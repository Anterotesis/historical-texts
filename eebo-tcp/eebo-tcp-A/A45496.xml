            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT's our Blessed Saviour's Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium
of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, that he
was a burning and shining light,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 35. in respect of purity
of life, and perspicuity of Doctrine,
which eminently appeared in him:
herein is he a Minister's pattern, in
whom both these are requisite: for
light without life would make him lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better then an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> apt to
mislead; or like a Candle in the socket,
not so pleasing by it's blaze, as offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
for it's ill savour; And life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
light will render him of little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
if not prejudicial; both in
conjunction make an happy mixture,
and qualifie the person in whom they
are for that weighty function. Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is his proper work, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13.
Which, with pains about his heart, and
<pb facs="tcp:42070:4"/>
watchfulness over his flock, may well
take up his whole time; there will be
little overplus for the unworthy world
or worse imployments. One of the
great wants he will have cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of, will be of time, as too short
for the dispatch of the grand affair
personal and functional incumbent
upon him: and indeed he that hath
tasted the sweetness, or duly weigh'd
the importance of those two, I much
marvel how he should be taken off
from, or neglective of either, for things
comparatively so mean, and mostly
pernicious.</p>
            <p>That which best deserves our pains
in study is,</p>
            <p>1. In the first place the sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
discovering to us things most
necessary and useful; without the
knowledg whereof, all our other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments
will prove but insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
things, serving only for vain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation,
as no way furthering our
own, or others chiefest good. These
therefore call for our diligent and daily
perusal; which we should labor to
make familiar; so that they may as
a choice treasure dwell richly in us in
all wisdom, that we may be as Scribes
instructed unto the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb facs="tcp:42070:4"/>
able upon all occasions to speak a
word in season unto any that shall have
recourse unto us either for counsel and
direction in their doubts or for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and consolation in their distresses.
To which we should never forget to
joyn fervent prayer for the obtaining
of the Spirit, the only guide to the
right understanding of these deep
things of God, without which they
will remain as riddles and a sealed
book unto us; of the great advantage
hereof to study, <hi>Luther</hi> (who each day
spent three hours in this duty) out of
his experience, thus speaks, <hi>benè oravisse
est penè studuisse,</hi> and again, <hi>haec tria fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt
Theologum, precatio, meditatio,
tentatio; Melch. Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Unto these, the writings of such
as in the Christian Church are most
Ancient, challenge the next place; who
have obtained (as accounted worthy
of it) the Venerable title of Fathers;
as nearest successors unto the Apostoles,
And therefore for some Centuries to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
wont to be stiled <hi>Apostolici,</hi>
even as many as precedeed the first
Council of <hi>Nice. Parker de dsc. Christ.
l. 4. §</hi> 10. These well deserve our serious
inspection, acquainting us not only
with the meaning of the Scripture, but
<pb facs="tcp:42070:5"/>
the Doctrine also and discipline agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thereto, preserved in, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Church; who were ever
held in great esteem, and approved of
by the Orthodox in the following A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

            <p>To reflect upon foregoing Ages, in a
Landskip of them is a thing both plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<pb facs="tcp:42070:5"/>
and profitable; for thus we seem
to live in more ages then one, and in joy
the benefit of that experience which
the narrow limits of our own cannot
afford. This may we be, in a sort said
to do, in the view of those Ancient
Worthies who are the subject of the
ensuing discourse; men living nearest
the Apostles times, and most perfectly
resembling them in their excellencies;
the due contemplation whereof is like
to produce the most notable effects in
such as are seriously this way exercised.
For what can be of more force to fit us
for, and quicken us to our duty, then
frequently to cast our eyes upon the
pourtraitures of such men, in whom is
represented what is most worthy our
imitation; seeing that to learn by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
is not only the most facil, but
effectual way; this being, as the surest,
so the most affecting sense, and what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
hereby, having the strongest influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Who can look upon that burning
Light <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whose heart did so
flame, and life spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kle with love to
Christ and his Church; and not find
himself at least warmed with the like
holy affection? Who take into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
the indefatigable industry of
<hi>Origen,</hi> and not be thereby excited to
<pb facs="tcp:42070:6"/>
mend his pace, and bewailing former
slackness to fall to his work with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diligence? Would we behold the
sweet fruit of uncessant study in the
vast and various knowledge attainable
thereby, making men shine as stars of
the first magnitude in their several
spheres and to communicate their
streams of light to after generations;
and would be awakened to the like
course in order to the like, or at least
considerable attainments? Let us fix
our eye upon those magazines of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Clement,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian.</hi> How emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
doth the beauty of Christian
zeal and courage in maintaining the
truth and opposing Heresie appear in
those Heroick Champions <hi>Iustine, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Hilary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Athanasius?</hi> Bulwarks
for the defence &amp; security of the one,
against all the fierce assaults, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
underminings of its adversaries;
and mauls and engines for the batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and beating down of the other. In
the last of whom, together with it, was
most conspicuous the grace of invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
patience, making him Adamant-like
unyieldable unto the most violent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of restless persecutors. In divers
of them may be seen in it's lustre that
more then conquering grace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb facs="tcp:42070:6"/>
Constancy, not loving their lives
unto the death in the quarrel and for
the Honor of their Lord and Master,
obtaining hereby the glorious Crown
of Martyrdom, set upon their heads by
that Captain of our Salvation; Briefly,
what a goodly Map (as it were) of the
choicest Christian Vertues have we
meeting together, and shining forth in
holy <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as so many stars in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation;
Piety and Prudence, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Humility, Compassion and
Charity, Patience and Constancy in
suffering often, and the utmost for the
sake of Christ? Of what singular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
must it needs be to us, to have
the endowments we should strive after,
that may accomplish us for our station,
in such lively Colours represented and
the things we should practice so fairly
exemplified &amp; set before our eyes, as in
these eminent men we find them to be?</p>
            <p>And for their writings they are a
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a precious treasure, from
whence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being duly improved, we may
be furnished with such things as may be
of no small advantage to our selves,
and make us no less useful unto others.
For therein shall we meet with not a
few apt interpretations and expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of many Texts of Scripture; such
<pb facs="tcp:42070:7"/>
as will afford us more then ordinary
light for the right understanding of
them: divers grave and pithy passages
which may well serve upon several oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
both for illustration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of any suitable subject; Also,
nervous &amp; weighty Arguments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they have so pressed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
the adversary, that the nakedness
of error hath been discover'd to the
confusion of it's fautors that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to maintain it; and the
beauty and strength of Truth to the
great exultation and establishment of
all that love it. Lastly, the best account
of the face and state of the Church of
Christ, both as to the sound Doctrine
professed, and wholsom Discipline ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in them; wherewith it may well
be presumed they were better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
then most others, and could
give us the fullest and truest informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
it having been their special work
to publish and defend the one, and they
having had the chiefest hand in the
management of the other; To all
which add the necessity of a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
insight into these Ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
that we may become no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Antagonists to grapple with,

<pb facs="tcp:42070:7"/>
the mouth of those of the Romish Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,
who, having shamefully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Doctrines of Christianity,
and shunning the trial and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Scripture, betake themselves
for shelter unto the monuments of these
Worthies, audaciously pretending that
they are theirs, and with greatest,
though groundless confidence of their
patronage.</p>
            <p>The improvement of the Ancients
in these regards is the design and scope
of the following treatise, presenting the
Reader with a Scheme both of their
lives and labors, as may beget in the
mind a fair <hi>Idea</hi> of both, and so prove a
good step toward the attainment of the
ends proposed; For herein a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
is given of each of the Fathers
discoursed of in this Decade;</p>
            <p>1. Of their lives and special imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the places of their abode; and
the Dignities and Offices they were
advanc'd unto; Together with their
diligence and continuance in them;
and various accidents betiding them.
2. Of their excellencies and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments
whether natural or acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by their industry, with their Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
in this regard; which shew in
what singular esteem they were held
<pb facs="tcp:42070:8"/>
(as they well deserved) by the most
pious and judicious in succeding ages.
3. The admirable products of their
parts and pains, which they either left
behind them, or intended so to do for
the benefit of posterity; whereof,
1. Some are lost through the injury of
time, little remaining of them besides
their names and titles; which yet here
you find recorded, as far as by diligent
search and inquiry after them, they
could be found. 2. Some have been
happily preserved, and are extant at
this day; and because in the Edition
of the works of these Worthies the
Brats of others (which they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
father upon them) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed
among their true and proper
births, and of some 'tis doubtful whose
they are; (and hereof the Romish
Champions make no small use and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
for the upholding of their
tottering and desperate cause) you
have here as full a Catalogue as could
be gotten of whatever bears their
names, with a hint of what kind they
are, whether genuine, spurious, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious;
to the end the Reader may
know (as much as may be) whom he
hath to do withal, and so his abuse
herein may be prevented; And of the
<pb facs="tcp:42070:8"/>
genuine, the augument and sum of
each is briefly set down, together with
the time and occasion of their writing,
which may give some light to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of them, help the Reader
in his choice, and provoke to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and attention. 4. The Stile
they used, which in some of them is
such as that a perspicacious and critical
observer may be able thereby to make
a judgment, whether the piece he is
perusing be indeed the Authors whose
name it bears, or no; which in some of
them is so elegant, and adorned with
the flowers of Rhetorick that it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the Reader with singular content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and delight; and in whom it is
otherwise, an intimation hereof is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
together with what may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
to be the reason hereof. 5. A
tast of the choice and useful passages,
wherewith they do abound, which
may serve for an invitation to the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to bestow their time and pains
upon them as being well assured they
will be neither lost nor ill laid out, in
case that care and judgment be not
wanting; 6. And because they were
(though more then ordinary) yet but
men, and so subject to slips and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
these are, <hi>salvo honore,</hi> taken
<pb facs="tcp:42070:9"/>
notice of, with the causes of, at least,
divers of them, that as rocks and
shelves they may be avoided; and the
unwary student, together with what
is Orthodox, take not in that which is
unsound and noxious. 7. All is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the close of all, their deaths,
whether natural or violent, by whom,
for what, and when and where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
            <p>All which he that would throughly
inform himself of (as in some measure
from this Treatise he may do) shall
find it, I doubt not, a notable clew
to wind and extricate him out of those
Labyrinths and Difficulties, which
otherwise he may haply be involved
in; and make his way and work by
far more facil and pleasant; which
that it may be the issue of this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
is heartily desired by him
who is,</p>

These Epistles do amount (as now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant)
unto the number of fifteen, and may
be divided or ranked in three sorts. 1. Such

               <p>These are six in number, though common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <note place="margin">Hist. 3. cap. 32. in cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. Script. Ignat. Epist. cap. 2.</note> But
that skillful Antiquary the Reverend <hi>Vsher</hi>
conceives, that the Epistle to <hi>Polycarp</hi> (which
is reckoned among, and makes up the seven)
is none of his; <hi>Ignatius</hi> writing no peculiar
Epistle unto him, but that unto the Church
of <hi>Smyrna</hi> only, directed both unto them, and
also unto him joyntly, as their Bishop or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour:
And this (saith that learned Author)
I do not at all doubt to have been in the mind
of <hi>Ierom;</hi> whose words, (<hi>Et propriè ad</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarpum
<hi>commendans illi Antiochensem Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siam</hi>)
are to be read as in a Parenthesis,<note place="margin">In catalog.</note> not
as denoting a distinct Epistle from that to
those of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> but as relating to the same.
For (as the quick eyed <hi>Casanbon</hi> observes)
those words of <hi>Ignatius</hi> mentioned by <hi>Ierom</hi>
immediately after,<note place="margin">Exercitat. 16. cap. 426.</note> (<hi>in quâ arte</hi>) are not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the Epistle to <hi>Polycarp,</hi> (as <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
imagined) but out of that unto the Church
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42070:13"/>
of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where only to this day they are to
be read,<note place="margin">Hist. lib. 3. cap. 33.</note> and not in the other. And <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
produceth the same words out of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to the <hi>Smyrncans:</hi> Thus, <hi>Hic</hi> Ignatius
<hi>cum Smyrnaeis scriberet, &amp;c.</hi> Hence <hi>Honorius
Augustodunensis,</hi> in his Book <hi>de luminaribus

enumerating the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
omits that unto <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Which yet the Centurists leave to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the diligent Reader,<note place="margin">Cent. 2. cap. 10.</note> how un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>likely
it is that they who conducted him
should go so much out of the direct way and
Road leading to <hi>Rome,</hi> and fetch so great a
compass about in their journey.</p>
               <p>Though these (and these only) are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be genuine, yet have they not escaped
the hands of those who have offered no small
injury unto them; having most unworthily
corrupted these ancient Reliques, partly by
addition and interpolation of what never fell
from the pen of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and partly by dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
and substraction of that which they
saw would prove of disadvantage and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
unto them. These Epistles (saith
<hi>Chemnitius</hi>) have in them many sentences
not to be contemned,<note place="margin">Examen pat. 1. pag. 198.</note> especially as they are
read in the Greek, but withal there are ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
other things, not a few, which verily
have not in them Apostolical Gravity: It's
most certain therefore (saith <hi>Cook</hi>) that his
Epistles are either supposititious,<note place="margin">In censur.</note> or at least fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
corrupted;<note place="margin">Crit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

they are of little or no credit, but only in those
things wherein they do agree with the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Apostles, from whose Doctrine
that <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not recede, both his Piety
and Learning do perswade us. So that even
those six Genuine Epistles, through the foul
abuse that hath been offered unto them, have
clearly lost much of that authority which they
they had of old.</p>
               <p>For the discovery of this fraud, take a few
instances:<note place="margin">

the first author thereof, who lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the year 370, a long time after <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
And as this is foysted in, so are those
words left out, which are cited by <hi>Theodoret,</hi>
in <hi>Dialog.</hi> 3. being taken by him out of the
Epistle to the <hi>Smyrneans:</hi>

denyed the truth of Christ's flesh) <hi>admit not

<hi>Igitur</hi> Corpus Christi non est phantasma.</q>
               <p>I wonder therefore (saith <hi>Scultetus</hi>) what
judgment they have, who bring this place of
<hi>Ignatius</hi> to establish trans and consubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Pelagi.</note>
That passage also mentioned by <hi>Ierom,
(Ignatius</hi> that Apostolical man boldly writes,
that the Lord chose Apostles who were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
above all men) is not now to be found,
which yet <hi>Ierom</hi> had out of one of the seven,<note place="margin">Rivet. crit. sac.</note>
(if not rather six) Epistles contained in his
catalogue, for he speaks of (and therefore 'tis
probable he had seen) no more.</p>
               <p>The second sort of Epistles are such as are
dubious, and concerning which it is very que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
whether they be his or no: of these
there be also six in number,<note place="margin">Ignat. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. cap. 6. &amp; 18.</note> being the second
collection, made (as the reverend <hi>Vsher</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures)

by one <hi>Stephanus Gobarus Tritheita</hi>
about the year 580: by <hi>Anastasius Patriarch</hi>
of <hi>Antioch,</hi> about the year 595: and by the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher
of the Constantinopolitan Chronicle, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the year 630.<note place="margin">Idem ibid. cap. 6.</note> So that in the sixth Century
after Christ, they grew up to the number of 12,
coming out of the same Shop that vented the
Canons of the Apostles, augmented by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of 35 to the former; as also the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Constitutions variously trimmed and
altered. So that these are of a much later
date than the former, the only Genuine Birth
of this famous Martyr.</p>

                  <hi>The true and unfeigned
Epistles of</hi> Ignatius: supposing that none can
rationally doubt thereof, who will compare
them together; seeing that in the judgment
of all the Learned, their agreement in stile,
character and many other notes of words, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
and things doth plainly speak out and
evidence so much; Than which (saith he) a
better proof cannot be brought or desired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so that there is no ground for the least suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of imposture. But these big words of his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42070:15"/>
upon examination will appear to be of little
or no force,<note place="margin">Ignat. Epist.</note> as the Reverend <hi>Vsher</hi> shews:
for as touching the likeness of stile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these Epistles, it is not such or so great,
but he that would counterfeit <hi>Ignatius,</hi> might
easily imitate him so far. The Forger observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some forms of speech and composition,
frequently occurring and familiar to him,
which he conceived was for his purpose care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to retain. He considered that <hi>Ignatius</hi>
delighted in compounding words with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
in the end, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the beginning: for
as he himself was surnamed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; so are
the Ephesians praised by him as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
which words and the
like he useth also in other of his Epistles.
Hence the same words are taken up by the
framer of these Epistles. So likewise in the
true <hi>Ignatius</hi> we meet with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
&amp;c.
wherein he is imitated by his counterfeit, as
also in divers other expressions and sentences,
which the Impostor might do without any
great difficulty: so that it ought not to seem
strange, if there be in some sort an uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of stiles found in them.</p>
               <p>Besides, the deceit may be discerned by
some passages contained in these, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be imagined ever to have fallen from the
pen of <hi>Ignatius, e. g.</hi> This is reckoned among
the Heresies sown by the Ministers of Satan,<note place="margin">Coci censur. Epist. ad Tarsens.</note>
that Christ is he who is God over all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,<note place="margin">Epist. ad Philip.</note>
if any one shall fast on the Lord's day,
or Sabbath (one only excepted) he is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer

the Pascha with the Jews, or receive the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42070:16"/>
of the Festivity, he is partaker with those
who slew the Lord and his Apostles: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he condemns the Romans, who used to
fast on the Sabbath: and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> whom he
calls most blessed, together with the Asian or
Eastern Churches, who kept the Pascha or
Easter after the manner of the Jews. <hi>viz.</hi> as
to the day whereon they observed it: which
plainly shew the Author of these Epistles to
have been some latter, obscure and absurd fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,<note place="margin">Epist. ad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</note>
altogether unlike <hi>Ignatius.</hi> Moreover,
in these Epistles there is some mention of
some stiled <hi>Laborantes,</hi> who are ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the orders of the Clergy: And <hi>Diaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epist. ad Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp.</note>

of which Functions or Offices Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical,
there is a deep silence among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients;
which, how could it have been, had
<hi>Ignatius</hi> written so plainly of them? Lastly,
writing to <hi>Polycarp,</hi> he thus speaks, Attend
unto your Bishop, that God may to you:
what had he forgot, that he wrote to a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop?
Almost throughout this whole Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
I find,<note place="margin">In medull. in notis in Epist.</note> saith <hi>Scultetus,</hi> the genuine <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>

the Genuine to be seven, because that to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42070:16"/>
is reckoned as distinct from that unto
the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> both by <hi>Eusebius</hi> and
<hi>Ierom</hi>) It's apparent (saith he) that five of
these are without doubt adulterate and spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
Again, it's certain these are suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and foisted in by others. And therefore
though <hi>Baronius</hi> do affirm, that four of these
should be added by the <hi>Philippians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad an. 109. § 19.</note> unto the
former, collected by <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and sent unto
them; and that they were afterward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
known both to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi>
(which yet neither <hi>Eusebius</hi> among the
Greeks, nor <hi>Ierom</hi> among the Latines (both

with the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Chronicler, one of
those formerly mentioned, who collected the
second rank of Epistles, between which two
collections there could therefore be no great
distance of time. Thus now at last they are
grown up to the number of fifteen: the three
last added are,</p>
               <p>1. One unto the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> together
with her answer.</p>
               <p>2. Two unto the Apostle <hi>Iohn.</hi>

found among the Greek Copies of his Epistles,<note place="margin">Ad an. 109. § 34.</note>
nor do they at all savour of the Gravity of
<hi>Ignatius</hi> his stile. And <hi>Baronius</hi> leaves it to
the prudence of the pious Reader, whether
he will allow them any credit or no: Only
(saith he) we know that they are cited by
<hi>Bernard,</hi>

                  </gap> Authors make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them: But (saith <hi>Possevine</hi>) they
are of no such certain credit as the other; yea,
seeing they are not found written in Greek,
nor mentioned by any of the ancient Fathers,
<hi>ad Bernardum usque,</hi> unto the obscure age of
<hi>Bernard:</hi> It's the safer course in my judgment
(saith <hi>Mastraeus</hi>) to rank them among the
number of Apocryphal Writings,<note place="margin">Coci censur.</note> or at least to
account them not altogether certain and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine.
So faintly and dubiously do even the
Romanists themselves speak of the authority
of these three last Epistles.</p>
               <p>Hence may we observe with what caution
the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> even the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and undoubted (since so corrupted)
are to be made use of; and upon how weak
and sandy a foundation (<hi>viz.</hi> the pretended

unsound Doctrines,<note place="margin">Praefat. ad Epist. Ignat. in Biblioth. patrum. edit. Paris. 1586. per Magarinum la Bigne.</note> of superstitious honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

these delusions, who not contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42070:17"/>
with the Sacred Oracles alone, and the
Doctrines contained in them, (which are

               <p>Frivolous therefore and vain is the flourish
of <hi>Baronius;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad an. 109. § 20.</note> that it came to pass by the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Counsel and providence of God, that
these Epistles should all of them be written
by <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and notwithstanding the ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
which so many writings have suffer'd,
yet that these should be preserved intire and
uncorrupt: whereas 'tis very evident that the
greater part of them now extant are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
and not his, and the genuine misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
corrupted and alter'd. So that it may
upon better ground be said, that herein the
good providence of God hath been eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seen, that he hath been pleased to stir up
and assist some of his servants in vindicating
the writings of this, and other of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
from the injury that hath been offered
them by base and disingenuous spirits, who
have preferr'd their own interest before the
honour and truth of God; and in plucking
off the vizar, and discovering the fraud and
Leger-demain of those that would abuse and
cheat the world, by the obtrusion of Novelty
instead of Antiquity thereupon.</p>
               <p>§ 4. His stile savours of a certain holy
simplicity,<note place="margin">Scultet in Medull. Vedelius. ex Usher. Igna. Epist.</note> as did the State of the Church at
that time, full of gravity, suitable unto a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42070:18"/>
Bishop; lively, fiery and solid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
so glorious a Martyr.</p>
               <p>§ 5. That which is chiefly remarkable in
these Epistles, are those passages which are
mentiond by <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Ierom,</hi> as being
most unquestionably such as fell from the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this blessed Martyr: wherein are in a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manner drawn and deciphered the purtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his most excellent spirit, his singular
and vigorous love to the Lord Jesus, (whose
name is said to have been ingraven upon his
heart in letters of gold) as also his undaunted
courage and Magnanimity in his cause accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with unconquerable constancy and
sweet humility.</p>
               <p>1. His earnest desire of Martyrdom, he
thus expresseth:<note place="margin">Jerom. in Catalog. ex Epist. ad Roman Ex editione Usheri.</note> From <hi>Syria</hi> even unto <hi>Rome</hi>

               <p>2. When he was now condemned to the
wild beasts,<note place="margin">Ieron. ib. ex Epist. eade<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

heard the Lions roaring; saith he, I
am the wheat of God, whom the teeth of
wild beasts shall grind, that I may be found
the pure or fine bread of God. Immediately
before which, go these words. I write to all
the Churches, and injoyn them all; because I
willingly die for God, if ye hinder not: I
beseech you therefore that your love toward
me be not unseasonable. Suffer me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the meat of wild beasts, by whom I may
obtain God.</p>
               <p>3. His care of the Churches was very
great, whom he earnestly presseth to holiness
and a conversation becoming the Gospel: And
commendeth unto <hi>Polycarp,</hi>

of a Bishop or Pastor in his room: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting
herein his zeal for God and his glory,
as also his cordial affection and fidelity to the
brethren.</p>
               <p>Besides these, there are in the Epistles other
things worthy of notice, though not so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
his, as the above-mention'd; They
are such as these.</p>
               <p>4. His Creed or brief sum of Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Epist. ad Magnesian. <gap reason="foreign">

wherein he accords with the Apostles
Creed. His words are, Beloved, I would
have you to be fully instructed in (the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42070:19"/>
of) Christ who before all ages was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of the Father, afterward made of the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> without the company of man;
and conversing holily, and without blame,
he healed all manner of infirmities and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
among the people, and did signs and
wonders for the benefit of men, and revealed
his Father, one and the only true God; and
did undergo his passion, and by his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
the Jews, suffered on the Cross under
<hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> President, and <hi>Herod</hi> the King,
and was dead, and rose again, and ascended
into heaven unto him that sent him, and
fitteth at his right hand, and shall come
in the end of the world in his Fathers
Glory to judge the quick and the dead,
and to render unto every one according to his
works. He that shall fully know and believe
these things is blessed.</p>
               <p>5. Though he were one of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
men of his time both for Piety and
Learning, yet out of the depth of his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
he thus speaks of himself, when bound
for Christ and his truth and lead toward his
Martyrdom;<note place="margin">In epist. ad Ephes.</note> stiling his chains <gap reason="foreign">

Again,<note place="margin">In Epist. ad Magnesian.</note> speaking of the Pastours of the

               <p>9. The spirit of errour preacheth Self,<note place="margin">Epist. ad Ephes.</note>
speaking it's own proper things, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for it is self-pleasing, and glorifies
it self: it is bitter, full of falshood, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing,
slippery, proud, arrogant, talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
dissonant, immensurate, pertinacious,
streperous.</p>
               <p>10. He warneth the <hi>Ephesians</hi> to avoid
and beware of Hereticks,<note place="margin">Epist. ad Ephes.</note> of whom many
were sprung up in his time; and for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he commendeth that Church as most
pure, renowned, and to be praised of all

who wandred up and down to spread their
errours, and shut their ears against them.
These Hereticks in his Epistle to the <hi>Trallensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
he particularly names, <hi>viz.</hi> Those who
held the Heresie of <hi>Simon,</hi> as did <hi>Menander</hi>

                  </gap>, such as set Christ to
sale, and made a gain of him, fraudulently
pretending the name of Christ, and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the word of the Gospel; mingling the
venom of their errour with sugred words,
as those that infuse poison into sweet wine,
that by the delicious savour and relish there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he that drinks it being deceived and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
may unawares be destroyed.</p>
               <p>11. To the <hi>Romans</hi> he thus writes:<note place="margin">Epist. ad Roman.</note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
this only for me, that I may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with strength, both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
not only to say but to will, not only to be
called, but also to be found a Christian. A
Christian when he is hated of the world, is
beloved of God. It is better to die for
Christ, then reign to the ends of the earth.
Life without Christ is death. My love was
Crucified.</p>

he replyed, That he was altogether unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with those Sciences. Hereupon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
that it would be but lost labour,
to endeavour after the knowledge of those
things that conduce unto true happiness, till
he had gotten somewhat that way; he was
much grieved that he should fail and be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
of his hopes. Therefore bidding
him farewel, he betakes him unto the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,
under one of whom he profited very
much, and was greatly delighted in those Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
deeming that in a short time he should
this way attain unto the knowledge of God.
Being much taken up, and eager in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of what he sought for, he gets him into a
desart from the society of men, where he was
followed by (as he thought) a grave old
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42070:22"/>
man, who (when <hi>Iustin</hi> turning about had
espyed him) asked him, if he knew him: he
answered no. After much discourse with him,
he told him it was a vain thing for him to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine,
that he should find the knowledge of
the truth among the Philosophers, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
knew not God, nor were assisted by the
Holy Ghost, and having for some time had
communication together about the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Soul, about rewards and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<hi>Iustin</hi> assented unto what he had said,
and demanded of him by what means he
might arrive unto the true knowledge of God.
He willed him to read and search the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and to joyn prayer thereunto: Asking
him again what Master he should make use of?
Above all (quoth the old man) do thou
pray that the door of light or illumination
may be opened unto thee: for those things
(which are contained in the Prophets) cannot
be apprehended by any, but by him alone to
whom God and his Christ will give under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
And having so said, he suddenly
vanished, neither did <hi>Iustin</hi> from that time
see him any more. Hereupon forsaking the
Philosophers whom formerly he had followed,
he forthwith fell upon this course, and so
became a Christian.</p>
               <p>As touching the former of these Relations, it
is nothing improbable, that the admirable and
extraordinary constancy of Christians in their
greatest Sufferings for Christ might be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
unto him to enquire after the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Religion which they professed, the
truth whereof they could so willingly and
chearfully seal with their blood: a notable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42070:22"/>
demonstration of the excellency and divine
original thereof, and so might it make way to
his conversion. Many instances might be
given of the strange effects that such Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
have produced in the hearts of those that
have been the Spectators: <hi>Trajan</hi> himself (who
moved the persecution against the Christians)
hearing good <hi>Ignatius</hi> (at that time when
the Lions were ready to be let loose upon
him) to utter those words,<note place="margin">Antonin. Chronic.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the wheat
of Christ, whom the teeth of wild Beasts must
grind, to make me pure Bread for God:</hi> With
admiration breaks out into these words,
<hi>Grandis est tolerantia Christianorum, Great is
the patience of the Christians: Who of the
Greeks would suffer so much for his God?</hi> To
whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> meekly replyed; <hi>Not by mine
own, but by the strength of Christ do I undergo
all this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as for the latter, whether he had such
an apparition or no, and directions given him
by his old man, what course he should take
that he might come to the knowledge of the
truth; <hi>Penes lectorem esto,</hi> I leave unto the
prudent Reader to judge; yet was not <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin's
tolle, lege,</hi> altogether unlike it; neither
are Histories wholly barren and silent in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the like kind. The gravity and piety
of the Author may justly challenge from us a
suspension at least of our censure, and stir us
up to take notice of the variety of ways that
God hath (who can, if in his infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
he see it meet) go out of the way of
his ordinary providence to bring his great
counsels to pass, and the things he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to his chosen from eternity,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:42070:23"/>
After that he had once given up his name
to Christ,<note place="margin">Cent. 2. cap. 10.</note> he became a most notable Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
and Defender of the Christian Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Enemies thereof in every kind, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
the Heathen Philosophers, the bitter
opposers of it, with whom he maintained
with a great spirit many sharp conflicts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes
for the vindication of it from their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies:
for which work he was singularly
furnished and instructed,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 4. cap. 8.</note> being well studyed
and exercised in the Doctrine of the Gentiles,
and eminently skilled in Philosophy, as the
very addition to his name more than inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
being commonly stiled <hi>Iustin</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher.
Moreover, he was very ready and
expert in the Scriptures, as may be eminently
seen in his Colloquies with <hi>Triphon</hi> the Jew,
whom (as another <hi>Apollos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 18. 24.</note> and eloquent man
and mighty in the Scriptures) he mightily
convinced that Jesus was the Christ, and had
undoubtedly won him to embrace the Faith,
had he not rather chosen to imitate the inbred
obstinacy of his Nation, than yield to manifest
and invincible truth: as saith the publisher
and perfecter of that Latine Translation
and Edition which <hi>Gelenius</hi> had began and
enterprised,<note place="margin">In Epist. ad Lect. ante opera justin.</note> but could not finish, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by death.</p>
               <p>§ 2. He was an holy man,<note place="margin">Epiphan. Haeres. 46.</note> and a Friend of
God, leading a life very much exercised in
virtue;<note place="margin">Trithem. de Script.</note> an eminent lover and worshipper of
Christ, which he abundantly manifested in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the first that in those times of hot
persecution (wherein the very name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
was accounted a crime sufficient for them
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42070:23"/>
to be proceeded against with utmost rigour)
took unto him the boldness to be the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
Advocate, (a Title peculiarly given to
one <hi>Vetius Epagathus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 5. cap. 1.</note> who being moved with
indignation at the unjust proceedings used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Christians, desired that he might be
heard in their behalf, undertaking to prove
that no impiety was to be found in them;
for which cause, he was afterward stiled

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Advocate of the
Christians) publickly to plead their cause, to
clear their innocence, and to vindicate them
from the groundless calumnies wherewith
they were aspersed by their Adversaries, in
his Learned Apologies;<note place="margin">Hieronym. Epist. 84.</note> which he tendred
unto the Emperours and Senate of <hi>Rome:</hi>
As did also about the same time, <hi>Aristides</hi> and
<hi>Quadratus,</hi> who all three presented their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologies
unto the Emperour <hi>Adrian;</hi> the like
did <hi>Athenagoras</hi> unto <hi>Aurelius Antoninus</hi> and
<hi>Commodus</hi> the next succeeding Emperours.
Wherein (having with singular zeal broken
the Ice) they were afterward followed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:
amongst the rest, <hi>Apollinaris</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 4. ca. 13. &amp; 25. &amp; lib. 5. cap. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Apollonius</hi> a Noble-man and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator
of <hi>Rome, Melito</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sardis, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>He was one that had attained the height
and top of Philosophy,<note place="margin">Photius in Biblioth. num. 125.</note> both Christian and
prophane, abounding in the riches of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and History; but little studious to set
out the native beauty of his Philosophy
with the borrowed colours of the Art of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory:
and therefore, though his Books be
otherwise full of strength and stuffed with
knowledge; yet have they but little relish
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42070:24"/>
or savour of the sauce of Art, nor do they
with winning inticements, and cunning insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations
allure vulgar Auditors: So much he
himself freely confesseth; I shall (saith he)
deal with you out of the Scriptures,<note place="margin">In Colloq. cum Tryph.</note> not shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much Art in the choice and quaintness of
words; for I am not endewed with such a
faculty; only God hath given me grace to
understand the Scriptures. So that there is
to be found in him more solidity and strength
of argument, than of the flowers and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
of Rhetorick. And yet is not this

the judgement of the Author of the Parisian
Edition:<note place="margin">Epist. ad lect.</note> For that he was an Oratour (saith

<hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Ierom,</hi> and therefore likely to
be the first of the two. The sum whereof
<hi>Baronius</hi> gives us in these words: <hi>Multa ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrat
de iniquissimis in Christianos judiciis,</hi> &amp;c,
<hi>i. e.</hi> He much upbraids them for their most
unjust proceedings against the Christians,<note place="margin">Baron. ad an. 150. § 2.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
for that without any inquiry into cause or
matter, they were adjudged to death as the
most impious and flagitious of all Men; and
that for no other reason, but because they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42070:26"/>
were Christians; the very name being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
crime enough. Wherefore he doth
notably clear them from the several calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
cast upon them, and fully demonstrates
their innocency by many arguments: parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that they were not such as they were
commonly fam'd to be, <hi>viz.</hi> Atheists, because
though they worshipped not the gods of the
heathen, yet they knew the true God, and
performed that service that was agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: Also that they looked not for an
earthly kingdom (as was suspected of them,
for which cause the Romans stood in fear of a
Rebellion and their defection from them)
but a Divine and Heavenly, that made them
most willing to run the hazard, and suffer
the loss of this present life; which they
never could do, were they possessed with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
desires of reigning in the World. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
he wipes off those blasphemies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Christians were loaded, for their
worshipping of a crucified Man, by such as
were altogether ignorant of the mystery of
the Cross of Christ. Shewing, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of such as worshipped the gods was
but a vain and sordid superstition. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Learnedly and copiously discourseth of
the Divinity of Christ, and of his incarnation
or assuming our Nature: and unfolds many
things of the mystery of the Cross: and by
many clear and convincing arguments proves
the verity of the Christian Faith: withal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuating
their harmless Life, exact obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of chastity, patience, obedience, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness,
gentleness, and love, even to their
very enemies. Lastly, he lays before them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42070:26"/>
the Rites or manner observed by the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in their sacred Mysteries, <hi>viz. Baptism,</hi>
and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper,</hi> &amp;c. because of the
slanders that were raised and scattered abroad
concerning them, as if horrible and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
things were practiced by them (such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as are not to be once named among
them) in their secret meetings upon such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.
All which he performed with such
admirable liberty and boldness, as became so
zealous and Advocate in so good a cause:
wherein the magnanimity of his Spirit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with an holy indignation, may evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be discern'd by the seriousness of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contained in it, and the solidity of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments

should come.</p>
               <p>6. An Epistle to <hi>Zena</hi> and <hi>Serenus;</hi> which
comprehends the whole life of a Christian
man, whom he instructs in all the duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to him: of which yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:42070:27"/>
makes some doubt whether it be his or
no.<note place="margin">De Script. Eccles.</note>
               </p>
               <p>7. An Epistle unto <hi>Diognetus;</hi> wherein he
shews why the Christians have left the Jews
and Greeks;<note place="margin">Scultet. in Medul.</note> what their life and doctrine is, and
why they contemn death. As not the two
first, so neither are these two last mentioned
by <hi>Eusebius</hi> or <hi>Ierom:</hi> yet are all these seven
conceived to be the proper works of <hi>Iustine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides these there are other extant under
his name, which yet are either question'd, or
conceived to be none of his; but supposititious,
&amp; falsly ascribed to him: They may be discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from those that are genuine, either by the
diversity of the Stile, or some other evident
Notes distinguished the one from the other.
And they are these that follow.</p>
               <p>1. His Book <hi>de Monarchia:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Scultet. in Medul. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet. crit. sac.</note> the Stile
whereof is not unlike that of <hi>Iustine:</hi> yet is
it doubtful, whether he were the Author of
it: 1. Because the Title differs from that
mentioned by <hi>Eusebius, Ierom, Photius</hi> and
<hi>Suidas,</hi> who intitle the Book written by him,
<hi>de Monarchia Dei:</hi> whereas this is only <hi>de
Monarchia.</hi> 2. In that he tells, that he
fetcheth Testimonies not only from our own
Authors, <hi>i. e.</hi> the sacred Scriptures; but also
Writings of the Heathens: whereas in this
now extant, the later sort of Testimonies only
are to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gelenius</hi> also in his Latin Edition of the
Works of <hi>Iustin,</hi> (which he saith compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
all those then extant) leaves this out
altogether.<note place="margin">In observat. Ri et. crit. sat.</note> 
                  <hi>Perionius</hi> therefore concludes,
that either this, that we now have is not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42070:27"/>
perfect, but wants many pages; or else for
certain <hi>Iustin</hi> wrote another Book upon this
Subject.<note place="margin">Note in Hieronym. Catalog. in Bibloth. Eccles.</note> 
                  <hi>Miraeus</hi> is of this judgement, that half
of the other Book <hi>de Monarchia</hi> remains;
and that half of one Book <hi>de Monarchia Dei</hi>
is lost.</p>
               <p>The sum of it is to exhort the Greeks,<note place="margin">Scultet. in Medull.</note>
to leave their idolatry, and to worship the
true God; whom their Poets did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be the only Creator and Governour
of all things; but made no reckoning at all
of their feigned gods.</p>
               <p>2. An exposition of the true Faith, or of
a right Confession of the holy and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essential
Trinity. Which by divers Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may evidently be proved to be none
of his; especially.</p>
               <p>1. By the Stile,<note place="margin">Cent. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. cap. 10. Scultet. in Medul.</note> which seems to differ from
that of <hi>Iustin,</hi> being more curt and neat than
his.</p>
               <p>2. Because he speaks much more apertly
and distinctly of the Mysteries of the Trinity,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Scrip.</note>
and Incarnation, than the Writers of that age
are wont to do.</p>
               <p>3. None of the Ancients make mention
of it.</p>
               <p>4. The words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
were not then so usual in the Church: nor
are they any where to be found in the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of <hi>Iustin,</hi> when as yet he sometimes
professedly handles the Doctrine of the
Trinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself therefore is doubtful of
it:<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Ambigo,</hi> saith he, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n ejus sit:</hi> and well he
might,<note place="margin">Scultet. ibid.</note> there being so much cause. But
whoever were the Author of it, it is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42070:28"/>
and profitable discourse, and worthy of
such an Author as <hi>Iustin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herein he shews, that there is indeed but
one God, who is known in the Father, Son,
and holy Spirit; and that these three have
but one and the same Essence, as also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth
of the Incarnation of the Word;
who is Mediator according to both Natures,
the manner of the Union whereof in Christ
is ineffable.</p>
               <p>3. A confutation of certain Opinions of
<hi>Aristotle:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In apparat. ad an. 165. § 8.</note> which (saith <hi>Possevine) Iustin</hi> did
not write; neither will <hi>Baronius</hi> undertake to
determine whether it be his or no. <hi>Eusebins,
Ierom</hi> and <hi>Suidas</hi> mention it not; for which
cause it is justly rejected, as not written by
<hi>Iustin;</hi> though <hi>Photius</hi> speak of it as his,
and it have no evident note of falshood,<note place="margin">De Script. Eccles.</note> in
the judgement of <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> Therefore,
saith he, I have nothing to say one way or
other.</p>
               <p>4. Certain Questions propounded by the
Christians to the Gentiles, and their Answers
to them, together with a confutation of those
Answers. Which piece, as the Stile bewrays
it to be none of <hi>Iustins;</hi> so may it easily be
discerned also from the often mention of the
<hi>Manichees</hi> in the confutation of the answer
to the first question:<note place="margin">Bellar. ibid. &amp; Possevin. in apparat.</note> who arose above an
hundred years after <hi>Iustin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Certain questions propounded by the
Greeks or Gentiles, with the answers of the
Christians unto them.<note place="margin">Cent. 2. cap. 10.</note> Which are ranked with
the former by the Centurists.</p>
               <p>6. This answers to 146 questions,<note place="margin">In apparat. de Scrip.</note> unto the
Orthodoxes: it seem not to <hi>Iustins,</hi> saith
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42070:28"/>
                  <hi>Possevine;</hi> the same thinks <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> yea,
that this is certain,<note place="margin">Scultet. in Medull. &amp; Coci censur. &amp; Cent. 2. cap. 10.</note> many things contained in
them do plainly evince. As 1. Some words,
which were not in use in the Church, till a
long time after <hi>Iustin. e. g. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
&amp;c.</hi> 2. In them is cited <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> Quest.
115. whom he stiles a Martyr: yet did <hi>Iustin</hi>
die some fourty years before: <hi>viz. An.</hi> 165.
where <hi>Irenaeus</hi> suffered Martyrdom, <hi>an.</hi> 205.
according to the account of <hi>Baronius.</hi> Also
<hi>Origen</hi> is quoted, Quest. 82. &amp; 86. who yet
was long after <hi>Iustin.</hi> 3. Divers passages
are here to be found, which are cross to what
is contained in the genuine Writings of <hi>Iustin.
e. g.</hi> That the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> did but delude
the eye;<note place="margin">In Dialog. cum Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon.</note> that they seemed to see <hi>Samuel,</hi>
when 'twas not he. Quest. 52. whereas <hi>Iustin</hi>
asserteth that 'twas the true <hi>Samuel</hi> that was
raised. Also, Quest. 112. the Angel that
spake with <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and other of the
Patriarchs, is said to be a created Angel; and
that for his office committed to him, he was
honoured with the name of God. Whereas
<hi>Iustin</hi> earnestly contends and affirms, that that
Angel was Christ the Son of God.</p>
               <p>Add hereto, that the stile shews them to
be counterfeit;<note place="margin">Bibliotia. lib. 4.</note> which seems (saith <hi>Sixtus
Senensis</hi>) not unlike unto that of <hi>Theodoret</hi>
in his questions upon the <hi>Octoteuch:</hi> and it is
conceived that they were written by some one
who lived about that time. Besides all this,
there are among them so many questions and
answers,<note place="margin">Sylburg. in Annotat. Scultet. in Medull.</note> unworthy of the Piety, Candour and
Learning of <hi>Iustin,</hi> that if they be compared
with his true Writings, they will be found to
differ no less than Gold and Lead, the one
from the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:42070:29"/>
Upon how frail a foundation then are those
unsound Doctrines of the Papists built (for
the proof whereof these spurious Writings are
often alledged) <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dr. James <hi>corruption of the Futhers.</hi> Coci. censur.</note> the lawful use of the Cross,
the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> without sin, keeping and
worshipping of Reliques, religious Vows,
Baptism necessary unto Salvation, the use of
Chrism, Ceremonies of the Mass, Free-will
and that Confirmation is a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>§ 4. The stile that <hi>Iustin</hi> used, was vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and worthy of one that handled serious
matters:<note place="margin">Cent. 2. Cap. 10.</note> but it came nearer to that of the
Philosopher, than to that of the Orator;
which is the reason why he is sometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Many things of special Note, and
very observable are to be met withal in this
ancient Author: among the rest are such as
these.</p>
               <p>1. He acquaints us with the manner of the
Christians performance of the duties of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

thus: Upon the day which is called <hi>Sunday</hi>

the Prophets and Apostles:<note place="margin">

up Prayers; which concluded, there is
brought forth Bread, and Wine, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:

then the Pastor, according to his ability,
offers up Prayers and Thanksgivings,<note place="margin">

as they will: and what is gathered, is
deposited with the Pastor; who therewith
relieves Orphans, Widdows, and such as
through sickness, or any other necessity
are in want; as also such as are in bonds and
strangers; briefly he takes care of all that are
poor. And therefore do we meet upon
<hi>Sunday,</hi> because upon it God dispelling the
darkness, and informing the first matter,
created the World, and also because upon that
day Jesus Christ our Saviour rose again from
the dead.</p>
               <p>And a little before he thus speaks of the

we mutually salute one another with a kiss:

               <p>In this plain and simple manner were the
Ordinances according to Christs institution
then administred; without all those pompous
Observations, Ceremonies and superstitious
Additions, which in after times by degrees
were brought in, practised and prevailed to the
great dishonour of God, detriment of Souls,
disturbance of the Church, and despoiling of
the Ordinances themselves of much of their
beauty and lustre, which then shines forth
most, when they are preserved in their native
purity, and kept most free from all debasing
mixtures of mens devices and adventitious
supposed Ornament, which rather deform than
deck and adorn them.</p>

none that can terrifie or bring us into bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,

all the earth: For when we are slain with the
sword, crucified, and punished with bonds,

known that we forsake not our profession:
and the more we are tormented, the more is
the number of Believers, and such as embrace

I shall never dare to think or say that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures

Then are they brought by us unto the place

King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> erecting a Library at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
and understanding that the Jews had
ancient Books which they diligently kept,<note place="margin">Exhortat. ad Graecos. p. 13.</note> he
sent for seventy wise men from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
who were skill'd both in the Greek and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Tongues, and committed unto them the
care of translating those Books. And that
being free from all disturbance they might
make the quicker dispatch of the translation,
he commanded a like number of Cells, or
little Rooms to be made, not in the City it
self, but about seven furlongs from it, where
the <hi>Pharos</hi> was built, that each one should
finish his interpretation by himself alone, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
the servants attending them, to be in
every regard serviceable to them; only to
hinder them from conversing together, to the
end that the exact truth of the Interpretation
might be known by their consent. And co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to know that these seventy men used
not only the same sense, but also the same
words in the translation, and that they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
no not so much as in one word one from
another, but had written in the same words of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42070:32"/>
the same things; being hereat astonished, and
believing the Interpretation to be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by divine assistance, he judged the men
worthy of all honour as loving, and beloved of
God, and with many gifts commanded them
to return again into their own Country: And
having the books in admiration (as there was
cause) and consecrating them unto God, he
laid them up there in the Library: These
things we relate unto you, O ye Greeks, not
as fables and feigned stories, but as those who
have been at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and have seen the
footsteps of those Cells yet remaining in
<hi>Pharos:</hi> This we report as having heard it
from the Inhabitants, who have received the
memorable things of their Countrey by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
from their Ancestors: Which also you

and a most earnest maintainer of that opinion,

saith he, I am not such a wretch, O

I have confessed unto thee before, that my
self and many others are of the same mind,
as ye fully know, it shall be even so: but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42070:33"/>
withal I have signified unto thee, that some
Christians of a pure and pious judgement, do
not acknowledge this:—But as for me,
and those Christians who are of a right
judgement in all things, we do know that
there shall be a Resurrection of the Flesh, and
a thousand years in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> re-built, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
and enlarged, as the Prophets <hi>Ezekiel,

that there shall be an Universal and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Resurrection of all together and a
Judgement, as a certain Man of our own,
whose name was <hi>Iohn,</hi> one of the Twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
of Christ, in that Revelation which he
had, hath foretold.</p>
               <p>2. He entertained a gross Judaical conceit,<note place="margin">Apolog. 1. page 44.</note>
concerning some of the Angels: of whom
he hath these words: That God having made
the World, and put the Earth in subjection
unto Man:—He committed the care of
Men themselves and of the things under the
Heavens unto certain Angels whom he had
appointed hereunto: but the Angels trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing
the Ordinance of God, were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with the company of Women, on whom
they begat those Children which are called
Daemons: and moreover they brought the
rest of mankind into servitude unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,—and
sowed Murthers, Adulteries,
Wars, and all kind of wickedness among
Men, This errour took its rise from an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Edition of the Septuagint,<note place="margin">Sixt. Senens. Biblioth. lib. 5. annot. 70.</note> which <hi>Philo
Iudaeus,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> followed: they finding,

brought to light (after it had been almost
buried) and recovered from the dust, being
mouldy and moth-eaten.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And should they
have remained in perpetual oblivion: the loss
had been exceeding great: for (saith he) his
writings do breath forth the ancient vigour of
the Gospel; yea his very phrase came from
a breast prepared for Martyrdom; for the
Martyrs have a certain serious, bold and mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
kind of speech.</p>
               <p>It hath been a question,<note place="margin">Bellarm. in Catalog. Scrip.</note> and doubted by

Books in the Greek, or Latine Tongue: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are now not to be found but in the
Latin only:<note place="margin">In Epist. nuncupat. ante Iren.</note> yet was he a Greek by Nation,
and his phrase savours of that Language,
having many Grecisms in it. <hi>Erasmus,</hi> a
man of more than ordinary perspicacity and
judgement this way, rather inclined to think
it written by him in Latin, yet would not
peremptorily conclude it: For, saith he, it
is not clear to me, whether of the two he
wrote in; though I rather soppose that he
wrote in Latin, but was more expert in the
Greek, and therefore speaking Latin he is
bold to make use of Greek figures and forms
of speech. But most are of another mind,
judging the Greek to have been the Original
Language, werein his Books were written;

<hi>Pamelius</hi> also thinks that both he and those

considered, it's a wonder that <hi>Erasmus</hi> should

the great <hi>Scaliger:</hi> I do admire (saith he)

imagine, both that 'tis the true <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and
that he imitates the Greeks: That Latin In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
was most foolish, and either omitted

not. The fragments which are extant

2. In the second, he treats of the one Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
True, Omnipotent and Omniscient God,
besides whom there is none other: And that
not any feigned <hi>Demiurgus</hi> or Angels, but this
eternal God alone, Father, Son and holy Ghost,
did out of nothing produce this whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,
both of Heaven and Earth; and gave
being to Angels, Men and all inferiour Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and refuses the Errours of the Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks
concerning the same; shewing what
they stole from the Philosophers to deceive the
simple withal, and wounding, yea over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
them with Weapons or Arguments
fetched out of their own Magazines and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <p>3. In the third, which is partly polemical,
and partly exegetical, he discovers and proves
the Hereticks to be foully guilty of that hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
crime of corrupting and curtailing the
sacred Scriptures: and evidently demonstrates
the perpetual consent of the Prophets and
Apostles concerning our Lord Jesus Christ,
God and Man.</p>
               <p>4. In the fourth he clearly, and by solid
Arguments proves, that one and the same
God was the Author of both the Testaments,
the Old and the New; and that therein he
hath revealed himself and his Will concerning
the Restitution and Salvation by Jesus Christ,
of all men that do repent; largely discoursing
of the power of the Will, and of our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and being gotten out of the craggy
and intricate places, he enters into a large
field, explaining many Scriptures depraved
by the Hereticks.</p>
               <p>5. In the fifth and last Book having made
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42070:43"/>
a repetition of divers things formerly handled,
he comes to confute the vain conceits of the
Gnosticks concerning the utter perishing of
the bodies of men; and proves that our bodies
shall not only be raised by Christ at the last day,
but also that the very bodies of the Saints
shall injoy eternal life, and be saved together
with their Souls. In the handling whereof
he gives a notable experiment (as the diligent
Reader may observe) of a clear head, and as
of a choice a spirit; whence his weighty
arguments sharpned with holy Zeal, do pierce
deeply into the very hearts of the Enemies of
the Truth, to their shameful prostration, and
utter overthrow: for great is the Truth, and
will prevail.</p>

               <p>Where observe by the way, that though it
may be wondered at, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> should no
where expresly call the Holy Ghost God, yet
that he held him to be God equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son, is manifest, in that he makes
in his Creed the object of faith to be all the
three persons of the Trinity alike:<note place="margin">In prooem. lib. 4.</note> As also
from hence, that elsewhere he ascribes the
creation of man unto the Holy Ghost, as well
as to the Father and the Son.</p>

salvation, we should not have had it firmly;
and unless man had been joyned unto our
God, he (<hi>viz.</hi> Man) could not have been
made partaker of incorruptibility. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Mediator of God and Men,<note place="margin">Domestici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem.</note> by his
nearness unto both, to reduce both into
friendship and concord; and to procure that

Church,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. 11.</note> and that it is not tied to one place
or succession; he thus speaks, When once
the Gospel was spread throughout the world,
and the Church gathered out of all Nations,
then was the Church no where tied to one
place, or to any certain and ordinary succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but there was the true Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the uncorrupted voice of the Gospel
did sound, and the Sacraments were rightly

doth dispose in the name of Christ Jesus (cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified

help of the Nations, neither seducing any one,
nor taking money from him. For as it hath
freely received from God, so also doth it free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
administer: nor doth it accomplish any
thing by Angelical Invocations, nor incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
nor any wicked curiosity, but purely
and manifestly directing their prayers unto
the Lord, who hath made all things.</p>
               <p>6. He plainly asserts that the world shall
continue but six thousand years: For, saith
he,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. pag. 613. cap. 28. Feuardent. edit.</note> look in how many days this world was
made, in so many thousand years it shall be

rested the seventh day.</hi>

a prophecy of things to come: for one day

Christians differed in their Judgements about
the manner of Fasting, yet notwithstanding
were they at unity one with another, for
this variety of fasting commendeth the unity
of Faith.</p>
               <p>They that were Presbyters before <hi>Soter</hi> of

<hi>Anicetus,</hi> I mean, and <hi>Pius,</hi> and <hi>Hyginus,</hi>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42070:46"/>
it themselves, nor left any such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
to their posterity, and yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
they (not observing it) were at unity
with them, who resorted unto them, from
those Churches that did observe the same,
when yet their observance was contrary to
those who observe it not. Neither was any
one at any time rejected, (or excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
for such kind of fasting: but those very
Presbyters who were thy predecessors, have
sent the Eucharist to the Brethren of those
Churches who kept it after their own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
And when <hi>Polycarp</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> in the
time of <hi>Anicetus,</hi> and they were at variance
among themselves about some certain small
and trifling matters, they were soon reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;

used not, it seems, to command them as
now) that he should not retain that which he
had always observed with <hi>Iohn</hi> the Disciple of
our Lord, and the rest of the Apostles with
whom he had been conversant: neither did
<hi>Polycarp</hi> perswade <hi>Anicetus</hi> so to observe it,
but told him he ought to observe the Ancient
Custom of the Elders, whom he succeeded?
And things being at this pass, they held com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
one with another: and in the Church
<hi>Anicetus</hi> granted the <hi>Eucharist</hi> unto <hi>Polycarp</hi>
for the reverence which he bare him; and so
they parted from each other in peace, and in
the Universal Church, both those that did
observe it and those that did not observe it,
were at peace one with another.</p>

and after a while; <hi>Pantenus</hi> dying, he was
esteemed worthy to succeed him in the Office
of Doctor or Moderator of that School; in
which imployment he continued long, even
unto the end of his days, managing it with
much industry and prudence to the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and advantage of those that attended

approbation.</p>

endowments of nature,<note place="margin">Cent. 2. c 10.</note> of an acute wit, &amp; most
tenacious memory, which he imployed and
improved to the uttermost, sparing neither
industry nor travail for the attaining of
learning and knowledge, which he was very
greatly desirous, yea greedy of; for which
cause he betook him to the Schools of those
men in divers provinces and countries,<note place="margin">Baron. ib.</note> who
were most eminent and famous, drawing
from them what he found to be best, and
might most advantage him in that which he
sought for. Nor did he attend only upon
the living, but also applied himself unto and
consulted with the dead, diligently and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
perusing the Monuments of men learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>He likewise greatly improved both the
Learning and Life of his Master <hi>Pantenus,</hi>
(who was a pious and a prudent man) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

               <p>§. 3. He was exceeding useful unto the
Church of Christ as well by his pen, as by
his preaching: for being a man of singular
and more than ordinary abilities he wrote di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42070:52"/>
books, wherein he transmitted unto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
the doctrines which he had received
and taught, and vigorously asserted and
maintained the truth against the adversaries
and opposers of it. Of which writings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<hi>Casaubon</hi> quoting a passage of these Books,

               </p>
               <p>The excellency and usefulness of all three,<note place="margin">In Epist. ante opera Clem.</note>
is thus fully and at large set forth by <hi>Gentian
Heroet,</hi> who among others translated them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Latine. Of how great utility (saith he)
this ancient Father may be, doth from hence
evidently appear: Are there some that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with the most ancient Histories? Let
them read <hi>Clement,</hi> who retained them all so
exactly, that none of these things which
were done throughout the world, seem to
have escaped his knowledge. Are there
who reverence the Verses of the old Poets,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42070:55"/>
and certain divine answers of the Oracles?
These must needs have <hi>Clement</hi> in very high
esteem, who citeth the testimonies of very
many Poets, whose works are at this day utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lost and perished. Are there, who would
fain know and acquaint themselves with the
ancient Rites and Ceremonies observed in or
about the sacrifices of the Gods? Let such
betake them unto <hi>Clement,</hi> who so unfolds
all those abominable mysteries, that if any
one among Christians do yet praise and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
those old Heathenish Ordinances and
Customs (and would to God there were
none that did so) he will forthwith (unless
he be more stupid than a stone) upon the
reading of <hi>Clement</hi> cast away every fond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of those false Gods, and must needs be
ashamed of the madness of those who afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
did worship them. Would any know
the decrees or opinions of the old Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers?
Let them view <hi>Clement,</hi> who so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
and describes the original of all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
together with the several Sects, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
and Maxims of all Philosophers; that
seeing a man so singularly learned hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
Christian Philosophy (or Religion)
before all other; they will be forced (though
unwilling) to confess that this is plainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and in very deed inspired and published
from God. Have any a mind to understand
what were the Doctrines of those Hereticks,
who in its infancy and first rise disquieted the
Church of God? They may hear them by <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
explicated and confuted. Are any wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have evil and corrupt manners cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
and amended? There is none that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42070:56"/>
against vice more sharply, none that
better exhorts unto vertue, none that shews
the way how men should order and lead their
lives more exactly then <hi>Clement</hi> doth. An
encomium large enough to invite the most
curious Reader, seeing there is such choice
fare, and variety of dishes for his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
               <p>There is observable in these works of his
fore-named, an admirable order and method,
purposely intended by himself; which shews
the mutual aspect and close connexion of the
one unto the other;<note place="margin">Heinsius in annotat. in Clement.</note> So that even herein he
is mysterious, and Pythagorical. For,</p>
               <p>1. In the first, he sets forth the vanity of
Heathenish Idolatry;<note place="margin">Scultet. in Maedull.</note> by arguments drawn
from the original and matter of their gods,
and the judgement of the more sound Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks;
who, though unwillingly, yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
their errour: Also from the vanity
of their Temples and Images: and in the

               <p>Concerning this last, take a hint of these
two things:</p>
               <p>1. That herein he tyeth not himself unto
any exact method or order, but is somewhat
confused and abstruse: for so he himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
rendring the Reason why he did so,
<hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Strom. lib. 7.</note> he therefore dispersed the Doctrines that
excite unto true knowledge here and there,
that they might not easily be found out by
any that are not initiated into these mysteries:
therefore, saith he, <hi>neque ordinem neque dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem

                  <note place="margin">Strom. lib. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the Books of

that here, it seems he was curious in neither.
Again, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.<note place="margin">Strom. lib. 6.</note> these Books being as a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

Wherein things as they occasionally offered
themselves and came into his mind, are
scattered up and down, as a Meadow is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously

of his end in compiling these Books; his
words are, as rendred in the Parisian Edition;

great variety of the choicest herbs and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
wherein the judicious Reader may with
much contentment recreate himself, and be
thence abundantly stored both for his profit
and delight. I shall gather and present you
with a view for an invitation.</p>
               <p>1. Concerning the Holy Scriptures he
speaks very venerably, plainly asserting the
Divine authority, perspicuity and perfection
of them thus:</p>
               <p>We make use (saith he) of the Scriptures
for the finding out and judging of the truth
of things:<note place="margin">Strom. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> Now whatsoever is judged, is not
believed before it be judged; wherefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is that a principle, that needs to be judged.
If it be not enough to affirm what seems to be
a truth, but that a proof of what is spoken be
requisite, we expect not the Testimony of
men, but we prove what is inquired after by
the Voice of the Lord, which is more worthy
to be believed than any demonstration, or
rather is the only demonstration. Again, as
in war, that order is not to be foresaken, which
the Commander hath given to the Soldier: So
neither is that order to be forsaken, that the
word hath prescribed to us,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

received as the Prince or Moderator both of
knowledge and practice.</p>
               <p>2. To believe in Christ,<note place="margin">Strom. lib. 4.</note> is to be made one
with him and inseparably united to him: Not
to believe is to doubt, and to be divided and at
distance from him.</p>
               <p>Faith is a voluntary anticipation (or afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
taking hold of what is promised) a
pious assent:<note place="margin">

               <p>3. The whole life of a godly man is,<note place="margin">Strom. lib. 7.</note> as it
were, a certain holy and solemn festival day:
his Sacrifices are Prayers and Praises, and the
reading of the Scriptures before his repast; as
also Psalms and Hymns while he is at meat:
likewise before he goeth to rest, yea, and in the
night to Prayers again. By these he unites
and joyns himself unto the Quire of Heaven.
But doth he know no other Sacrifices? Yes;
namely, the largess of instruction, and relief
of the poor.<note place="margin">

               <p>5. This is to drink the Blood of Jesus,<note place="margin">Paedagog. lib. 2. cap. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
to be made partaker of the incorruption of
the Lord.</p>
               <p>6. It's the greatest argument of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,<note place="margin">Strom. lib. 1.</note>
that the Lord permits not sin and
vice, which had its rise from mans volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
defection, to remain unprofitable, nor
yet altogether hurtful: for it is the office of
the divine wisdom, vertue and power, not
only to do good (for this is (to say it once for
all) the nature of God, as it is of fire to burn,
and of light to illuminate) but also, and that
chiefly, to bring that unto some good and
profitable end and issue, that hath been devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by wicked men, and to use those things
profitably, which seem to be evil. Again,
nothing comes to pass without the will of the
Lord of all: It remains therefore that we
briefly say,<note place="margin">Strom. lib. 4.</note> that things of this Nature, (<hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42070:59"/>

                     </gap>.</note> for this only
salves both the Divine Providence and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
for we ought not to imagine that he
doth effectually cause afflictions; far be it
from us so to think; but we ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
our selves, that he doth not hinder
those who are the authors of them, but make
use of the bold attempts of adversaries unto a
good end.</p>
               <p>7. God,<note place="margin">Strom. lib. 6.</note> who is good and gracious, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiseth
for three causes. 1. That he who is
chastised may become better than he was.
2. That such as may or shall be saved, being
admonished by Examples, may be prepared.
3. That he who is injured, may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned,
and apt (or exposed) to more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
               <p>8. Speaking of the several sorts of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers

that we have not the wonted superscription
prefixed in this Epistle, <hi>viz. Paul an Apostle,

writing unto the Hebrews, because of the ill
opinion they had conceived of him, he very
wisely concealed his name, left upon the sight
thereof they should be dismayed, and refuse
to read the Epistle: And also, (even as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius</hi>
the Elder said) for as much as the
Lord himself was the Messenger of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
and sent unto the Hebrews; <hi>Paul</hi>
for modesties sake, or out of his humility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Apostle of the Gentiles, wrote not
himself the Apostle of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> partly for
the honour due to Christ, and partly also
for that he being the Apostle of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,

               <p>The Gospels which contain the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies

to <hi>Mark</hi> was written upon this occasion;
when <hi>Peter</hi> preached openly at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
published the Gospel by lively voice; many
of his Auditors entreated <hi>Mark</hi> (having been
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42070:60"/>
a hearer and follower of that Apostle a long
time, and one that well remembred his words)
to deliver unto them in writing such
things as he had heard <hi>Peter</hi> Preach before;
which thing, when <hi>Peter</hi> afterward under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to be done, though he had not given
command that it should be done; yet being
done, he forbad it not. <hi>Iohn</hi> last of all see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to demonstrate the antiquity of the

                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:42070:61"/>
the King of the <hi>Argives</hi>) was more ancient
than any of the Greek Poets, Philosophers,
or Wise men, yea, most of their gods: to
which end he sets down and reckons the times
of the Kingdoms of the Jews, Persians, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians
and Romans: and so presents us
with an exact and accurate Chronology from
the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> unto the death of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Commodus;</hi> in whose Successors reigns,

                  <hi>Severus,</hi> (for <hi>Pertinax,</hi> who came between
them, held the Empire but a few Months)
he wrote these Books as <hi>Eusebius</hi> concludes:
for thus he: <hi>Clemens</hi> writing his Books of
<hi>Stromes,</hi> comprised in the first Volume a
Chronicle, containing the times unto the
death of <hi>Commodus;</hi> so that it is evident,
(saith he) that he finished his Books under
<hi>Severus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. He thus descants upon those words of
Christ:<note place="margin">Strom. lib. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Matth. 10. 23. When they persecute
you in this city, flee ye into another:</hi> he doth
not here perswade to fly, as if to suffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
were evil; nor doth he command
us, fearing death to decline it by flight; but
he wills us, that we be to none the authors or
abettors of evil; he requires us to use cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but he that obeys not, is audacious
and rash, unadvisedly casting himself into
manifest perils. Now if he that kills a man
of God, doth sin against God; he also is
guilty of that Murther, who offers himself to
Judgement. And such a one shall he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted,
that avoids not persecution, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously
offering himself to be taken.
He it is, that as much as in him lyeth, helps
forward the impiety of him that persecutes.

               <p>2. <hi>Ierom</hi> and others report concerning him,<note place="margin">In catalog. Nicephor. lib. 4. c. 34.</note>
that he continued an orthodox Presbyter in
the Church, <hi>usque ad statam mediamque aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,
unto his middle age;</hi> and afterwards fell
away unto the Heresie of the Montanists:
but now evident it is, that he wrote the most
of his Books before that time, to the doing
whereof, and furnishing for such a work, a
great deal of time must needs be requisite.
In the judgment of <hi>Pamelius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In vitâ Ter-Tertull.</note> and according
to his computation, he became a Christian in
the third year of the Reign of <hi>Severus,</hi> in
which also he is of opinion, that he wrote his
Book <hi>de P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llio,</hi> or <hi>of the Cloak;</hi> and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
year after year to put forth some or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Labours unto the time of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which fell out in the eighteenth year
of that Emperour's Reign: so that he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Church after his conversion about
fifteen years before he arrived unto his mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
age, and therefore could be of no great
age when first he gave up his name to Christ.</p>
               <p>That which gave the occasion of his relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing
the Heathenish,<note place="margin">In Apolog.</note> and embracing the
Christian Religion, some conceive (taking
a hint hereof from a passage of his own) to
have been this,<note place="margin">Pamel. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâ Tertull.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that the Devils being
sometimes adjured, did, though unwillingly,
confess that they were the Gods of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
This put him upon the search and study
of the Scriptures, whose great antiquity (as
transcending all other writings in this regard)
asserted their authority, and the truth of the
predictions contained in them (testified by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42070:67"/>
answerable events) was a sufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Divinity: which two, duly
considered, could not but prove strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
to perswade him, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Religion therein taught and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed,
must needs be the truest, and above
any other most worthiest to be believed
and embraced: To which he added, as no
small help hereunto, the diligent perusal of
those writings of his Predecessors, wherein
they had testified against the Gentiles their
profane practices and abominable Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>Having after his conversion spent some

               <p>1. Through pride, which is too often the
companion of them, and begotten by them:
hence they soar aloft, prying into things secret,
not content to walk in the common and safe
road: they would (as he, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 9.) be some

the limits of sobriety, they do <gap reason="foreign">

soon fall into the snare of the Devil.</p>
               <p>2. Through envy, which for the most part
follows them, as the shadow the substance:
this blasting their reputation, and being as a

they betake them unto factions: chusing
rather to side with the erroneus in esteem, then
with the orthodox in disgrace.</p>
               <p>3. Through ambition, they would fain be
as eminent in place as in parts: accounting
themselves injured when others are preferred
before them: hence it comes to pass, that
sometime in way of discontent and by way of
revenge, they have deserted, yea set themselves
against the truth, because they would make
opposition against those that have stood in
their way, and crost them in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.</p>

Here in his heat he condemns second
marriage, accounting it (as <hi>Montanus</hi> had
done) but little better than adultery. This
Book is another of those which he wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Church.</p>

What in the former Treatise he only
perswaded,<note place="margin">Rhenan. in argum.</note> in this he magisterially enjoyns,
more openly condemning second marriage:
they are both of the same subject,<note place="margin">Pamel. in vitâ. Hieronym. in catalog.</note> and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

Cloak, as more becoming Christian Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
he was by one branded with the note of
inconstancy: hereupon (in vindication of
himself) he writes this Book, therein shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the antiquity and commodious use of the
Cloak. This being the Garment of the
Greeks, which they were wont to cast over
their other Garments: hence it came to pass,
that by way of reproach, the Christians using
it, were called Grecians; and when they
went abroad, they commonly heard this
nickname or taunt, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
unto their Garment. Also because of
the simplicity or meanness both of it and
those that used it, it grew into contempt;
and it became a Proverb among the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,

unto <hi>Tertullian,</hi> induced hereunto by the
fidelity (as he supposeth) of some Manuscripts:
and because the stile is the same with that of
the other, he concludes that all three were
his, <hi>viz. Genesis, Sodoma &amp; ad Senatorem.</hi> A
weak ground for him to change his mind,
and build such confident conclusions upon, as
well may we deny them to be either <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

and roughness which you meet with in him
throughout, and that <hi>Carthagmian</hi> spirit and

Christ, of the Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> the Son of God
the Creator; and the resurrection of the

by which the truth may be known,
<hi>viz.</hi> If the Lord Jesus Christ did send out
the Apostles to Preach, other Preachers are
not to be received then those whom Christ
did institute: because neither doth any other
know the Father but the Son, and he to
whom the Son hath revealed him; neither
doth the Son seem to have revealed him unto
any others, save to the Apostles whom he sent
to Preach. Now what they have preached,
(<hi>i.e.</hi> what, Christ revealed to them) ought
no other way to be proved, then by the same
Churches which the Apostles themselves
founded; preaching unto them as well by a
lively voice, as they say, as afterward by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles.
If these things be so, it is then
evident, that every Doctrine which agrees
with the faith of those Apostolical, Mother

he not follow <hi>Montanus</hi> and <hi>Maximillia</hi> with

Errour, which I shall mention in the first
place.</p>
               <p>1. He became a follower of <hi>Montanus;</hi>
whose gross and sottish Errours having once
entertained, he (for ought that appears to the
contrary) persisted in unto the end of his
days; stiling and owning the blasphemous
Heretick,<note place="margin">Lib. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrect. car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis. &amp; sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius alibi. lib. advers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Praxeam. initio.</note> (together with his Female con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts

injoyned him to learn by heart; by which
means he grew unto such promptness and
acquaintance with the Scriptures; that he
contented not himself with the bare and usual
reading of them, but proceeded farther, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the hidden and profound meaning
of them; so that many times he would even
gravel his Father, questioning him what
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42070:96"/>
was meant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by this and that place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as his Father would check him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in outward appearance, admonishing
him not to enquire curiously above the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of his years, and more than the plain
Letter gave him to understand; yet inwardly
did he rejoyce greatly hereat, and would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
uncover the Breast of his child
while asleep, solemnly kissing it as the Shrine
or Closet of the Holy Ghost, giving hearty
thanks unto God that he had made him the
Father of such a Son.</p>

               <p>When his Father was martyred, he was left

things are to be found, that at first a Man
would easily judge all his assertions were to
be assented unto: for if the life give any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
his industry, purity, patience, and
sufferings were great, if his stock and learning,
what more noble? springing from a Family
made Illustrious by Martyrdom. Moreover,
for Christ was he deprived not only of his
Father, but also of all his substance, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
so far in the straits of poverty, that he
was oftentimes afflicted for the confession of
the name of Christ: such also was the strength
of his Wit, profound, sharp, and elegant, that
by much and far he excelled well nigh all
others; so great was his knowledge and
learning that they were but few things in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and almost none in humane Philosophy
that he throughly attained not unto? What
was there so difficult to be perswaded, that by
the force of disputation he cleared not up?
What so hard to be done, that he made not to
seem easie? His speech being so pleasant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
and sweet, that to me their seemed to
flow from his mouth, not so much words, as
honey. But perhaps, his assertions were wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
only with knotty arguments? Nay ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42070:107"/>
never any of the Masters did use more
examples of the divine Law. But (you'l say)
I believe he wrote but little; no mortal Man
more: so that I have not only not read all
his Books, but it seems even impossible to find
them all: and lest any thing should be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in him requisite unto the attaining of
knowledge, fulness of Age also abounded.
But perhaps he was not happy in his Scholars?
who ever more happy? sith innumerable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
Priests, Confessors, and Martyrs came
from his bosom. Besides, who can express
how great admiration, glory, and favour, he
had amongst all men? Who any way religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
did not fly unto him from the utmost
parts of the World? Who among Christians
did not reverence him as almost a Prophet;
among Philosophers, as a Master? How much
he was respected, not only by those of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
condition, but also the Empire it self,
Histories do declare, that report him to have
been sent for by the Mother of <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Emperour, for the worth of his Heavenly
Wisdom. His Epistles also testifie the same,
which in the authority of a Christian Master,
he wrote unto <hi>Philip,</hi> the first among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Emperours that was a Christian, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
whose incredible knowledge, if any
one will not receive the testimony of us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
reporting it, yet at least let him believe
the confession of the Heathen Philosophers
affirming it. For that impious <hi>Porphyri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42070:108"/>
the common people did understand the words
of the Scripture, being frequently exercised
in the reading of the sacred Volumes. For
then even Weavers and Spinsters had those
Books at home, which as often as they had
leasure, they carefully perused: neither to the
understanding of them was their need of any
other Language, than that which the illiterate
vulgar did make use of: and certainly that
reading brought this profit with it, that they
sate in the Church more docil or teachable

<hi>Origen</hi> was also very zealous and lively in his
delivery:<note place="margin">Erasm. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâ Origen.</note> for he loved the things which he
spake, and of such we use to speak with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

short, for he would never exceed an
hour, lest he should cloy his Auditors, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it better to preach often than long. In
reproving he always remembred Christian
moderation; sharp he would be, yet never
bitter; but for nothing he would more blame
them, then for seldom and slack coming to the
hearing of the Word, and for oscitancy when
they came, accounting diligence or negligence
this way one principal note of proficiency or
deficiency in Piety. He observed this method:

he was more faithful in his Translation than

But living ingloriously among these
also, he became a Christian, embracing the
Heresie of the <hi>Ebionites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 6. cap. 16.</note> who held that
Christ was a mere man, and born of <hi>Ioseph</hi>
and <hi>Mary.</hi> He translated the Old Testament
into Greek, not word for word, as <hi>Aquila</hi>
had done, but according to the sense thereof:
<hi>non verbum ex verbo, sed sententias ex sententiis
reddidit:</hi> about the year of Christ 200. This
Translation,<note place="margin">Buxtorf. ibid.</note>

saith,<note place="margin">Euseb. ibid.</note> that <hi>Symmachus</hi> delivered it her to
keep.</p>
               <p>2. To the four above named, he added
two more, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hebrew Text in Hebrew

Greek Characters, for the help of those that
could not read the Hebrew: These Texts
with the former four interpretations were set
one beside another; each page being divided
into six distinct columns for that purpose;
for which cause he intituled the work <hi>Hexapla,</hi>
as the former <hi>Tetrapla,</hi> and the following
<hi>Octopla,</hi> for the like reason; each page having
in the one four, as in the other eight columns.

the name not from the number of columns,
but from the nature of the Work: but were
it so, then might the same title have been
given as well unto the foregoing and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

to them all alike.</p>
               <p>3. To these six he added two more:<note place="margin">Sixt. Senens. Ibid.</note> which
because he had found without the names of
their Authors affixed to them, he called the
one <hi>Quinta,</hi> or the fifth; and the other
<hi>Sexta,</hi> or the sixth; the former whereof he
had found in the City of <hi>Hiericho;</hi> the later

they be his or no; for they do scarce

unto that of <hi>Chrysostom:</hi> he thinks it was
some Latine, that wrote them: which may
be guessed from hence, that in explicating
divers texts; he tells us how they are in
Latine, how in Greek: which was not the
manner of the Greeks to do; for they little,
or not at all cared for the Latine Tongue.
But if <hi>Ruffine</hi> translated it, he according to
his custom, made that his own by defiling it,

enough: but if any contend, that
<hi>Ruffine</hi> is sometime foolish this way, I will

wants a Preface, which (because it was <hi>Ierom</hi>'s
manner to set a Preface before what he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated)
<hi>Erasmus</hi> supposeth to be taken away
by those to whom he wrote, after that the
name of <hi>Origen</hi> became odious or envyed at
<hi>Rome:</hi> For very likely it is, that therein he
spake highly in commendation of his Wit, as
he doth in his Prologue before the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
upon <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> Yet notwithstanding
the Historical errours (saith <hi>Grynaeus</hi>) the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
so weak and waterish,<note place="margin">Ante homil. in Esai.</note> and the frigid
Allegories (<hi>indignissamae Origine &amp; Hieronymo</hi>)
together with the Barbarism of the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
do, I think abundantly shew, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Origen</hi> was the Author, nor <hi>Ierom</hi> the

whereof <hi>Ierom</hi> was the Translator; which

the Greek Titles declare;<note place="margin">Eras. lecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri ante hunc commentar.</note> though some have
imprudently divided them into Tracts or
Homilies: whereas there is not the least
footstep of that kind of writing to be found
in them: for his Homilies always end in a
Doxology, having sometimes a short Prayer
joyned therewith. It contains thirty eight
Homilies say some;<note place="margin">Cent. 3. c. 10. Sixt. Senens. Bellarm.</note> but thirty five say others:<note place="margin">Grynaeus. &amp; Merlin.</note>
wherein we have an exposition of a great part
of this Gospel, <hi>viz.</hi> from the thirteenth unto
the seven and twentyeth Chapter. It is a
piece (saith <hi>Erasmus</hi>) most worthy to be read:<note place="margin">Lectori E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ante comment.</note>
                     <hi>Origen</hi> is ardent every where, but no where
more, than when he handleth the sayings and
doings of Christ, and in my judgement (saith
he) no one of the Evangelists doth more fully
comprehend the Life and Doctrine of Christ,
then <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sixt. Senens. lib. 4.</note> Yet <hi>Ambrose</hi> conceiveth our

                     <note place="margin">Erasm. ibid. In lib.</note> as may be gathered
(though the Preface be wanting) from the
liberty which he takes in translating: It
seems (saith <hi>GryneuS</hi>) to be the writing of
some Latin: <hi>demptis iis quae vertit Erasmu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

15. Upon <hi>Luke</hi> thirty and nine Homilies:
of which without doubt <hi>Ierom</hi> was the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator,<note place="margin">Erasm. in censur.</note>
seeing he professeth so much in his
Preface: And because they are not so elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and are sprinkled with some errours
that were condemned,<note place="margin">Sixt. Senens. lib. 4.</note> he excuseth them as

upon <hi>Matthew</hi> when he was old.)<note place="margin">Casaub. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitat. 14. §11.</note> He is no
where in his Homilies so short and concise, as
in these. Three and thirty of them are a
continued exposition of this Gospel, from the
beginning thereof unto the midst of the fourth
Chapter. The six latter of them are an
enarration of divers places scattered here and
there.<note place="margin">In lib.</note>

the many errours inserted therein.</p>
                  <p>16. Upon <hi>Iohn</hi> thirty and two <hi>Tomes:
Ierom</hi> speaks of thirty and nine, which he
durst not undertake to translate for the Bulk
of them.<note place="margin">Sixt. Senens. lib. 4.</note> They all lay hid, till of late <hi>Perionius</hi>
a Monk of <hi>Cassinas</hi> found nine <hi>Tomes</hi> of them
in an old Greek Copy which he light on in
the King of <hi>France</hi> his Library, and turned
into Latin, yet were they in many places
maimed and inconsequent. These were
afterward by some obscure Grecian, divided
into thirty and two <hi>Tomes,</hi> that they might be
the more desired and sell the dearer: by whom
<hi>Ambrose</hi> of <hi>Millain,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Cassina,</hi> was
deluded, though a Man sagacious enough, and
of a quick Wit, who translated and published
them in thirty and two <hi>Tomes</hi> as now they

                  <p>17. Certain Homilies upon divers places
of the Evangelists:<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Script.</note> which without doubt
are not all <hi>Origens:</hi> some of them (saith

                  <p>2. Of the authority of the Scriptures: we
ought,<note place="margin">Tract. in Math. 23. 17.</note> (saith he) for the testimony or proof
of all the words which we utter in Doctrine
or Teaching, to bring forth or alledge the
sense of Scripture, as confirming the sense or
meaning which we expound or give: For as
all that Gold which was without the Temple
was not sanctified; so every sense (or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation)
which is without the divine
Scripture, though to some it may seem admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
is not Holy, because it is not contained
in the sense of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>3. Of the Divinity of the Scriptures, and
how they may be known of God:<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap> 4. cap. 1.</note> thus, If
any one with all diligence, and with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
which is meet, do consider the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Prophets, even then when he
reads and carefully looks into them, it is
certain that having his mind and sense strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n
or moved by some more Divine inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he shall know and acknowledge, that
those words, which he reads, are of God, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42070:125"/>
not uttered by Man, and of himself he shall
perceive that those Books were written not
by humane Art,<note place="margin">Divino Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurno.</note> nor mortal eloquence, but in
a divine and lofty stile.</p>
                  <p>4. Of the fulness of the Scriptures, thus: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
us to believe the sacred Scriptures not to
have one <hi>Apex</hi> or Tittle void of the Wisdom of
God.<note place="margin">Homil. 2. in Jerem.</note> The Prophets receiving of his fulness sung
or spake those things which they took of his
fulness. Therefore the sacred Scriptures do
breath the fulness of the Spirit: and there is
nothing either in the Prophecy, or the Law, or
Gospel, or in the Apostle, which descendeth
not from the fulness of the Divine Majesty.</p>
                  <p>5. Of the great efficacy and utility of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,<note place="margin">Homil. 2. in Joshuah.</note>
thus: Because all Scripture is given by
Divine Inspiration and is profitable: (<hi>in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturis
sanctis est vis quaedam, quae legenti etiam
fine explanatione sufficit.</hi>) we ought to believe
it to be so, though we feel not the benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
As Physicians are wont sometimes to give
some meat or drink for the clearing of the
sight, yet in taking of it we perceive not any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
but afterwards when its vertue reacheth
it, it by little and little purgeth the sight; after
this manner we ought to believe the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
to be profitable unto the Soul; although
for the present, our sense or reason reach not,
nor attain unto the understanding of it.</p>
                  <p>6. That Children ought to be baptized, thus:
the Church hath received from the Apostles
this tradition to give or administer Baptism e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto Infants,<note place="margin">In Epist. ad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Roman. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of divine Mysteries were committed, knew that
there is in all the inbred filth of sin, that ought

                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:42070:126"/>
7. Of the Sabbath;<note place="margin">In lib. Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meror. cap. 28.</note> thus: Let us see how
a Christian ought to observe and keep the
Sabbath: Upon the Sabbath, none of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the World ought to be done, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou cease from all worldly labours, and
do no such work, but attend spiritual imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
come to the Assembles, apply thine ear
unto the holy Scriptures read, and Sermons;
think of heavenly things, be sollicitous
about the future hope, have before thine eyes
the judgement to come, look not unto things
visible, and that are present, but unto invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and that shall be: This is the observation
of a Christian Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>8. Concerning excommunication, and that
it ought to be performed by the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">In Josuah. cap. 7.</note>
thus: If any one having been admonished
and rebuked for a fault, once, again, and the
third time, shall shew no amendment; there
remains no remedy but cutting off:<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 20.</note> For so
saith the Lord, <hi>If thy right offend thee, cut it
off,</hi> i. e. If I that seem to thee to be a right
hand, and am call'd a Presbyter, and seem to
preach the Word of God, if I shall do any
contrary unto Ecclesiastical Discipline, and
the Rule of the Gospel so that I give a scandal
or offence unto the Church; let the whole
Church conspiring with one consent, cut me
off, their right hand.</p>
                  <p>Again,<note place="margin">In Josuah. cap. 15.</note> those whose sins are manifest, we
ought to cast off; but where the sin is not
evident, we ought not to eject.</p>
                  <p>9. Out of those Prophesies or Books of
the Scripture,<note place="margin">

what is figuratively signified by them; seeing

                  <p>10. He reciteth the Canonical Books of the
Old Testament,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 6. cap. 24.</note> as they are now reckoned,
<hi>viz.</hi> twenty and two in number, after the

these, saith he, there are Books of the <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees.</hi>
Of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he
thus speaks;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> The character of the Epistle to
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (saith he) setteth not forth the
stile of <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 10.</note> who confesseth himself to be
rude in speech; for the phrase of that Epistle
savoureth very much of the Greek Tongue;
whosoever he be that hath any judgement or
discerning of phrases, will confess the same.
I truly for mine own part, that I may speak
as I think, do say, that the Doctrine of this
Epistle is the Apostles for undoubted; but
the phrase and order another mans, who noted
the sayings of the Apostle, and contrived such
things as he had heard of his Master, into
short and compendious notes.</p>
                  <p>11. That Christ cometh and goeth,<note place="margin">In Cant. Homil. 1.</note> and
is not always enjoyed, nor alike present with
his people; thus: God is my witness, that I
have often times beheld the Bride groom
coming unto me, and to be very much with
me; who suddenly withdrawing, I could
not find what I sought for. I therefore again
desire his coming, and sometimes he cometh
again; and when he appeareth, and was held
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42070:127"/>
in my hands, he again slips away: and being
gone, he is again sought for by me: and
this he doth often, till I truly hold him
fast.</p>
                  <p>12. Against the Observations of ones
Birth-day,<note place="margin">In Job lib. 3. item in Matth. cap. 14.</note> as an annual Festival; thus: It
is no where recorded in the Scripture that
any of the Saints did keep a Festival, or hold
a great Feast upon the day of his Birth; only
sinners rejoyce for such a Nativity, as did
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Herod.</hi>

many; (his deeds even from the Cradle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
in the judgement of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> to be
recorded and transmitted unto Posterity) so
were they equalled by his defects and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes;<note place="margin">Merlin. in Apolog. Origen.</note>
and as for the one he was justly had
in high esteem; so did the other no less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from his reputation; which occasioned
that speech so commonly made use of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him; that, where he did well, no man did
better; and where he did ill, no man did
worse.<note place="margin">Vid. Baron. ad an. 256. § 46.</note>

it came to pass that divers of the Ancients
were so divided in their judgements, and had
such hot contests about him: Some vilifying
and opposing him, as did <hi>Theophilus,</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi>
a City of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> who speaking of the

                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:42070:127"/>
He was also perswaded by Letters,<note place="margin">Gennad. de Script.</note> which
he received from the said <hi>Theophilus (qui
scripsit adversum Originem unum &amp; grande

at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> wherein by the Bishops of the Island
assembled,<note place="margin">Socrates, lib. 6. cap. 9.</note> it was decreed that none should
read the works of <hi>Origen:</hi> The like was also
done shortly after, in a Synod convened by
<hi>Theophilus</hi> himself in his own Province:
Upon which divers of <hi>Origens</hi> followers fled

the aid of <hi>Chrysostom;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Binnius. Concil. tom. 4.</note> who admitted them

that occasioned the great contention between

speaks of him; that for natural and moral
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42070:132"/>
philosophy he was a Doctor acceptable unto
all; but for matters Dogmatical or of Faith,
&amp; of Theological speculation, he shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the most absurd of all that went before or
followed after him. Which also those frequent
passages of <hi>Ierom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epist. Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. n. 65.</note> do shew; where he saith;
I commended him as an interpretor, but not
as a Dogmatist: Again; I call <hi>Origen</hi> ours
for his learning and wit, not for the truth of
his opinions and Doctrine. Lastly,<note place="margin">Apolog. adv. Ruffin. l. 2. Epist. ad Theop. n. 62.</note> as I ever
attributed unto <hi>Origen</hi> the Interpretation and

he prescribes this as an antidote against
the errors therein contained: Whosoever,
saith he, will read these books, and go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the land of promise with his feet shod,
lest he be bitten of Serpents, and smitten
with the forked wound of the Scorpion;
let him read this book or Epistle wherein are
declared the dangerous passages contained in
those books, that so he may know before he
begin his journy, what things he must shun &amp;
avoid. Hence <hi>Beza</hi> gives this censure of him;
certainly,<note place="margin">Epist. 28.</note> saith he, this writer is every way so
impure whether he wrote so himself, or
whether his writings were afterward <hi>depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
that in matters controversial, he deserves
no authority in the Church. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in the judgment of some, the good
that was in him, exceeded the evil; so that
although he were guilty of the errors impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto him, yet being a man of so much
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42070:132"/>
learning, he deserves to be pittied; whose
faults,<note place="margin">Hist. Eccles. lib. 6. c. 3.</note> saith <hi>Haymo,</hi> if there be any in his

saith he, and how great, which hapned to
<hi>Origen</hi> in that persecution, and how he died;
the spiteful Devil pursuing him with his
whole troop; striving against him with all
might and every kind of sleight that possibly
could be invented; and especially against
him above all the rest which then were
persecuted to death; and what and how
great things he sustained for the Doctrine of
Christ; imprisonments and torments of
body; scourging at Iron stakes, stench of
close prison; and how for the space of
many days, his feet lay stretched four paces
asunder in the stocks; and how that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
he endured the threats of fire and all
that the enemy could terrifie him with; and
what end he made after the judge had
wrought by all means possible to save his
life; and what speeches he uttered very
profitable for such as need consolation; sundry
of his Epistles truly; faithfully and curiously
penn'd, do declare. He lived the space of
sixty nine years:<note place="margin">Euseb. hist. l. 7. c. 1. Hieronym. in Catalog. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

exercise of Piety, and many notable vertues.
But notwithstanding all his labours and
worth, his age and end (as well as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

poverty; so small recompence and reward

with the knowledge of the Arts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his proficiency was such, that (among
the rest) he became an excellent Rhetorician,<note place="margin">Lactant. de institut. lib. 5. cap. 1.</note> and publickly professed and taught that art at
<hi>Carhage,</hi> being had in very great esteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them; but all this while an Ethnick,
without the knowledge of Christ, yea, a most
bitter persecutor of the Christians, withal à

though this last be very improbable in the

               </p>
               <p>How long he continued in this condition is
uncertain, yet that he was well stricken in
years before converted unto Christianity, may
be conjectured, 1. Partly from his own
words: for (while being a Gentile, he
thought of receiving the Christian Faith)
he conflicted with such reasonings as these;
he conceived it a hard and difficult thing (as
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42070:134"/>
sometime did <hi>Nicodemus</hi>) for a man to be born
again, that he should by the washing of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
put off what he was before, and have his
mind changed: How (saith he) can such a
conversion be possible, that so suddenly that
should be put off which was genuine and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and through length of time and old
age had taken such deep rooting?<note place="margin">Ad an. 25<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. § 7.</note> Hence it
appears (saith <hi>Baronius</hi>) that he was <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nescens,</hi>
near unto and upon the verge of old
age when he was about to give up his name
to Christ. 2. Partly also from the time that
he sate Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
conceived to be about the space of ten
years,<note place="margin">Pamel. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâ.</note> and not above; for he was chosen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the office about the year 249, and suffered
martyrdom, <hi>an.</hi> 259. Now both <hi>Baronius</hi>
and <hi>Pamelius,</hi> as also before them, <hi>Pontius</hi>
his Deacon and companion in his exile, who
wrote the story of his life, do all affirm, that
he was made Bishop shortly after his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and while but <hi>Neophytus &amp; Novellus,</hi> a
Novice in Christianity, and newly come to
the Faith.</p>
               <p>The instrumens by whom he was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Pontius in vitâ Cypr.</note>
was one <hi>Caecilius</hi> a Presbyter, who part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by his pious conversation (which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
exemplary, he being a just man, and in
honour, as well as age, a true Presbyter)
and partly by his perswasions (upon which
his eloquence did set such an edge,<note place="margin">Cent. 3. cap. 10.</note> that they
were of great force and pierced deeply) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with him,<note place="margin">Baron. ad an. 250. § 6.</note> and brought him unto the
knowledge and profession of Christianity.
It seems the special portion of Scripture that
wrought upon him, was the prophecy of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42070:135"/>
                  <hi>Ionab,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Jonan cap. 3.</note> which haply <hi>Caecilius</hi> was unfolding
and preaching upon at that time; for so much
<hi>Ierom</hi> intimates, where he saith, Blessed <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
having been before an assertour of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
at length hearing the Sermon of <hi>Ionab,</hi>
was converted and brought unto repentance.
It is not unlikely that he had been before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
and somewhat inclined unto the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, by reading the Books of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and particularly of <hi>Tertullian</hi> his
Country-man, unto whom he was much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
and greatly admired him; for had it
not been so,<note place="margin">Ad an. 250. §. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> seeth not how (unless
you will ascribe it to a miracle) he could in
so short a time attain unto such a height of
knowledge both in Doctrine and Discipline,
as should furnish him for so high a function in
the Church.</p>
               <p>His love and affection unto his <hi>Caeeilius</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
after was so great,<note place="margin">Pontius in vitâ.</note> that he respected and
and reverenced him not as a friend and equal
only, but as a spiritual Father, and one by
whom he had received a new life, which he
gave clear testimony of unto the world, by
prefixing his name unto his own: so that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this day he is called and commonly known
by the name of <hi>Caecilius Cyprianus,</hi> as did
<hi>Eusebius</hi> in after times annex the name of
<hi>Pamphylus</hi> unto his own,<note place="margin">Post non multum temporis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus in Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum etiam Episcopus Carthagi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But a very little time did intervene between
his conversion and advancement unto the

his growth in the faith, that in a short space

other weighty reasons: as</p>
               <p>1. In obedience to God, whose provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
spake out no less than his command
what he should do,<note place="margin">Epist. 10. § 4.</note> as he himself speaks:
You shall (saith he in an Epistle to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy)
hear all things, when the Lord shall
bring me back again unto you, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to withdraw. Of which <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
gives us a larger account:<note place="margin">In vitâ Cypr.</note> 'Twas fear
indeed (saith he) moved him so to do, but
it was that just fear lest he should offend God,
that fear which would rather obey God than
be so crowned; for his heart being in all
things devoted unto God, and his faith sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto divine admonitions, he believes that
if he had not obeyed the Lord, requiring him
then to hide, he should have sinned in his
very suffering.</p>
               <p>2. Lest by his presence he should stir up
envy of the people,<note place="margin">Pamel. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâ.</note> who could less away
with him than any other of the Presbyters;<note place="margin">Cypr Epist. 15. § 1. &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 6. § 1. &amp; Epist. 36.</note>
and so the sedition already begun among
them, should grow unto a greater height.</p>
               <p>3. The Church could not have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of him but to her exceeding great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment,<note place="margin">Pontius in vitâ.</note>
especially at that time, there being

none so able to afford that comfort, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,

which multitudes in the Church did then
stand in need of: Well, well, therefore,
(saith <hi>Pontius</hi>) and truly by divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
it came to pass that a man so necessary
in many regards, should be delayed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
of Martyrdom. Yet it seems
that some were unsatisfied with, and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated
this his action,<note place="margin">Pamel. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâ.</note> which he therefore
took occasion to clear and vindicate in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of his Epistles;<note place="margin">Baron. ad an. 253. § 32.</note> whereby he gave satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

unto brotherly love, should be banished the

was the Church much vexed for sometime,
and <hi>Cyprian</hi> loaded with calumnies by the

bare and overcame with invincible courage

at <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pamel. in vitâ.</note> and in other Provinces,
both of the Eastern and Western Churches,
for the suppressing of them. What after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
became of these Schismaticks is not

               <p>After this arose the question about the

                  <note place="margin">Baron. ad an. 258. § 11. 12.</note> This
was occasioned by the practice of the <hi>Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>

that such as had been by Hereticks baptized,
were upon their return unto the Church to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42070:138"/>
be admitted again, by rebaptization: and
that, because there is but one Baptism, which
is no where to be found, but in the true
Church. The sentence of <hi>Cyprian</hi> is in the last
place set down in these words.<note place="margin">Binnius ibid.</note> My sentence
(or judgement herein) (saith he) the Epistle

Adversaries of Christ, and called Antichrists,
when they come unto the Church, are to be
baptized with the only Baptism of the Church;
that they may be made friends of foes, and of
Antichrists Christians. Which Opinion was

                  <note place="margin">Baron. ad an. 258. § 42.</note> and the
Council by him there assembled. Yet did
many of the Eastern Bishops, and of <hi>Egypt,</hi>

this his opinion;<note place="margin">Ibid. 49.</note> which having for a while,

embrace what was by others profitably and

               <p>2. His Charity and compassion to those in

to preserve and hold, even with those
that dissented from him:<note place="margin">August. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trà Donatist. lib. 1. &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trà Crescqu. lib. 2.</note> as appears in the
grand difference between him and <hi>Stephen</hi>

not break Communion by separating from
them, so neither did he cease to perswade

others also, that they should bear with one
another in love,<note place="margin">Epist. 76. § 12.</note> endeavouring to keep the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

words that he used in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi>

miscellany Epistles, written in the times of

of Hereticks; and seven in his last

affords not a little light for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

&amp; Diaconorum urbis Romae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the general there are three things
especially observable in the Epistles of our
Author.</p>
               <p>1. There are to be found in them divers
evident footsteps of the ancient Discipline of
the Churches of Christ. As concerning
Officers and the manner of electing them: of
the power of those Officers, and how it was
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42070:146"/>
made use of by them; of the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of offenders, and the restoring of them
unto Communion again, upon their repentance
and satisfaction given unto the Church: of
the care that ought to be had of the poor,
imprisoned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which see <hi>Epist.</hi> 6. 11, 12, 13
31, 34, 37, 52, 54, 64<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 65.</p>
               <p>2. Many notable cases propounded unto,
and resolved by him; particularly, these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
among the rest.</p>
               <p>1. Whether <hi>Novatian</hi> the Schismatick could
or might baptize or no?<note place="margin">Ad Magnum Epist. 76.</note> he denies that he
could (though herein he erred) which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to maintain and make good by
divers arguments: but the good Bishop (as
<hi>Goulart</hi> observes in his notes) undertook a bad
cause, in defending whereof he discovered
much weakness, though withal no less mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
in the close of his discourse.</p>
               <p>2. Whether a Stage-Player, persevering in
the exercise of that unseemly Art,<note place="margin">Ad Eucrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Epist. 62.</note> ought to
communicate? To which his answer is in
the Negative, that he ought not. <hi>Puto, inquit,
nec Majestati Divinae, nec Evangelicae Discipline
congruere, ut pudor &amp; honor Ecclesiae tam turpi
&amp; infami contagione foedetur,</hi> which place
(saith <hi>Goulart</hi>) meets with those who admit
unto the Communion without distinction,<note place="margin">In Notis.</note>
such as are impious and impure.</p>
               <p>3. Whether those who had been baptized
by Hereticks, upon their return unto the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, ought again to be baptized?
His answer is Affirmative, (wherein joyned
with him many other Bishops) and as the
ground of it, he labours to prove the Baptism
of Hereticks to be a nullity; wherein he doth
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42070:146"/>
                  <hi>humanum aliquid pati.</hi> And this is the chief
subject of divers Epistles, <hi>viz.</hi> from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventieth
unto the seventy seventh, among
which in the seventy sixth Epistle, the first
<hi>Quaere, viz.</hi> that about the Baptism of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatian,</hi>
is answered.</p>
               <p>4. Whether the <hi>Clinici (i. e.</hi> those who
were baptized upon their sick Beds) are to
be accounted legitimate or rightful Christians,<note place="margin">Epist. 76.</note>
because they are not washed, but only sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with baptismal water? Unto which his
answer is affirmative: <hi>Nos, inquit, aestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
in nullo mutilari &amp; debilitari posse benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia
divina, nec minus aliquid illic posse contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,
ubi plenâ &amp; totâ fide &amp; dantis &amp; sumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
accipitur, quod de divinis muneribus hauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
&amp;c.</hi> This by <hi>Pamelius</hi> is made to be
the latter part of the seventy sixth Epistle,
and not an entire one by it self:<note place="margin">In annotat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ante opera Cyprian.</note> and so thinks
<hi>Erasmus</hi> of it also, though in some Editions
it be disjoyned from it: It's plain, saith <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus,</hi>
from the first words, that it is no
entire Epistle; for who would begin an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
after this manner, <hi>Quaesisti etiam:</hi> yet in
his Edition are these made two distinct E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,
<hi>viz.</hi> one the sixth of the first Book:
the other the seventh of the fourth.</p>
               <p>5. Whether <hi>Fortunatianus</hi> (sometime a
Bishop) who had sacrificed unto Idols,<note place="margin">Epist. 64.</note> might
challenge or take unto himself his office again?
He answers negatively, rendring divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why he so judgeth.</p>
               <p>3. Many excellent and pressing exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

of Christ; as also sundry choice documents
and directions for Holiness and Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation;
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42070:147"/>
for which work he was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
furnished, that <hi>Pontius</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from thence, his flight in the time of
persecution, and reservation from Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for a while, to be from the special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, because of the need the
Church then had of him: For, saith he,
who should teach the <hi>Lapsi</hi> Repentance,<note place="margin">In vitâ Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</note> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
Truth, Schismaticks Unity, the Sons
of God peace and the Law of Evangelical
Prayer? Who should comfort Christians
tenderly affected with their losses, or rather
those of little faith, with the hope of future
things? Whence should we so learn mercy or
patience? Who should raise up so many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
with divine exhortations? Well then it
happened, that a man so many ways so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
should be for a while respited from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.<note place="margin">In vitâ ejus.</note>
He was therefore, saith <hi>Pamelius,</hi>
saved by the Lord, that being destined unto
Martyrdom afterward, he might by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
send before many Martyrs unto
the Lord, who, had they wanted the incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of this celestial Trumpet, might else
have fallen from the faith. Hear the words

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42070:147"/>
25. 56. 77. &amp; 81. In Epistolâ 77. (inquit
Baronius) elucet mirificè Christiani nominis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentiâ

               </p>
               <p>For his other works, <hi>Pamelius</hi> conceives,
that in the last recited words of <hi>Pontius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In praefat. in Tom. 2.</note> is
hinted the order in which they were written;
for who can think, saith he, that meerly by
accident, and not rather purposely and with
mature deliberation, he should observe such
an order in his words, which he therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
in his Edition, and so shall I in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital
of them. His Treatises then are these
following.</p>
               <p>1. Of the discipline and habit of Virgins,
entituled by <hi>Erasmus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epist. ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metriad. n. 8. de Script. Pamel. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâ.</note> only <hi>De habitu Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi>
and by <hi>Ierom</hi> and <hi>Trithemius, de vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitate.</hi>
It was written by him while he
was yet a Presbyter, or at least shortly after
he was made Bishop, <hi>viz.</hi> in the first year: of
which <hi>Rhenanus</hi> thus speaks, <hi>Cyprianus
scripsit de habitu Virginum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In argument. lib. Tertull. de patient. Epist.</note>

Ierom</hi> stiles it an egregious Volume, wherein
he exhorts Virgins to a conversation suitable
to their profession, to contemn the world,
and to shun the abuses and corruptions of it,
which in a lofty strain he stirs them up unto:
for so <hi>Augustin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De doct. Christ. lib. 4. cap 21. Erasm. in Margin.</note>

as by the threatenings of the adversary were
drawn to sacrifice, and did not rather with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
according unto the counsel of Christ,
blaming them, that before their repentance
they would even extort communion and peace
from some Presbyters without the consent of
the Bishop: and lastly, by divers arguments
he exhorts them unto a publick acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

the Church. Herein also he imitates <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulian</hi>

discourseth of the Duty of those who stand

the society of Schismaticks. This excellent
piece of <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Vassals of the Romish See
have been most busily tampering with, and as
palpably corrupting for their advantage in
point of the Popes Supremacy; having boldly

of the best and most uncorrupted Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts:<note place="margin">Treatise of the Fathers.</note>
the additions are these following,</p>
               <p>1. He built his Church on him alone (<hi>viz.
Peter</hi>) and commanded him to feed his
Sheep.</p>
               <p>2. He established one Chair.</p>
               <p>3. The Primacy was given unto <hi>Peter,</hi> to
shew that there was but (one Church of
Christ) and but one Chair.</p>
               <p>4. He that forsakes the Chair of <hi>Peter,</hi> on
which the Church was founded, doth he hope
himself to be in the Church? Of these last
words, saith <hi>Philander</hi> (after <hi>Theophilus</hi>

In this piece commending this prayer;<note place="margin">Schultet. in Medull.</note> he
shews how we ought to draw near unto God;
then explains the several parts and petitions
of it: unto which he subjoyns somewhat of
the necessity of prayer, how the mind ought

                  <hi>Erasmus</hi> wonders why any should rather
call it a Treatise, then an Epistle. Wherein,
using a more elaborate stile, he clears the
Christians of those calumnies that were cast
upon them by <hi>Demetrian</hi> and other <hi>Ethnicks;</hi>
who imputed it unto the Christians not
worshipping the Gods, that those grievous
judgments of famine, pestilence and war,
did so rage in the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire: the true
cause whereof he shews to be their contempt
of Christianity, which he proves by divers
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>guments; and closeth with an exhortation
unto the Gentiles to come unto God, and to
believe on Jesus Christ. In this likewise he
imitates his Master <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apology,<note place="margin">Pamel. in Annotat. De Justit. lib. 6, cap. 4.</note>
and in his book against <hi>Scapula;</hi> but is
blamed by <hi>Lactantius</hi> for not handling the
matter as he ought; because he dealt with an
Heathen by Scripture testimonies, which
<hi>Demetrian</hi> esteemed as fained and vain; who
should have been refuted by reason and
arguments grounded thereupon;<note place="margin">Hieronym. in epist. ad Mag. n. 84. Ad an. 256. § 30.</note> yet herein
is he defended by <hi>Baronius</hi> who labors to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him.</p>

6. Of the vanity of idols; or, that idols
are not gods: wherein he proves that they
were men, and consequently that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of them can be no way profitable:
And that there is but one true God and Lord
of all, whom the Christians worship. <hi>Erasmus</hi>
suspects it to be a fragment of a larger work,<note place="margin">In Annotat.</note>
because it begins so abruptly. Of which
piece <hi>Ierom</hi> thus speaks,<note place="margin">Ad Magnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. epist. 84.</note> commending his
wit and skill: with what brevity, with what
knowledge of all Histories, with what splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of words and sense hath <hi>Cyprian</hi> discussed
that idols are not Gods? Herein also as he
imitated <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apology, so likewise
doth he <hi>Minutius Foelix</hi> in his <hi>Octavius;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pamel. in vitâ ejus.</note> or
<hi>Minutius</hi> him: for they lived near about the

               <p>7. Of Mortality; written by him in a

and the rest of <hi>Egypt. Vsher</hi> calls it a

he armeth Christians against the fear

what are the fruits of death, and of how

                  <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Pamelius</hi> are very

the industrious Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> doubts not to rank
it among the works falsly ascribed unto this
Father.</p>
               <p>12. Three books of Testimonies unto
<hi>Quirinus,</hi> being none other then a rapsody
or collection of several places of Scripture.
The two first, against the Jews: In the one
he shews that the Jews have departed from
God,<note place="margin">In praefat. Cypr.</note> and so have lost that grace and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
which formerly was afforded unto
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42070:151"/>
them; and that the Gentiles from among all
nations have succeeded them, and come into
their place. The other contains the mystery
of Christ, that he came according as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
had foretold, and hath done and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
all things by which he might be
known. In the third,<note place="margin">Cent. 3. c. 10. praefa. Cypr. in lib. 3.</note> which the Centurists
stile, <hi>de disciplina Christianorum,</hi> he instructs
<hi>Quirinus</hi> in a Christian life; it being a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of Divine Precepts and Commands,
which may be the more easie and profitable
for the Readers, for that, being but a few
and digested into a Breviary, they are the
sooner Read over, and more frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.<note place="margin">In argu. in l. Eras. in Annot. ante opera Cypr. In Medull.</note>
                  <hi>Pamelius</hi> cannot wonder enough at
the censure of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> that it should seem
more probable unto him, that these books
are not <hi>Cyprians:</hi> Yet is this sagacious censor
seconded by <hi>Scultetus,</hi> who renders some
reasons why he should make question of it,
<hi>viz.</hi> that some Greek forms of speech, are
used in the third book, which are not to be
sound in the other works of <hi>Cyprian:</hi>
withal he adds, that many things do offer
themselves unto the diligent Reader, by
which without any great ado they may be
distinguished from what of this Father is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine.</p>
               <p>13. The sentences or suffrages of the
Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> concerning the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of Hereticks:<note place="margin">Eras. in Annotat.</note> which is none other than
a rehearsal of what was done and said in that
Council; as things were taken by the publick
Notaries, whereof he gives an account unto
<hi>Quirinus.</hi> This piece shuts up the second
Tome in <hi>Pamelius</hi> his Edition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:42070:152"/>
His third Tome contains those books that
are doubted of or falsly ascribed unto <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian:</hi>

though in his preface <hi>Pamelius</hi> makes
them to be of three sorts. First, Some, that
by the stile and Scriptures cited, do certainly
appear to be his genuine works: but how
true this is, we shall hereafter examine. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Others, of which there is some
doubt; yet are there many things to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us that they are his, or at least, of some
Author, no less Ancient then he. 3. Some
that are certainly found to be none of his.
But though divers pieces have his name af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
unto them, that he was never the
Author of; yet, saith <hi>Erasmus,</hi> herein was
he more happy then some others,<note place="margin">In praefat. ante opera Cypr.</note> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is ascribed unto him but what is Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and proceeded from great men.</p>
               <p>These are, first, his book of Spectacles;
which, he shews 'tis unlawful for Christians
to be present at and behold. A book, which
neither <hi>Trithemius</hi> nor the <hi>Centurists</hi> nor

without cause suspected; which also the stile
gives sufficient ground for. Herein the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

               <p>2. Of Discipline, or the good of chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;

'Tis a work of an uncertain but Learned
Author, so that 'twere pitty it should be

3. Of the praise of Martyrdom,<note place="margin">Baron. ad an 255. § 38. Erasm. in Annotat.</note> unto
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Maximus;</hi> wherein, <hi>pennis elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentiae
se mirificè extulit.</hi> But the stile is so
elaborate and unequal, that <hi>Erasmus</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
no man is of so dull a scent, but he must
needs perceive it to be far different from that
of <hi>Cyprian.</hi> He thinks it therefore to be an
Essay of some one that would exercise his
pen; wherein he shewed more care then,
wit, and more affectation then ability. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal

3. Of the Canonical Books of the Old and
New Testament, the same Author of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Apostles Creed, having enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated
the same Books that we do: These,
saith he, are they which the Fathers conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
within the Canon, out of which they
would have the assertions of our Faith to
consist: But we are to know further, that
there are other Books which our Predecessors
called not Canonical, but Ecclesiastical, as
the Books of Wisdom, <hi>Ecclesiasticus, Toby,
Iudith</hi> and <hi>Maccabees,</hi> all which they would
indeed have to be read in the Churches, but
yet not to be produced for the confirmation
of the Faith.</p>
               <p>4. Of how little esteem custom ought to
be,<note place="margin">§12. Epist. 74. Pompeio.</note> if not founded upon truth, he pithily
shews in that short sentence; <hi>Consuetudo sine
veritate, vetustas erroris est: Custom without
truth is but mouldy errour.</hi> In vain therefore,
saith he,<note place="margin">Epist. 53. § 11 ad Jubai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum.</note> do some that are overcome by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
oppose or object custom unto us, as if
custom were greater than truth; or that in
Spirituals were not to be followed, which for
the better hath been revealed by the Holy
Ghost. Again, if Christ alone must be heard,
as <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 5. we ought not to heed what
another before us thought fit to be done,<note place="margin">Epist. 63. § 11. Caecilio.</note> but
what Christ, who is before all, first did. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought we to follow the custom of man,
but the truth of God.</p>
               <p>5. He understands by Tradition, nothing
but that which is delivered in the Scripture:
Let nothing be innovated, saith <hi>Stephen</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him,<note place="margin">Epist. 74. § 2. Pompeio.</note> but what is delivered. He replyeth,
whence is this Tradition? whether doth it
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42070:159"/>
descend from the authority of the Lord, and
the Gospel, or doth it come from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Commands and Epistles: for those
things are to be done, that are Written:—If
therefore this (speaking of the Rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization
of Hereticks, or receiving them into
the Church only by imposition of hands,
which later was <hi>Stephens</hi> opinion against
<hi>Cyprian</hi>) be either commanded in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
or contained in the Epistles or Acts of
the Apostles, let it be observed as a Divine and
Holy Tradition.</p>
               <p>6. That the Baptism of children was
then received and practised in the Church;
and that performed by aspersion, as valid
as that by immersion. This, saith he, was
our sentence in the Council,<note place="margin">Epist. 59. § 4. ad Fidum.</note> that none ought
by us to be kept back from baptism, and the
grace of God, who is merciful unto all.
Now seeing this ought to be retained and
observed toward all, then we think it is much
more to be observed about even Infants and
such as are newly born.—Neither ought
it to move any one that the sick are sprinkled
or have water poured on them, seeing they
obtain grace of the Lord.—it appears
therefore that sprinkling also obtains even as
the Salutary Laver: and when these things
are done in the Church, where the faith both
of the giver and receiver is sound, all things
may stand, be consummated and perfected,
with or by the Majesty of the Lord and truth
of Faith. Concerning which opinion of his

feeling whips and stripes, they confess the
judgment to come. Come and know the

it is the Father that doth teach and instruct;
the Son that doth reveal and open the hidden
things of God; the holy Spirit that doth
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42070:160"/>
replenish and endue us. From the Father
we receive Power from the Son Wisdom,
from the holy Spirit Innocence. By the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is given us eternity, by the Son confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
unto his image; by the holy Spirit inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
and liberty; In the Father we are, in the

               <p>9. Of inadvertency in Prayer;<note place="margin">Tract. de orat. Dom. § 22.</note> what
slothfulness is it, saith he, to be alienated and
drawn away with foolish and profane
thoughts, when thou art praying unto the
Lord? as if there were some other things
that thou oughtest to think on, then that
thou art speaking with God. How dost thou
desire to be heard of God, when thou hearest
not thy self? wilt thou have the Lord to be
mindful of thee when thou prayest seeing
thou art not mindful of thy self? this is,
not wholly to beware of the enemy; this is,
when thou prayest unto God, to offend with
the negligence of prayer the Majesty of God;
this is, to watch with the eyes, and sleep
with the heart; whereas a Christian ought,
even when he sleeps with his eyes, to have his
heart waking.</p>
               <p>10. He doth most Rhetorically upbraid the
slothfulness and sterility of the Lords people,<note place="margin">Tract. de eleemosyn. § 19, 20.</note>
by bringing in Sathan with his sons of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thus speaking; I, for those, O Christ
whom thou seest with me, have neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
blows, nor sustained stripes, nor born
the cross, nor redeemed my family with the
price of my passion and death; neither do I
promise them the Kingdom of heaven, nor
restoring unto them immortality do I call
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:42070:160"/>
them back again to Paradise: And yet they
prepare me gifts very precious, great and
gotten with too much and long labor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Shew me, O Christ, any of thine, admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by thy precepts, and that shall receive for
earthly heavenly things, who bring thee such
gifts:—By these My terrene and fading
gifts (he means the Ethnick Spectacles) no
man is fed, none clothed, none sustained by
the comfort of any meat or drink; all perish
in the prodigal and foolish vanity of deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pleasures, between the madness of him
that sets them forth, and the error of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
—thou promisest eternal life to
those that work, and yet unto mine that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
thine are scarce equal, who are honored
by thee with Divine and Celestial rewards.

We (saith he) that must render an account
unto the Lord,<note place="margin">Epist. ad Cornel. 55. § 17.</note> do anxiously weigh and
sollicitously examine; those who are to be
received and admitted into the Church: For
some there are, whose crimes do so stand in
the way, or whom the brethren do so stiffly
and firmly oppose, that they cannot at all be
received without the scandal and danger of
many. For neither are some rotten shells so
to be gathered, as that those who are whole
and sound should be wounded; nor is he a
profitable and advised Pastor who so mingles
diseased and infected sheep with the flock, as
to contaminate the whole flock by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictation
(<hi>afflictatione</hi>) of evil cohering:
Oh, if you could (dear brother) be present
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:42070:161"/>
here with us when these crooked and perverse
ones return from schism, you should see
what ado I have to perswade our brethren to
patience, that laying asleep or suppressing the
grief of their mind, they would consent unto
the receiving and curing of those evil ones.
For as they rejoyce and are glad, when such
as are tolerable and less culpable do return;
so on the other side they murmur and strive,
as often as such as are incorrigible and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and defiled either with adulteries or
sacrifices (and after these things yet over
and above proved) do so return unto the
Church, that they corrupt good dispositions
within: I scarce perswade, yet extort from
the common sort, to suffer such to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and the grief of the fraternity is made
the more just, because that one or other of
those (who though the people did withstand
and contradict, yet were through my facility
received) became worse then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
nor could keep the promise of repentance,
because they came not with true repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>12. That the people had at that time a
voice in the election of their Bishop or Pastor,
even in <hi>Rome</hi> it self plainly appears in the
case of <hi>Cornelius</hi> so chosen; yea that it was
the use every where, is evident, by these
words of his:<note place="margin">Epist. 68. § 6</note> That (saith he) is to be
held and observed diligently from Divine
Tradition and Apostolical observation, which
is held with us also, and almost through all
provinces; that to the right celebrating of
ordinations, the Bishops of the same province
next unto that people over whom the Chief
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42070:161"/>
Officer is ordained, do convene or meet
together; and that the Bishop be chosen in
the presence of the people, who most fully
know the life and conversation of every one.
Again,<note place="margin">§ 4.</note> the people obeying the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and fearing God, ought to separate
themselves from a sinful overseer, nor to
mingle themselves with the sacrifices of a
sacrilegious Priest; seeing they chiefly have
the power either of chusing such as are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
or refusing the unworthy. Which very
thing we see to descend from Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
And else where, speaking of <hi>Cornelius,</hi>

called unto the Office of a Bishop; he hath

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42070:164"/>
judgment was this, that those who having
been baptized by Hereticks, did forsake their
Heresies, and return unto the Church, were
to be received by Baptism. In this opinion
many Bishops,<note place="margin">Bin. Tom. 1. concil.</note> not of <hi>Africa</hi> only, but of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>
also, consented with him: about which,
there having been three Councils convened at
<hi>Carthage;</hi> in the third (wherein <hi>Cyprian</hi> was
President) it was agreed in the affirmative,
upon this ground chiefly, because they
thought the Baptism of Hereticks to be a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>Great was the contest between the African
and Western Churches about this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie:<note place="margin">Epist. ad Pompeium contra Steph. Epist. 74. § 1.</note>
these latter holding with the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that Hereticks returning unto the
Church, were to be received only by prayer
and imposition of hands: wherein they are
to be conceived no less erroneous than the
former; for that they allowed the Baptism of
all sorts of Hereticks,<note place="margin">Bin. concil. tom. 1. ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

distinction between them: whereas, not long
after in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> if any one flie
unto the Catholick Church from the Paulia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
(meaning the Samosatenians,<note place="margin">Hieronym. advers. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer. dialog. August. de Haeres. cap. 44.</note> called by
either name from the Author <hi>Paulus Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satenus</hi>)
and Cataphrygians, it is ordained
or decreed that they ought altogether to be
rebaptized. The reason was, because these
Hereticks holding Christ to be none other
than a meer man, they baptized not in the
name of Christ; and so the substance and true
form of Baptism not being retained by them,
it was adjudged to be no Baptism. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
whoever is baptized by such an Heretick
as openly denies the Holy Trinity, ought to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42070:164"/>
be rebaptized:<note place="margin">Osian. Epist. cent. 3. l. b. 2. cap. 13.</note> so that it was the errour of
<hi>Stephen,</hi> and those who joyned with him,
that they excepted not such Hereticks as these;
as <hi>Cyprian</hi> erred in excepting none.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Stephen,</hi> though he were little less er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
than <hi>Cyprian</hi> herein, yet did he differ
much in his disposition and carriage:<note place="margin">Epist Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. ad Cypr. 75. § 21.</note> for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto his hot and cholerick temper,
he declared publickly against <hi>Firmilian</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Cesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> (of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
and excommunicated all those that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
from himself. Contrariwise, <hi>Cyprian</hi>
discovering herein the mildness of his spirit,
thus bespeaks his colleagues in the Council of
<hi>Carthage: (Ierom</hi> in commendation of him,<note place="margin">Advers. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferian.</note>

For observing the Christian Religion to be

their proud impiety, and conscience of the

them, who might have been confounded in

               <p>That which occasioned the writing of
them was the cunning and calumniating
books, especially of two great enemies of

himself a man of chief note among the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
wrote three books against the
Christian Name and Religion; whom <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi>

Poets, Philosophers, Sibyls, and of
<hi>Apollo:</hi> also (refuting the Gentile gods and
their Religion in the general, and of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>

were born at a certain time, lived most wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,

by divers arguments, shewing that the
causes of all errors in this kind are these two.

The cunning and craft of the Devil. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

4. Of true Wisdom; which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
the Doctrine of Christ, his Person,
Name, Nativity, two Natures, Miracles

the causes of Heresies to be Avarice, Pride,
Ignorance of the Scripture, and admiration of

who think Christians to be fools;
and that their sin is great and inexcusable;
who persecute the Church pretending it to be
for their good, <hi>viz.</hi> That they may bring them
unto a right mind.</p>
                  <p>6. Of true Worship: which consists in
this, that the mind of the worshipper be
presented blameless unto God, discoursing

Judgment, the sum whereof he himself thus

that we might be born; we are born that we

                  <p>There are besides these; certain Poems that

is very questionable whether they be his or
no: seeing, that neither <hi>Ierom</hi> nor <hi>Trithemius</hi>
take any notice of them, nor did <hi>Thomasius</hi>

by some most elegant Poet, who yet, I
believe, saith he, was not a Christian:
for he calls his <hi>Phoenix</hi> the Priest of the Sun,
and speaks of <hi>Phoebus,</hi> as if he were in very
deed a god.</p>
                  <p>2. Of the day of the Resurrection of the
Lord; which for elegancy, is no way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
unto the former;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> whence it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears that they are not of the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and Authority. <hi>Thomasius</hi> saith, that he
found them in the <hi>Vaticane</hi> Library among
the works of the Christian Poet <hi>Venantius
Fortunatus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Poictiers.</hi> And whereas
in the Ordinary Editions the Poem begins
with this Distich,
<q>Salve festa dies.—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Authority of the <hi>Vaticane</hi> copy, he
placeth it twenty Distichs off, immediately
before that.
<q>Mobilitas anni.—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which from his copy he amends thus,
<hi>Nobilitas anni.</hi>—and in the <hi>Pentameter,</hi>
for <hi>Stridula cuncta,</hi> he puts <hi>Stridula puncta.</hi>
And out of the same copy, he adds unto
the Poem, ten verses more then are usually
found, both because they very well agree
with it, and also because in the end of the
Poem be these Numeral Letters, CX. to make
up which, those ten were to be added; yea, I
find an hundred and twelve verses of this

spake unto all.</p>
                  <p>2. Again, to the same purpose; the Sacred
Scriptures,<note place="margin">Instit. l. 3. c. 1</note> saith he, deliver things briefly
and nakedly, neither indeed was it meet to be
otherwise, as if when God would speak to
men, he should assert his words with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as if he were not to be believed;
but, as it became him, he spake as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as the great judge of all things; for
whom, 'tis not to argue, but to pronounce
what is true.</p>
                  <p>3. Of the mighty force and efficacy of the
Scriptures and Christian Religion, beyond all
the Rules of Moral Philosophy, to expel vice
and plant in men all kind of vertue, he thus
speaks.<note place="margin">Instit. lib. 3. cap. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

So great is the power of Divine
Wisdom, that being infused into the brest of
a man, doth at one assault expel folly, the
mother of vices.—Hath any one of the
Philosophers either performed these things,
or can he, if he will? Who when they have
worn out all their time in the study of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
can make neither any other, nor
themselves better, if nature a little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
Therefore their wisdom when it
hath done its utmost,<note place="margin">Non excin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit vitia sed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> few precepts of

you cannot know him to be the same.</p>
                  <p>4. Of the Church: thus. The Church,
saith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">Instit. 4. c. 13</note> is the true Temple of God, which
consisteth not in walls, but in the hearts and
faith of men, who believe on him, and are
called faithful or believers.</p>
                  <p>5. Again, That only is the Catholick
Church, which retains the true Worship of
God.<note place="margin">Inst. l. 4. c. 30 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> This is the fountain of verity, this is
houshold of faith, this is the temple of God,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42070:174"/>
into which who so shall not enter, or from
which, who so shall depart, he is an alien
from the hope of eternal life and salvation.—
And because every company of Hereticks, do
think that they chiefly are Christians, and
theirs to be the Catholick Church; we are to
know, that that is the true; wherein is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Confession and Repentance, which
wholsomly cures the sins and wounds unto
which the frailty of the flesh is subject.</p>
                  <p>6. Of Repentance thus; He that repents
of his deed,<note place="margin">Inst. l. 6. c. 24</note> understands his former error:
wherefore, the Greeks do better and more
significantly call it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, then we La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
can call it <hi>Resipiscentiam.</hi> For he repents,
and, as it were, recovers his mind from
madness, who grieveth for his error, and
corrects himself for his folly, and confirms his
mind to live more uprightly, being most wary
of this, that he be not again drawn into the
same snares.</p>
                  <p>7. Again, The conscience of sin and fear
of punishment,<note place="margin">Inst. l. 5. c. 13</note> makes a man the more Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious:
and always faith is by much more firm,
which repentance resettles or puts again in its
place.</p>
                  <p>8. He sets down the sum of the Law, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
it unto two heads, after this manner.
The first head or chief point of the Law is to
know God and to obey and worship him
alone: Or, the first duty or point of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is to be in conjunction or communion
with God: the second with man: the former
is called Religion: the other is named, mercy
or humanity.—Wherefore the principal
bond of men among themselves, is humanity,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42070:175"/>
the which, whosoever shall break asunder, is
to be accounted a wretch and a parricide. For
if we all have our Original from one man,
whom God formed, surely, we are of kin
and of the same blood;<note place="margin">Consangu. Act. 17. 26.</note> and therefore is it
the greatest crime to hate a man, even an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
for which cause God hath commanded
that we should never bear enmity toward
any, but always take it away, to wit, that
we should pacifie those who are enemies unto
us,<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 8.</note> by admonishing them of the alliance that
is between us.</p>
                  <p>9. God, saith he, is not to be worshipped
with offerings and much blood;<note place="margin">Inst. l. 6. c. 25</note> but with a
pure mind and honest purpose. Temples are
not to be builded unto him with stones heaped
together on high; but to be hallowed by
every one in his own brest. If any one think
that garments and gems and other things
which are had in esteem, are dear to God, he
plainly knows not what God is; who thinks
that he takes pleasure in those things, which,
if even a man contemn, he shall be justly
praised. What therefore is pure, what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of God? but that which he himself in
his Divine Law requireth. Two things there
are which ought to be offered; a gift and a
sacrifice: the gift is integrity of mind; the
sacrifice, praise and thanksgiving.</p>
                  <p>10. There is no man so rude and of such
barbarous manners,<note place="margin">Inst. l. 1. c. 2.</note> but, when he lifts up his
eyes unto heaven, albeit he know not by the
providence of what God this universe, which
he beholds, is governed, yet doth he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that there is one, by the very vastness,
motion, order, constancy, utility, beauty and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42070:175"/>
temperament of thing: and that it cannot
be, but that that which consisteth in such an
admirable manner, is guided by some greater
Counsel.</p>
                  <p>§6. These and many other the like use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
passages are to be found in his writings:
though yet for the chief points of Religion he
handles them but very slenderly, and not so
plainly as he should: for there is not a clear
sentence concerning faith, the benefits of the
Son of God, or of any other necessary part
of the Doctrine of Christianity to be met
with in <hi>Lactantius</hi> throughout:<note place="margin">Cent. 4. c. 10</note> he being for
the most part imployed in refuting the false
opinions of the Gentiles; which is the ground
of that speech of <hi>Chemnitius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Orat. de lect. patr. Scultet. in Medull.</note> that <hi>Lactantius</hi>
cannot much advantage his Reader. Many
points of Religion he but toucheth only, and
the most he understood not: so likewise
speaks <hi>Chytraeus</hi> of him;<note place="margin">De stud. Theolog.</note> 
                     <hi>Doctrinam Evangelii
propriam, de beneficiis Christi, &amp; de fide parùm
intellexit.</hi>
Whence it comes to pass that his
errors were neither few nor small; speaking
of the weightiest doctrines very unfitly and
improperly; though perhaps in some of
them (as <hi>Osiander</hi> charitably conceives) he
thought better,<note place="margin">Epitom. hist. Eccles. cent. 4. l. 1. c. 31.</note> and was more sound in his
judgment.</p>
                  <p>His Errors were such as these.</p>
                  <p>1. Concerning God,<note place="margin">Inst. l. 1. c. 7.</note> his expression is very
unmeet and dangerous, <hi>viz.</hi> That God made
himself, Yet may his meaning be that God
had his being of himself; for so: <hi>lib.</hi> 2. 9.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:42070:176"/>
'tis God alone who is not made;—he
is of himself, as we said: <hi>lib.</hi> 1. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is such as he would himself to be, <hi>viz.</hi>
impassible, immutable, uncorrupt, blessed,
eternal.</p>
                  <p>2. He so speaks of Christ,<note place="margin">Cent. 4. c. 10.</note> say the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turists,
that a man may well say, he never
rightly understood either the person or
Office of the Son of Son of God. As where
he saith;</p>
                  <p>That God did produce a Spirit like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">Inst. l. 2. c. 9.</note>
who should be endued with the vertues of
God his Father. Also, The Commands of
his Father he faithfully observed:<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 4. 14.</note> for he
taught, that God is one, and that he alone
ought to be worshipped; neither did he ever
say that himself was God; for he should not
have been faithful, if, being sent to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the gods, and to assert one, should have
brought in another beside (that) one.
These and such like words he hath, that
do not a little smell of <hi>Arianism.</hi> Indeed,
he in this particular doth not express himself
so warily as he ought; which hath occasioned
such suspicions of him; but yet however,
that in his judgment he neither denied nor
doubted of the Deity or Eternity of Christ,
seems clear from divers other places, where
in so many words he acknowledgeth both;
as, where he calls him the word of God; <hi>&amp;,

knew any thing, <hi>Ierom</hi> acquaints us what
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42070:177"/>
his apprehensions of him were; In his books,
saith he, and especially in his Epistles unto
<hi>Demetrian,</hi> he denies the substance of the
holy Ghost, saying, according to the error of
the Jews, that he is referred either unto the
Father, or the Son; and that the sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of either person, is demonstrated under

whom at first the power of the earth was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

and that with much earnestness and
confidence, bestowing a whole Chapter upon
the maintainance of so evident a mistake, in
shewing the Original, and (as he conceived)
the absurdity of the Antipodian opinion, and
confuting it: wondring at the folly of those
that held it. What shall we think, saith he,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:42070:178"/>
of them who give out that there are Antipodes
walking opposite unto us? Do they speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing to the purpose? or are there any so
stupid as to believe, that there are men whose
feet are higher than their heads, or that those
things there do hang which with us do lye on
the ground? That the Plants and Trees spring
downward, that the snow and rain and hail
fall upward upon the earth? And need any
man marvel that hanging Gardens are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
in the number of the seven wonders
of the world, since the Philosophers have
made both Fields and Seas, Cities and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
all hanging?—What to say of these

§ 7. As concerning his death, I find no
mention at all in History, where, or after
what manner he ended his life. That he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
unto a great Age, may be gathered from
what <hi>Ierom</hi> writes of him,<note place="margin">In catalog.</note> that in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
old Age, he was in <hi>France,</hi> Schoolmaster
unto <hi>Crispus</hi> the Son of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great,
where therefore it is most likely he might end
his days: But withal he was reduced to such
poverty and want, (which is somewhat
strange being a man of such worth and so
greatly favoured by that good Emperour)
that for the most part he lacked even necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for his subsistence.<note place="margin">Euseb. chron. ad an. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their only Son: From his very
Childhood he gave good evidences of his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardliness
and inclination unto piety and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things. One thing especially as very
remarkable, and presaging his future dignity
and employment, is recorded by most Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
concerning him, and it is this:<note place="margin">Socrat. lib. 1. cap. 11.</note> He with

Bishop: Who acting his part accordingly,
baptized some of the boys, that had not been
baptized before, according unto the due form
of interrogatories and answers usually prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Baptism; giving them afterwards divers
exhortations and admonitions. All which,
<hi>Alexander,</hi> then Bishop of that place, passing
by at a distance beheld, and understanding by
examining them how he had proceeded, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with his Presbyters, that what was
done, though in childish simplicity, was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
and that those Children ought not again
to be baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> being moved herewith, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sent for his Parents, earnestly besought
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:42070:180"/>
and charged them that he should be carefully
trained up in piety and learning for the service
of the Church: which accordingly they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
performed, delivering him unto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Notary,<note place="margin">Ruffin. hist. lib. 1. c. 14.</note> who instructed him in the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar:
After which he spent some small time in
the study of the liberal Arts; lest he should
seem to be altogether ignorant in this regard;
which having lightly tasted and passed thorow,
he is, as another <hi>Samuel,</hi> by his Parents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their promise presented unto the
Bishop: With him, being taken into his care
and tuition, he applies himself wholly unto
the study of divinity, most diligently perusing
and meditating in the holy Scriptures of the
Old and New Testament, by which means he
became deeply insighted into them: hereunto
he added also the study of the Law, wherein
he attained unto so much skill, that <hi>Sulpitius
Severus</hi> speaking of him,<note place="margin">Sac. hist. l. 2.</note> gives him the Title
of <hi>Iurisconsultus</hi> or a Lawyer.</p>
               <p>For a while he lived with the Bishop as his

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:42070:180"/>
being called by the Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> the
Great, <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither, takes along with him young <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,</hi>
who was present not only as a
spectator,<note place="margin">Ruffin, hist. lib. 1. c. 14.</note> but an assistant unto the Bishop,
now grown aged, helping him much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
the subtile Sophisms of the adversaries:
wherein he gave a notable experiment of his
Learning and Piety, which much endeared
him unto the Orthodox, but made him from
that time no less envyed and hated by the
<hi>Arian</hi> Hereticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> survived this Council but a little
while, not above the space of five months:
when he was upon his death bed, he would
often call for <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who purposely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
himself, being unwilling to undertake
the charge of that Church, which yet the old
Bishop had designed him unto, using such
like words as these; <hi>Athanasius,</hi> thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to escape, but thou shalt not: meaning
hereby both the Bishoprick, and also the many
and great conflicts that he should undergo:<note place="margin">Ruffin. hist. lib. 1. c. 14.</note>

then about four and twenty years of age, so
great was his proficiency in whatever qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
were requisite for that Office. This
his Election by an Universal consent, is testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in these
words. We with the whole City and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
do testifie, that the whole multitude
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:42070:181"/>
and people of the Catholick Church, being
met together, and, as but of one body and
soul, did with clamors and cries require that
<hi>Athanasius</hi> might be given us for the Bishop
of this Church; and that with publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
they desired this of Christ; which that we
the Clergy would do, they earnestly besought
us night and day, themselves in the mean
time not departing from the Church, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
us to depart. Whence it evidently
appears how great the inclination of them all
was unto him, and how honorable an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they had of him.</p>
               <p>He no sooner undertook this weighty
charge, but forthwith he applied himself di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
(and made it his main work) to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate

The truth here of may be seen in the following
passages of his life.</p>
               <p>His chief adversary was <hi>Eusebius</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Nicomedia,</hi> who with his complices many
ways assailed him, as,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:42070:181"/>
1. They cavilled at, and found fault
with his Election, as undue; but that came to
nought.</p>
               <p>2. They traduced him unto the Emperor
<hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, as one that caused di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
and distractions in the Church, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
concord: the ground whereof was, his
refusing to receive the Heretick <hi>Arius</hi> (a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
of <hi>Alexandriae</hi>) into Communion,
whose return from banishment had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by a certain Presbyter about the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
upon his fained submission and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto the <hi>Nicene</hi> faith. Hereupon the
Emperor, (giving too much credit unto the
party of <hi>Eusebius</hi>) wrote menacing letters
unto <hi>Athanasius,</hi> threatning to remove him
from his place in case he should persist to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
<hi>Arius:</hi> But he by his Letters, gave full
satisfaction unto the Emperor; shewing that
such an Heretick having been proscribed and
justly excommunicated by so famous a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
ought not to be received again, but upon
his repentance manifested, and by the publick
consent of the pious. This not succeeding,
his adversaries.</p>
               <p>3. Proceeded to accuse him as a fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of sedition aiding with mony one <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumenus,</hi>
who enterprised somwhat against
the Emperor. But he, coming unto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
cleared himself, and made his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
so to appear, that the Emperor not
only acquitted him from all suspicion of the
crime objected unto him, but also honorably
sent him back unto <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with letters
of high commendation. Being thus disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
his restless enemies ceased not to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:42070:182"/>

which he made his answer in the Synod of
<hi>Tyre</hi> consisting of sixty Bishops, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened

temple which the Emperor had built at
<hi>Hierusalem:</hi>

saith he, enter into thine house, or had any

pointing at <hi>Timotheus</hi> with her finger, thus
replyeth with much eagerness; Thou, thou

be his, and to have been cut off and kept by

whether any one there present had known

               <p>During the reign of <hi>Constantius,</hi> divers
Councils of the Eastern and Western Bishops
were convened; as at <hi>Antioch, Sardica, Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium,

Council: which yet succeeded not according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Eastern being still stoutly opposed by

                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:42070:187"/>
was? who answered, that they had
lately seen him passing not far from thence.
They followed him therefore as they thought
with all the speed they could make, but all in
vain, for by this means <hi>Athanasius</hi> escaped
their hands and came safe unto <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
where he lay hid until the death of <hi>Iulian,</hi>
who was shortly after slain in a battel against
the <hi>Persians,</hi> having reigned only one year and
eight months.</p>
               <p>In his Room <hi>Iovinianus</hi> is by the Army
chosen Emperour, a most pious, Prince, who
reduced from banishment the orthodox Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:
Among whom for his singular virtues
he much admired <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and had him in
great esteem, conferring and advising with him
about matters of faith, and the right ordering
of the Churches: under whom they were like
to have been in a very flourishing and happy
condition, had not the shortness of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
prevented it, which the space of eight
months put a period unto.</p>
               <p>After him followed <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
with him in the government of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
his Brother <hi>Valens:</hi> these dividing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, <hi>Valentinian</hi> had the West, and
<hi>Valens</hi> the East for his dominion. This <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi>
did greatly favour the <hi>Arian</hi> faction, in
so much as he began to persecute the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
especially <hi>Athanasius,</hi> (their great eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
sending an Officer by force to expel him
out of <hi>Alexandria: Athanasius</hi> fearing what
might ensue hereof, and that stirs and tumults
might be raised by the common people,<note place="margin">6. Time be hide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself for about the space of four months in

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:42070:187"/>
grew so seditious, that to appease and
satisfie them, <hi>Valens,</hi> though unwilling, was
fain to permit <hi>Athanasius</hi> quietly to enjoy his
Bishoprick: which he did (and the Church of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> peace) unto the end of his days.

wherein he attained unto a competent

unto diligent Meditation in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Nazianz. Orat. 31.</note>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> all the Books both of the Old and New

in the riches, not only of knowledge and
Divine Contemplation, but also of an egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

so that in Learning he went beyond those
that were famous for their Learning, and in

manners were a rule for Bishops, and his

Orthodox Faith:<note place="margin">Nazianz ib.</note> a man of great ability to

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42070:188"/>
and commiseration; withal of most Heroick
magnanimity (inkindled in his brest by the
holy Ghost) to bear any adversity, and of
such invincible courage, that he could not
be broken with any blows of persecution: his
speech was pleasant, but his manners more; of
an Angelical face; yet in his mind more Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical;
he was indeed an exact picture of vertue,
and pattern for Bishops; His skill was great in
the Management of the affairs of the Church,
and an admirable dexterity he had in the
composing of differences and distempers,<note place="margin">Ep. 49. &amp; 51</note>
(unto which his Authority conduced much,
and was of great advantage) as appears by
the addresses that <hi>Basil</hi> made unto him, earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imploring his aid: who stiles him their
only comfort against those evils, and one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by God in the Churches to be the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
for the curing of their maladies; for
which work he was abundantly furnished.
In a word, he was as a Maul or Hammer unto
the Hereticks (<hi>semper Arianis velut murus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitit

calling him a meer creature: which Heresie
he is not charged withal nor was it broached
or maintained by him, but brought in by

Wherein, first, he sets down a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of the Canonical and Non-canonical

was written, whence it had its name, and

which are Pious and Learned, and
therefore most worthy to be read. The
phrase shews them to have been both written
by the same Author; not <hi>Athanasius,</hi> but one
<hi>Maximus</hi> a very Learned Man, many years
after the death of <hi>Athanasius. Scultetus</hi> tells
us that he hath seen the name of <hi>Maximus</hi>
upon a certain old Parchment,<note place="margin">Rivet. Crit. Sac.</note> in which
these Dialogues were wrapt up. This <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
was a <hi>Constantinopolitane</hi> Monk, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

are found only in Latine; and seem to have
been written in that Language, and not
Translated out of the Greek; as appears
partly from the Stile; and partly because the
Author tells us how those things are expressed
by the Greeks, which he wrote in Latine; he
also confutes one <hi>Vrbicus Potentinus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bellar. de scrip. Eccles. Riv. crit. sac.</note> a disciple
or follower of <hi>Eunomius;</hi> which <hi>Athanasius</hi>

               <p>71. A disputation concerning the Faith
held at <hi>Laodicea,</hi> between <hi>Athanasius</hi> and

Counterfeit; nor can it be a true disputation
between those two; for <hi>Athanasius</hi> is here
brought in as a Deacon disputing in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

without doubt are supposititious: for this

this time was <hi>Athanasius</hi> in banishment in

So that both these Epistles, and also the

As also, there are not three incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibles,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:42070:199"/>
nor three uncreated; but one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created,
and one incomprehensible. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
the Father is Almighty, the Son Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
and the holy Ghost Almighty; and
yet they are not three Almighties, but one
Almighty. So, the Father is God, the Son
is God, and the holy Ghost is God; and yet
they are not three Gods, but one God. So
likewise, the Father is Lord, the Son Lord,
and the holy Ghost Lord; and yet not three
Lords, but one Lord. For like as we be
compelled by the Christian verity, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
every Person by himself to be
God and Lord: so are we forbidden by the
Catholick Religion, to say there be three
Gods, or three Lords.</p>
                  <p>The Father is made of none, neither crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
nor begotten. The Son is of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alone; not made, nor created, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
The holy Ghost is of the Father
and of the Son; neither made, nor created,
nor begotten, but proceeding. So there is
one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not
three Sons; one holy Ghost, not three holy
Ghosts. And in this Trinity, none is afore,
or after other, none is greater, or less then
another. But the whole three Persons be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal
together, and coequal. So that in all
things as is aforesaid the Unity in Trinity, and
the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped. He
therefore that will be saved, must thus think
of the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting
salvation; that he also believe rightly in the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:42070:199"/>
incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For
the right faith is, that we believe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of
God, is God and Man. God of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Father begotten before the
worlds: and Man of the substance of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
born in the world. Perfect God, and
perfect Man, of a reasonable soul, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father
as touching his Godhead: and inferior to the
Father, touching his manhood. Who though
he be God and Man, yet is he not two but
one Christ. One, not by conversion of the
Godhead into flesh; but by taking the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
into God. One altogether; not by
confusion of substance; but by unity of
Person. For as the reasonable soul and
flesh is one Man; so God and Man is one
Christ.</p>
                  <p>Who suffered for our salvation; descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into hell; rose again the third day from
the dead: He ascended into heaven; he
fifteth on the right hand of the Father,
God Almighty: from whence he shall
come to judge the quick and the dead. At
whose coming all men shall rise again with
their bodies; and shall give account for
their own works; And they that have done
good, shall go into life everlasting; and
they that have done evil into everlasting fire.
This is the Catholick Faith, which except
a man believe faithfully, he cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

I thought good to give you Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s
apprehensions of them, how they ought to
be understood: His words are these. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
(saith he) they must be interpreted by
their opposition to those heresies that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
the Church,<note place="margin">In his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals.</note> and which were acts of
carnality in them that broach'd and maintain'd
them against the apostolick doctrine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to that foundation which had been
resolved on as necessary to bring the world to
the obedience of Christ, and were therefore
to be anathematiz'd after this manner, and
with detestation branded, and banished out
of the Church. Not that it was hereby defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be a damnable sin to fail in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
or believing the full matter of any
of those explications before they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
and when it might more reasonably
be deemed not to be any fault of the will, to
which this were imputable. Thus he.</p>
                  <p>2. The canonical books of the old and new
Testament owned by him, are the same with
those which the reformed Churches acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
for such, of which he thus speaks. All
scripture of us who are Christians was divinely
inspired.<note place="margin">In Synopsi.</note> The books thereof are not infinite
but finite, and comprehended in a certain
Canon, which having set down of the Old
Testament, (as they are now with us) he adds,
the Canonical books therefore of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:42070:200"/>
are twenty and two, equal for number
unto the Hebrew Letters or alphabet, for so
many elements of Letters there are among the
Hebrews. But (saith he) besides these there
are other books of the Old Testament not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical,
which are read only unto the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens,</hi>
and of these he names, the Wisdom
of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Wisdom of <hi>Iesus</hi> the Son of
<hi>Syrach,</hi> the fragment of <hi>Esther, Iudith,</hi> and
<hi>Tobith,</hi>

no account of them, yet he afterward menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
four books of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> with some
others. He also reckons the Canonical Books
of the New Testament, which (saith he) are
as it were certain sure anchors and supporters
or pillars of our Faith, as having been written
by the Apostles of Christ themselves, who
both conversed with him, and were instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him.</p>
                  <p>3. The sacred and divinely inspired Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
(saith he) are of themselves sufficient
for the discovery of the truth:<note place="margin">Orat. contra idola, et or. 2. contra A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</note> In the reading
whereof this is faithfully to be observed, <hi>viz.</hi>
unto what times they are directed, to what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

things be severed from their reasons, and so
the unskilful, reading any thing different from
them, should deviate from the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

                  <p>4. As touching the way whereby the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Scriptures may be attained,<note place="margin">Lib. de in. carnat. verb. Dei.</note> he
thus speaks. To the searching and true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the Scriptures, there is need of
a holy life, a pure mind, and virtue which is
according to Christ, that the mind running
thorow that path, may attain unto those things
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:42070:201"/>
which it doth desire, as far as humane nature
may understand things divine.</p>
                  <p>5. The holy Scripture (saith he) doth not
contradict it self, for unto a hearer desirous of
truth, it doth interpret it self.</p>
                  <p>6. Concerning the worshipping of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and <hi>Arians,</hi> but we adore the Lord of things
created, the incarnate Word of God, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Flesh be in it self a part of things
created, yet is it made the Body of God:
Neither yet do we give adoration unto such a
body by it self severed from the word, neither
adoring the Word do we put the Word far
from the Flesh, but knowing that it is said, <hi>the
Word was made Flesh,</hi> we acknowledge it even
now in the Flesh to be God.</p>
                  <p>7. He gives this interpretation of those
words of Christ, <hi>Mark. 13. 32. But of that day
and that hour knoweth no man, no not the Angels
which are in heaven, neither the Son but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

the Son of God, lest the divinity should seem
to be ignorant, but simply, neither the Son:
that this might be the ignorance of the Son as
man. And for this cause when he speaks of
the Angels, he added not a higher degree say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
neither the Holy Spirit, but was silent
here, by a double reason affirming the truth
of the thing: for admit that the Spirit knows,
then much more the Word as the Word (from
whom even the Spirit receives) was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of it.</p>
                  <p>8. Speaking of the mystery of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

in Christ;<note place="margin">In orat. Christum esse unum.</note> What need is there (saith he)
of dispute and strife about words? it's more
profitable to believe, and reverence: and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently

do not curiousty inquire why the same is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and impassible, or why God and man:
lest being curiously inquisitive why and how,
I should miss of the good propounded unto us.
For we ought first to believe and adore, and
in the second place to seek from above a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of these things: not from beneath to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of Flesh and Blood, but from divine and
heavenly revelation.</p>
                  <p>9. What the faith of the Church was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Trinity,<note place="margin">Ep. ad Serap. Sp. S. non esse creaturam.</note> he thus delivers. Let us
see that very tradition from the beginning, and
that Doctrine and Faith of the Catholick
Church which Christ indeed gave, but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
preached and kept: For in this Church
are we founded, and whoso falls from thence
cannot be said to be a Christian. The holy
and perfect Trinity therefore in the Father, Son
and Holy Ghost, receives the reason of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
possesseth nothing forraign or superindu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from without, nor consisteth of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and Creature, but the whole is of the
Creator and Maker of all things, like it self and
indivisible, and the operation thereof one.
For the Father by the Word in the holy Spirit
doth all things, and so the unity of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is kept or preserved, and so one God in
the Church is preached, who is above all and
through all and in all: <hi>viz.</hi> above all as the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:42070:202"/>
Father, as the beginning and fountain, but
through all by the Word, moreover in all in
or by the holy Spirit. But the Trinity is not
in name only, or an empty form of speech:
but in truth and reason of subsisting, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
For as the Father is that very thing that
he is, so also the Word God over all, is that
very thing that he is; so also the Holy Ghost
is not any inessential thing, but truly existeth
and subsisteth.</p>
                  <p>10. According to the Ecclesiastical Canons
(saith he) as the Apostle commanded,<note place="margin">Ep. ad Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. in persecut.</note> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being gathered together with the Holy
Ghost, who constitute a Bishop, publickly
and in the presence of the Clergy, craving a
Bishop, inquisition ought to be made, and so
all things canonically performed.</p>
                  <p>11. Concerning the lawfulness of flight in
time of persecution,<note place="margin">Apol. ad Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>at. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantium.</note> he thus speaks. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
me to flight not for fear of death, lest
any should accuse me of timidity, but that I
might obey the precept of our Saviour whose
command it is that we should make use of
flight against persecutors, of hiding places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those that search for us, lest if we should
offer our selves unto open danger, we should
more sharply provoke the fury of our persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
Verily it is all one both for a man to
kill himself, and to proffer himself unto the
enemies to be slain: but he that flees as the
Lord commands, knows the Articles of the
time, and truly provides for his persecutors:
lest being carried out even to the shedding of
blood, they should become guilty of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that forbids murther. Again concerning
the same thing;</p>

                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:42070:202"/>

unto all in general,<note place="margin">De fuga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

should they be precipitate and rash in tempting
the Lord, but must wait until the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of dying do come, or that the Judge
do determine something concerning them, as
shall seem good unto him: But yet would he
have us always ready, when either the time
calls for it, or we are apprehended to contend
for the Church even unto death. These things
did the blessed Martyrs observe, who while
they lay hid did harden themselves, but being
found out they did undergo Martyrdom. Now
if some of them did render themselves unto
their persecutors, they were not thorough
rashness moved so to do, but every where
professed unto all men, that this promptness
and offering of themselves did proceed from
the Holy Ghost.</p>

§ 6. The defects and blemishes of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Father and Champion of Jesus Christ,
were neither so many nor so gross, as are to
be found in most of the Ancients that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him: yet was he not altogether free but
liable to error as well as others, as appears
from somewhat of this kind that dropt from
his pen, which were especially such passages
as these in his genuine works, for as for the
apparently supposititious, I shall forbear to
meddle with them, having in them so much

§ 7. As touching his death, it was very
remarkable in this regard: that in the midst
of a most vehement storm and tempest (the
cruel persecution under the Emperour <hi>Valens</hi>)
he should so quietly arrive at the haven. For
being forc'd to hide himself (as hath been said)
in his Fathers monument about the space of
four months, the people that greatly loved
him, and had him in very high esteem, grew
so impatient of his absence from them, that
they began to be tumultuous, threatning to
burn the ships and publick edifices, unless <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi>
were permitted to return unto them
again.<note place="margin">Socrat. lib. 4. c. 16.</note> The Emperour hereupon fearing what
the issue might be, gave way to their fury (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a hot and hasty kind of people) and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to enjoy his Bishoprick again, from that
time tempering himself from troubling <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
and the Country of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> By this
means it came to pass,<note place="margin">In vita ejus ab incerto Authore.</note> that after so long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and sweat for Christ, so many encounters
for the Orthodox faith, so frequent and famous
flights and banishments, having given many
things in charge unto <hi>Peter</hi> his successor, he
did at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in peace and a good old age,<note place="margin">Osiard. ep. hist. Eccles.</note>
pass from this vale of trouble unto the rest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,

profiting as he desired, (which made him to
doubt whether he should ever attain unto
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:42070:205"/>
that which he aimed at) he left the Schools,
purposing to fall upon some other course: and
passing along by a certain well in the way,
walled up with great stone, he observed that
those stones were much worn and hollowed
in some places, by the often rubbing of the
Rope upon them, wherewith they used to
draw the water: Hereupon he fell into this
consideration with himself: if this Cord, that
is much softer, hath by frequency of fretting
made this hard stone hollow; then surely
may I also, by continuance of time, both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and perfect or accomplish my desire:
Accordingly, he betook him again unto the
Schools, where by assiduity and constancy in
study he at length became a most Learned and
accurate Scholar.</p>
               <p>He seems to have been at first an Ethnick,<note place="margin">Cent. 4. c. 10</note>
at what time perceiving and considering with
himself how vain the opinions and conceits
were which the Philosophers had of the gods,
musing much hereupon, he at length light
upon the books of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hilar. de Trinit. l. 1.</note> the Prophets, and
the Apostles, by the diligent perusal whereof
he came to the knowledge of the truth, and
to embrace the Christian Religion; being
now well stricken in years: yet in a short
time did he so much profit in the Doctrine
of Christianity,<note place="margin">Bellar. de scrip. Eccles.</note> that he was deservedly esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a chief Doctor and pillar of the Catholick
Church.</p>
               <p>His Country men, coming to understand
of his great worth, soon advanced him unto
a high degree of dignity; though a married
man, he being by them chosen to be Bishop
of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> chief City of the Province of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctou.</hi>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:42070:206"/>
About this time, the persecution under
the Emperor <hi>Constantius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bin concil. tom. 1.</note> grew very hot; in
so much that many eminent Bishops for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fast and sticking close unto the Catholick
Faith, were exiled and driven into banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Hereupon <hi>Hilary</hi> with divers other

(yet after this was he sor heinous

to be congregatted at <hi>Byterris,</hi> and at <hi>Arles</hi>
Cities of <hi>France,</hi> unto which the Catholick
Bishops should be forced to come: <hi>Hilary,</hi>
being one of those who were present in these
Synods, fearing least by the subtilty of the
<hi>Arians</hi> (as was their manner) the Orthodox
through simplicity might be circumvented,
offereth a libel to be read, wherein the close
conveyances, crafty fetches, and blasphemous
Heresies of the <hi>Arians</hi> were laid open and
discovered unto all. But the adversaries
withstanding the Reading thereof, prevailed
so far, that <hi>Hilary</hi> refusing to subscribe unto
their ambiguous and captious contessions and
decrees (for he was very circumspect and
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:42070:206"/>
quick sighted to discern and avoid their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
devices and impostures) was banished
into <hi>Phrygia</hi> in the East, where he continued
for the space of three whole years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>In the fourth year of his banishment,<note place="margin">Sulp. Sever. lib. 2.</note> the
Emperor commands a Synod of the Eastern
Bishops to assemble,<note place="margin">Bin. Tom. 1. Concil.</note> at <hi>Seleucia</hi> a City of
<hi>Isauria,</hi> (about the time that those of the West
met at <hi>Ariminum</hi>) at the which <hi>Hilary</hi> was
compelled by the Emperors deputy, to be
present among the rest: this the Officers did
by vertue of a General Command that they
had received, for the convening of all the
Bishops, having no particular order concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Hilary:</hi> which yet came to pass, not
without the special hand of God so disposing
it, that a man so well instructed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Divine Truth, should be present,
when matters of faith were to be disputed of.
Being come, and received with a great deal
of respect by the Orthodox the minds of all
being toward him; they first demanded of
him, what was the Faith of the <hi>Gallicane</hi>
Churches, (for by the false reports of the
<hi>Arians,</hi> they were suspected by the Eastern
Bishops to be tained with the Heresie of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius:</hi>)
wherein having given them good
satisfaction, and shewed them that in the
Faith they agreed with the Council of
<hi>Nice,</hi> he was taken into their society, and
added unto the Council: in the which, the
<hi>Arians</hi> after much debate, were condemned
by those that were but little better, being
Half-<hi>Arians.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:42070:207"/>
Some are sent unto the Emperor, to give
him an account of what had passed in the
Synod.<note place="margin">Ibid. Sulpit. Sever.</note> Whither being come (those, who
had been condemned, going thither also,
presuming upon the strength of their party,
and the Emperors favor, who was of their
faction) they there found the delegates of
the Orthodox partly that had met at <hi>Arimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi>
who, partly through fear of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
and partly through the fallacy of the
<hi>Arians,</hi> were compelled to joyn in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Hereticks, there having been
delivered unto them a specious form of the
Faith, wrapt-up in fallacious terms and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
which indeed seemed to be Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
but had the contrary doctrine closely
couched under them.</p>
               <p>Unto this, the Emperor required those of
the Council of <hi>Seleucia</hi> to subscribe, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
banishment unto them that refused so to
do: in so much as the greater part were
drawn to yield hereunto, some by one means,
and some by another. <hi>Hilary</hi> being present
with the Emperor, waiting upon him to
know his mind whether he should again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into exile or no; and seeing the Faith
in so much danger, the Western Bishops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and the Eastern deterred, and both
overcome: he did most importunately by
three petitions crave audience, and that he
might be permitted to dispute the matter in
controversie with the adversaries: which the
<hi>Arians</hi> shunned and altogether refused. At
length <hi>Hilary</hi> is commanded (as being the
seminary of discord and disturber of the East)
to return into <hi>France</hi> again.</p>

There are extant to this day these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
books, which are generally conceived to
be his.</p>
                  <p>1. Twelve books of the Trinity against the
<hi>Arians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cent. 4. c. 10. Chemnit. in or. de lect patrum.</note> which he wrote when he was banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>Phrygia,</hi> being the first among the La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tine
Fathers that dealt upon this subject: A
work in this regard of no small advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Reader,<note place="margin">Erasm. in ep. ant. Hilar.</note> that therein he expounds divers
places not a little obscure, in the Gospel of
<hi>Iohn</hi> and Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> no less happily than
accurately.<note place="margin">Erasm. ibid.</note> The first of these books as it seems
he writ last, for it contains an account or sum
of the whole work, setting down particularly
the subjects or contents of each of the other
books.<note place="margin">Socrat. h. l. 5. c. 12. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. l. 3. c. 14.</note> It is an elaborate piece, of much
strength, and commended even by the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
themselves.</p>
                  <p>2. Three books or Apologues unto <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
the Emperour,<note place="margin">Cent. 4. c. 10.</note> who much favoured the
faction of the <hi>Ariaus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In epist. ant. Hiiar.</note> All which <hi>Erasmus</hi>
thinks to be imperfect, for (saith he) they
promise something exact and laborious, but
perform not accordingly, being as it were sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
silent. The first of these he conceives
to have been written after the death of that
Emperour, because he therein deals more freely
and sharply with him; whereas in the other
two he is more fair and moderate, <hi>Baronius</hi>
supposeth the first as well as the two later, to
have been written while the Emperour was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
and therefore that the book mentioned
by <hi>Ierome</hi> to be written after the death of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In catalog.</note>
is not now extant; because he saith
that by this free confession, he tended to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,
whereunto he exhorteth others by
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:42070:211"/>
the like liberty of speaking, which would have
seemed ridiculous if the persecutor had been
now dead.<note place="margin">De script. Eccless.</note> But (saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) perhaps
these different opinions may be reconciled, by
thus saying: That at the Writing of the first
Epistle, <hi>Hilary</hi> thought him to have been dead,
though indeed he were then alive.</p>
                  <p>3. His book against the <hi>Arians</hi> or aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Cent. 4. c. 10.</note> written unto the
Bishops and people detesting the <hi>Arian</hi> heresie:
which by <hi>Ierom</hi> is stiled an elegant book:<note place="margin">In catalog.</note>
wherein he accuseth the said Bishop as infected
with <hi>Arianism.</hi> To which is annexed an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
of <hi>Auxentius,</hi> wherein he cleareth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as not guilty of the crime laid to his
charge.</p>
                  <p>4. His book of Synods unto the Bishops of
<hi>France,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Erasm. ant. Hilar. epist.</note> whom he congratulates that in the
midst of so great tumults as are in the world,
they had kept themselves free from the <hi>Arian</hi>
faction; wherein he declares in what meetings
of the Bishops the <hi>Arian</hi> heresie had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
This book (as himself testifieth) he
translated out of <hi>Greek,</hi> but with this liberty
that neglecting the words he kept still to the
sense, and where the place invites him so to
do,<note place="margin">In or. de lect parr. ante loc. com.</note> he adds and intermingles somewhat of
his own. Of which, <hi>Chemnitius</hi> thus speaks.
He gathered together (saith he) the opinions

            <p>THis Treatise which hath lain dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant
by me for several years, was
dispatch'd and put out of hand,
before Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi>'s book of the
Writings of <hi>Dyonisius Areopagitae</hi> and <hi>Ignatius
Antiochenus</hi> saw the light, and had it then
passed the press (as it was very near to have
done) I had been saved this labour, and no
contest had happened between the very learn'd
<hi>Dallee</hi> and my self. But coming to a view of
it, when mine was adventuring into the world,
I thought my self concerned to say somewhat
(and much it shall not be) in vindication of
the Epistles of that holy Martyr <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as
being at least in part genuine, and not wholly
supposititious; though it cannot be denied that
both he and they have been not a little abused
by bold and dis-inngenuous persons.</p>
            <p>Having therefore perused what the perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> hath done upon this subject,
I find that therein he hath given sufficient
proof of his singular learning, judgment and
industry: And had his great pains been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to and level'd at, the further discovery
of the vile injury that hath bern offered to the
worthy monuments of that famous Martyr
and primitive Pishop, and not the utter extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:42070:218"/>
of them, his undertaking might have
proved much more acceptable and successful.
He herein follows his Coaetanian Countrymen
<hi>Salmasius</hi> and <hi>Blondel;</hi> and of the more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
(who yet were Eight hundred years after
Christ) <hi>Nicephorus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
and <hi>Anastasius</hi> the Library keeper at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
these are the principal whom he names to have
been of the same mind with himself herein,
though the greatest part of learned men go a
contrary way unto him.</p>
            <p>The method he proceeds in is this: 1. He
endeavours to make out the imposture (as he
apprehends it to be) by no less than sixty six
Arguments, drawn from the Ancients making
no mention of these Epistles, especially such
as preceded <hi>Eusebius:</hi> as also from divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
and passages found in them, which
we cannot imagine should ever drop from the
Pen of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> 2. He undertakes to answer
the arguments and objections against it, made
by those that dissent from him herein.</p>
            <p>In answer to the first Argument drawn from
the silence of the Ancients making no mention
of them: Besides what the learned Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
hath said, <hi>viz.</hi> That he is clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of positives, whoever would make use
of Negatives, and saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> arguments
negatively drawn from authority conclude
nothing: both these sayings Mr. <hi>Dalle</hi> sets
down, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. I would offer to conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>1. That it is more than probable that <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
did write Epistles: this Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> seems
to grant: 'tis not question'd (saith he) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote Epistles, (for who is so
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:42070:218"/>
foolish to deny that he writ some) but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he wrote those that are carried about. p.
450. Again, why do we not follow that
which is most likely, to wit, that the impostor
having learned that some Epistles were of old
written by <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and perceiving that they
were now wanting, took counsel from thence
to feign and put forth his own under the same
name. <hi>p.</hi> 454. To which he subjoyns these
words of the learned <hi>Petavius,</hi> I verily deny
not that the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpolated
and changed by the addition of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
things, and depraved; and that some are
supposititious: But that no Epistles at all were
written by <hi>Ignatius,</hi> I verily think to be too
rashly affirmed. p. 230. Now if he did write
Epistles, we cannot but suppose that those of
his time who had him in so high esteem, would
with utmost care preserve them, and not suffer
through their negligence so precious a
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be lost: And if so, what hinders
why these now remaining should not (at least
in part) be some of them?</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis known that the Ancients do but
seldom make use of the writings of those that
went before them, and when they do so they
do it many times without naming the Author
from whom the passages are borrowed. So
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> is wont (saith Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi>) to bring
and recite the sayings and sentences of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
men more ancient than himself, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, whether written or by lively voice,
without naming the Authors. p. 266. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> in his treatise of the right use
of the Fathers, <hi>lib. 1. Chap.</hi> 6. p. 103. If the
Fathers (saith he) would have but taken the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:42070:219"/>
pains to have given us notice every time, who
the Author was whose opinion they alledged,
this manner of commenting upon the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
would have been much more beneficial
to us and less troublesome. But this they
very seldom do, as you may observe out of
the expositions of <hi>Hilary, Ambrose</hi> and others
who robbing poor <hi>Origen</hi> without any mercy,
do not yet do him the honour so much as to
name him scarcely. From the Ancients not
mentioning the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> therefore,
to infer that they are none of his, is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequent,
seeing this was a practice very
usual with them.</p>
            <p>3. We find that <hi>Polycarp</hi> who lived at the
same time with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as also <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and
<hi>Origen,</hi> (who were all before <hi>Eusebius</hi>) do
make use of some passages in those Epistles:
And the double testimony (saith Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi>
p. 458.) of <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> prevail'd
with <hi>Eusebius</hi> so far, that he doubted not but
that it was <hi>Ignatius</hi> his work. It is true that
the Arguments drawn from hence by the most
reverend <hi>Vsser,</hi> and learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> labours to enervate as of no sorce:
but of what strength his solutions are we shall
make some tryal by and by: And thus much
for his first argument drawn from the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
not mentioning, as he pretends, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
of <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As to his second Argument fetched from
the expressions and passages found in them,
which cannot be conceived to have come from
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> but have been inserted by some lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hand: To this it may be answered, that
many of these (and too many of them have
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:42070:219"/>
crept into <hi>Ignatius</hi> his epistles) have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and made mention of by others: though
the diligent and quicksighted Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> hath
taken notice of and discovered many more.
The first discoverers of the imposture from
thence concluded (as well they might) that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oul hands had been tampering with and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing
them: (and who of the most eminent
Ancients have not been so dealt with by
wretched men; that so those worthies might
seem to own some errors, which by this means
these hucksters seek to impose upon the world,
and would fain that they should be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by unwary Readers) but yet did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this to be a sufficient ground altogether
to disclaim and reject them, as not written
by <hi>Ignatius: Et gradus non alterat speciem.</hi>
And had Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> proceeded no further up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his more narrow inspection into, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyal
of the fraud of those interpolators, good
might have been done by his laudable pains,
and the mischief of the deceit more fully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
But Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> seems to have been
too much swayed by <hi>Nicephorus P. C.</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastasius</hi>
the Roman Library keeper, whom he
follows herein, who upon this only account
(as <hi>Vsser</hi> thinks) because they were interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and corrupted, did rank these Epistles
in the number of <hi>Apochryphals:</hi> as Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi>
tells us p. 251. Though the instances produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> (too many here to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated)
be looked on and yielded to have been
since added by unworthy interpolators, yet
may there be so much found remaining, as
may make up those Epistles as they came out
of the hands of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> those Epistles of his
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:42070:220"/>
reckoned to be genuine, being much shorter
in the time of <hi>Eusebius</hi> than they are at this
day. The interpolations therefore are no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
warrant for their utter rejection. <hi>Petav.</hi>
p. 229.</p>
            <p>The second branch of this discourse consists
of his answer made to the Arguments of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters,
wherein they shew that the Ancients
before <hi>Eusebius,</hi> did make use of divers passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
from <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and therefore is his pretence
of their silence in this regard of no sorce to
annul the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their first argument is drawn from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of <hi>Polycarp</hi> his contemporary, which
is found in his Epistle to the <hi>Philippians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> returns this solution.
1. That that Epistle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> is apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chryphal.
<hi>Answ.</hi> Those whose judgment this
is, are the aforesaid <hi>Nicephorus P. C.</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastasius
Bibli. R.</hi> who follows <hi>Nicephorus</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> owns, p. 250. f. so that upon
the matter it amounts to no more than one
single testimony; against which we may well
oppose the contrary judgment of <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
much more ancient than they who mention
that passage of <hi>Polycarp, (viz.</hi> that he had sent
them as many Epistles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> as he had by
him) as contained in his Epistle to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi>
without any hesitation of its being
his. <hi>hist. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 32. and quotes <hi>Irenaeus,
lib. 3. cap.</hi> 3. as owning it to be his: Thus,
there is (saith he) extant an Epistle of <hi>Polycarp</hi>
unto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> very profitable <hi>&amp;c. hist.
lib. 4. cap.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solut.</hi> 2. The Author (saith Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi>)
of that particle in <hi>Polycarps</hi> epistle, (<hi>viz.</hi> of
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:42070:220"/>
               <hi>Ignatius</hi> himself, and those that are with him,
signifie what ye know for certain) intimates
that when he writ it <hi>Ignatius</hi> was living, but
the Author of the Epistle most plainly affirms,
(using the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) that he was
dead: Therefore wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it inserted into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
by some other.</p>
            <p>Answ. 1. Were it so; yet this makes not the
whole Epistle Apocryphal but only corrupted,
as those of <hi>Ignatius</hi> have also been, for which
cause <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and <hi>Anastasius</hi> reject them:
and upon the same reason, as Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,
do they conclude that the Epistle of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp</hi>
also is Apocryphal, p. 429. m. but how
weakly, judge. And for this particle inserted
Mr. <hi>Dallee, ibid.</hi> thinks it no crime to say, that
those Epistles, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which in this
Epistle of <hi>Polycarp</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> are said
to be collected by him, were not collected by
<hi>Polycarp,</hi> a conjecture but slenderly bottom'd.
Yea Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> grants that if those words put
in by the impostor be left out, all the rest of
the Epistle agrees with the judgment of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
one of the Successors of <hi>Anastasius</hi> in the
Patriarchship who saith: There was read the
Epistle of <hi>Polycarp</hi> unto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> full
of many admonitions, with plainness and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.
p. 429. m. It seems by this that <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
(a most learned Writer as Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> there
stiles him) did not account that Epistle to be
Apocryphal, nor did the judgment of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor
sway him herein, which therefore he
did not look on as of so much weight as Mr.
<hi>Dallee</hi> esteems it to be.</p>
            <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> tells us that it is
apparent that the particle contained in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:42070:221"/>
(wherein is mentioned that a collection
of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his epistles was made by <hi>Polycarp</hi>)
was inserted by the impostor, whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
that the collection was not made by
him: It seems not to be so apparent, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that particle not to be be so coherent with
the preceding clause, as Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> conceives,
yet we know how usual it is in the close of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,
to add somewhat beside the main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
of them occasionally. Besides, all
that he gathers from the seeming incoherence
is only this; that those words seem to have
been rashly and beside the mind of the Author
sown on by some other hand: and if any thing
were added, saith he, by the Author beside
the above mentioned words, I should believe
that those last words which follow after the
place objected against, (<hi>viz. Scripsistis mihi et
vos &amp; Ignatius, &amp;c.</hi> where he speaks of the
collection of the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> made by
him) were the words that were added. p. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>7.
So, saith he, expunging all that which is said
of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Epistles, the whole clause
of the Epistle would run decently. Thus he
p. 427. And what amounts all this conjecture
unto, but only this that from the seeming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherence
of that particle with the foregoing
words, it seems to him and he believes, and
p. 429. 'Tis his opinion concerning the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
place in <hi>Polycarp</hi>'s Epistle, that that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
was added by the impostor. Let the
Reader now judge whether these conjectural
apprehensions of his be sufficient to invalidate
<hi>Polycarps</hi> testimony of the Epistles of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what can be imagined that the impostor
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:42070:221"/>
should have in his eye, in adding this particle
to <hi>Polycarp's</hi> Epistle? seeing it hath nothing in
it, beside a commendation of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,
but some particular affairs: what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
could he gain by such an abuse? Oh
much, saith Mr. <hi>Dallee:</hi> the impostor (whom
I think we need not look far for) is even he
without doubt, whom we have hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
by many and manifest proofs to
have substituted, feigning the name of <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
Epistles framed by himself to the holy
Martyr. This is indeed said by Mr. <hi>Dallee,</hi>
but how doth it appear that he is the man?
and if he framed <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles, then all
or only some of them: All he could not, for
some were extant before <hi>Eusebius</hi> his time,
who mentions divers of them. <hi>lib. 3. cap.</hi> 33.
and he lived. <hi>an.</hi> 326. And the second colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
being six in number, was made (as the
Reverend <hi>Vsser</hi> conjectures) <hi>Ann.</hi> 580. or,
as the publisher of the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
thinks, <hi>ann.</hi> 630. So the space of time
between those mentioned by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> if col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
but in his time, and the second collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is by the former computation. 254. years,
and by the latter 304. years, a time too long
to imagine the impostor to have lived. If he
were the forger but of some only, 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of which? and of this I suppose it
will be found somewhat a knotty difficulty to
determine. Besides, if some only be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors,
then the remainder must be of some
other, and if so why not of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> being
the commonly reputed father of them.</p>
            <p>2. That the Author of the Epistle saith
plainly that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was then dead, is not so
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:42070:222"/>
plainly to be found therein. For those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
<hi>viz.</hi> That he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and
had finished the least act of his conflict, do not
necessarily imply so much, but might be made
use of upon this account, because he had been
condemned, and was under the sentence of
death, being now also in the way to his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for such are dead in law and looked on
as in that state: as that Phrase holds out, <hi>Psal.
79. 11. According to the greatness of thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
preserve thou those that are appointed to
dye,</hi> or as the Margin reads, <hi>the children of
death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The second Argument or objection
made by the dissenters, is drawn from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> who in his fifth book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
heresies, towards the end hath these
words: As one of our own, who for the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of God, was adjudged to the beasts;
said, I am the Wheat of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solut. Irenaeus</hi> saith not that he wrote those
words, but only that he spake so: Then it
cannot be gathered that he saw any writing of
<hi>Ignatius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> denotes indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
both the thing uttered by the voice, and
those delivered in writing also: so <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 12.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: one of themselves even a prophet of
their own, said, this was written by <hi>Epime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
the Poet. So then notwithstanding the
expression <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he might have that sentence
from some writing of <hi>Ignatius. 2. Ierom</hi> and
others report, that those words were uttered
by him, when he was adjudged to the beasts,
which was no small while before he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
them. For after his sentence pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:42070:222"/>
he was led from <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> a long
journey, wherein he writ his genuine Epistles,
of which that to the <hi>Romans</hi> was one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the words pronounced by him: So
that probable it is that he spake those words
more than once, between the time of his being
sentenced aud executed; and therefore may
well be conceived to have made mention of
them in an Epistle.</p>
            <p>2. Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> concludes that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> never
saw or knew of any Epistle of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he brings the Authority of such as were
Elders before him, and disciples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
against the error of <hi>Florinus</hi> and of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp</hi>
by name; but mentions not <hi>Ignatius.
Answ.</hi> 1. His not mentioning of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> is
but a slender argument to prove that he saw
not any Epistle of his, he might have some
reason unknown to us of this his silence.
2. <hi>Ignatius</hi> is no less contained in the word
Elders, than <hi>Polycarp:</hi> for he saith in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
that <hi>Florinus</hi> never had his doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to him from those Elders, the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Apostles: which expression (El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders)
comprehends and may be understood of
<hi>Ignatius</hi> as well as <hi>Polycrap,</hi> who were both
the Disciples of the Apostle <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. In that
fragment of his Epistle to <hi>Florinus,</hi> he saith
this only of <hi>Polycarp:</hi> I, saith he, saw thee
<hi>Florinus,</hi> when I was yet a boy with <hi>Polycarp</hi>
in the lesser <hi>Asia, &amp;c.</hi> and then adds, if that
holy and Apostolick Elder had heard any such
thing, he would streight have stopp'd his ears.</p>
            <p>This therefore is but a weak Proof that he
never saw any of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his epistles: but
rather the contrary, he being as well as <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp</hi>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:42070:223"/>
comprehended in the name Elders.</p>
            <p>2. Because where he mentions the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Anicetus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>Polycarp,</hi> about the observation of <hi>Easter,</hi> he
speaks not a word of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that peremptory saying of his (in his
Epistle to the <hi>Philippians</hi>) that if any one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<hi>Easter</hi> with the <hi>Iews,</hi> he is partaker
with those that slew the Lord and his Apostles:
<hi>Anicetus</hi> might well have objected this to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp.</hi>
p. 270. <hi>Answ.</hi> You have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to say that the Epistle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi>
was altogether unknown to <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> because
he made not use of this passage to <hi>Anicetus:</hi>
for 'tis conceived that those words fell not
from the Pen of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but were since foist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in by some one that corrupted that Epistle:
we grant that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> never read those words
there, nor could he well, seeing they were
not at that time there to be found: Yet might
he see that Epistle as it came out of the hands
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which had no such blemish
in it.</p>
            <p>3. Because he is of a contrary mind unto
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> about the time of Christs abode up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth: <hi>Ignatius</hi> rightly conceiving that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
baptized about the thirtieth year of his
Age, he remained on earth but three Passovers
after that time: whereas <hi>Irenaeus</hi> thinks that
he taught to his fortieth or fiftieth year.
<hi>Answ. 1. Irenaeus</hi> was not bound to follow
<hi>Ignatius</hi> in every thing, if he had a peculiar
apprehension of his own in this matter, what
eminent men have not in some things had the
like, wherein yet sometimes they have been
in the wrong? 2. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> erring herein,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:42070:223"/>
thought he had reason for his opinion. Mr. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
lib. 4. §. 13. de descensu.</hi> speaks in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.
This tradition, saith he, of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in it a certain shew of truth, and seems to
have a foundation from the Scriptures: He,
<hi>i. e.</hi> Christ was called Master, and had the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
age of a Master; he came to save every
Age, therefore he passed through every one:
thou art not yet fifty year old, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 65.
therefore was he forty or upward: for the Jews
lyed not, or missed, twenty years. Also <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
brings in men of great name for Authors,
namely the Elders which had lived with <hi>Iohn</hi>
in <hi>Asia.</hi> He quotes for this <hi>Iren. lib. 2. cap.
39.</hi> 40. No marvel then that he was mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and his dissent from <hi>Ignatius</hi> herein, is
but of little strength to prove, that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unacquainted with <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
I may here make use of Mr. <hi>Dallee's</hi>
words, <hi>cap. 9. p.</hi> 282. where speaking of the
disagreement of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> from
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> about the time of Christs preaching
after his baptism, (whereas <hi>Ignatius</hi> saith it
was three years, <hi>Clemens</hi> saith it was but one)
he hath this passage: If <hi>Clemens</hi> had known
the judgment of so great a man as <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
without doubt he either for his piety would
have followed it, or for his learning he would
certainly have brought reasons and confirm'd
it, why he thought not that to be followed:
thus he. And this we find <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to have done
<hi>viz.</hi> To have produced reasons.</p>
            <p>3. The third Argument or objection made
by the dissenters, is drawn from the testimony
of <hi>Origen,</hi> in whom are to be seen two passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of <hi>Ignatius</hi> that are found in his Epistles:
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:42070:224"/>
the former in <hi>bom. in Luc. cap.</hi> 6. where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> I, saith he, found written in
an epistle of his, that the virginity of <hi>Mary</hi>
was hidden from the Prince of this world, <hi>epist.
ad Ephes.</hi> The latter out of his prologue to his
commentary on the <hi>Canticles:</hi> where he thus
speaks. I remember that one of the Saints spake
thus of Christ; <hi>My love was crucified.</hi> So<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solut.</hi> The latter of these passages, he saith,
that he spake but not that he writ so. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.
The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies speaking either with
the voice, or by writing: As doth also the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the same import: as <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28.
As some of your own Poets have said <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
instancing in a saying of <hi>Aratus,</hi> in his Poem
entituled <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> 2. He might both speak &amp;
write so too, see his answer to his Solution of
the first argument from the testimony of <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.
2. Solut.</hi> Each place, saith he, alledged out of
<hi>Origen,</hi> is of uncertain and doubtful Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If those places be dubious, then
the passages of <hi>Ignatius</hi> might be reported by
<hi>Origen</hi> as well as not: And the Authority is
of equal strength for the Affirmative or Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
nothing certain can be concluded from
them. 2. <hi>Erasmus</hi> his censure (which you
produce who thinks it none of his) is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible:
and <hi>Merlin</hi> (to whose pains we are
beholding for one edition of <hi>Origen,</hi> who
therefore should be acquainted with his works)
is very confident that these commentaries are
<hi>Origen's</hi> 3. The reason for which they are
judged to be the work of some Latine Author,
seems not to be so cogent, <hi>viz.</hi> because some
Greek words are interpreted by Latine: For
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:42070:224"/>
this he might do for the help of those that
might not so well understand some Greek
words; which therefore needed explication.
Besides it is known that for <hi>Origen</hi>'s works,
although he wrote them in Greek, yet have
we scarcely any of them at this day, but only
in Latine; except his excellent answer to <hi>Celsus</hi>
in eight books. Therefore these interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of divers Greek words by Latine; and the
saying that such a Latine word or expression
is rendred so or so in the Greek, may be done
by the Translators of his works, which is most
likely: from whence therefore it cannot be
inferred that those Commentaries are none of
<hi>Origen's.</hi> 4. For his homilies on <hi>Luke</hi> they
are not mentioned by either <hi>Cook</hi> or <hi>Rivet</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Tracts falsely ascribed to <hi>Origen;</hi>
which doubtless they would, and (in such a
work, their censure) they ought to have done,
had they judged them not to be <hi>Origens.
5. Ierom</hi> the interpreter of these Homilies on
<hi>Luke</hi> thinks them to be <hi>Origens,</hi> but a birth of
his younger years, and not so elaborate, for
some errors sprinkled amongst them. <hi>Sixt.
Senens. in Biblioth.</hi> which errors, as <hi>Merlin</hi> i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magines,
were inserted by those that envied
him. So that notwithstanding what is said
by Mr. <hi>Dallee,</hi> those sayings of <hi>Ignatius</hi> may
have been related by <hi>Origen,</hi> which he might
be acquainted with from his Epistles.</p>
            <p>4. The fourth Argument or objection made
by the dissenters, is drawn from the testimony
of <hi>Eusebius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> who in his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siatical
History, <hi>lib. 3. cap.</hi> 32. mentions six
Epistles of <hi>Ignatius:</hi> So the Reverend <hi>Vsser</hi>
accounts them, making that to the Church
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:42070:225"/>
of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and to <hi>Polycarp</hi> their Bishop to be
the same, but others reckon seven, judging
that to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and that to <hi>Polycarp</hi> to be two
distinct Epistles: These six or seven (saith
Mr. <hi>Dallee p.</hi> 442.) we confess that <hi>Eusebius</hi>
acknowledgeth and holds them to be truly the
Epistles of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> To these Mr. <hi>Dallee's</hi>
Solutions are.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Solut.</hi> His testimony is of no force being
of a man that was two hundred years later
than <hi>Ignatius. Answ.</hi> 1. The Epistles of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
might well be preserved unto that time:
many mens writings have remained many
hundred years longer. 2. If so, then might
<hi>Eusebius</hi> well come to the sight of them though
others not; being a man so inquisitive after
books, and <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his intimate compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
most studious and diligent in erecting the
Library at <hi>Cesarea,</hi> and searching after books:
So <hi>Ierom. Iulius Africanus</hi> began a well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
Library in the University of <hi>Caesarea,</hi>
(saith <hi>Middendorp</hi> of Academyes <hi>lib.</hi> 2.) which
<hi>Pamphilus</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> so enriched, that there
is not a more famous one in the whole Earth.
Being then so intimately acquainted with
<hi>Pamphilus</hi> (as that he added his name to his
own, being called <hi>Eusebius Pamphili</hi>) and
assistant with him (who was very curious to
find out the writings of those that went before

epist. ad Philip.</hi>) are such, that from them
you may reap great profit, for they contain
faith, patience, and all edification pertaining
to our Lord. Here then <hi>Eusebius</hi> might come
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:42070:225"/>
to see and peruse them, if he had them not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his own store. 3. The work he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
and accomplished, (<hi>viz.</hi> The compiling
of an Ecclesiastical History, wherein no one
had gone before him) required that he should
be supplyed with fitting furniture for such an
enterprise: who therefore being most inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
after the chief monuments of antiquity,
doubtless would not neglect so choice a
relique as those epistles, that might contribute
not a little to his intended design. So that if
<hi>Ignatius</hi> writ any epistles, (and, saith Mr.
<hi>Dallee</hi> it were a foolish part in any to deny that
he did, <hi>p.</hi> 450.) who was more likely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them (reserved with utmost care by those
that lived with him, as <hi>Polycarp</hi> and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to whom he sent them) than <hi>Eusebius,</hi> so
conducing to his purpose?</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Solut.</hi> He leans, saith Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> upon a
broken Reed, <hi>viz.</hi> the two passages in <hi>Polycarp</hi>
and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> which are falsly said to be found
in them, as hath been made to appear. <hi>Answ.</hi>
But we have shewed before that the allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from them are a ground sufficient to prove
that for which they were produced, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I refer you to what hath been said hereof
already.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Solut.</hi> He evidently overthrows this his
opinion by somewhat laid down by himself
elsewhere, (which Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> stiles his Golden
Rule) which is this, that no books inscribed
with the names of the Ancients, are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for true, but only those whose testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
were made use of by men, either of the
same or certainly of the next memory or Age,
<hi>Euseb. lib. 3. c. 34. Answ. Eusebius</hi> his words
are these: speaking of the second Epistle of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) we
have to learn, saith he, that there is a second e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
of <hi>Clement</hi> which was not so received and
approved of as the former,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dallee</hi> page 444.</note> seeing we find not
that the Elders (or Ancients) did use it. Now
the question may be what use of it <hi>Eusebius</hi>
means? Not that which Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> intends, <hi>viz.</hi>
their alledging of it in their writings; but the
publick reading of it in the Churches: for so
<hi>Eusebius</hi> records of his first epistle. One un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Epistle, saith he, of his there is extant,
both worthy and notable, which he wrote from
<hi>Rome</hi> unto <hi>Corinth,</hi> when sedition was raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> the same epistle we have
known to have been read publickly in many
Churches both of old and amongst us also, <hi>hist.
l. 3. c.</hi> 14. Again, saith he, <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>
writing an epistle to the <hi>Romans, viz.</hi> unto
<hi>Soter</hi> their Bishop, remembreth the Epistle of
<hi>Clement</hi> thus: we have, saith he, this day so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniz'd
the holy Sunday, in which we have
read your Epistle and always will for instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
sake, even as we do the former of <hi>Clement</hi>
written unto us, <hi>hist, l. 4. c.</hi> 22, So that <hi>Eusebius</hi>
his golyen rule (as your term it) being thus
misunderstood by you, proves in its right sence,
as no way advantageous unto you, so no whit
at all prejudicial unto him.</p>
            <p>Thus have I spoken a word in the behalf of
<hi>Ignatius</hi>'s his epistles, which notwithstanding
what hath been said by the learned Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi>
do not appear to be altogether supposititious:
and that, though they have been basely abused
by unworthy persons with their corrupt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polations,
yet have we to this day found among
us some remains of the monuments of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
and glorious Martyr.</p>
