         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

errours and corruptions which (through ſin and Satan)
have inſinuated, nay pierced the very entrals of this State;
and laſtly (which is worſt of all) thoſe infinite pollutions of
body and minde, in all degrees of men both naturall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall,
moved me with reſolution to faſten upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But notwithſtanding the pregnancy of theſe induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Theme ſeemed ſo weighty, that I was forced to
<pb facs="tcp:58230:3"/>
ſearch what furniture I had ſtored up for ſuch a worke. And
at laſt I found the caſe to ſtand with me, as it doth with two
friends, who through diſcontinuance, or abſence, have wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

               </gap>p to renew their acquaintance. So ſtood the caſe
betweene my ſelfe and theſe Meditations, which gave the
firſt draught of the Treatiſe enſuing; which ſince my firſt
preaching thereof lay long by mee, as halfe forgotten; but
now ſeemed to preſent themſelves to my view with double
appetite and ſavour, as promiſing to be materiall and uſefull
for the bettering of publique manners, and helping to redreſſe
the corruptions of the time. Accordingly therefore ſhaking
off the duſt and ſoyle of my Papers, I have beſtowed ſome
paines to contrive them into ſome ſuch order and expreſsion,
as might (if not ſatisfie the curious, yet) profit the deſirous
of cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſell and reſolution in caſes of this nature.</p>
            <p>You ſee (Right Honourable) how bold I am to draw you
from your deeper occaſions, to liſten a while to theſe private
notions of mine: which I preſume (out of your facility to
give beſt conſtruction to things) you will not diſdaine to doe.
To proceed then: Alas! How evident is it, by mens practice,
that although all confeſſe they ought to be religious (and who
now adayes is otherwiſe?) yet few will admit the yoake of
God upon their necke, in the wiſe undergoing of thoſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
wherein they ſtand obliged? Among which this of
marriage is a rooted and fundamentall one, as being in order
before the reſt; and ſuch an one as either affords influence
and ſap to them (both Family, Polity, and Church) or elſe
inferres a blemiſh and aſperſion upon them all. So that, if
men would derive the ſavour and power of godlineſſe into
this eſtate of life, ſeaſoning it with the graces of ſelf-deniall,
and faith, and holineſſe; they ſhould (doubtleſſe) enjoy it in
a farre more ſweet and contentfull ſort then now they doe,
<pb facs="tcp:58230:3"/>
while they detaine this truth in unrighteouſneſſe, ſeparating
the thing: which God hath united.</p>
            <p>Men tell us, they will heare Preachers (while they keepe
their bounds) while they teach them onely faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
but if they will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IUdicious and religious Reader, this Wheele of
our Converſation, whereof this Booke treates,
(Marriage I meane) including many leſſer wheeles
in, and under it, all ſubject to the motion thereof,
and each of them requiring a due order and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that both might bee regular, and according to
knowledge; how ſhould I thinke any other, but that I
have lighted upon this point of Marriage by a ſpeciall
Manuduction of Providence? Deſirous wee are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
that the matter we have by us in readineſſe, might
be ſeaſonable alſo for the times wherein we live: But,
when indeed the manners of our preſent age ſeeme to
give a life to that which we have before prepared, (for
thou knoweſt Occaſion is the life of a Thing) then dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
it appeares ſeaſonable, yea as Apples of gold, and
Pictures of ſilver. Howbeit further muſing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſundry other ſmaller cords concurred to draw me on
to this endeavour: whereof I will make thee partaker,
(as counting it none of the ſmalleſt mercies that I may
give an account to the Church of God, for the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and redeeming of my ſeaſons) in theſe ſad times;
wherein that good God, who allowes us any the leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:58230:6"/>
protection and liberty, requires that wee ſpend it not in
vanity and froth, but to the beſt advantage, if not as we
would (for hee is wiſer then man,<note place="margin">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 1. 25.</note> yea his fooliſhneſſe
and weakneſſe exceeds the beſt wiſedome and ſtrength
which is in us) yet as wee may for the better making up
of our reckoning, at his comming, when the uſe of our
Talents ſhall be examined.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt then, I obſerved, that Religious Conſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
couples did not onely faſhion the family relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the children and ſervants, much the more orderly;
but alſo extended it ſelfe to the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
cauſing thoſe ſervices which concerne publique
communion of worſhippers, to proceed more faire; as
alſo the duties of common life, to paſſe more comely
then otherwiſe they would doe. One godly and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
Couple, I have noted, to diſpatch more good
ſervice to God, to themſelves, to their brethren, then
ſome ten couples unequally yoaked. So true a maxime
of <hi>Machiavel</hi> and his maſter the Devill it is, Hee that
would beare rule,<note place="margin">Si vis impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, divide.</note> let him ſow diſcord and diviſion. This
one wheele then being of ſo maine importance; what
need is there that the ſpokes and ſtaves of it bee ſound,
and well compact, according to the rule of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary?
This was one motive.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I obſerved moreover, that as barren as the world is
of good perſons, and good couples, yet here and there
are ſcattered many of a tractable and docible diſpoſition,
to doe well, and to order their marriage courſe aright.
Onely their Principles lying,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50. ult.</note> rather in a morall way of
good affections, zeale, and duties, then in the particular
relations of life, in which they live, as of marriage; yea,
being ignorant of that which ſhould either informe their
judgement, or order their will thereunto; alas they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:58230:6"/>
attaine the Tythe of comfort, and content which
this eſtate might affoord them. How great pitty were it
then to defraud ſuch people of directions, who if they
might enjoy it, would not bee wanting to improve it?
How many full of knowledge, yet live, (and in marriage
eſpecially) as if they had none? By ſo much the more
its pitty that ſuch ſhould want it, as would gladly enjoy
the fruit of it? And conſidering, that without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the heart is not good; and that good intentions
without rule, are as a goodly Coach without a skilfull
driver; I conceived I ſhould doe them acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and ſome glory to God, in caſting this Platforme
of Direction for them, out of Gods Word. This ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
another inducement.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Beſides theſe, as wee ſee a great deale of ground va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth 
in a narrow Map, which in a larger lyeth open;
ſo I have noted, that in Sermons, or ſhort Touches upon
the fifth Command (wherein the Preacher onely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
his text, meets with no ſuch occaſions of inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
much inſtruction about particular duties of Mariage
are concealed, which yet (in a Treatiſe appointed for
the nonce) will offer it ſelfe fitly to be diſcuſſed. They
that are in a crowd, muſt get through as they can; but
the doore ſtanding open freely, one by one may paſſe
through with eaſe. So is it here; a Treatiſe hath this
advantage, to reach in many things which a generall
handling paſſeth over: and ſatisfaction to a doubtfull
minde, is more eaſily given this way, then by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes of more waighty nature: Each ordinance of
God ſerving ſpecially for that end, which another doth
not. A poore ſtar may in her uſe exceed the Sun, when
its darke, and night ſeaſon: though the Sunne exceed all
Starres in her light. This was a third reſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58230:7"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But above all other, I conſidered that the wofull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow
of ſinne, and of Luſt by name, in this our age,
which reignes as in her element, through diſdaine or
violation of the ordinance of marriage: ſeemed to need
ſome check and affront from heaven, which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
as a witneſſe againſt our debauchery, and which
might flait men out of their uncleanneſſe. Unto this
worke, though I know my ſelfe the unfitteſt of many,
yet as one having more leaſure then they, (as ſometime
a looker on may ſee what a gameſter overſees) I durſt
not wholly decline that taske, ſo farre as this vice offered
itſelfe, or came within the bounds of my Treatiſe. The
contempt of long light, having begot thoſe ſpirituall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
of a ſecure, unbeleeving, impenitent he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt, with
apoſtaſie from the truth: how ſhould it bee otherwiſe,
but the ſpirit of grace muſt ſtraiten it ſelfe exceedingly,
both in removing of many helpes, and a fruitleſſe living
under ſuch as remaine? And what then muſt follow,
ſave a formall, empty profeſſion of that truth, the power
whereof is wofully wanting! Now we know, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
cannot long continue within her owne bounds, but
ſhe muſt quickly diſcover her ſelfe to be openly profane.
When was hearing,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 3. 5.</note> and worſhip (in the memory of man)
accompanied with ſo much wickedneſſe? or when had
Popery bettery colour to traduce our Goſpell for a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of licentiouſneſſe? And while men have leaſure
enough for every other thing, who lookes at reforming
of ill manners? And how juſtly doth God leave men,
who will not be as they ought, (with <hi>Hazael)</hi> to prove
worſe then they ſeemed? What argues this, that men
living in a practice of drunkenneſſe and uncleanneſſe,
dare preaſe upon a Miniſter of Chriſt, for comfort to
their ſoules, as imagining it to belong to them? Is it not
<pb facs="tcp:58230:7"/>
a ſigne of a ſpirit of giddineſſe reigning in the world, out
of deepe doting upon their prayers and hypocriticall
worſhip? Hath ſuch a Baalamiſh conſcience ever appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and ſo commonly as now it doth in all places? Dare
Uſury, drunkenneſſe, covetouſneſſe, ſwearing, (which
are more infamous and hated) openly proclaime their
ſhame: and doe we thinke that more ſecret ſinnes, which
love the darke, are not much more generally practiſed, as
ſodomy, fornication and wantonneſſe? For which ſake
the wrath of God juſtly comes upon the children of
diſobedience! And this fourth was my ſtrongeſt reaſon.</p>
            <p>Now then as my endeavours want not due motives,
ſo it lyes in thee for whoſe ſake I have written, to look
to thy ſelfe, leſt it bee undertaken in vaine! If there be
little hope that my Phyſicke (not mine, but Gods) will
worke any great Cure, yet I wiſh it may prove preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to ſuch as yet remaine untainted? What the ſucceſſe
is like to be, lyes not in mee nor thee to determine! At
leaſt this I deſire, that they who are entred, or are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the eſtate of Marriage, may find theſe rules ſomwhat
advantagious to further them in their choice, or to guide
them in their courſe! I ſhall bee happy in my deſigne, if
either of theſe be obtained: to the effecting whereof, I
commend all to his grace, who hath by his providence
brought this Treatiſe to an end, both for mee to publiſh,
and for thee to peruſe.</p>

ſeeme queſtionable to a Reader,
not obſervant of the circumſtances of
times and perſons. Sure it is, that the
Apoſtles ſcope is very orderly and familiar. For having in
the former Chapter propounded the Doctrine of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the cauſes thereof, both matter &amp; forme; and having
alſo very effectually built thereon that great exhortation, to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58230:10"/>
beleeve, and to live by faith. In the chapter before this, he
proceeds to the urging of obedience and holineſſe,<note place="margin">Chap. 12.</note> in the
generall: and in this 13. chapter he proceeds to particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
and inſtance in ſome ſpeciall, and ſome perſonall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

what ſhould cauſe the Apoſtle to thinke this argument
of Marriage as weighty as the reſt, and to equall it to other
Doctrines handled in this place; may be ſuppoſed, not to be
from a common notion, ſwimming with other things in his
minde, and uttered by courſe: but, probably from ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of reall and preſent neceſſity moving him. I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
what ſeemes to me the truth. There were at the time
of writing this Epiſtle, two ſorts and practices of men very
rife, and that of contrary intention; the one of heatheniſh
prophaneneſſe, the other of Iewiſh ſuperſtition: the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
as they thought ſingle fornication no ſinne at all (as
appeared by their common practice of it;) and adultery it
ſelfe, none of the greateſt ſinnes; ſo, they ſleighted all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations
of Gods wrath and judgement againſt either;
and ſnorted ſecurely in the practice of both. The Iew, on
the contrary extreame, comes in with his Superſtition, as
thinking there is no way to controll this impiety, ſave by
maintaining a flat contrariety unto it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Marriage it
ſelfe is unlawfull.<note place="margin">Jew confuſed in his conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe taxeth ſuch falſe teachers,
<hi>Forbidding to marry,</hi> that is, croſſing Gods owne ordinance,
provided for the ſafeguard of chaſtity. Much like the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
at this day,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 3.</note> ſundry of whoſe poſitions favour of no other
ſtraine, then to oppoſe one errour by a farre worſe. As, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſee mens lives very barren of good workes, they
have no other way to draw men to be forward in weldoing,
then by a falſe Doctrine, that workes are meritorious. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
finding fault with mens backwardneſſe to Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
in Policy, they deviſe ſuch Penances of the fleſh as God
never ordained, to whip themſelves with cords beſet with
needles, and ſharpe pricks, or to ſtand up naked to the chin
in cold water, or to faſt from all kinde of fleſh, to goe bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot
on pilgrimage, to renounce the world, ſell all, and live
in a Cloiſter. This myſtery of iniquity wrought early, even
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58230:10"/>
here in the mindes of ſuperſtitious Iewes and falſe teachers,
who found no way to alay the flame, ſave by quenching the
fire: and therefore, to quaſh heatheniſh contempt of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
by whoredome, or the corrupting thereof by Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
they affirme no marriage or carnall knowledge at all,
to be allowed to Chriſtians; which remedy is much worſe
then the diſeaſe; as if the life of <hi>Divels</hi> (adultery) could be
overthrowne by the doctrine of <hi>Divels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim 4. 1, 2, 3.</note> which is, defiance
of marriage. We ſee this ſtopping of the ſtreame, hath in
all ages doubled the rage of all kinde of uncleanneſſe. Here
therefore, the Apoſtle, that he might oppoſe both theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities:
firſt, the ſuperſtition of the Iew, tels him, <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is honourable;</hi> and therefore an ungodly thing to diſanull
an ordinance. <hi>And the bed</hi> is <hi>undefiled:</hi> there is no neceſſity
of making our ſelves Eunuches, to avoid unchaſteneſſe. And
on the other ſide, to the Heatheniſh, or lately converted
from <hi>Pagan</hi> prophaneneſſe, this he addes, <hi>But Whoremongers
and Adulterers God will judge:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heathens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> 
                  <hi>q. d.</hi> Let no man ſtrengthen
himſelfe in his adultery or filthineſſe, under pretext of the
lawfulneſſe of carnall knowledge: for why? whether men
goe to common harlots, and defile virgins more openly, as
<hi>Whoremongers;</hi> or goe to worke more covertly, ſhrowding
their ſinne by the Married eſtate; although for a time, they
may defile or be defiled, without feare or checke: yet, they
muſt know, that the God of marriage and pureneſſe, will one
day in perſon ſit upon them, and ſhew his deteſtation of ſuch
wayes, by plaguing them, be they great or ſmall, high or
lowe, Princes or Peſants. As once <hi>Latimer,</hi> that holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
upon an handkerchiefe with a booke wrapt up in it, and
preſented to a King, wrote this very text for a poſie, <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores

               </p>
               <p>The words then containe in them a Diſcretive proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">The Analis of it.</note>
the which divides it ſelfe into two truths; either an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertive,
or denouncing truth: onely there muſt be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be a ſecret defect of the words in them both, which
muſt be ſupplied for the making up of a full meaning. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Aſſertion firſt, its two fold; the one concerning the
Ordinance it ſelfe, <hi>Marriage is honourable;</hi> the other reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58230:11"/>
the uſe of it; <hi>And the bed is undefiled</hi> (for ſo I read it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Text and ſcope.) The ſecond truth denouncing,
divides it ſelfe into two parts; either a Threat, or the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
thereof: the Threat is againſt the corrupters of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<hi>God will judge them.</hi> The object is double; firſt, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
ſuch as mixe unlawfully with the ſingle, either harlots
or virgins, making theſe whores, or nouriſhing them that
are ſo, in their trade. Or elſe <hi>Adulterers,</hi> who (although ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the parties married, cauſe adultery) yet being
married, doe linke themſelves with other mens wives, for
the concealement of their villanie, and ſo of baſtardy. Both
theſe, the one for his manifeſt and open, the other his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
and cloſe uncleaneneſſe, ſhall be adjudged by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
The conceived defect of the ſentence, lyeth in the
oppoſition of the parts, thus, <hi>viz, Marriage is honourable, the
bed is undefiled, and bleſſing is upon all that ſo preſerve it. But
Whoremongers and Adulterers are diſhonourable, debauched ones,
and God will curſe and plague them.</hi> I will go through both the

which a man may bleſſe God while he lives.<note place="margin">Marriage is from God, yea in innocency, and he ſtill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth it: ſee Pſal. 68. 6.</note> This, I ſay, in
the firſt place, as the chiefe ground of her honour: and yet
this is not all; ſhe is called the crowne of her husband, both
by <hi>Salomon</hi> (uſing that word) and by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> calling her <hi>his
glory,</hi> who before was his utter ſhame. <hi>Crownes,</hi> we know,
are very precious things and honorable,<note place="margin">God ſetteth ſolitary ones in families.</note> ſerving to grace
things of chiefe eminency, Emperours, Kings and Princes:
Crownes are made of the pureſt gold,<note place="margin">Pro. 12. 4.</note> embelliſhed with the

her price is ſaid to be farre above <hi>Rubies:</hi>

no jewell is to be compared to her, farre above ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
yea, the choiſeſt gold. Happy is he upon whoſe head
ſuch a crowne is ſet, to whom heaven hath given ſuch a gift.
The other party is the Man;<note place="margin">Man honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> we know the man doth eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
reſemble the image of God, and in that reſpect is the
Wives head:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 7.</note> and although by her ſinne, he came to loſe his

The Greeke word here uſed,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 2.</note> is the ſame which is uſed
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. and may as well be tranſlated <hi>Precious,</hi> or of worth
and value, a coſtly thing: and ſo it well befits <hi>Marriage;</hi> for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58230:12"/>
why? Its precious in the nature of it. A Prince is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
peece in himſelfe;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art worth ten thouſand of us</hi>
(ſay the people to <hi>David)</hi> without any other reſpects; he
is the delight of his Subjects, an object of naturall conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and eſteeme. The light of the Sunne (though conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
apart from the uſe) a pearle, gold, skill and cunning
in Arts, have a peculiar ſplendour, grace and nobleneſſe of
nature in them, and doe eminently exceede other things. So
marriage in the nature of it (although never ſo much ſtained
with the unjuſt aſperſions of Popery, and their compariſons
with virginity) is a precious ordinance in her nature. How
men by their ſinne make it, is not the queſtion (for a crown
may be caſt into the dirt) but how it is. I ſpeake not now,
how generall conſent and opinion hath ſetled it in worth,
graced it with priviledges, diſgraced ſingle life (which yet
I approve not) and granced immunities to marriage farre
above it, both in warre and peace (as the Romans law of
the claime of three Sonnes ſhewes) but I ſpeake of Gods
owne inſtitution of it; for thats onely honour which a King
gives, who himſelfe deviſed it; yea, and that not as a reliefe
of man fallen, but an addition of perfection to his creation,
before ever ſin entred: for the order of it, after all other
creatures were made to entertaine and grace their Lord and
Lady, yea, the guard of heaven to uſher them into Paradiſe;
even the Father,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28. &amp; 2. 18.</note> Sonne and holy Ghoſt, conſenting to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
man created, and not ceaſing to create, till the
woman was created: more eſpecially, the Lord Ieſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
(when he needed it not) yet would grace it, by being
the Sonne of a married Virgin, and chooſing to be <hi>Ioſephs</hi>
reputed Sonne: not to ſpeake of that honour he caſt upon
it, when he did yeelde to doe his firſt divine Miracle at a
Marriage.<note place="margin">Iohn 2. 5.</note> Now that which a God of pureneſſe ordaines by
a perpetuall decree of pureneſſe, in an eſtate of pureneſſe,
how can it chooſe but have an ingraven character and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
nature of preciouſneſſe and honour in it? This for
the ſecond.</p>
               <p>The third reſpect is yet more for the honour of it.<note place="margin">Third reſpect: the uſe of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> We ſay
it beares <hi>pricke and price,</hi> which containes ſweet and good,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58230:12"/>
price and uſe in one. For why? The very pleaſing pure lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
of a pearle, would make it precious of it ſelfe, though it
had no vertue or quality for uſe in it. Marriage then is alſo
honourable for the uſe of it. If the Sunne be excellent for
her pureneſſe, what is it then for his influence and life, the
very heat and vegetation of the Creatures? what ſhould the
world be, ſave a dungeon without it? And what were it
but an emptineſſe and vanity without the uſefulneſſe of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage?
If light be ſo precious for the pureneſſe of it, what
is it for the uſefull direction of it to doe the world of worke
which it daily affordeth? If a Prince be ſo honourable for
his nobleneſſe, what is he for the uſe, to be a Father to his
People, to rule them with all godlineſſe and honeſty, to feed
them in <hi>Iacob</hi> and Iſrael? uſefulneſſe is the varniſh and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
of honour, grounding and eſtabliſhing it, as colours ſet
in oyle. Now then what is equall to marriage, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or well being of life? I ſay, the being, ornament or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of it. Its the prop of mutuall content, the aid of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the perfection of health, wealth, beauty, learning, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and experience, youth, manhood, old age, whereof
none is ſweet, where marriage ſupplies not the lacke. It
ſerveth not onely for the neceſſity of generation (for how
can there be warmth to one, but if two <hi>lye together, they have
warmth?)</hi> but for the reliefe of ſuch as are paſt it, looking
at the ſafeguard of the ſtocke, and comfort of life? Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is the <hi>Preſervative of Chastity, the Seminary of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,

the ambition of virginity, the foundation of Countries, Cities,
Vniverſities, ſucceſſion of Families, Crownes and Kingdomes;</hi> yea
(beſides the being of theſe) <hi>its the welbeing of them being made,</hi>
and whatſoever is excellent in them, or any other thing,
the very furniture of heaven (in a kinde) depending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The fourth reſpect of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſacredneſſe.</note> its alſo honourable for the ſolemne ſacredneſſe

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58230:13"/>
civill ordinance; and, although for the better witneſſe, our
Marriages are finiſht in Churches, yet marriage properly is
no Sacrament. But I meane, that God generally hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a reverend eſteeme of it in man, and put a deepe awe of
it into our mindes (as all thoſe Lawes doe teſtifie, which
have ſo ſtrictly maintained the repute of it:) but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that divine ſanction by which pure marriage is bleſſed:

to diſhonour and deſtroy them.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 17.</note> Him who defiles the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, by the pollution of this ordinance, God will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

a divine ſpirituall act, yet its ſacred, and the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him, an act of ſolemne and high reverence, moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly
obliging the Subject to all due ſervice,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> as to his

The ſtate of marriage is with theſe impure ones, an

ſerve to maintaine the honourable off-ſpring of marriage;
therefore God leaves them to be more filthy, and to let ſuch
a filthy off-ſpring maintaine none, ſave the children of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.
Marriage was honourable in the Church, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Lay-men onely, but (in the old Teſtament) with the
high Prieſt, and all his Tribe (which yet were typicall of
the pureneſſe of Chriſt himſelfe) and <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe, a man
who was converſant with God, and ſpake to him face to

Patron (and <hi>Paul</hi> had the ſame power) with the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,
and many religious Biſhops and Overſeers of Chriſts
flocke, from their times to many generations following. Till
the myſtery of iniquity, which long before had bin laid as

leven, and began to worke, was growne at length to open
Doctrine of Divels,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 2.</note> in rejecting of marriage, and practice
of Divels, in playing the Sodomites and whoremongers; for
generally this taint hath run through them all (if Hiſtories
may be beleeved) from the head to the foot.<note place="margin">See our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned writers. Centur.</note> And although
I deny not, but many votaries among them, abſtaine from
uncleanneſſe, ſome more, ſome leſſe; yet their Doctrine frets
like a Canker,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 17.</note> to defile and diſhonour this honourable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.
Away ye hypocrites, and vaniſh at the light and

it is a ſhame onely to name them, the Sunne bluſhing at

her owne necke, in deſtroying marriage? To be ſure, none
are ſo unfit to commend or defend her, as they who confute
marriage by the ſame uncleanneſſe whereby they defile vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity.
Virgins, I confeſſe, have their honour, yea, thoſe
Eunuches who have made themſelves ſpiritually ſo for the
kingdome of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 12.</note> are praiſe worthy. And, as that <hi>Demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke</hi>
ſaid,<note place="margin">Acts 19. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Ieſus we know, and Paul we know, but who are ye?</hi> So
we, marriage and true virginity we admire, but as for you,
what, or whence are yee? If you ſpeake a good word for
it, it were meet (as they at Athens were wont in the Senate
to do) to take it out of your unvirgin-like unſeemly mouthes,
and put it into the mouth of honeſter perſons. Praiſe ſtinkes
in the mouthes of ſuch as doe reproach more by deeds, then
their mouthes can commend. As the Poet once ſaid of the
cold Poetry of them who commended faſting with their
bellies full: ſo may I ſay of you, who praiſe virginity, your
ſelves having bodies debauched with uncleanneſſe; your
breath is not ſweet enough for this worke, nor your words
ſtrong enough, to make you beleeved. None but Oratours
can praiſe eloquence, nor any, ſave chaſte virgins, ſingle

life, whether married or unmarried. One once ſaid of the
great Turkes horſe, that no graſſe grew after where he had
once trod; ſo, neither did ever virginity thrive upon your
praiſes. As Locuſts eat up all before them, ſo doth your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled
luſt; and the more, by how much its vailed with
the vow of that Chaſtity, which becomes the greateſt ſnare
of uncleanneſſe, to them that make it. Thus much for the
firſt branch.</p>
               <p>But to leave theſe,<note place="margin">2. Branch of terrour againſt all prophaners of marriage.</note> I would alſo apply this truth to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſort of men, for their diſhonouring of marriage. Such
I meane, as doe (though not by Popiſh, yet) by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane

The moſt reall and chiefe offenders in this kinde,
who by their manners doe not onely impute, but infuſe (in
a ſort) a blot and ſhame into marriage, cauſing it to ſtinke
by their ſinne, which God hath honoured and bleſſed. And
theſe are the ſucceſſours of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 23.</note> whoſe open

grace rules not) of whom in the end of this Treatiſe I ſhall
ſpeake more. But beſides theſe, how doe the lives of ſuch
as live in this eſtate of marriage cauſe men to vow the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
uncleanneſſe, rather then they would be ſo married? As
once an Heathen ſaid, If this be the practice of Chriſtians
to eat their God, and to kill their King, let my ſoule be with
the Philoſophers. So ſay I, the baſe curſed life of many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, who brawle, ſcold, fight, and live at defiance with
each other, cauſes many ungodly ones to prefer a ſingle life,
though beſmeared with all ſorts of luſts contemplative, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall,
natural, unnatural, with wives, harlots, or as they can,
rather then to marry! that is to ſay, Let my ſoule be with the
adulterers. I ſay to ſuch married perſons, ſtumbling-blocks
and eye-ſores; perhaps you may be guiltleſſe of this ſin your

<hi>Marriage honourable</hi> in her ſelfe: you doe as much as in you

to ſeeke God, to worſhip him joyntly, to ſhun all occaſions

are loath to take the paines: ſurely, you ſhall finde at laſt
that repentance will be the beſt fruit of ſuch ſleghtneſſe: it

have taught it:<note place="margin">Marriage no buckler to ſence our ſelves in bad courſes.</note> but men thinke marriage to be a buckler to

               <p>Others there are, who by their froward, peeviſh carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age

               <p>BVT becauſe there be many more Vſes to be made of
this point, ere I come to them, I deſire further to open
this truth, and in particular to ſhew what the honour of this

is, How married couples may attaine this honour? To
which I anſwer, by two maine duties: Firſt, procure it:
Secondly, preſerve it. Procure it firſt, by laying the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of it in honour;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By two things; firſt, by good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, continuance</note> for as the root is, ſo will the branches
be, either honourable or reproachfull: ſeeke therefore to
enter into that eſtate according to God and his rules. And
then ſecondly, having entred well into it, manage it well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
nouriſh the honour of it carefully and warily, for its no
whit leſſe vertue to keepe well, then to ſeeke aright; and
many begin with great ſhew of honour, who yet end in
ſhame.</p>
               <p>Touching the former of theſe,<note place="margin">The former part: to marry in the Lord.</note> there is a double rule of
the word; firſt, to marry in the Lord: ſecondly, to marry
aptly in the Lord. This is the ground of an honourable mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
when as thou art content to be taught by him who
firſt put honour upon it, to maintaine it. For the former, to
marry in the Lord,<note place="margin">Entrance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and aptneſſe.</note> is to uſe our uttermoſt diſcreet diligence,
to ſeeke out ſuch companions, as (in charity and likelihood)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58230:20"/>
are either already eſpouzed to the Lord Ieſus, their husband
by faith; and in token thereof, ſit cloſe to him in obedience;
or an endeavourer thereto; that is, ſuch as are in a faire and

               <p>This is a ſhort deſcription of a ſpouſe of Chriſt,<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>kes of a lower degree.</note> and a

ſuch no queſtion needs to be made, but they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> (in this firſt
reſpect) meet husbands and wives for each other. But leſt
my words prove ſnares to any who come ſhort of theſe, and
yet are loth to be debarred from marriage: I adde, that there
is a leſſer degree of grace under this, onely appearing in the
ſeed, tender and weake; and that is of ſuch, as (although
they reach not ſo farre) yet have their eye toward this bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome,<note place="margin">Job 33. 23.</note>
counting him one of ten thouſand, comparing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58230:21"/>
ſelves with ſuch as are married to him, thinke themſelves far
inferiour, wiſh their caſe were ſo happy; abhorre their own
treachery,<note place="margin">Zach. 9. 9.</note> count the feet of ſuch beautifull, as wooe them to
Chriſt, thinke highly of the offer, love to be ſuch friends of
the Lord Ieſus,<note place="margin">Cant. 3.</note> and children of his Bridechamber, full of tears,
affections and deſires after it. Even theſe are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
neither, there is hope of ſuch, that they may come to
be married to Chriſt in due time; therefore it were unequall
that for meere lacke of time and training, they ſhould be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted:
rather, if better faile (in ordinary providence) there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſufficient ground to hope, that their little is in truth: I
dare not deny, but a contract with ſuch may be lawfull, and
the Lord may cover defects in mercy; eſpecially if the more
forward party be induſtrious to improve a little to a greater
meaſure, in the other, if the weaker party be teachable, and in
either of both there be a ſelfe-denying heart (if God croſſe
their hopes) to lye downe meekely at his feet, humbled for ſin
(the cauſe thereof) and patiently taking up and bearing their
croſſe, till God amend it.</p>
               <p>By all this it appeares, that Marrying in the Lord, requires
good conſideration;<note place="margin">Reaſons of this firſt branch</note> and that they who ſo marry, have laid
the foundation of future honour beforehand. And who doubts
but it had need be ſo? for what hope is there, that they who
never ſought it before,<note place="margin">The firſt: Raſh matches unbleſt.</note> ſhould ever light upon it after? Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
requires good breeding, and it is a ſtud, which except it
ſubſiſt upon a good ground-cell, will ſoone lye in the duſt.
Raſh and ſudden attempts in this kinde, doe but make way for
ſhame and reproach; onely marrying in the Lord, prepares
the ſoule for the worke: it hath her tooles in readineſſe to fall
to the trade, whereas the contrary is ſtill to ſeek; yea, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
method of the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle, ſhewes no leſſe, for
he ſpeakes of no marriage buſineſſe, before he have fully ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the doctrine of faith, he layes that for the bottome, and
then comes in, and tels ſuch, their <hi>Marriage is honourable:</hi>
Faith then is the hand and wheele, which muſt frame a veſſell
for honour, prepared, as for all other, ſo for this worke of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
And in truth, as it is all Religion (upon point) ſo it is
the marriage ring, which makes the ſoule one with the Lord;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58230:21"/>
and this ring is beſet with many rich jewels, all of them ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for the honour, that is, the well carrying and diſcharge
of marriage duties.<note place="margin">The jewels of the marriage ring.</note> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> One jewell is, humility and ſelfe-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
whereby the heart is tamed and humbled to this worke
with all ſubjection, and freed from that rudeneſſe and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion 
of ſpirit,<note place="margin">Faith and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> which makes it fit for nothing but it owne

this ordinance.<note place="margin">Peace.</note> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another jewell is peace, whereby the ſoule 
is ſo calmed and pacified within it ſelfe, in the point of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and Gods favour,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> that it can beare any affronts: even
as the ſhooes or braſſe boots of the Souldier can walke upon
rocks or pikes, and feele no hurt; ſo an heart well a paid in
the Lord, is calme, and able to cleare the coaſt of all diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;

unquiet ſpirit cannot.<note place="margin">Purity.</note> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third is purity, which cleanſeth the 
ſoule of many bad humours, very unequall for marriage;
ſelfe-love, pride, diſdaine, wrath, heart-burning, jealouſies
and conceits, and makes a man much fitter for marriage. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A 
fourth (the laſt which I will name) is righteouſneſſe;<note place="margin">Righteouſnes.</note> that is,
the fellowſhip with Chriſts holy nature, by which the ſoule
partakes the properties of Chriſt, qualifying it with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
influence, ſtrength, meekneſſe, patience, holineſſe, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
long-ſuffering and compaſſion; which graces, as
they make him a meet head and husband for the Church, ſo
they make married couples meet heads and helpers for each
other. Faith, I ſay, doth draw from Chriſt all ſuch abilities
and graces, as may prepare the ſoule to all the ſervices which
the marriage eſtate cals for. Even as the ſpokes or ſtaves of
the wheele ſtrengthen it, for the good motion of it, ſo doth
faith ſtrengthen this great maſter-wheele of converſation,
which is Marriage.</p>

in all? yong are married to old, rich to poore, untaught to

I doe not alway ſay it can; for Religion it ſelf hath no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to enter upon unequall marriage, howbeit, if it be ſo,
religion can beſt ſet all ſtraight and eaven, or elſe nothing
can. It is not her wealth, which can procure content with
a prophane, froward wife; it is not a good nature which

ſay thus, Thy wife was but poore, but ſhe is loyall, chaſte,

what a brave thing were it? There is a pleaſure in doing
that which is forbidden, to our curſed nature, even becauſe

this doctrine. So long as they can marry morally, ſuch as are

As if men were ſelling of cattell in a marquet? Not thus;
What is the woman? how brought up? how qualified with

ornaments of wealth and beauty, yea, more in price with

parents (who ſo ſhunned religious ones before) can wiſh
they had matcht them with religious ones too. But its juſt
that they pierce themſelves through with cares, who ſeeke
religion out of ſeaſon, rather out of their own ends then for

Imagine not, that profit and pleaſure can doe the

are but by-reſpects in a lower contract of friendſhip: how
much more here? when ſweet and profit are once worne
off, as the nap from the fine cloth, nothing remaines behinde

that looke what defect ſo ever there be in couples, yet mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

one) and all will doe well enough. Can marriage make
all errours vaniſh? Is any man ſo mad as to thinke, that
becauſe he hath a great ſumme to pay, therefore he may
convey twenty ſlips into it, and not be diſcarded? ſhall

Once (as our Engliſh ſtory mentions) there was
in the Engliſh Court a very ſweet Lady, called <hi>Iane-make-peace;</hi>
which no ſooner perceived any little difference
among the Nobles or Courtiers, but ſhe would accord them
preſently. But this office is onely in religious marriage, not
marriage onely: nay, rather marriages ill entred upon, are
commonly ſo farre from ſweet accord, that rather after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they prove worſe; for then doth the divell preſent
more baits of liberty, to an unbrideled heart, then before.

that feare God venture upon thoſe that doe not: and let all
ſeeke for their parts, to be in the Lord, before marriage.
Above all, let ſecond marriages beware of adventuring in
this kinde, upon each other for advantage ſake (an errour

eares in this now adayes?) but concerning the reall worke
of the Word by name, how the Law hath quelled a proud
heart, and ſtopt the courſe thereof in evill: how it is brought
ſo low and to ſuch a tameneſſe, as to crouch to God for the
crums that fall from his table: to be low in her ſelfe, and lay
aſide all her ornaments,<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 6.</note> glad to be equall to them of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,

Alſo,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 15.</note> how faith purifies the heart, kils the ſtrongeſt luſts and

that which one thinks comely, another diſtaſts, and
ſome diſproportion and unſympathy herein, may cauſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

this buſineſſe borders much upon the outward man; beware
therefore that neither outward defects doe weaken, nor their
abilities doe forſtall thy judgement either way, from the
due weighing of the beſt things in the ballance, to or fro.
Slight defects will ſoone be ſupplied by religion, where love
is entire, but want of religion is not eaſily recompenced
with externals: be wiſe not to ſtumble too much at the
former; neither let heat of affection ſnare and couſen thee
in the latter. So much for the meanes to be uſed for marrying
in the Lord.</p>
               <p>And to this iſſue pertaines all this diſcourſe:<note place="margin">Concluſion of this ſecond duty.</note> therefore ſtill
I ſo conclude, as I began. And becauſe no bad marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals
any, where the husbands ſinne is not chiefe, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
himſelfe is bad, or erreth in judging the wife: (the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
having onely a refuſing voyce,<note place="margin">The man hath the leading hand, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be wary.</note> not a chuſing, but the
man having the prerogative of choice, as the leader of the
buſineſſe:) therefore let the man eſpecially looke to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
Its not for the modeſty of the womans ſexe, to play
the ſuitour,<note place="margin">Women wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers threaten woe.</note> to put forth her ſelfe towards the man, but to
wait till God offer her an object of conſideration: and I ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
have noted matches very ſuccesfull in this kinde. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the anſwer of a wiſe man to a Gentlewoman, which
told him, ſhe could love him before any man: he anſwered
her, but of al others, I dare not venture upon you for my wife.
He conſidered, that ſuch pangs in that humorous ſex cannot
come from judgement, becauſe they thwart an ordinance:
and as a ſudden torrent of paſſion or heat cauſeth them, ſo
they ſuddenly fall as faſt, and leave the channell dry: when
the humour is over, then coole blood ſucceeds, and checks
the party for raſhneſſe, workes a diſlike of the choice, and a
very indifferent ſpirit to the husband; thinking him to be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58230:38"/>
too meane for them; and ſo little joying in him, waxing
darke, and farre from that ſweet temper of amity and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which a wife ſhould bewray. Therefore ye husbands
be not gulled with eaſie matches; they are not ſo eaſie to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
as to get: the furtheſt way about, is the neereſt way
home. There is a pleaſingneſſe in ſhew, to be fancied by a
woman, to be offred that eſtate which I could never have
expected:<note place="margin">Touching marrying in the Lord: three queſtions anſwered.</note> but when all is ſaid that can be, it is too eaſie to
prove happy: what it may prove I cannot ſay, but ſince its
not of God, and is againſt the modeſty of that ſex, I can ſee
no great hope of it. This by the way. I end my counſell
with a two-fold queſtion.<note place="margin">1. Queſtion anſwered.</note> One is this: if (ſay ſome) we ſtay
till theſe choice marriages be offred us, we may wrong our
hopes, paſſing the time of our virginity and youth vainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
To whom I ſay (I ſpeake to none in this kinde ſave
to the religious; let the reſt move in their owne ſpheare:)
commit thy way to Iehovah,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37 5.</note> and he will effect it: where there
is truth of grace, it cannot lye hid; ſome way or other the
Lord ſhall provide, and the labour of thy love ſhall not be
concealed: feare not the worlds feares, cry not a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
where they cry it;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 15.</note> but wait, and there will alway be
ſome men, who will be as jealous as women, to plunge
themſelves into a croſſe marriage, as glad of thee as thou
of him: its a reciprocall caſe, and hee who beleeves,
makes no more haſte then good ſpeed. Thy worth ſhall
breake out as the light,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 6.</note> and thy patience and modeſty as the
noone day.</p>
               <p>Another is,<note place="margin">2. Queſtion anſwered.</note> whether ſhould we goe to finde out ſuch? for
we ſee the families of ſuch as had name of religion, are
now degenerate, and empty of ſuch choice. None doe more
degenerate to pride, vanity and prophaneneſſe, then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of many Miniſters and profeſſours, which have bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious;
yea, many townes anciently of note for ſuch, yet are
now become as barren as any other. To whom I anſwer:
when the people came and told <hi>Samuel,</hi> that his children
walked not in his wayes,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8. 5.</note> it was not ſo much from any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at their ſinne, as for their owne ends, to make them a
King: many upbraid good families, becauſe they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58230:38"/>
to balke them, and to looke otherwhere. Sure I am,
that families are not ſo wanting of good matches, as the
good matches who are in them are diſregarded. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
be it true, Gods rules are ſleighted in all places now a
dayes, and religion was never thicker ſowne, nor come up
thinner then now: what wonder, if ſinne carry this duty
downe the ſtreame of contempt, as well as others? yet I ſay,
is religion gone quite out of all families? Though it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
to no one, yet cannot free grace plant it ſelfe where it
liſteth? if it leave one, can it not chuſe another? religion
(for ought I ſee) may lye long enough, except exceſſe of por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſmell her out. Oh! follow not the ſtreame, conforme
not to the faſhion of this world: God is tyed to no places,
families, congregations, he is no accepter of perſons; but in
all places where his name is feared and called upon, there
will he bleſſe. Such ſhall not need to diſtruſt God: hee
makes none a ſoone of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 10. 34.</note> but he makes a daughter
of <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo meet for him; uſe meanes to finde them out,
and having ſo done, preferre pearles before pibbles, and the
Lord ſhall bring the good to the good,<note place="margin">1 Cor 14. 33.</note> for he is a God of
order, not of confuſion.</p>

which is unſtained with ſo much ill, being in the midſt of
it, more approved and tried with the touchſtone, then that

marriage. It is not for nothing, that the Lord brought <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
a meet helper for him; that is, not onely one created in
the ſame image of holineſſe as he; but made of himſelfe, fleſh
of his fleſh, and bone of his bone: woman of man, equall to
him in dignity; not of his head, nor his feet or lower parts,
but of his fides and ribs, in token of one that was to fide with
him, and agree with him in the married eſtate: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
uſeth a phraſe about husband and wife,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 35.</note> the which is
tranſlated thus <hi>[For that which is comely;]</hi> the originall word
is an equall ſiding, or ſitting cloſe to the ſide, with comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
ſo ſhould it be with the married: there ſhould be ſuch
an aptneſſe in the choice (ſo farre as may be) that the one

                     </gap>s.</note> fellow in the yoke, well met (as
we ſay) and ſutable each to other. Hence marriage is called
a Match, to ſignifie, that couples ſhould be peeres, and like
each other, true matches. Otherwiſe, a manifeſt diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cauſes not onely a fulſomeneſſe, in the judgement of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but to the affections of each other. And this the Lord
would have us take notice of, as foreſeeing the inevitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
which muſt needs follow upon miſmatched
couples. Cattle of uneven cize and ſtature, ſtrength and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
draw very ill in one yoke, and untowardly. This I
adde, leſt any ſhould miſtake my former ſpeech, <hi>viz.</hi> That
religion is the true levell of all other inequalities. I meant
this, that if it be the lot of any to enter marriage unequally,
then there being religion to moderate, it will make a better
levell then any other thing can, when religion is abſent. I
did not juſtifie unequality but accommodate it, when it is.
Here I adde moreover, that when other conditions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
are unequall in any great degree, religion can doe no
more then ſhe can doe. Marriage conſiſts of a carnall peece
one way, as well as a religious another way; and we may
ſay of it as of the belly, ſhe hath no eares. When I ſay, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality
of couples is apparant, it is as the claſhing of a glaſſie
body againſt a groſer metall. When a poore party meets
with a rich, a well-bred one with a rude and illiberall, a
curteous with a froward, a bountifull with a miſerly, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with a baſe; one from the Court with another from the
cart or the ſhop; a proper and perſonable, with a deformed,
crooked or dwarfe, what a diſproportion doth it cauſe, and
a kinde of loathſomneſſe? We ſay of the ſame body that its
an uncomely ſight to behold a ſweet face, and a crooked
backe: if it be ſuch a jarre in the ſame, how much more
in two perſons, which can better view each other behinde
and before, then the ſame eye can ſee her owne crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
but eſpecially when two religious ones meet, the
one whoſe diſpoſition lyes on the left and, to froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
melancholy, ſullenneſſe, teachineſſe in an eminent
degree; the other's to meekneſſe, curteſie and amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
what a continuall vexation is it? what a diſcord
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58230:40"/>
of ſounds doth this cauſe? An inſtrument out of tune, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt
to play upon, diſtempereth each leſſon, and diſpleaſeth
every eare.</p>

None are ſo unapt,<note place="margin">Who are unapt</note> but they can alledge one thing
or other for themſelves. Old women marrying yong men,
juſtifie themſelves by this, that they will maintaine their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
and that ſhall make up the flaw, and levels that val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.
Deformed ones marrying faire or perſonable, alledge,
they are penny white: and kitching-maids marrying Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
may ſay, They are good nurſes, and deny themſelves
as much another way. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> To all which I anſwer and affirme,
that none provide for the honour of marriage, ſave thoſe who
provide againſt the ſtaine and diſhonour of unapt marriage.
And yet I muſt adde, that when I urge aptneſſe, I urge it not
in ſo arithmeticall and ſtrict a proportion, and in every point
of aptneſſe, as if elſe it might be no marriage. There is a
diſſimilitude in the ſame kinde, which is no diſproportion in
a divers kinde: and there is a diſcord of tones in the moſt
exact muſicke, making it moſt pleaſing, becauſe ſtill its with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the kinde. I judge not one unequall to another in birth,
becauſe the faſhion of the one is a little lower; but by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
of degree, when gentle marry baſe; noble, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
worſhipfull marry ignoble, and under themſelves in
the whole kinde. Elſe, as the roundneſſe of the eath recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penceth
this or that particular unevenneſſe; ſo may marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
levell petty unequalities. And to this, that inequality
doth no alway follow ſome contrarieties of temper, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they be ſuch as inferre a naturall diſtaſte of each other:
as for example,<note place="margin">Exceptio<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

accord betweene a very provident wife matcht with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident
husband, when the husband counts that gift a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of his defect; becauſe its onely a defect in accident or
quality, not reall. Difference alſo in eſtates, may cauſe a
kinde of neceſſity of diſproportion. It fals out that ſome
impaire or cracke of braine leſſens the repute of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
well deſcended; this diſableth his hopes of any great
marriage. Shall one defect inferre a worſe, a deprivall of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58230:40"/>
marriage wholly? no verily, a woman much inferiour to him
in birth and meanes, or yeeres, ſhould yet be thought a very
good, yea apt match for ſuch an one, and that with reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and honour to her humility, if ſhe be faithfull. A gaine, a
man hath by a former venture, a great charge of children,
which are like to lye upon the hand of a ſecond wife, both
for education and attendance; in ſuch a caſe, a woman of
an hundred or two hundred pounds worth, who is willing to
requite that defect with love and painfulneſſe (being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
competent for her honeſt parentage and faſhion of
life,) may be as equall a match, as perhaps one of a thouſand
pound eſtate, without that encumbrance. Againe, in the
judgement of men, defect of honour may ſometimes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced
with wealth and eſtate: as if a man nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,
yet growne to meane eſtate, hath need of ſuch a
ſupply, though perhaps he faile of ſome degree of the other:
I ſay, if both concur, its beſt; but if the defect doe lye in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
it may be equalled with eſtate; and it were a ſhame for
honour to quarrell with ſuch a wife for unequalneſſe; for then
may ſhe ſay, ſhe hath bought her honour at a ſad rate, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deare tearmes.</p>
               <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">More excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> it fals out, that two marry, the one a man whom
preſent honour and favour with his Prince hath advanced
beyond the ranke of his family; or perhaps, honour hath
gone along with ſwifter pace toward him, then with ſome
other houſe, who yet may be as honourable in times paſt, and
more ancient, then they are preſently, though not with ſuch
titles: if now the one match with the other, ſhall preſent
honour conteſt with ſuch an one as inferiour? No ſure, if
the root be as good, the match is not unequall. Laſtly, in
caſe of perſecution for religion, or of going voyages of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
by ſea to forreigne plantations: in which caſes, ſtrict
equality is not to be mentioned: now in ſuch caſes, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
being to flye or tranſplant, needs the aid of a wiſe head,
or the man the helpe of a diſcreet woman: they cannot
match themſelves in their due rankes, as otherwiſe they
might; therefore looking at the maine point, that is, at reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and integrity of report, they match as neere their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58230:41"/>
as may be: although it prove very much inferiour, yet
it is not to be counted a diſhonourable marriage. Maſter
<hi>Fox</hi> in the ſtory of Queene <hi>Maries</hi> perſecution, reports of
a worthy religious Dutcheſſe of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> which married to
a godly Gentleman, one Maſter <hi>Berty,</hi> (farre under a Dukes
ſtate) with whom ſhe fled the Land, and in that moſt weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
flight (as it proved) found him a moſt faithfull and
loyall husband to the death. So then, if there be a generall
proportion of aptneſſe, ſo that the diſparity lye onely in a
degree, not in kinde, it muſt not be cenſured: all cannot
lye under the Aequator, under the ſame line and latitude; ſome
may admit many degrees off. The truth is, in this confuſion
of all things, its not to be expected that marriage ſhould
keepe quarter with exactneſſe more then other occurrents of
life: in ſome caſes, we muſt abate and yeeld of rigour, left
we ſplit all: Men are growne to enhaſe their degree to an
higher pitch then formerly; and it will be hard to convince
high ſtomacks, of meanes or unequalneſſe; their ambition
hath too high a pitch. Thoſe perſons are fitter to obſerve
this rule, who are meane in their owne eyes, and equall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to thoſe of lower degree. To leave them therefore
with their great hearts and hopes, let me yet yoke them with

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58230:45"/>
might ſeeme not onely to adde light to the Sunne, but to
weaken that which I would ſtrengthen: yet for order and
formes ſake, a word or two may be premiſed for the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereof, I ſay neceſſity in a way of God, though not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute:
for this buſineſſe of marriage without parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
is one of them, which ought not to have bin done, yet
being done, muſt availe, for the avoyding of worſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences:
that is, conſent is not ſo eſſentiall to marriage as
ſome other things are, that the non-concurrence thereof
ſhould diſanull it againe. But in a morall and meet way, its
neceſſary that marriage be attempted with conſent of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
And ſurely, if thoſe heathen Lawes ſeemed juſt which
yeelded unto parents power of life and death, over their
children (ſuppoſing perhaps that love might well enough
be truſted) and thought it meet enough, that they who were
the inſtruments of giving children their naturall life, might
be permitted to be Iudges of the ſame children, in taking it
away; or perhaps rather chuſing, that a parent might kill
a vicious childe for ſome offences, then the childe kill the
heart of a parent, by his diſſoluteneſſe: then ſurely much
more may it be yeelded to parents to have power to give
life or to marre their marriages. I doe not by the way juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the former law, but rather thinke it was a dangerous ſnare,
and betrayed the lives of many innocents, into the hands of
the unmercifull; and no doubt, if it were in force among us,
it would provoke many prophane and malicious perſons, to
ſhed the blood of better children then themſelves. But I
plead the farre greater equity of this law, that parents may
claime a right in the choice of their childrens marriages.
Muſt parents have the worſt of it, and be debarred from the
beſt? beare the burthen of the whole day; the providing
for their children, all meanes of ſupport, education, either
ingenuous or machinall, helpe them to Arts, Stocks, trades,
which is but to be their drudges, if there were no more but
ſo; and ſhall they leave them juſt at the point of marriage,
and betake them to their owne wiſdome and counſell? No
ſurely, it's good cauſe they ſhare in the honour, as well as
the labour.</p>

It it true,<note place="margin">Parents cannot doe as they would in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of their children.</note> God makes matches, and parents cannot (as
they deſire) in ſuch a world as this is (wherein all are for
their owne ends) provide for their children ſuch contentfull
matches as they deſire, but thats not their fault. God muſt
helpe, or elſe they cannot, with the barne and winepreſſe. But
yet in ſuch matches as are offered, parents muſt beare ſway
&amp; ſtroke with their children: though it is not in their power
to afford them ſuch as they wiſh, yet this muſt not cauſe them
to give up their Authority to their children to marry as they

parents themſelves,<note place="margin">Guardians and governours are to looke to their orphans, as well as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in point of marriage.</note> I ſay of Father or Mother in laws, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
and Tutors, who by them, or by the law, are left to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſee
and order the waies of Children, not yet able to guide
themſelves; yea although they be of ſuch years and diſcretion,
as perhaps a parent, at leaſt a ſtep-father, might permit them
to themſelves. Yet it were the duty of ſuch a childe, to take
leſſe rather then more upon himſelfe, and to adviſe ſeriouſly
with them (ere he finiſh ought) whether he have been well
guided or no about marrying religiouſly, or aptly: Some
parents, I grant, have exceedingly waſted their Title, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed
their Prerogative: for, ſuch is their ignorance, and
injudiciouſneſſe in ſuch affaires, (having in truth never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
in any degree, what their owne marriage meant,
much leſſe are fit to guide others:) alſo many are ſo vitious,
and ſo debauched with ſinne, that they have loſt all abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to adviſe, eyther in this, or in any other weighty bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe;
but yet neither are theſe to be deſpiſed, but to be
honorably handled, and eſpecially, if they ſhall deſire to ſee

are to yeeld therto as well as to themſelves. What ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports

and that out of the Councell of Trent, Seſſion 14.

this text onely implyes, Marriages ought not to be made

much more a private civill act of his child to marry. Neither

<hi>Hottoman</hi> a famous Civilian ſpeaks the ſame, in his book of

him, then the barrenneſſe of his own defence, in which
he alway returnes to his old ſong, that though Nature teach
Parents right, yet, not the diſanulling of Marriages upon
non-conſent. Touching which I anſwer, Many reaſons
may inforce the continuance of a thing done (eſpecially in
ſo waighty a caſe as this) which yet argues not the well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
that is all the queſtion. He urges the examples of <hi>Iacob</hi>
and <hi>Tobija:</hi> whereas the one (although ſixty yeares old at
his marriage) yet did nothing without his father and mothers
conſent. <hi>Tobija</hi> (if the Text were Canonicall) had an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
with him to guide him extraordinarily. Indeed <hi>Eſau</hi>'s

like went againſt <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Robecca</hi>'s charge. Much good
doe him with it. He alledgeth a Decree of <hi>Clement,</hi> A ſonne
is not compelled to follow his parents choice. Who doubts
it? But, doth this follow, A parent may not compell his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to marry againſt their will: Therefore a childe may
marry contrary to the Parents? No ſurely. That which hee
addes out of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſhe may chuſe her husband, ought ſhe
not to preferre God in her choice? comes to no more then
this, That a Virgin hath power to chuſe (at leaſt to refuſe
her husband) but yet with parents conſent. The argument
he brings from the validity of the marriage of ſlaves againſt
their maſters conſent, and that, upon the ground of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and ends of marriage, is doubly anſwered: firſt, that
it is true, Maſters cannot barre their ſlaves of marriage, but
yet they may limit the right of Nature, by appointing them
wives, for avoyding wrong to their owne eſtates. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the caſe betweene maſterlike power, is not like to paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:
for the power of the former is onely civill, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58230:47"/>
may be reſtrayned by law; but the other is naturall, and
therefore need no reſtraint: ſince its to be ſuppoſed that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
deſire the poſterity and marriages of their children,
much more then maſters need doe of ſervants. As touching
that objection, that after copulation marriages are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;
this proves not, that the power of parents is diſſolved,
(for what abſurdity is it for one to thinke, that his ſecond
ſin ſhould favour and juſtifie his former offence?) But that,
for divers inevitable conſequences upon the breach of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
already made, it is better for a parent not to uſe his
right, then to uſe it. Its the voice of the Law, <hi>Fieri non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit,
ſed factum valuit.</hi> So much for this.</p>
               <p>Yet as there is no rule ſo generall,<note place="margin">Exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule.</note> but it admits excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo doth this. One is, the barre of Gods law, in caſe of
uncleanneſſe committed by the parties before marriage:<note place="margin">Exod. 22. 16.</note> in
which reſpect God forbad that they ſhould by any meanes
be parted: ſo that here parents conſent was, though not
wholly, yet partly prevented, not in right, but in point of
honeſty, by their lewd children, who forced a neceſſity of
marriage upon themſelves, being become as outcaſts, not
worthy of ſuch care of parents to be caſt upon them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
it was to prevent beggery of the baſtards, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing
of the land by fornication, if they had beene permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to caſhiere ſuch as they had defiled, and to marry chaſte
perſons: for, its better one houſe bee troubled, then two,
(ſince one muſt be) let them eate of the fruit of their owne
labours, and thanke themſelves. The law is mentioned by
<hi>Moſes, If a man finding a maid, defile her, he ſhall ſurely marry
her, becauſe he hath humbled her.</hi> Another caſe is, the ſupine
neglect of parents, when as they ſee offers made to their
children: to wit, when as they permit parties unknowne,
and pretending to be ſuch as afterwards they prove not, but
tainted with lewd qualities, and of no ſuch eſtate as is made
ſhew of: I ſay, when as, through fooliſh credulity they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
all ſhewes, or uſe not meanes to enquire throughly
after their manners and deſerts, but are cheated by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
and hypocriſie: but all this while they harbour
them, or ſeeing that their children are forward in their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58230:48"/>
toward ſuch, ſo, that they are enſnared: and yet the
parents ſuffer matters to paſſe on, and hold their peace: then
the rule of the word ought to be obſerved, <hi>That conſent is
implyed by their ſilence:</hi> and why? becauſe he, in whoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
it is to ſtop evill, and yet doth not, ſeemes to command
it. Not onely if there appeare no more cauſe of breaking it
off, then at firſt, (for then it is onely the headſtrong will of
the parent, unjuſtly diſcontent) but, although there ſhould
breake out more hideous and odious crimes againſt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For it was the parents duty to have uſed all diligence to
have ſearched out the truth of things at firſt,<note place="margin">Duty of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents towards children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſely ſuffered to link them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> and to have
made all other matters cleare, before ſuch time as liberty
be given to the parties themſelves to enſnare themſelves.
For by this meanes it may ſo fall out, that extreame danger
may enſue, both to the party deſerted, and to them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.
Yet this I adde, that all meanes be wiſely uſed, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitch
and diſſolve that league by degrees, which hath long
beene in knitting, rather then to doe it raſhly. Let parents
preſent to both the parties their deepe diſſimulation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
them, betweene themſelves, rather to breake off,
then incurre a tolerable vexation by marriage; and live at
perpetuall feud with them, who ſeeke their beſt welfare.
But, if nothing will prevaile, I ſay, as ſad as the neceſſity
is, yet the parent comes in too late with alledging his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.
If (ſaith the holy Ghoſt) a virgin hath vowed a
vow,<note place="margin">Num. 30. 4.</note> (ſay it be a purpoſe to marry ſuch a man) much more
if ſuch a likelihood be daily preſented to his eye; and hee
forbid it, then he doth no more then his authority may claim,
for he is a parent, and may diſanull it: but if he let it paſſe,
and doe not gainſay it, he is ſuppoſed to reſigne up his right
in refuſing, and ſo to eſtabliſh it.</p>
               <p>Another caſe is,<note place="margin">Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</note> in ſecond marriages of children, men or
women. For although there be a difference of judgement
in ſexes, yet, in this both are reputed to have equall liberty
to match themſelves, and to be diſcharged from the power
of the parent. The firſt marriage made the parties one fleſh,
and divided them both from the parents houſe and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
So that in ſuch a caſe the rule holds not. <hi>Paul</hi> doth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58230:48"/>
not extend the power of a parent over a widow, as to a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.
In the latter, he alway yeelds to a father his liberty: if
he give his virgin to marry, or refuſe to give her, hee doth
well both wayes: that is, foreſeeing the danger of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and withall knowing the ſtrength of his virgin,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 36.</note> that ſhe
is not neceſſitated to marry, he may refuſe, or otherwiſe hee
may yeeld; he offends in neither. But after one marriage is
expired, the widow is not ſo tyed, becauſe providence hath
ſettled her upon her owne right. Howbeit, for the weaker
ſexe, the caſe ſo falling out that ſhee may ſtand in as much
need of counſell at laſt as at firſt, yea of more: this I ſay.
That it were the part of ſuch widows to remember that they
are children, and to aſcribe a reverentiall and honourable
eſteeme of their parents counſell, out of wiſedome and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
although a preciſe command of God doe not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
urge it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Parents muſt obſerve the condition of their children.</note> parents muſt ſtill looke at the maine point, that is,
the condition and ſtate of a childes both body and minde.
For a parent underſtanding the caſe to be ſuch, that a childe
cannot without deepe diſcontent of ſpirit, and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of body, propending ſtrongly to marriage, and ſhunning
thoſe continuall and noyſome vexations, which would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the contrary; I ſay, cannot abſtaine: then, his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
not being allowed him, for the tyranny and hurt, but the
good and welfare of his childe, he ought not unſeaſonably
and rigidly to diſpute his right, or to hold it; but tenderly
and wiſely to releaſe it, at the childes humble inſtance. And
this I might alſo preſſe in other caſes as well as this. But
becauſe they will occurre better upon objections brought
againſt this point: I will ſtop two gaps with one buſh, that
is, both lay downe the extent of this exception, and alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
a queſtion, both in one.</p>
               <p>For why?<note place="margin">Childrens ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt parents careleſneſſe in their marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, anſwered.</note> here it is objected by ſundry children (as I
toucht before) that, as neare as they can, they obſerving the
rules of God, in religious and apt choice, and being now to
ſtrike up the match, they ſay, The parents or guardians (at
leaſt of one ſide) wilfully withdraw their conſent. To whom
I muſt anſwer with much caution, for the ſafegarding of a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58230:49"/>
parents honour: Firſt, ye children beware leſt you put any
unjuſt affront upon your parents, that may cauſe this rigour
you complaine of, and open their mouthes againſt you. For
if you doe, their cauſe muſt be heard when you muſt ſtand
by. Put caſe that it fall out that your match be not faulty,
after your tryall of each other: howbeit you upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
thereof have beene your owne carvers, and carried
all with your owne wits, leaving your parents to ſerve your
turne after: and hereupon the parent being offended, looks
not ſo much at the fitneſſe of the match, as at his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
who can in ſuch a caſe juſtifie you? In this caſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
if the parents be irreligious, and unable to value the
price of a good husband or wife, I ſee not what courſe you
ſhould take, but to humble your ſelves for your offence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
in your owne caſe, how unwilling you would
have beene to be ſo ſerved. Parents, I grant, ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hearken to, but runne and ride to ſeeke out good matches
for their children, if any occaſion be offered, and yet many
of them are ſo ſtout, peeviſh, ſelfe-willed and envious, that
of all other matches, they will croſſe them moſt which are
the beſt. But yet, you children, croſſe not them, by forcing
unequall conditions upon parents, in conſenting to your
marriages. Although you be granted to be religious, yet it
becomes not you to thinke ſo well of your ſelves, that being
unequall in ſtate and ſtocke, or in other reſpects, you will
force the marriage of one that hath great meanes, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of religion. For in this caſe a parent is not bound, but
hath his excuſe. If God ſhould move a parent in this caſe,
conſidering how few are religious or thrifty, to match their
children under-foot for the world in reſpect of grace, it is
well and good: embrace their good will thankfully. But
to obtrude your own worth upon their affections,<note place="margin">Counſell to ſuch children.</note> you ought
not: whether the parents bee religious or not. The like I
ſay, if the diſproportion lye in any other kinde: This by
way of digreſſion; that children bee ſure of it, that their
matches be conſonant and agreeable to the rule; for they
may be godly, and yet not apt matches. But to anſwer the
queſtion, as it lyes, If I ſay your matches be truly equall, yet
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58230:49"/>
your parents will not yeeld: Then, firſt, Let ſuch children
count it the croſſe, that they are fallen upon ſuch parents;
let them not domineere over them, and outſhoote the divell
in his owne bow, of reſolution and ſtomack; but humbly
ſubmit to the parents, as parents in generall, ſeeking by all
meanes to winne their love and reſpect, firſt or laſt, by your
obedience and well-pleaſing: that they may ſee it and ſay,
My child <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by way of mediation, as may beſt alay their oppoſite mindes,

ſupplicating that he would turne the hearts of fathers to

Doves, inſteed of Crocodiles. If all theſe prevaile not, then
(the diſcipline of the Church being in force) courſe ought
to be taken to make complaint of ſuch wrong,<note place="margin">Parents obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to be curbed.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that a

a childes portion from them, as in ſuch caſe is fit: But, if
children cannot meet with ſuch releefe, I leave them under
the croſſe which God hath caſt upon them, to take it up
meekly and beare it,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 25.</note> till God eaſe their chaine. But, if the
father conſent and the mother onely be obſtinate, they may
with good conſcience notwithſtanding proceed, yeelding
all due reſpect to her. So much for this.</p>
               <p>Another queſtion heer mooved is this.<note place="margin">Queſtions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Parents conſent, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> Put caſe that two
parties have got the affections of each other, but the father
on his deathbed, diſſent and forbid the marriage: whether
is the conſcience of the child abſolutely ſo tyed by thoſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable
words, that he or ſhe may not dare to attempt
marriage? I anſwer, that child which out of an honourable
reſpect ſhall wholy forbeare, for feare of after ſcruples; or
ſhall piouſly encline to forbeare, doubtleſſe they bewray a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58230:50"/>
very awfull heart to the counſell of their parent, eſpecially if
they be convinced of an overruling providence determining
the buſineſſe. But to affirme directly, that a child is alway
bound to obey in ſuch a caſe, I dare not. Many circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
muſt be obſerved, next to the rule: and therefore firſt I
ſhall thinke it fit in this buſineſſe, that the parties reſigne up
themſelves to the judgement of ſome wiſe and impartiall
men, who (without playing bootie) may judge whether
ſuch a marriage be according to God, or not. If not, they
ought ſo much the rather to diſſolve it, as being not onely
contrary to parents will, but Gods rule alſo. And then there
is no more to be ſaid in it: for a pious child ought not to
violate ſuch a band as this, upon any affection to the other
party, or like pretence. But if the marriage be found good
and equall: then ought it not to be broken off, through the
parents refuſall at his death: But the will of God being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be for it, the parents will muſt not contradict his.
And hereto adde, that it muſt indifferently be enquired, firſt
whether the parent were a man truly judicious to pronounce
ſuch a ſentence? elſe ſure its a deadly ſnare. Againe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his life he permitted the parties to conſort in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
till they had wonne each others heart: for in that caſe,
his deniall is doubly injuſt: eſpecially if he have actually
given conſent during life, and changed it without ground.
Alſo whether he were not alike various in other his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
eaſily drawne to or fro by ſmall perſwaſion:
Likewiſe whether he have not in other of his childrens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
beene hardly drawn to conſent, no reall cauſe of his
diſſent appearing: whether refuſall might not proceed
from ſome other ſiniſter cauſe, and not the diſlike of the
match it ſelfe; as from privity to his weake eſtate, loth
to disburſe much, aſhamed to come ſhort of the worlds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
for diſcredit ſake, or the like. If probably
theſe things doe appeare, I thinke the bare religion of the
fathers laſt ſentence, ought not to prevaile againſt more
forcible reaſons to the contrary: and upon the weighing of
theſe caſes, the parties ought to thinke that they heare the
voice of God, to beare downe the parents: Although the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58230:50"/>
dead parent, cannot alter his words, yet it may be ſuppoſed
he would have altered it, if he had lived, becauſe he ought.
For this ſo much. If any more queſtions ariſe, I will han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

then doe well without him. It ſhall be as health to thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
and marrow to thy bones: it ſhall procure bleſſing from
thy parent, whoſe curſe is worſe then a Popes with booke,
bell, and Candle. Obey them who are ſet over you, for good,
for their ſorrow will not bee your joy: you provide ill in
grieving them. <hi>Eſau</hi> and his race were Lord Dukes for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

with his wives, loſt him his birthright, and at the laſt
coſt him ruine. Honour thy father and mother therefore,
that thy dayes may be long in the land which the Lord hath
given thee. Say thou deny thy ſelfe a little in this: ſay thou
muſt conflict with a crabbed untractable parent, yet behold
God in a parent, when thou canſt not in a good one: winne
him by humility, conteſt not, a fathers ſpirit will not endure
it: duty may overcome and breake his heart, but wilfull
oppoſition will marre all. And I ſpeake not this onely in
caſe of young couples, living under their parents roofe, but
in what diſtance ſoever they live. Nor, in caſe onely that
the parent be wiſe, ſolid, judicious, holy: for ſuch a one
claimes it by many reſpects: but, even when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unwiſe, irreligious, and obſtinate. The good parent may
pray for thy ſucceſſe, as well as endow and enrich thee. But
the bad and prepoſterous cannot forfeit his right to his
childe, though he may diſable it: he muſt have the honour
of thy conſent, though thou canſt not enjoy the good of it.
Above all, let religious children beware of prevarication in
this kinde; calling in queſtion their ſincerity this way: yea,
though they meet with many rubbes in their way: yet let
them by their good converſation, prevaile with parents,
and ſeeke God to breake and mollifie their parents ſpirits, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to exaſperate. Yea, let mothers have this honour
as well as fathers: perhaps they can better adviſe: howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they have merited this honour as well as fathers. Yea
let all ſuch as are ſet in place of ſuch by marriage of owne
parents, all tutors, guardians, and governours ſhare in this
kinde. Thinke not that your youth and wit can ſee further

dote, and are fooles: but old ones know that children are

bad thoughts of them, baſe qualities of ſervility and hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

It cauſes children to thinke themſelves ſlighted, and as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
points, ſo in marriage, as if parents were too high to
take thought for it. Difference (I ſay) there is betweene
auſterity, and the contrary extreame, of fooliſh familiarity.
For by this, children grow ſo ſawcy and effeminated, that
they thinke it almoſt ridiculous to queſtion it, whether

If we ſhould negotiate in this worke, our children perhaps,
would beſhrew us, for ever after, and never love us more.
We for our parts have given our ſelves content in our wives
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and matches, and we have done well (God be thanked) and

good divinity. They ſee ſmall religion ſerves your turne,
and you are better without it, then with it: and they ſee,
that if they ſhould marry any better then the parents, the
goodneſſe of a wife would be but a ſuperflous object to

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Other parents are alſo ſo inconſtant in their humors, and
aimes at their childrens matches, that they can never come
to a point with themſelves about them: Their hearts are
carnall, and therefore never ſatisfied. For, either on the one
ſide, they are ſo wedded to the peny, that (although they
very well might) they are loth to part with any thing, for
the preſent, to procure competent portions for the children:
Or elſe, they ſeeing their eſtate too narrow for their proud
hearts, and ſcorning that they ſhould match their children
no better, then they can; forbeare altogether to yeeld con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

their childrens matches, for they being led by no
groundes nor ſound reaſons, but fancie, doe perſwade
their children to ſuch matches, as become moſt ſnaring

               <p>Neither are parents guilty onely about the match it ſelfe,<note place="margin">A contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much love to Children.</note>
but alſo the conſequence thereof. For why? through their

ſo damnifie the reſt of their better deſerving children, and

meanes (which commonly falls ſhort, and comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)
or elſe to take debauched courſes, to ſteale, to
ſherke for their living. Thus the folly of parents (upon the
ſequele of their childrens firſt matching) filles the world
with bare yonger bretheren, with hangbies, and idle ones,
ſnaring them with perpetuall diſcord and quarrells, and at
laſt bringing them to moſt diſhonorable ends. No, no: you
parents, be wiſe, God hath made you your childrens carvers:
Set your houſe in order, and doe not make confuſion among

debts, as your heires muſt be faine to take all, and pay all,
and ſo fleece the reſt: Let the eldeſt (carrying himſelfe
well) have a double portion (education being conſidered
which the eldeſt are ſureſt of) and the reſt, a competent
allowance; for perhaps they may do as much good in their
places after, as the elder, if not more, for grace doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

               <p>But,<note place="margin">The 2. degree.</note> above all follies in this kind, that is moſt eminent,
when parents, to make their children great, thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
out of all, that their children might ſucceed them in
their places, holding the candle to them, while they doe all,
and act their parts upon the ſtage. And by this meanes,
both father and mother, which have lived in good ſort all
their time, come in their old daies to depend wholy upon
their childrens curteſie: That part of their life, which of

But, if they may be at good tearmes, upon condition of
being their ſervants both without doors and within, as droils

when all ſtrength and ability is gone, then are they no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

Truſt neither of them in this caſe, for in truth, your ſelves
make the ſnare, and your children put it on you: you wrong
your children in putting that into their hands, which God
hath denied them: Love muſt deſcend, not aſcend: its not

undertake the duty, more cheerfully. Be circumſpect, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
wife and helpfull to your children, (ſo farre as your

tries your love and integrity, by this occaſion. Times are now
growne ſuch, that the beſt parents cannot improve their
love and affection to their well deſerving children, as were
to be wiſhed: the world is at ſuch an high rate, that they
whoſe eſtates are not very great, can hardly light upon a
comely ſutable match, eſpecially for daughters: there being
none ſo meane now adaies, but looke for as good portions,
as in our predeceſſors time, would have beene thought a
very good portion for men thrice above their faſhion: And
it is the diſeaſe as well of the children of God, as of men,
to flight good matches, where exceſſe of portion attends
not: yea, I am perſwaded, its the cauſe why Gods hand is ſo
manifeſt in the ill ſucceſſe of moſt matches, becauſe God
was never ſo little looked at in marriages, as now. But as
for theſe things, let both good parents and children, count
it their affliction: beare it meekely, and leave it to God.
Let your love be nevertheleſſe, to doe them the good you
can. It is not in your power to do all you would: God will

them both joyntly made, either at the firſt, or afterwards,
doe as deepely binde them both before God, and in court

betweene them, is not formall, but accidentall: and both are

                  <hi>viz.</hi> in the deliberate,
voluntarie, mutuall and honeſt reſolutions of the parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves: which being paſt, give the eſſence to
marriage, before the other came, and is the foundation and
ground of the latter: For elſe it might be ſaid, that any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of expreſſion betweene two, before witneſſe, falling
from parties, though in raſhneſſe, or in ſport, or upon a
queſtion demanded, might carry the force of a contract,
which no man of any ſenſe can imagine: to wit, becauſe
the expreſſed contract before witneſſe, implieth a former
mutuall conſent betweene them, not now to be queſtioned:
but yet for ſpeciall cauſes, to be more ſolemnly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
teſtified for avoyding of great inconvenience. And
this appeares plainly by the effect which a contract or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
produceth: and that is a great alteration in the parties,
who before ſuch promiſe, were their owne and had the
ſtroke in their owne hand, to diſpoſe of themſelves as they
pleaſe: But, after their mutuall promiſe, they ceaſe to be
their owne, and paſſe over themſelves, (not their money,
or corne, or goods, but themſelves) each under God to the
other, ſo that now each hath power over other, and onely
one over the other. In ſo much that whatſoever other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
ſhould poſſibly be made, by both of them, or either of
them, to any other, beſides themſelves, if confeſſed, doth
diſanull it ſelfe, and is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> voide, by vertue of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contract
or forepromiſe ſo made: But although it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58230:58"/>
yet it nevertheles bindes them before God, ſo that they
ſhall be for ever culpable before him, of treachery and ſpouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breach,
without repentance. If this were conſidered,
doubtleſſe it would awe the ſpirits of many hot and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayed
yoong ones, from ſuch attempts. But of that after.
Heere onely I ſay, that ſeeing the true nature of ſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
and ſelfe reſigning reſydes as really in a private
promiſe, as in a witneſſed contract, therfore they are not
two things, but the ſame with divers circumſtances for
ſpeciall reaſons, annexed. So much for the acception of the
word.</p>
               <p>To this I may adde,<note place="margin">Reall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacts as good as verball.</note> that in ſome caſes, realls may counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
verballs: when as a thing done implies as much (in the
judgement of a diſcreet man) as a promiſe made in words.
As if a perſon formerly intermitting a purpoſe to marry
another yet hearing, that ſhe is attempted by a new lover,
ſhall repaire to the party and ſay, ſo it is that you know there
is love betweene you and me of a long time depending, ſo
deep, that I dare not in conſcience, yeeld my right in you
to any other; wherefore I pray you, if any ſuch thing be
offred, accept it not: this in conſcience ties the party to
marry her, and is equivalent in promiſe, and if there be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
it concludes againſt him, that ſhall deſert her. Why?
becauſe he defraudes her of a poſſibility of equall weight,
to his owne marriage. So againe, a man hath deſiſted to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
an offer of marriage with a woman, Virgin, or wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
(all is one) and the woman adreſſes her ſelfe to a
farre off dwelling, perhaps thouſands of miles out of the
Kingdome: The man hearing of her drif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, comes to her,
and tells her, that whereas there hath beene ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of love and marriage-ſute a long time, yet now he
cannot permit her to goe that long voyage, his love is ſo
deepe towards her, and therefore diſſwades her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>Here I ſay, that although the woman (if free before) is at
her owne hand to goe, or not to goe, yet if ſhe conſent to
ſtay, the motion made is equipollent to a promiſe of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
and cannot in conſcience nor righteouſneſſe be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58230:58"/>
off by the man. Many like inſtances might be uſed: but
theſe are ſufficient.</p>
               <p>The Vſe, &amp;c. This being thus, what ſhould the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be of ſuch counterfeits, and impudent varlets, who
dare falſifie the matter of a promiſe, that is, impudently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verre
and beat downe a party, that there hath beene a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
and promiſe of marriage betweene them, when as
yet never any ſuch thing was in the world? I ſay ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ought to have the uttermoſt penalty inflicted that the
Law can impoſe: as being an extreame impeachment of
the credit and eſtate of the innocent party, and a marke of
intolerable audaciouſneſſe in abuſing ſo ſolemne a thing, to
any counterfeit ends of baſe wretches, not meet to live in
a Commonwealth. An example whereof wee have lately
had in our Corner, by ſo much the more odious, becauſe ſo
inſolent.</p>
               <p>Before I paſſe from this point of promiſe,<note place="margin">What promiſe for marriage doth bind.</note> it may be asked,
what promiſe doth realize marriage before God? I anſwer:
Firſt, it muſt be mutuall; ſecondly, voluntary or free; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without error; I meane ſuch as doth overthrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
it ſelfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it muſt be mutuall, and equall, not of 
one to the other onely,<note place="margin">A mutual one.</note> but of that other to him? For if ſuch
a promiſe be a putting off ones ſelfe into the power of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
then, as no man can put himſelfe into anothers power
without an act of his owne reſignation of the liberty he had
in himſelfe, ſo neither can each of the two parties give up
their liberties without mutuall conſent each to other. For
in marriage the yeelding up of the right of one, receives a
right in another: and therfore it muſt be mutuall and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.
If one ſhall pretend the promiſe of the other, and yet
ſuſpend his owne, as thinking hereby to tye that party to his
owne time and leaſure, himſelfe being free, he is deceived.
For marriage conſent muſt be mutuall; and the party with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
conſent, doth in that reſpect extinguiſh and make
fruſtrate the others promiſe from ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aring the promiſer: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
afterward the other party alſo ſhall as freely come in
as the other did, and ſo make the promiſe mutuall and equall.

                  </gap>ure enough of her, without any deepe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
himſelfe unto her, pleaſed himſelfe in his conqueſt,
and there reſted: ſo long till the Gentlewoman perceiving
her ſelfe ſlighted, fell to as deepe a diſdaine of him, as hee
had beene indifferent to her: in ſo much as another match
being offered her, ſhe embraced it. But the report thereof
comming to the Gentleman, as he was playing very ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon his Lute, he ſuddenly ſtart up, and breaking his Lute
all to peeces, inſtantly went out of his wits. A notable
Item to all, that they play not faſt and looſe in matter of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> promiſe, and ſpeedy diſpatch of marriage. Secondly,
it muſt be free and voluntary, not drawne forth by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
and ſubtill trickes or polices,<note place="margin">A free or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary one.</note> either of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
themſelves, nor yet their agents and ſpokeſmen: nor
extorted by feare and threats, either of parents, (when they
are deſirous to put off their children for their eaſe, and are
ſet to diſpatch the matter) or by the parties themſelves, (as
when the man menacing the woman, and attempting to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
her, except ſhee conſent, or to doe other violence to
her, doe hereby force a promiſe from her) or any other who
are active in the buſineſſe. And this I would have noted, that
although parents doe not uſe any compulſory and terrifying
courſes, to draw their children to inconvenient matches;
yet if they doe carry themſelves ſtearnly to their children in
an indirect way, and refuſe to heare them who are third
parties, uſing weighty reaſons to diſſwade; or if the parents
doe not rather in meekneſſe convince the childe by reaſons
invincible out of the word, or other reſpects of good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and diſcretion, that its a meet match, yeelding ſtill to the
childes objections, (who muſt bide by the ſorrow, when
the parent goes free) then I ſay, That the overmuch reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentiall
awe of the parent, ſmiting into the childe a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to offend, and taking deliberation a way from it, that
ſo its led in a cord of neceſſity to doe that which elſe it
would not doe: I ſay this ought to bee counted as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion,
and ſuch a childe to be pittied and freed from the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58230:59"/>
Contract: Or, if marriage proceed, and ill conſequences
follow, they muſt be all faſtned upon the parent, not upon
the childe, and the childe may claime the beſt amends. I ſay
then ſuch promiſes binde not in conſcience, becauſe the
princible of willingneſſe is abſent: and the party would
never have conſented, if ſuch feare and compulſion had not
beene uſed. I adde this, except afterward the party being
freed from ſuch feare, and returning to her ſelfe, ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
another conſent free and ingenuous: then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
impediment cannot fruſtrate this latter promiſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. A plaine one without deceit.</note> it muſt alſo be without deceit or falſe opinion:
and that in ſuch a kinde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as oppoſeth marriage eſſentially.
Hence thoſe Heatheniſh preſidents of marriages are fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
when one ſexe marries the ſame, <hi>(Nero</hi> was an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
example) when an Eunuch marries a woman, or a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
marries an Hermophradite (one of the Epicene gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,)
when a man is deceived in the perſon, as <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Lea,</hi>
put into his bed in ſtead of <hi>Rahel:</hi> (notwithſtanding the act
of copulation) but eſpecially, when the party ſuppoſed to
be pure, and a virgin, proves defiled and corrupted: in ſuch
a caſe, if it breake out, before marriage conſummate, it doth
juſtly infringe the promiſe, and makes it of none effect. This
be ſaid touching a binding promiſe.<note place="margin">What that is.</note> But touching this laſt
of error, underſtand it of no other errors accidentall, which
doe not of themſelves croſſe marriage. For, though they
may be ſuch as gave occaſion to the party to conſent, and,
had the error beene foreknowne, the party would not have
yeelded: yet becauſe they diſannull not the reall knot of
marriage, that is, peculiarity of perſon, by defilement, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are preſumed no other then in ſome caſes would
have beene admitted: and therefore the party muſt ſtick to
his or to her promiſe, nevertheleſſe; and therefore let them
either beare it as their deſart for lacke of inquiſition, or if
they did their indeavour to be informed, but were deceived,
let them take it as the triall which God hath put upon them;
the promiſe bindes ſtill, except the other party releaſeth it.
And ſo much for this queſtion.</p>

the other of Reproofe. The admonition is, that

So that its no matter of ſlightnes, and merryment,
no play, no trifle, no ſport, except you will call that a ſport
which may coſt a poore wretch both body and ſoule. <hi>Abuer</hi>
indeed called murder a ſporte, but bitterneſſe was in the
end of it. Be adviſed therefore: and let this point, ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
as a hammer knocke home to the head the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
of marrying in the Lord, and wiſely to looke well
about you, e're you venture. I pray tell me, would you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
make another man maſter and owner of any commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
you have for nothing? ſay it were but your horſe, or
cow, yea were it but a dogg, which you ſet by? I trow not,
how much leſſe of thy ſelfe? Art thou ſo ſeelly as to reſigne
up the right of thy ſelfe, and to make thy ſelfe a priſoner,
a captive, in the priſon of marriage, whence there is no eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.
Surely no except thou art mad, and hateſt thine own
fleſh: thou wouldſt not doe that with a breath, which all
thy worth cannot revoke and undoe? As <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
how thou become ſurety for a ſtranger: quit thy ſelfe
ſpeedily, and deliver thy ſelfe as a Roe, and as a bird from the
net of the purſuer. Man or woman, youth or maid, looke
to your promiſes. I thinke reſignation of a mans or womans
ſelfe to an other, had not need to be to every commer, to
every unknowne ſtranger, to each unchaſt, irreligious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet
companion, which might make thy life irkeſome for
ever. In the promiſe is the foundation of marriage: whether
it be well done or ill, it can be done but once, therefore let
it be deliberately, wiſely and well done. Oh! let it be a
ſolemne thought with you, my promiſe gives away my ſelfe
and takes unto my ſelfe another, my liberty is gone. If a
woman be urged to give up her right onely in a little copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58230:60"/>
ſhe will ſhrug at it, and thinke well of it before hand:
And yet ſhee may poſſibly recover a better peece of land,

You ſhall have leaſure enough to repent, if anguiſh
will ſuffer you. Alſo of all violent parents, who to be ridd
of their children, force them upon unſutable marriages,
which their children had as leive part with their lives, as
venture upon: and ſo bring upon them a laſting monument
of miſery. If ſaith the parent, thou refuſe this match, I will
never own thee for my child, I will diſpoſſeſſe thee of
all? Nay what ſay you to parents who firſt defloure virgins,
and then force their childen to marry the harlots, for
a cover of their owne villanie: Is not this curſed love, and
cruell command of an inocent child? But to be ſhort, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
it rebuketh the baſeneſſe of many, who caſt arrowes, and
deadly things, and ſay am not I in ſport? that is, who ſcrue
themſelves with ſtrong perſwaſions and arguments into
the hearts of ſuch as they ſue unto, and having ſo done,
breake off all againe, and wipe off every crumme off their
mouthes, as if they had eaten no bread: Oh, you maſterleſſe
perſons: what? are ſollemne promiſes but cobwebs,
which great flyes can breake through? Make ye no bones
of them? doe ye ſnap theſe bandes in two as <hi>Samſon</hi> did his
cordes and greene withes? There is one who is ſtronger
then you, who will not be mocked, but bind you for bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
in cheines too ſtrong for you. But perhaps you will
ſay, if it were my lightneſſe and giddineſſe, it were very
ſinfull indeed, and I deſerved never to be truſted more. Yes
perhaps your word ſhall be taken, but it ſhall be by ſuch an
one, as ſhall make you doe penance againſt your will, all
your life for the breach of that promiſe which you willingly
made. But you have ſince that heard ſad reports of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
for inſtance ſake. That the woman is no huſwife, or
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58230:61"/>
is a Melancholique perſon, not fit for your temper, nor yet
(in a ſecond marriage) for your children, or ſhe hath ſome
of her owne, or ſome ſuch blemiſh now you have found
out: well either theſe are true or elſe falſe. Are they falſe?
How baſely minded art thou, whom the pratling tongue of
ſome falſe ſycophant, jangler or goſſip (loving neither her
nor thy ſelfe unfeignedly, ſhould ſhake that affection of
thine, which being well grounded once (as thou ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedſt)
drew from thee promiſes of marriage? But ſay they
are true in part, or wholly? what then? They come in out of
ſeaſon, the ſteed is ſtolen, its too late now to ſhut the ſtable
doore: affections are ſnared, thou maiſt not deſert her. Waſt
thou not in thy owne power before? hath any man forced
thee to reſigne it, ſave thy free ſelfe? Thou art ſnared: and I
ſay, if ſhe ſhould releaſe thee, it were her meeknes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,

was, who defiled a Virgin, for the ſatisfaction of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented

No other ſatisfaction can duely be made her, then
thy returne againe to her with ſo much the more affection,
by how much thy deſerting of her hath beene long and
yrkeſome. Let the falling out of friends, be the renuing of
love: Thou departedſt once, that thou mightſt returne

of ſubſtance without it as with it. Howbeit, I conceive it
to be of very ſpeciall expediencie and uſe, for the behoofe
and good of the parties, as I ſhall after manifeſt. All ſorts
of people, even very heathens have alwaies eſteemed Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſalls,
Betrothings, Aſſurings, Contractings, Affirmings,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58230:61"/>
(for they are all one) to be very ſolemne matters, as the
words they uſe, and the ceremonies then performed, do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie:
So ſacred and reverend it hath appeared to all ſorts,<note place="margin">Contracts ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ancient, and of general uſe.</note> that
there ſeems to be a finger of God, pointing out the uſefulnes
thereof. Witneſſe the aſſembling of the friends of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
on both ſides to be ſpectators therof, that ſo the bleſſing
of it might bee more effectuall. Witneſſe that inſtance of
<hi>Booz</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> who were (as it were) affianced in the
gate of their City, before many ſolemne witneſſes: who
being called forth to teſtifie the contract, did aſſent thereto,
and by their acclamations and thanksgivings, and prayers
to God for them, graced and honored the ſame. So that its
no wonder if the Church of both old and new Teſtament
did practiſe it. And its particularly ſpecified in the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt, that when <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> had been eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
together, before they came together, ſhee was found
with child,<note place="margin">Iewiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts what?</note> of the holy Ghoſt. The Hebrew writers tell us
of the formes and tenor of words uſed among the Iewes,
to wit, that by divers reall ceremonies, they ſtrengthned
the promiſe which had paſſed betweene the parties, and
that in a ſet meeting of the familie. Somtimes they did it
by tickets of paper, written by each of their hands, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by each other mutually. Sometime by very ſolemne
words of obligation paſſing betweene them: ſometime by
a peece of coine given and received, which by the change
of poſſeſſion, argued the poſſeſſion and aſſignment which
one made and ſurrendred to the other: All to ſhew that
they accoumpted this buſineſſe no trifle, or toy, to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly
uſed, for the pleaſing of carnall humors, but a divine
ordinance requiring firme and ſtrong aſſurance each of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The formes were theſe, Lo, thou art betrothed unto
me, or, be thou betrothed unto me, or the like. If it were
without witneſſes, it was fruſtrate. The ſolemnity hereof
was acted under a Tent, Canopie or Tabernacle, ſet up for
the nonce, to ſhew inwardneſſe and ſecrecie of marriage
affection and benevolence. This was diſtinct from the act
of marriage it ſelfe, which followed ſometime after, and
was done with great feſtivity and with many ſongs and

               <p>Touching the third,<note place="margin">Action and performance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the contract. And that ſtandeth in three perſonall acts.
The firſt is of him that leadeth the contract, or guideth the
two parties, to expreſſe their former conſent. Who ought
to be a meet perſon for gravity, and experience, able to teach
them (if need require) the duties of that condition, and to
anſwer ſuch ſcruples as might ariſe in their mindes about it.
In a word, ſuch an one, as by his preſence might caſt ſome
awe and authority upon the mindes of the parties, and aſſiſt
the action with ſome correſpondence. One that may bee
wiſe to diſcerne of the frame of the parties, and therefore
by queſtions may ſift out the truth, to prevent danger, as by
demanding whether they formerly have engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to any other man or woman, perſon or perſons, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them the dangerous ſinfulneſſe of ſuch dalliance: Alſo,
whether themſelves have freely and without feare, and
with the mutuall conſent of parents, teſtified, by preſence,
or by their hand (if doubt be made) conſented mutually
in heart, to this contract. The ſecond perſon, are the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
contracted: who ought to follow him that leades them
in the contract, thus, or in like forme of words; firſt the
man, then the woman: I <hi>Thomas, Iohn,</hi> &amp;c. doe take thee
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58230:62"/>
                  <hi>Joane, Mary,</hi> &amp;c. for my eſpowſed husband, or wife, and I
promiſe to marry thee ſhortly without faile, if God will. And
ſo with ſome ſhort counſel and praier to God to diſmis them,
as true man and wife before God. The third perſon are the
witneſſes produced: who being moved therto, anſwer and
ſay, we are witneſſes of this contract, by which theſe parties
are betrothed each to other, and wil teſtifie it, being required.</p>
               <p>The fourth generall is, the rationall reſpects, in which
ſuch a contract ſeemes very meet to be uſed.<note place="margin">Rationall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects in which a Contract may be uſed.</note> And they may
be reduced to theſe three following. As firſt the ſutablenes
of the contract to the witneſſes of the attempt. It's meet that
ſuch things be done orderly, leaſurely, and by degrees, not
raſhly,<note place="margin">The 1.</note> ſuddenly: and therefore although a promiſe have
paſſed betwixt the parties,<note place="margin">Sutablenes to the weight of the thing.</note> yet as the matter growes riper
between them, ſo its comely that it be no longer kept ſecret,
but manifeſted, that thereby they may be awed with the
more feare and jealouſie of themſelves, from uncomely and
audacious enterpriſes one againſt the others chaſtity. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and all men are liers. And its ſeene as much in this ſubject,
as any others.<note place="margin">To prevent inconſtancie.</note> As hot as youth is in her gare and paſſion,
yet the beſt of their gold prooves braſſe oft times, when
they weigh things in coole blood. Adde hereto, that this
baſe world is full of curioſity, and jangling, talebearers,
and flatterers, who fill the eares of couples with idle and
ungrounded ſurmiſes: whereunto they whoſe eares as cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
doe lye open, and hereby their affections are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
alienated, each againſt other. Thus fooles love lightly,
and leave as lightly, others of themſelves, not knowing

time long before to bethinke themſelves. But who can
make a coate for the Moone? By this meanes, as God is
diſhonored, ſo the party innocent wiſer and of more ſolid
affections is deluded, yea ſometime driven to deſperateneſſe:
And had not here need to be a cord to tie a <hi>Proteus</hi> in a
knot from ſliping? yes ſurely, witneſſes had need be ſolemnly
uſed to witneſſe to the contract, that if they will ſtill be ſo
fickle, they may be compelled to faithfulneſſe, or elſe hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
as their treachery deſerveth. I have heard of ſome who
have gone to the doores of the church to be married, and yet
ſhrunke back. And whereas its objected, may not things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in time worſe which before lay hid? I anſwer yes,
but you ſhould have thought ſo before, and ſuſpended your
promiſes: except you made no other promiſes, then you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented
together to keepe or breake, and that each ſhould
conſent to the others reſolution, either to proceed or deſiſt,
which I thinke is a fulſome courſe, and makes a promiſe
needleſſe and fruſtrate.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reſpect 3.</note> this may ſerve for the benefit of the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.
For,<note place="margin">The benefit of the parties contracted.</note> as it was an ancient cuſtome among the
Iewes when two parties were contracted, to pray to God
for them, and to bleſſe them ſolemnly: and (no doubt) the
parents or ſuch as ſupplied their roomes, did annexe ſome
word of exhortation, to them, from the experience they had,
both how great worke they entred upon, and how raw
and greene they were to digeſt it, ſo I ſay I thinke it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe,
that ſome grave perſon did the like now. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
ought not to be a bare ſurrender of each other; but an
inſtilling of ſome diſcreet watchwordes and charges from
their elders, touching the mutuall duties of both, jointly and
ſeverally, and ſo prayer for a bleſſing to be added. Solemne
things ſhould be handled accordingly even in the outward
faſhion of it: for men are ſenſible and ſenſuall creatures,
and are led by outward objects to inward apprehenſions.
Still I ſay, I do not affirme this courſe to be of the eſſence of
the contract, but yet a very meet addition, if it may be had:
and much making for the better diſpatch thereof. And,
what ſeaſon is ſo apt as this? when the Ewes of <hi>Laban</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:58230:63"/>
were to conceive, <hi>Jacob</hi> (warranted by God) ſet roddes
pilled and ſtraked before them, that the fancie of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being heated in the act of generation, might the eaſier
carrie in the ſpecies of particolouredneſſe: So here, the ſight
of ſo ſolemne a worke is this is, of contracting two, and
making them one fleſh, will more eaſily and throughly ſtirre
the imagination, and the ſenſe being mooved, doth the
more familiarly convey the inſtruction to the underſtanding
and heart. Pitty therfore it is, that the mouldes being ſo ready
to faſhion it, that the melted metall of inſtruction ſhould
be wanting unto them, they being ſo capable. And this I
think is the cauſe, why there be Sermons made at Baptiſme,
and the Supper, at funeralls and ſuch occaſions, to let in the
doctrines of the things into men, (whereunto in generall
moſt are ſo a verſe) becauſe, as there is a ſeaſon for all things,
(which is like apples of gold and pictures of ſilver,) ſo alſo
for this: and that is, when by the novelty and ſtrangeneſſe
of the thing, never done before, the mind is provoked to an
expectation, and ſo ſets the wheels on worke, to receive
and apply things according to their worth and uſe. This for
the third. Only one word more I adde: If any ſhould aske,
what forme of inſtruction were meet to be uſed at ſuch a
time, to the parties contracted? I anſwer, I preſcribed
none: This whole treatiſe following ſheweth their duties;
two or three ſentences culled out of each branch may ſerve
at ſuch a time, if wiſely applyed, as the ſeverall uſe of the
parties may ſeeme to require. So much for this fourth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Generall Touching queſtions.</note> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Now I proceed to the fift generall,  touching the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ariſing out of this contract. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>1</label> The firſt may be, what is
to be thought touching the publication of the contract, in
the aſſembly, and touching the Miniſters act in marrying.
For the former, I ſay, it is a very diſcreet and neceſſary act
of the Church:<note place="margin">Whether pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of contract be neceſſary.</note> for as much as the procuring of the ſafety
and good report of the married, is a point of religion. Now
the private contract of two inſecret, or with a few, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the end of publication; Becauſe its more likely that
the body of a Congregation may ſooner give notice of any
precontract betweene the parties, then a few witneſſes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58230:64"/>
can doe: and as for the parties themſelves if they were
guilty, its much leſſe to be expected, that they ſhould accuſe
themſelves. So that, for prevention of ſuch a confuſion, as
to marry precontracted perſons, what courſe can be too ſafe
and ſufficient? True it is, when all is done, it may proove
but little to purpoſe, through the ſubtilty of the offending
party: but when that is done which can be, the Church is
free: the miſchiefe ought juſtly to light upon the wicked
delinquent. Well therefore were it in this caſe, if liberty
were denied to parties, (at leaſt in ſo common a way of a
fee, without difference, or ſpeciall inquiry about the fitneſſe
of the diſpenſation) from thwarting ſo wiſe and orderly a
device: which being done, people would not itch as they
doe after private marryings, to oppoſe publication, and that
upon humor, and vanity. For through ſuch a baſe cuſtome,
it comes to paſſe, that one learnes of another, and now he
is thought but a peaſent who declines not this lawful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Church. Rather thoſe who be of faſhion and
wealth, ſhould thinke it their honor to ſubmit to this practice:
that they might give the better example to others, and ſo
approve the warrantablenes of their marriage: and ſtop the
gap of privacy and of clandeſtne matches, without conſent
of parents, a world of ſutes upon pretended precontracts, and
as much ſorrow to parents who by this diſorder are robbed
of their children, and cannot underſtand of their marriage,
till it be paſt revoking.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>2</label> The ſecond queſtion is, what is to be thought of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
by a miniſter? The queſtion ariſeth from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of other Countries faſhions in this kind.<note place="margin">What is to be thought of the marrying by a Miniſter.</note> In the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
we ſee it was civilly carried, and diſpatcht by the
Elders in the gate: and now in ſome of the reformed
Churches, we ſee its performed in like ſort, officers being
appointed to take their names, to booke them in a Record,
and ſo with a ſhort ceremony to diſmiſſe them. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> But in my
judgement the practice of our church to do it, by the miniſter
is every way moſt convenient. For by this meanes, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquenes
of the action, makes the matter more ſolemne, awes
the parties much more, both before marriage to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58230:64"/>
ſo, as they may not be aſhamed to ſhew their faces in
publike, to juſtifie what they had done. And if there were
liberty given to parties in this kind to marry upon their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
contracts, what a world of ſinne might enſue, as in
ſome to live in a courſe of defilement, and to abuſe each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
bodies, at their pleaſures: in others to leave each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
even after the knowledge of each other, beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of that vulgar, which cannot be preſerved too warily. I
deny not, but that poſſibly ſome perſons ſo marring, might
do it without direct ſin againſt God: but what's that to the
ſcandall which is occaſioned thereby? we muſt ſo looke
at that we doe lawfully in it ſelfe, as not forgetting our rule,
that we procure things honeſt before men. Whatſoever is
pure, and of good report, that we muſt enſue, and ſo the
peace of God attends us, not elſe. Many acts may be good
in the doers conſcience, which yet are ſubject to the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
and ill conſtruction of others. In ſuch caſes, a man
muſt aske this of himſelfe, if all ſhould take ſuch liberty to
himſelfe, what would enſue of it? And this would checke
his proceeding. The Iewes (as the writers tell us) had a
ſtrange way of contracting couples: to wit, for the better
ſecuring of the match, they permitted the uſe of copulation
for once to the parties, and and no more till marriage, upon
a great penalty: But finding great inconvenience to grow
hereupon, (as no wonder it did) they forbad any ſuch
courſe of contract: and who ſo attempted it, if it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he was ſcourged with rods openly, for reproach ſake.
So much for this ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> Now a third queſtion ariſeth upon this, that in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
diſcourſe I have ſpoken of a lawfull contract:<note place="margin">Whether Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Germans may marry anſwered.</note> that is
lawfully entred upon, betweene ſuch as are within degrees
permitted. So that, its asked here, whether coſen germans
may marry? To which, this I ſay, that I obſerve of late
time many more Divines to encline to the affirmative, then
formerly have dome; and ſome of them, godly as well as
learned: and not onely ſo, but (which I wonder at, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch novell and forbidden things, are too ſoone runne
upon) that they do write for it, and have determined the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58230:65"/>
marriages of ſome in this way, contrary to the affections of
ſome of the parties, bearing them downe by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and giving occaſion (probably) of ſnaring their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
after, when the cruſted ſore ſhall breake out again.
But to the point. Firſt, for my part, I ſhould much reſt in the
generality of that charge, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 6. None of you ſhall
approach to any that is neare of kinne to him, to uncover
their nakedneſſe, I am the Lord. I demand what is meant
here by kinne? Is not it to be meant both of ſuch as are near
in blood, and alſo affinity? And, is there not very great
nearneſſe in blood betweene the uncles ſon and the uncles
daughter? <hi>Tremellius,</hi> as learned a Iew as moſt of our later
Iewiſh writers, in his Diagram upon <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. at the end,
is ſo bold as to take it for granted, That as its unlawfull to
marry the uncle or the aunt, ſo the hee and ſhee couſin ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<hi>(cognatum &amp; cogratam,</hi> ſaith he) and yet alledgeth no
Text for it: as if he would have the matter taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And in the Annotation upon the 6. verſe, he ſaith thus,
<hi>Of thy kin]</hi> that is, of thoſe who are ſpecified hereafter, or
which by Analogy of compariſon with them are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
And, who are they? In the end of the Chapter hee
tells us, in his firſt Corollary, The marriages of Collateralls
(either by affinity or conſanguinity) are forbidden to the
fourth generation. Is not this plaine enough? And he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
There was no uſe of it that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould
name them, the caſe is ſo cleare. I ſuppoſe the teſtimony
of one ſuch Iewiſh Textman as hee, ſhould overweigh the
opinion of many novell writers. But (ſay theſe men) if the
Holy Ghoſt had beene againſt it, might he not have named
it? I anſwer, yes, if he had thought good, out an argument
from negatives prevailes not. Rather, the not naming it,
ſtrongly argues the thing out of queſtion. The Text menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
not the nakedneſſe of the daughter in lawes daughter,
among the forbidden particulars: what then? may a father
in law marry ſuch an one? I thinke not. The ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
is included in the firſt: <hi>viz.</hi> Not uncovering the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in lawes nakedneſſe. Yet here is nothing but affinity
by marriage of the mother: and is it not as rationall that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58230:65"/>
though the uncle or aunts ſonne and daughter are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
farre nearer of blood (though not in the deſcending
line, but collaterall) then they, yet their nakedneſſe muſt not
be uncovered, becauſe the uncles and aunts may not? Tell
me, if the wives brother or husbands ſiſter had not beene
named expreſly, had it been a thing lawfull to meddle with
them? I thinke not. If the uncle bee directly forbidden to
marry his neece, or the aunt the nephew, ſhall not their
children be forbidden to marry alſo, being but one degree
lower? As touching the argument from negatives, it is ſo
weake, that it is gone into a proverbe: and might not a
thouſand abſurdities be as well proved by negation? Dare
theſe men argue thus againſt a Sabbath of the eighth day,
becauſe it is no where tranſlated expreſly from the ſeventh
to be the Chriſtian Sabbath? Againe, what is more common
through the Scripture, then for particulars not named, yet
to be included in their generals? It was not expreſſed in
the fourth Command, that a man might not gather ſtickes
on the Sabbath day: yet becauſe in generall God had
charged that no dreſſing of meat, or bodily labour ſhould be
then done, but all be dreſſed and provided before, therefore
the Lord commanded him to bee ſtoned by vertue of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Commandement. And, are not theſe weake bottoms
for men to warrant their owne, or other means marriages,
becauſe the contrary is not forbidden, when as that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
which is, if not further off, yet full as farre? It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that many of the Patriarchs did thus marry, and are
no whit impeached for it. I anſwer, if that be a reaſon, then
let us marry our halfe ſiſter, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did <hi>Sara;</hi> for ſo hee
juſtifies himſelfe to that <hi>Abimelech,</hi> yet in deed ſhee is my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
for ſhee is the daughter of my father by my mother in
law.</p>
               <p>Doe we not know how <hi>Terahs</hi> family after it came to
Meſopotamia, and ſubſiſted there, was farre divided from
the other families of <hi>Shem?</hi> and therefore ſtraitned much in
their choice? Curſed <hi>Chams</hi> family they were expreſly
forbidden to marry in, as being the nation which God
would root out, and give it the poſterity of <hi>Abraham:</hi> where
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58230:66"/>
then ſhould they marry, but within their owne narrow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily?
And wee may well thinke they did as well as then
could be done, and made ſuch a ſhift as they did: for even
thoſe they married were Idolaters, which was forbidden,
if it could have beene ſhunned: but one neceſſity pardoned
another: better Idolaters under no curſe, then accurſed
Canaanites. If they had had larger breadth, had they ſo ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured?<note place="margin">I make no quarrel, but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But they much preſſe the example of <hi>Caleb</hi> his giving
of <hi>Achſa</hi> his daughter to <hi>Othniel</hi> her coufin german. To
which I anſwer, If it had beene as they ſay, yet it was not
in coole blood, but upon a condition made in generall to
any: but falling out as it did, it might have beene an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by an extraordinary occaſion. But the thing was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo, for <hi>Othniel</hi> is called the ſonne of <hi>Kenaz,</hi> by the ſame
liberty of ſpeech which calls Chriſts kinſmen his brethen.
He was not the ſonne of <hi>Kenaz, Calebs</hi> brother, but the ſon
of his ſons ſon: ſo <hi>Tremellius</hi> upon the place: Brother (ſaith
he) that is, one deſcending from his brother, two or three
Generations remooved. Each Grandchild, and each Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
or ſonne of Nephew, is called a ſonne by the phraſe
of the holy Ghoſt. But I liſt not here, to take off every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
I returne. Put caſe I ſhould grant them their deſire,
that becauſe cozen germans are not named, therefore they
are allowed, yet methinkes there be abundance of things
which prudentially might move men to forbeare theſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.
Firſt, notwithſtanding the long time that this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
hath poſſeſſed the ſpirits of ſome men, yet we ſee, the
blemiſh and crock of it is yet unwaſht out, yea cleaves ſtill
and abides upon it. The mindes of men cannot yet put it on,
as a garment fit for their back: ſtill its a generally queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thing among the moſt, and even by ſuch as are with
much adoe urged to it by ſuch as thinke they ſee further then
all men, yet ſcarſe is the doubt exempt of out them, but they
ſtagger. I make not this an abſolute reaſon, but a ſuſpition
and prejudice againſt it. And why ſhould any man chuſe
rather endleſſely to beat his braine to evince a thing of ſo
doubtfull truth, then yeeld to the contrary practice, which
no man can doubt of? Is it not wiſdome to doe that which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58230:66"/>
is ſafeſt? Can faith and doubting ſtand together? And can that
be done without ſinne which is not done in faith, but wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring?
Surely the Plaiſter which men ſtudy to make for this
ſore, is far too narrow to cover it. Againe, the ſcruple being
unremooved, what apudder doth it cauſe among Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
eſpecially what jealouſie, ſtrangement, and diſlikes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the kindred? We ſhould aime at all communion, not
alienation. Beſides, when God hath vouchſafed ſo great

               <p>And ſurely, if this be a great reaſon of unlawfulneſſe of
marriage betweene degrees forbidden, becauſe thereby
that naturall honour and awefull eſteeme of parents, and

and violated (for what is more repugnant to reſpect
and honour, then the familiarity of carnall commixtion)
then I am ſure the reaſon holds as well betweene cozen
germans as others of kin: for nature hath put as due and
chaſt a reſpect of honour betwene them, as betweene thoſe
who are namely forbidden in Leviticus. But the former is
avowed by many writers, one whereof I produce, <hi>Auguſtin</hi>
his ſpeech <hi>de Civit. Dei,</hi> book 13. cap. 16. I know not how
it comes to paſſe, that there is a kind of naturall inſtinct in

of the parties: I meane this, that although God be in
a contract, yet ſo, as the parties which conſented, may alſo
diſſent, when they finde that conſent did hinder the private
good of their married eſtate. And ſo, when it appeares,
that the one partie is unqualified for the other through many
evills, that break by after intelligence, then they that made
it may breake it. But marriage hath a ſtrength by publique
conſent of the law, and the cuſtome of men, and therefore its
above all ſtrength of private promiſes: and admits no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
by private conſents: The union of contracted
ones, is an union of imagination, or of affection, ſo long as its
within ſuch boundes: But the union of marriage, is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſtate and condition, ſtanding in right, and law, above
all private affection. If private contracts be broken off (as
they ought not without conſent) there is private ſatisfaction
given to the parties: but if marriage be broken off, there is
publique ſcandall given beyond all ſatisfaction. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
wherof tieth the hands of married ones behind them
from all liberty of conſent to diſſolve the knot: becauſe as
it concernes the body of the ſtate to ſee ſinne puniſhed, ſo
to ſee good eſtabliſhed, when it may be ſo. For in <hi>Moſes</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> the hardneſſe of mens hearts was ſo great, that they
would be curbed by no law, each mans will was his law.
But now law having got the upper hand, mens wills muſt
ſubmit: becauſe better it is that one couple ſuffer, then the
law, which is the bond of publique peace and welfare.
So that this authortie looks not at mens private contents, or
diſcontents: But makes a voluntary conſent, which might
have beene broken, to become neceſſary, and irrevocable:
And whereas its inſtanced (as before) in the point of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of incontinency committed before marriage, (not
knowne till after) with that in marriage. I ſay, I deny
not but formerly and really both ought to diſſolve it by the
word, yet (as before I noted) the wiſedome of the Church,
putting difference, is to be regarded: neither is the ſinne
(in every degree) ſo extenſive. In this caſe therefore,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58230:67"/>
that ſpeech availes.: Better admit a miſchiefe, then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience.
Better pull downe a ſmoking chimney, then
admit a continuall ſmoake in the eyes: ſo, better endure a
bad marriage (which is the leſſer) then a breach of law
and right, which is the bond of the whole body. Beſides,
before marriage, the deſerting of the one party, inferres a
liberty to deſert another: the forfeit of the time alotted to
marriage, by the errour of the one party, may forfeit marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
it ſelfe, in the will of the other. Such a portion promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by parents in fraud, and after withdrawne injuriouſly,
diſſolves the marriage becauſe its ſuch a fault asoppoſeth the
condition of the firſt conſent. The like I may ſay of any the
like violations, which yet, after marriage it ſelfe hold not.</p>
               <p>But let me not be miſtaken in what I have ſaid: I would
not be thought to make promiſes of no value, becauſe I
make marriage of greateſt ſtrength and vertue. For, although
we have a rule, that is, in the ſame power to breake a law,
that firſt made it: yet it holds not in contracts, without
ſpeciall warrant. Not each pretended ſuddaine impotencie
of body, not each ſuborned infamous ſlander of the parties,
or either of them, not every deviſed flim-flam of a giddy
braine muſt be accepted to make a ſpouſe breach: (for
what were this, but to open a wide doore to all baſeneſſe,
and to expoſe the lawes of God and man to open contempt
and mockery?) But ſuch caſes as I have mentioned, if they
can be ſufficiently approved to thoſe who are the witneſſes
of the contract, ſo that all doubt of treachery and falſhood
be taken away, then its free for the contracted parties to
deſiſt if they will. Howbeit, not without mutuall conſent
neither: For put caſe that one of the parties pretend debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of body, yet the other party knowing her ſelfe to be in
a way of God, and to be bound to truſt God in his way, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the recovery of ſtrength to the weake partie, or for
ſtrength to waite upon God in the way of diſappointment:
ſhall refuſe to releaſe the other: then I affime that other
partie is tied ſtill by vertue of the contract, to marry. Gods
weakneſſe is ſtronger then mans ſtrength as the Apoſtle
ſpeakes. And whereas (commonly) rationalneſſe and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

the unruly party will depart, the innocent is diſcharged to

and ſhatter thoſe affections which have been ſetled, ſo that
the parties ſhould now ſtagger in their ſtedfaſtneſſe towards
each other, and wax weary through the prolonging of time:
Nor yet (on the other ſide) ſo ſhort, as ſhould hinder their
ſerious addreſſing towards marriage. Both extreames are
to be avoyded. For the firſt, we know in reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that when a contract loſes her ends, through over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
protraction of time, it taxes the doers for their haſty
attempting of that which might have better delayed: occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are given thereby to take offence each at either, that
they ſhould ſeeme formerly to make ſure of that which late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they ſeeme but indifferent unto. Hence may grow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
pritches and ſurmiſes of heart, tending to breach and
diviſion; and ſo worſe may follow, that the one waxing
looſer toward the other then he to them, there may ſeeme to
be wrong received; and ſo the wronged party hearkning
to bad counſell, and conſorting with company of ill note,
may grow to ſome new league, not only out of an unclean,
but even a revenging diſpoſition, thereby procuring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrangement
of heart, and irreconciliable difference. Now
what a baſe and abſured abuſe of the ordinance is here? how
eaſily might wiſedome have prevented all, in removing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of danger? On the other ſide, when the time is too
ſhort, marriage ruſhing rudely upon the Contract in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
it defaceth the characters of inſtruction, which ſhould
have taken deeper impreſſion, and ſo croſſeth the end of a

it at all: For if there bee no difference betweene a preſent
promiſe, and a promiſe ſhortly to bee performed, to what
end is contract, when onely marriage would ſerve? So
that a middle ſpace is beſt: The Iewes at the firſt aimed in
their contract at the ſtriking up and ſecuring themſelves of
the marriages; and after, tooke large liberty of a yeare, or
halfe a yeare, for the conſummation. But after, they found
they loſt as much in the Hundred as they got in the Shire,
and that hereby they endured great inconveniences, many
moe things falling out between, when the cup and lip are
ſo farre aſunder: and ſo, amending their error, they grew
to pitch a ſhorter time. So that it muſt be the diſcretion of a
man which muſt herein moderate it: I would think a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a weeke or ten dayes a compleat ſpace; but becauſe
occaſions may ſo fall out by abſence and travell, that there
is more preſent uſe of the contract, then of the marriage,
and that for ſetling of mindes: and ſometimes when ſpeed
is intended, yet delayes fall out, therefore the due ends of
Contract and Marriage being obſerved, and good conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

not onely becauſe marriage came betweene the act and the

not, that the root of it was errour?) But to make the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of marriage more ſolemne, and to teach people not
eaſily to admit of ſeperations, which I thinke is the cauſe,
why Divorces being once admitted, the guiltleſſe party is
prohibited the remedy of a ſecond marriage; which being
allowed by the Scripture, would not elſe be forbidden now,
were it not for the honour of marriage, and the oppoſition
to Iewiſh abuſe (who uſed Divorces frequently) leſt every
looſe, idle perſon, having the liberty of a ſecond marriage,
ſhould ruſh upon the pikes of Divorce. And ſo (in charity)
its to be judged in the caſe of uncleanneſſe committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
a Contract and marriage, that ſeperation is cut off,
not as if it were not according to the deſert of the offender
(for it muſt have bin ſo among the Iewes, as <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly

eſteemed above the content of this, or that married perſon?

I ſhould greatly pity, but rather ſharpely taxe you for

I pray you, what thinke you of Marriage? Is it a life of
looſeneſſe, and of the fleſh? elſe why are you ſo loth to be
well fitted ere you enter it? Surely, you muſt know, that
Marriage is rather a curbe to the fleſh, and a bridle ſerving
to reſtraine the looſeneſſe thereof. And, doe you affect car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

if by any meanes, you might compaſſe a cheerefull and

how ſtrict? wouldſt thou not take as much paines for a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe?
Nay, for a good Horſe, or a good Hawke? wouldeſt
thou preſume both were good enough, if price enough were

But I cannot promiſe thee thou ſhalt prevaile then, ſo well

impreſſion of God, faith in his alſufficiency and providence,
into your ſelves. And as the Lord of the Mannor, at each
alienation, comes in for his herriot, ſo now, at this your
change, pay God his fine, the beſt jewell of all you have,
devote your ſelves, give up your ſoules to him with mutuall
conſent:<note place="margin">Zach. 12. end. 1. Cor. 7.</note> reſt not in the praiers of others, but ſet cloſe your

               <p>Recognize with your ſelves, what the ſolemne opinion

               <p>And more particularly,<note place="margin">Councells in peciall for ſuch.</note> theſe two things I adviſe you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
Firſt, looke what eſpeciall baſe diſtempers and luſts you
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58230:71"/>
have found to ſway in you, either formerly, or ſince your
purpoſe of marriage, labour to purge them out, that you
may not carry defiled bodies or ſpirits into the married eſtate.
As Phyſitians at the end of a diſeaſe give their patient a clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

ſo doe you: you are entring into a pure and honourable
eſtate: honour it before, by burying all your Idols, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiering
your baſe luſts, that they crowd not in with you
into the wicket of marriage: leſt if you ſhall dare to carry
an uncleane, froward, covetous, diſcontented and unſavoury
heart with you into that eſtate, the Lord ſhall accurſe you,
and make them as <hi>Judas</hi> his ſop unto you, to defile you for

every thing even the very minde and conſcience are defiled.
Secondly, look what feeble ſeeds of knowledge and grace
were ſowne before marriage, you ply and attend them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
for time to come. Promiſe, yea ſecure the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand,
that no contentment of fleſh, no humouring of

When my husband, my wife firſt met me, I was very

deface theſe faire beginnings; it is appointed for good, let us
therfore meet for the better, not the worſe. Take me on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(Lord) as the child takes forth his leſſon, let the ſun of

               <p>TO returne then whence we digreſſed: now it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that we come to the ſecond part of the Honour of
Marriage:<note place="margin">The ſecond generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the honour of Marriage in the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</note> ſtanding in the carefull improving thereof in the
marriage converſation. It is the nature of honour to love
attendance; and they who have found an honourable mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
muſt wait upon it, and keepe it ſo. And it is a true
ſpeech, That it is no leſſe vertue to keepe a mans wealth,
name, or honour, then to purchaſe them. <hi>Iob</hi> tells us, that
God hath denyed wiſedome to the Eſtrich to looke to her
egges, to hatch them when ſhe hath layd them: ſhe forgets
the worke of laying, and leaves them in the ſand, for the
feet of wilde beaſt to deſtroy them. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> willes
that Lady and her children not to loſe the good things they
had gotten,<note place="margin">2. Iohn 8.</note> but to get a full reward. It had beene better,
that ſome had married with farre leſſe ſhewes of goodneſſe,
and hope of thrift, except they had kept it better: For there
is nothing ſo miſerable as to have beene happy. The praiſe
of that good woman in the Proverbs, is not, that ſhe was
vertuous before entrance;<note place="margin">Prov. 13.</note> no, it was her proofe and practice
which made her honoured, and her husband in her. Many
great Captaines have got a ſudden crown upon u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eir heads:
but they have died with a bare title, and loſt it with more
ſhame, then the glory came too which they got it by. Its
not ſayd, that <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were worthy couples
in their entrance; but both in their married courſe, walked
with God. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not onely teach married ones to bee
married in the Lord, and no more; but how to live together
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58230:72"/>
and maintaine conjugall affection, and to keepe that knot,
by ſubjection, compaſſion, tenderneſſe, and faithfullneſſe:
Reſt not in this, (as ſome Scholers doe) that their names
are up, and then fall to idleneſſe, and prove dunces: So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
couples are like the Image made of gold in the head,
ſilver in the breaſt, but worſe and worſe downeward. They
would have their marriage beare up it ſelfe, whereas that is,
as ſhe is uſed: if ſhe be not cautiouſly obſerved, ſhe will
take a tetch, depart, and carry her honour away, ſome huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
and wives, through the ſlighting of religion, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it needles to acquaint themſelves with God, (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith)
in all their complaints, wants, and diſtempers; others by
looſeneſſe of heart in company, whereof they make but ſmall
choice; others pampering themſelves with eaſe and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe,
lying open and naked to a unſuſpected enemy:
ſoone blaſt that honour of their marriage, which at the firſt
they ſeemed not diſhonourable to enter upon. And others
have done the like, by improvidence, by needleſſe meetings,
gamings, or the like idle courſes, others little obſerving each
others temper, and ſo preventing many diſcontents: others
alſo by preſuming to find at the hands of another more reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
and affection: or expecting greater wealth and eſtate,
then they found, grow to diſtates and debates; then to ſeek
ſtollen waters, as weary of their owne ciſternes: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
growes a decay in their eſtates, diſcredit among ſuch
as eſteemed well of them, poverty, and impriſonment, ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from each other. And, what is all this, ſave to caſt
their crowne into the dirt, and to prophane it wilfully?
whereas, had they reſigned up themſelves and the ſucceſſe
of all their hopes to God, walking faithfully and keeping
covenant both with him and themſelves, humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and ſubmitted painfully to their callings of magiſtracy
miniſtery, or private life, without ambitious reatching at
matters above them, they might have kept their crowne and
garland freſh and green: yea ſurely had they ſet themſelves
to embrace thoſe graces of God in each partie to winne
love and amity betweene them, bearing with infirmities,
and covering them with tenderneſſe: how flouriſhing had
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58230:73"/>
their head and honour continued without fading, even to
this day? But, it ſhall be enough in this place to touch only
in the generall, upon the equall neceſſity and coherence
of this ſecond duty, with the former: for all ſuch as would
preſerve their honour inviolable. That which I ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſay hereof, may more ſeaſonably come into the uſe of
that diſcourſe which ſhall enſue, after we have cleered the
point it ſelfe; which becauſe its large, and will coſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,<note place="margin">Honour of marriage to be preſerved, partly by the joint acts of both, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall acts of each party.</note>
let us enter upon it.</p>
               <p>It may then be demanded, wherein this art and skill
conſiſts, of ſaving this honour of marriage ſo unſteined?
The anſwer is, it ſtands in two ſorts of duties; whereof, the
former ſort, concernes both husband and wife jointly and
undividedly to practice: The latter concernes each of them
in ſeverall, the husband apart, and the wife apart. Let us
then begin with the former.</p>
               <p>Thoſe duties which concerne bothe equaly are foure.<note place="margin">Joint acts of the married fowre.</note> Firſt,
Iointneſſe in religion; mutuall love; like loyall chaſtity:
and ſutable conſent. Touching the firſt of religion: my
meaning is, that, as they are entred already with a religious
ſpirit, into their marriage, ſo they muſt continue: not only to
be religious ſtil, but to cleave mutually together in the pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe
of all ſuch meanes of worſhip, and duties of both tables,
as concerne them; I ſay, in the parts of religious converſation
to God. More plainely, firſt that they be joint in the worſhip
of God publiquely, both ordinarily upon the Sabbath (and
occaſionall at other times and ſeaſons) as alſo extraordinary:
The word muſt be heard by both jointly, Sacraments mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
received, prayers frequented, and all the worſhip at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Secondly family duties, concerning both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their children and ſervants, as reading of the
Scriptures, conferring of them, prayer and thankſgiving:
exerciſing thoſe, whom God hath committed to their care,
in the principles of Godlineſſe,<note place="margin">Jointhes i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> worſhip a main preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> and the ſeverall duties of
inferiors: The husband being the voice of God when they
are both together; touching which, more ſhall be ſaid in
the ſeverall offices belonging to the husband. If he be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and there be no man of better ſufficiency to preſent
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58230:73"/>
whom both of them allow of, then ought the wife to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the duty, as hereafter ſhall appeare. Thirdly, and
more eſpecially thoſe ſeverall duties of worſhip, which in
private and apart from the other family do concerne them:
which although they ought to performe alone alſo, yet not
alwaies, but jointly and mutually: as to conferre, read, pray,
confeſſe, and give thanks. Fourthly, they muſt be joint, in
the duties of charity to the poore, harberouſnes to ſtrangers,
reliefe of other both publique cauſes and private perſons,
whom by occaſion, God offereth to their regard. Fifthly,
that mutuall harmony in all religious relations, both towards
themſelves, as inſtruction, reproofe, advice, admonition, or
encouragement; or elſe others, in the Communion of Saints,
(of which reade more at large in my Catechiſme, Part 2.
Artic. 4.) or elſe in their generall, and exemplary conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
in the ſight of the world, which, when it is mutuall,
is reſembled in the glaſſe of each others practice, but if not,
then looſes her beauty as we ſee in the oppoſition which
the holy Ghoſt makes betweene <hi>Abigail</hi> and <hi>Nabal</hi> in
that point.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>E're I anſwer any queſtions about this, I muſt ground
and prove it by reaſons and Scripture. For the latter, it
needs not many proofes. That, of theſe two worthies
<hi>Luc.</hi> 1. 6. may be ſufficient, of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that,
both were upright before God, in all the Commandements
and ordinances of the Lord, without reproofe. In which ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
moſt of thoſe 5. particulers named before, are touched.
That of the Apoſtle may be added, that they defraud not each
other, except in the caſe of faſting, leaſt (ſaith he) your praiers
be hindred: that is your joint communion in religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
Now, if there muſt be ſuch an entercourſe in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
duties, how much more in ordinary? But its object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that <hi>Zachary</hi> cap. 12. bids them in their deepe humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to be apart; this ſeemes to contradict jointnes. I
anſwer. The phraſe is not to be excluſively taken, that
they ſhould alway be apart; for the Prophets ſcope in the
words, is, that there be ſingular uprightneſſe in their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations,
for which cauſe he enjoines ſecrecy, becauſe he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58230:74"/>
mournes truly who mournes without witneſſe, but this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
not jointneſſe in other times and caſes, becauſe fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
being as well required in them, as ſincerity which is
more ſtirred up by mutualneſſe, it is meete they ſhould bee
mutuall in that reſpect, as apart in the other. So that, theſe
two (as occaſion differs) exclude not each other.</p>
               <p>And there is ſpeciall reaſon of this duty:<note place="margin">Reaſons of join<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> religion of couples.</note> For firſt, God
is not now the God of them apart, as before, but jointly, as
married: of them I ſay, and of their ſeed: and therefore
now, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> God muſt be ſought jointly by them both, not onely in

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the good things which they receive from God
 though they pertaine to their ſeverall happineſſe, as their
faith,<note place="margin">Becauſe the grace of each furthers both.</note> hope, knowledge, yet they reach to the furtherance of
each others grace; if they be bound then, to trade with the

much more one with another?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, whatſoever they enjoy, good or evill, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they enjoy it in common:<note place="margin">They enjoy all things both good and bad in common.</note> Their ſinnes are common:
(God may puniſh the one in the other) their gifts and graces
are common, (both bleſſed for the others ſake) their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
are common, (each being a fellow feeler of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
their bleſſings, as health, wealth, ſucceſſe, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
their calling and buſineſſe common, tending to the
common good of them and theirs: their croſſes common,
yea their puniſhments, their poſterity, their dwelling, their
friends are common: Shall their God then bee ſeverall?
Shall their religion and worſhip bee disjointed? No, ſure:
mutuall wants and needs, muſt unite and reconcile them to
one God with common conſent</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Religion is the golden Cement of all fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
and unions, both to knit, and to ſanctifie the ſame more
firmely and cloſely together.<note place="margin">Religon is the Cement of all fellowſhip.</note> That union, which is not
thus faſtened, is but as the union of thoſe foxes, backward,
by firebrands in their tailes, ſoone diſſolved, and very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
The Iewes have a pretty obſervation upon the Ebrew
name of the woman, the firſt and laſt letters whereof make
up the name Iah, God: which if they be taken from the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58230:74"/>
middle letters, leave all in a combuſtion, for they ſignifie
fire. If God incloſe not marriage both before and after, and
be not in the middeſt of it, by this band of religious feare;
marriage is nothing ſave a fire: a contentious and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable
condition: But this conſent of both in the Lord,
is the moſt firme and bleſſed of all. Thoſe tearmes are ever
ſtrongeſt and beſt agreed, which agree in the beſt third, or
couple. Now the Lord is the beſt, and the ſafeſt band.
What a ſweet glaſſe is it for husband and wife to ſee each
others face, yea heart in, to be acquainted with each others
graces, or wants, to be aſſured of each others love and loiall
affection, then to looke how they ſtand affected to the band
of their union, I meane fellowſhip in religion, faith, hope,
and the fruits.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, let us examine this truth, but onely in one prime 
and chiefe act of religion,<note place="margin">From one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, viz. their neceſſity of joint truſt in God.</note> and that is faith in the alſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
of providence: and that will teach us the reſt. What
is the married eſtate, ſave a very ſtage of wordly care to act
her part? Single perſons never come to underſtand what
care meanes, till marriage come. Thats the black oxe which
treades heard upon them. How ſhall this tread be borne, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
faith in the promiſe act another part, of holy careles<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe
(I meane in point of carking?) Surely, as the faſhion
of ſome countries is to hang up a care-cloth in the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
to coole the heat of other affections in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and to put them in mind what an eſtate they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
upon; ſo, well may this cloth of care ever hang in
their chamber, except faith take it downe and faſten their
care upon him that careth for them, cutting off all ſuperflous
carking. Now this grace belongs jointly to both of them:
not only to the husband, who followes the world hard to
pleaſe his wife; but alſo to the wife, who (as the Apoſtle
ſaith) is as ready to pleaſe him. What a gulfe of care doe
both implunge themſelves into, except the Lord vouchafe
them his antidote? What craft, trickes, cooſenages, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
will they not find out, to ſcrape and rake together, all
being fiſh that comes into their net? What clamors, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
and brawles will ariſe, if defeated of their wills?
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58230:75"/>
What baſeneſſe will utter it ſelfe, upon any other expences,
then expected? But let the Lord be their portion, rocke, and
defence, and what can diſtract them: How ſweetly will
both draw in this yoake, if, as they have made God the God
of the hilles, ſo they can make him of the vallies, I meane, the
God of their bodies as well as their ſoules? Now, if this one
joint gift do ſo runne through all their life, what will joint
conſent in all graces do, as hope of ſalvation, fitneſſe to die,
mercy and compaſſion, love, feare, meekneſſe, and the reſt?
All which in their kind, under faith, ſerve to furniſh the
married condition with contentment and welfare.</p>
               <p>Sixtly and laſtly,<note place="margin">Nothing hath ſuch bleſſing annexed to it.</note> what can ſo aſſuredly bring in bleſſing to
the bodies, ſoules, poſterity, families, and attempts of each
other, as jointneſſe of religion? when both are agreed of their
verduict, and one buildes up as faſt as the other? when no
ſooner the one enterpriſes any thing, but the other joines
in a commending it to God, for bleſſing. They not daring
to goe to worke in an unbleſt way, without God. That no
ſooner they ſpie an infirmity, much more a corruption in
each other, but they reſerve it for matter of humiliation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
next time: No ſooner they meet with a mercy, but
they make it matter of thanks, keeping the Alter ever burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with this fewell and Sacrifice: What a ſweet deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is this to both, of pardon and bleſſing? What a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
is it unto them both, that each ſhall ſhare in all good,
when as both doe equally need it, ſo each ſeeke it of God?
When God is made both of Court and Counſell, privy to all
doubts, feares and wants of both, what can ſo aſſure them
of an happy condition, when cenſuring, condemning, or
quarreling each with other, is turned into a mutuall melting
in Gods boſome, for the greefs and complaints of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
when in Chriſt their Advocate they ſanctifie all to

it may hinder the grace of the duty, yet it muſt not hinder

in which reſpect, the wife making ſupply (eſpecially being
eminently better fitted then other women are) doth as it
were, obtaine acceptance of both, as if both could joine, and
the husband could bee the mouth of the woman to God.
This being provided, that her gifts conſiſt in an humble mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
as in other ſufficiency. But beſides alſo, though the
husband be oppoſite to good himſelfe, yet if he connive at
good in her, ſhe muſt not under any pretext, detract the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from God, by his lewdneſſe, and incurre double wrath
from God. Nay I adde further, although he be actually op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite,

be religious in marriage, but how? Forſooth as they were
before: they will goe apart by themſelves, and ſeverally;
but, this jointneſſe of worſhip, they abhorre, as too ſtrict
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58230:76"/>
and needleſſe: They will grant that they muſt read, pray,
conferre, but it muſt be as formerly, either apart, or with
other company; but as for imparting themſelves to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they are loth to utter their ignorance, barrenneſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groundedneſſe
in the principles, or their ſpirituall forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
unthankfulneſſe, lukewarmeneſſe, eſpecially the
defect in marriage duties each to other. Theſe they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
to make each other privy to. God onely is (they
thinke) meeteſt to be acquainted with them: Why? are
you ſuch ſtrangers? Were you not as able before marriage,
as now, to doe this? Are you now in no deeper relations,
then before? Then you could not, but now you may doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
and will you not doe it? I cannot better deſcribe
the folly hereof, then by the fondneſſe of ſuch wives, as
when they ſpeake to their husbands, they call them by their
names, or place, Maſter ſuch a one, or <hi>John, Richard,</hi> &amp;c.
ſo, as any other might call them, as well as they, or as they
might call them, before marriage. Surely the name of your
relation, husband, or wife, I thinke, were fitter for them
then common names. The like I ſay here, ſuch a religion
(I trow) were fitter for you, as might beſt agree with your
neere union; and not ſuch as any unmarried perſon may
enjoy. Woe to him, that is alone ſaith Eccleſiaſtes, for, if he
fall who ſhall helpe him? And, to one, how ſhould there
be heate? (he meanes of generation) But, two are better
then one: how doth this agree with the courſe of ſuch?
They are alone even when they are two: and they are two
(divided) when they ſhould be as one. Surely if they ſhould
claime power in ſeverall over their owne bodies, or power
to have a ſeverall purſe, or a ſtocke going apart, it were
leſſe ſinfull, then thus to nouriſh a worſhip of God, wholy
apart from each other. May any ſo fitly joine in mutuall
confeſſion or thanks as they, who have but one God, and
can (as one ſoule in two bodies) fellow-feele, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
each others caſe as his owne? Is there any rent
ſo bad, as in ſemeleſſe coate? What can this diviſion ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of, but pride, ſingularity, ſelflove? Or how would the
devill deſire to rule, rather then by this ſeperation? I aske,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58230:76"/>
doſt thou hold the body, or the body thee? And, whom hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
thou herein, ſave thine own body and ſoule, by refuſeing
ſuch a ſuccor? Wouldeſt thou not think it an unkindneſſe in
the heart and liver, if it would keep in all ſpirits and bloud
within themſelves, and tranſmit none to the parts? Muſt
it not threaten (as he ſaid once) putrifaction and obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to themſelves, and ruine to the whole? So much for this
firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Branch 2.</note> this reproves all ſuch couples, as are rather
backbyaſes each to others in the matters of God,<note place="margin">Hindrers of each other in ſuch joints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to be taxed.</note> then hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
either in ordinances, or duties. Such as, when family
duties are called for, either by husbands, or wives, then they
lay loggs in each others way, then of all other times, their
buſineſſe ſticks to their fingers, then they have moſt irons in
the fire to attend, errands abroad, or children within, to
runne upon, to dreſſe: If private duties be occaſioned, much
more awek and untowards they are: If any duty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
and mercy offer it ſelfe, viſiting the ſicke, counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the diſtreſſed, helping of the needy, come in their
way, they lowre, and croſſe it, diſnay each other from it.
Nay, and yet profeſſe to be religious nevertheleſſe. Oh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ones! Is this your conſent? Doe you thus honour your
marriage? Did you enter it with ſome opinion of religion,
and doe you thus promote it? Is it not a ſweet noſegay for
you to ſmell to, to heare your husbands alledgings, this duty,
Sabbath, Sacrament, Faſt, had beene done, ſanctified, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
hadſt not thou hindred? Take heed, God will not be
mocked! If this be done by the religious, what ſhall the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious
doe? If this be done in the greene tree, what ſhall
be done in the dry?</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Branch 3.</note> it reproves all ſuch as baſely reſt in the religion of
each other,<note place="margin">Such as doreſt in each others religion, tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> though themſelves looke after none. Many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
good for not hing but for drudgery, yet have a conceit
husbands praiers, their zeale and holines ſhal ſerve their turn,
and under that rotten ragge, they ſhroud themſelves. No, no,
this plaiſter is too narrow for the ſore: If each party will fare
the better for other, both muſt combine, both muſt pray, faſt,
ſanctify their bleſſings and croſſes, wives muſt not plod for
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58230:77"/>
their childrens backes and bellies, leaving the care of their
ſoules and good government to their husbands. What is
this, but to be a true ſlave, but an unfaithfull wife? Rather
ſay thus, husband, I have a part a part in them, as well as thou,
ſure I am, they have received as much of old <hi>Adam</hi> from me,
as thee: Oh, that I had as carefull a ſpirit to traine them up,
as thou. So in other parts of duty, reſt not either of you in
others religion, being barren your ſelves, for each tub ſhall
ſtand on his owne bottome. The goodneſſe of one ſhall not
be imputed to other; but the ſoule that ſinneth ſhall die.
Take heed leſt it be verified, two ſhall be in one bed, the one
taken, the other refuſed! As God hath made you for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to bee one fleſh, ſo ſee that by grace you bee one
ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to theſe may be added the prepoſterouſneſſe of
ſuch couples,<note place="margin">Married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their own fellowſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

boſome fellowſhip, runne into the company of ſtrangers, to
converſe with: to them they impart their marriage diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
crave counſell, adviſe from them, betraying (by their
practice) their husbands to baſe report; all, and more then
all their griefes they powre into ſtrange boſomes, refuſing
their owne, who are much better then themſelves, and then
its beſt done, when moſt privily, and furtheſt from their
husbands notice: But they may never heare of any thing
from them, except with up brading and diſcontent: They
muſt either heare of it from ſtrangers, or not at all. Oh, how
many of theſe houſewives have deceived both Miniſter,
friends, and husbands by their ſubtilty? till afterward their
ſinne betray them, what mettall and ſtampe they are of!
The truth is, their love is unfound, their hearts turbulent,
their tongues querulous and clamorous: But, if their husbands
be taken from them, and their eieſores remooved, then religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſons, and the Miniſter ſhall no more heare of them;
their hearts are upon new liberties, all their gronings are
vaniſht, and the next husband (though leſſe religious then
the former) pleaſeth them better. Oh wofull hypocrites,
thus to colour over a rotten heart, with religious complaints!
God ſhall meet with you, in your kinde, and make your

ſelves at laſt your owne judges, when his plagues ceaze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you! repent beforehand, and prevent them, if you bee

of me ere ignorance neglect this duty, being otherwiſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt:

Indeed in one ſenſe it may be ſaid, they are equally religious,

them: God is againſt them, nothing proſpers: Alas! what
wonder! God is the laſt end of your though, he is not ſet
up in your married eſtate! he is thruſt out into the backe

ſtrange nothing goes forward? How ſhould it? Surely if
it ſhould (as perhaps ſome as bad as you thrive) I ſhould
thinke he meant to deſtroy you! But now, ſince he ſends
this Bayliffe to arreſt you, and filles you with adverſity, I
hope it is to bring you to a parlee (as <hi>Abſalom</hi> in burning

him, in due ſeaſon! Bethinke your ſelves, ſet him up better,

it! picke out the ſecret canker out of this apple, elſe it will
conſume all: And this I adde, although you ſhould ſwimme
in all welfare, and prolong your daies, if this be all your
mourning, for corne and oyle, it ſhall be given you as a curſe:
if you ſee not Gods meaning, and honour not your marriage,
by reſigning up your Crowne, and caſting it at Gods feet,
depending upon him for bleſſing; you ſhall die diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablely,

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label> Fourthly, let this be exhortation to all good couples, who
feare God,<note place="margin">Exhortation to all good couples to be joint in their religion.</note> to be joint in their religion together. And here
give me leave to ſpeake a word or two of ſome particular
duties: and then of your generall converſe. Touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
I would touch theſe two, the one touching family
worſhip, outward, the other touching that grace mentioned
in the fourth reaſon before, I meane faith in Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which is inward. I begin therefore with this. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
both of you, there is but need of it, in this your courſe
of wordly dealing: moſt couples are met to encreaſe carking
and diſtruſt,<note place="margin">Both inward, as in faith, and the like.</note> as much raine to make a torrent. The Devill
will ſo ſtuffe and fill them with carking and covetouſneſſe,
their owne baſe hearts ſet upon the creature, will ſo inflame
them, the error of the wicked will ſo pollute them through
luſt, by their curſed example, that many who met together
in hope to become Saints, after they are met, proove little
better then diſguiſed heathen: Well might the Apoſtle joine
the caveat of marriage here, with that of covetouſneſſe in the
next verſe: and marke his phraſe, let not your converſation
be in covetouſneſſe: the words are, roll not (as the doore
upon her hinges) in the love of ſilver: his meaning is this,
marriage is a rolling up and downe from one carnall buſines
to another: the calling, the looking to children, buying in,
paying out, ſtocking the groundes, raiſing of commodity
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58230:78"/>
thereupon, going out and in, and walking in a round of the
world: nothing but ſcuffling and ſhuffling to get and ſcrape:
except there be this gift of faith to ſeaſon the heart in all
this orbe and round: to ſettle it in the center of providence,
to ſweeten it with affiance in God. Alas, elſe, all the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will be, how ſhall theſe chargabe ſervants be fed? how
ſhall all theſe debts be paid? what loſſes are here in our cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel?
how poore are our takings in our ſhops? our trades
are meane, our children are many, what ſhall we eate, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſhall we be cloathed? Alas, little thought I at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
that marriage had beene of this die, I thought all
had beene white and faire: now I ſee corne, cattell, huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,
houſe wiſery, all lies at the curteſie of mercy, the
ſtocke is out, and except God bleſſe it, may never come in
againe, except God give ſucceſſe, good ſeaſons of weather,
crops will faile, rents will be unpaid, and we may die beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
What? did you think marriage was but a ſong, a ſport, an
hony moone, of one daies jollity? did you not conſider, that
its a perpetuall exerciſe of faith, for your ſelves, for your
children, for your ſervants, and buſineſſe? If you did not,
then learne wiſdome now: God hath ſet you in it, to try
you, what mettall you are made of: whether it will make
you diſguiſed heathens, or gracious believers, who commend
your ſelves and all to God, ſhutting up your ſelves in his
Arke, that the floods of great waters overflow not. I tell
you marriage is a ſtage for faith to act upon, to caſt and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
all upon him, who will care for you, and promiſeth
to doe all your workes for you. Be therefore both of you
juſt before God, walke in this command of faith, as well
as any, yea this before any. Take no carking thought how
children ſhould be maintained, educated, portioned, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
Doe not as one lately did: having one ſonne borne,
he vowed he would have no more, whatſoever came of it,
for he meant to leave that child, all his eſtate, (judge by
the way into what noiſome ſnares a baſe heart brought him
into) and he whould have no more, to be beggers. Would
it be thought, this Divell of unbeliefe were ſo ranke? Why,
marriage will make covetouſnes a veniall ſinne, (worſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58230:79"/>
then the Pope makes it) without faith.</p>
               <p>Be reſolved of it,<note place="margin">Faith the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall prop of the married.</note> faith muſt be your onely helpe, to ſtop
you from drowning in this gulfe. Elſe no farme, or occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying
will be great enough: you would thinke all your life
but a moment, for the ſatisfying of an inſatiable ſpirit? So
many irons at once in the fire, till one marre another, and
overthrow all. Elſe, you will pick quarrels with your trades,
and be ready to forſake them, as faſt as you embrace them,
and ſo wearie your ſelves with loſſes, till ruined. Elſe you
will be ſo ſordid, ſo pinching and baſe in your houſe keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſo ſubtile, falſe in your ſellings, you will grow defrauders,
oppreſſors, uſurers, and cheaters, in your traffique and
trades, ſo eager in your toile, ſo impatient of a defeate,
ſo injurious and unmercifull not onely to your beaſts,
but even to your wives, ſelves, children, ſervants: ſo
baſe in your works of charity, that both God and men
loath and be weary of you. What patternes of ſuch married
ones,<note place="margin">Infinite miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the married through the diſtruſt of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> doth almoſt every towne afford? And when God
frownes upon them, then they knaw their tongues for vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and wax as profane in the firſt Table, ſcorners of
worſhip, and Sabbaths, as before unjuſt in the ſecond. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
live by faith both husband without, and wife within,
this is a joint worke of both: (of your ſeverall duties I ſhall
ſpeake after) doth gaine come in, and wealth abound? Set
not your heart upon it: be not giddie, wanton, ſenſuall:
faith abhorres ſuch behaviour, and ſettles the ſoule in a ſober
frame of thankfulneſſe: doth God croſſe you? Diſtruſt him
not, deject not your hearts, God is able to ſupply it. How
elſe was <hi>David</hi> ſupported, when not onely city and wealth,
but alſo wives were carried captives? ſurely by faith he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
himſelfe in God, and recovered all. Am I in debts?
God will pay them: I came not into them by my ſinne, but
God brought me in, by providence: he therefore ſhall bring
me out: Have I loſſes? God will reſtore them as to <hi>Job:</hi>
Am I ſicke in body? diſeaſed, husband and wife each lying
upon others hand, threatned by creditors, to goe to priſon,
fallen into the hand of a mercileſſe Landlord? faith will caſt
you upon a mercifull God: and although the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58230:79"/>
is, faith will never buy corne nor clothes: yet do but
improove it, and thou ſhalt finde, it will be like <hi>Salomons</hi> ſilver,
and anſwer all things, buy all marquets: She ſerves a
maſter who can mollifie the hearts of the cruelleſt enemy,
will ſooner ſuffer the Lyons to be hungerbit, then his poore
ſhiftleſſe Lambes to want: All the fiſhes in the ſea are his,
his are all the ſheepe on a thouſand hills, all the mines of
red and white earth, all the mony in all men purſes: All
things are Chriſts, thou being his all things are thine, and
ſhall be caſt in as an overplus unto thee: Thou needeſt not
ſay, husband, wife, we ſhall be deſtroyed one day by this
poverty; therefore wee muſt fall to indirect courſes, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to bring in the penny: No; let Atheiſts ſay thus, they
who have a God to truſt to, let them never diſhonor him,
by ſuch doings: thereby making him their enemy, leſt they
be compelled to ſpeake for ſomewhat. He that clothes the
graſſe of the field, and the lillies, which neither labour nor
ſpinne, much more will doe for them that truſt him; you
ſerve no hard maſter, nor one, that needs your ſinne to ſerve
his providence. This faith muſt be <hi>Domina fac totum,</hi> ſhe
muſt doe all and ſuffer all, and carry all, ſhe muſt be the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
houſewife (or elſe in vaine doe others ſtirre) who can
doe more with ſitting ſtill, then all others, though each
finger were a thumbe: By her therefore and her daughter
patience poſſeſſe your ſoules, and commend your ſelves to
him, who will effect your deſire. This for the former parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
for faith in the promiſe.</p>
               <p>The other particular is outward,<note place="margin">Familie du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate worſhip, neceſſary for good couples to joine in cloſely.</note> which is the joint ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of God in the family. Though both of you pray not,
yet the one hold it up in the others abſence, and ſet up God
with both hands in your houſe: Let prayer, reading, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worſhip hanſell your dwelling and ſanctifie it, at your
firſt entrance, and afterward ſeaſon and ſweeten it, and all,
both perſons and things that belong to that: Let all goe
under the banner and protection of God by it. It muſt be
as the Temple morning and evening ſacrifice, what elſe ſo
ever you adde thereto, you may, but this muſt be conſtant.
The holy Ghoſt loves to honour this Sacrifice through the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58230:80"/>
Scripture: <hi>Daniel</hi> would pray at the ſeaſon of it, <hi>Eliah</hi>
would offer his ſacrifice at that time, and ſo the reſt. And
this Sacrifice made all the reſt welcome, and bleſſed, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the fleſh, which is the cuſtome of moſt couples. Looke not
aſquint with an evill eye upon it, to caſt your buſineſſes ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily,
as to trench upon the ſeaſon thereof: as if your

it. Both of you be juſt before God in it: ſtriving who
ſhould goe before the other in it: be no ſnare each to other
not onely by your backwardneſſe and murmuring at it, not
ſo much as in your indifferency of ſpirit toward it: leaſt you
defile each other by it, and ſo you grow mannerly to put it
off at firſt, and then by degrees by any trifling occaſion to
outweare it. Know it, that by the defacing of this, you out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weare
all bleſſing, and goe in the rowe of them of whom
its ſaid: poure out thy wrath upon the families which call
not upon thy name. Be very ſerious to taske your ſelves to
it, to preſſe each other not onely to a performing of it in
generall, to ſay a few praiers, but to bee inſtant, fervent,
and conſtant in it. The ſeaſoning of your children, the awe
and government of your ſervants depends upon it: and
where its wanting, both prove ruinous, and brutiſh, beſides
the miſery of the whole family condition. Vſe all wiſdome
thou man, all prevention and earely care, thou woman,
both without and within, that all buſines and occaſions may
be ſet at a ſtay, and diſpatcht, that this weighty affaire ſtand
not let for them. Be ſure that thy heart ſmite thee not oft in

much more hath his hand in the accorde of reaſonable
creatures, their fellowſhip and league together, as without
which they could not well continue in their welfare &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.
And therefore, for the more ſweete reconciling and
uniting of the affections of one to another in every kinde of
league and fellowſhip, both the more generall and common,
ſtanding in outward commerce, and the more neer &amp; cloſe,
as in friendſhip and marriage; he hath accordingly planted
in every nature, ſexe and perſon more or leſſe Simpathy, that
the one not poſſibly beeing able to ſubſiſt without the other,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58230:82"/>
might by this tye, each love the other, and be knit to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in union and affection.<note place="margin">Not only bred by peculiar inſtinct.</note> This appeares even in the moſt
remote contracts of buying and ſelling, borrowing and len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
wherin although the league ſtand rather in things then
in perſons, yet even there, is ſeene a generall kinde of love,
each man chuſing to trade and traffique with them, whoſe
ſpirit and frame is moſt ſutable to their owne. When God
meant to enrich the Iſraelites by the bounty of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
he darted in for the time ſuch a ſympathie into their
hearts, that they found favour in their eies; ſo that nothing
was then too deare for them, jewels and gold and ſilver,
till they had impoveriſht themſelves. And, in thoſe combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of men which are grounded in law and civill order
in commonwealths and corporations, although there be a
neceſſary bond, to keepe all ſorts within order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
yet there is to be obſerved between thoſe members, a
more peculiar bond betweene ſome then others, through a
ſuteableneſſe of diſpoſition that is in them, whereby for
ſpeciall cauſes, the one doth more tenderly affect ſome one
or other, then the common body can affect it ſelfe. This yet
doth much more appeare in the league of friendſhip, wherin
we ſee God doth ſo order it, that by a ſecret inſtinct of love
and ſympathy, cauſing the heart of the one to incline to the
other, two friends have beene knit ſo cloſe to the other,
that they have beene as one ſpirit in two bodies, as not only
wee ſee in <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> but in heathens which
have ſtriven to lay downe their lives for the ſafeguard
of each other. And that the finger of God is hert, appeares
by this, that oftimes a reaſon cannot be given by either
partie, why they ſhould be ſo tender each to other: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cauſed notby any profitable or pleaſurable meane, but by
meere ſympathy, which is farre the more pure and noble
cement of union, then what elſe ſo ever. Nay, in the very
ſenceleſſe creatures is to be ſeene this amity and neereneſſe,
that as ſome have an antipathy each to other, as the ſhadow
of the walnut is noxious to other plants; ſo, the elme and
the vine doe naturally ſo entwine and embrace each the
other, that its called, the friendly elme; who can tell why?
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58230:83"/>
much more then in reaſonable creatures, it muſt be ſo. And
hence thoſe heathens (that could goe no further) make the
very conſtellations of heaven, under which two are borne,
to be the cauſe and influence of their accord: I know not
what ſtarre (ſaith one) hath temperd my nature ſo fitly
to thine, that we ſhould be ſo united. And another, ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
at one he diſtaſted, tells him, I love thee not certainly,
and yet I cannot tell why, (for thou never hurteſt me) but
this I am ſure of, that I love thee not. What wonder then,
if God for the preſerving of that band which is neereſt of
all, durableſt of all, and the moſt fundamentall of all: hath
much more cauſed a ſecret ſympathie of hearts to live in the
breſts and boſomes of ſome men, and ſome women, that are
to live in the married eſtate, (whereof no reaſon can bee
given, ſave the finger of God;) whereby I ſay their hearts
and affections doe conſent together, of two to become one
fleſh, the moſt inward union of all? Whence is it, that (all
others ſet aſide, ſometimes more amiable in themſelves, more
rich, better bred, and the like) yet through this inſtinct of
ſympathie, (an hidden and unknowne cauſe) two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
together to become husband and wife? Surely by this
it appeares, that by how much leſſe reaſon can be given of
this temperament, ſo much the more God is in it, as purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
by a more pretious and uniting band, then ordinary, to
knit them together, whom he purpoſeth to maintaine in ſuch
a league, as muſt endure, and cannot be diſſolved, when once
it is made. So that we ſee marriage love is oftime a ſecret
worke of God, pitching the heart of one party upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for no knowne cauſe; and therefore where this ſtrong
lodeſtone attracts each to other, no further queſtion need
to be made, but ſuch a man ſuch a womans match were
made in heaven, and God hath brought them together.</p>

it ſelfe herein alſo: even framing the matter ſo, that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58230:83"/>
oftimes where this naturall inclination failes, and where in
likely hood ſome antipathie and contrariety of ſpirits would
appeare; yet, by ſome accidentall endowments of religion,
of education, of eminent naturall parts, of ſweet diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
even that party pleaſes beſt, who yet were as likely to
diſpleaſe as much as any in the generall. I ſay this is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
more generall, then the former: ſo ordering things,
that where meere ſympathy failes, yet another band may
proove (to ſome perſons) as pleaſing and laſting, when as
they ſee that one defect is recompenced, with another emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
and perfection. Who but God hath ſo accorded it,
that many a woman of exquiſite beauty and perſon, like to
attract love enough (in a mutuall way of man) ſhould yet
come ſhort of inward wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, wiſedome and abilities? Surely he
who doth all ſo well, that nothing can bee found out after
him better then he hath made it, hath thus appointed it, leſt
if all perfections ſhould concurre in one impotent ſubject,
the heart would be too big for the boſome, and ſwell into
an exceſſe of pride, and ſelfelove. And on the other ſide,
who hath ſo ordred it, that oftentimes, where beauty failes,
where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther perſon is ordinary, there yet, theſe uncomely
partes ſhould be cloathed with greater honour, of vertue,
underſtanding, induſtry, providence, and other qualities of
worth: and all for this univerſall end, that there might be
an equality? So that whereas the perſon in ſome regards
might be an object of diſdaine, yet in others, might be to a
rationall and wiſe man, a meet object of eſteeme, her gifts
drowning her defects, and ſo ſuſtaining the poore creature
from contempt and ſcorne. Thus doth God by his wiſedome
ſo order contraires, that being brought by his own skillfull
hand to a due temperature, they might cauſe a moſt pleaſing
harmony: ſo that oftimes a nimble wit joyned with a more
ſlow, a phlegmatique temper with a ſanguine, a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
with a merry, a cholerique with a mild and patient
temper, might behold the workmanſhip of God herein
with ſuch admiration, that the frame of ſpirit which in the
generall might ſeeme moſt repugnant, yet in reſpect of the
neceſſarie uſefulneſſe and commodity thereof, might find
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58230:84"/>
moſt favour. And why? ſurely becauſe ſimilitude of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
might breed a confuſion in the married eſtate, wheras
the one quality alaying the other, might reduce the body
to a ſweet harmony and correſpondence. So that ſtill we
ſee God hath an hand in this union of hearts in the married
and although ſome unite through a ſecret ſympathy: others
from ſome confeſſed good and amiable object in the party
loved; yet God is in them both, that by a ſtrong marrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
knot the married couples might eike out that love and
affection towards each other, which elſe neither the
need of each other, no nor religion it ſelfe could alone,
maintaine and preſerve. And ſo much for this ſecond

but a ſweete compounde of both, religion and nature,
the latter being as the materiall, the former as the formall
cauſe therof; properly called <hi>Marriage</hi> love. And this love
is not an humor rayſed ſuddenly in a pang or thoade of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ebbing and flowing; ſometymes when the parties are
ſet upon the ſtage abroad, among company and ſtrangers,
where they woulde acte a parte for their Credit; (for family

Action) but an habited and ſettled love planted in them by
God, wherby in a conſtant, equall, and cheerfull conſent of

is this, of the love of couples: no union of imagination, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

two, (for polygamy is the Corruption of marriage;)
not to be diſſolved till death, except uncleannes divorced it.

Elſe friendſhip were a better one-ſhip then marriage,
becauſe that may be diſſolved, when it waxes a burden, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this holdes, bee it never ſo weariſome. But then is it
happy when the lover and the loved enjoy each other: elſe
the fellowſhip of thoſe maried ones, whoſe love is degenerat
into bitter hatred, were as good as the beſt: for the worſt, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is ſuch, that (till one ceaſe to bee) it cannot ceaſe to bee
a knitting of two in one; no time, no diſtance of place, no ſin
(except adultery) breaking it of: but how miſerable a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
is that, which hath no law, no remedie? Hence God hath
allowed ſo many reſpects and liberties in the choiſe of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
and wives, becauſe he would ſtreighten none, but that
they might live lovingly, except the fault bee their owne. So
that as he who marrieth for other ends, religion beeing neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
offendeth chiefly, ſo doth hee alſo, who ſhall marry
one religious, without due caution of other things which
might ſtrengthen love, even hee ſhall ſin againſt the comfort

compounded of the forenamed cauſes, doth laſt, marriage is
but a carcaſſe voyde of life. And the ſtronger the tie is, the

Hence is the generall rule,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 25.</note> urged mutually upon both, huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
love your wives, as Chriſt loved his Church, and gave
himſelfe for it, to purge and waſh it: that, it might bee
without ſpot: and the like hee profeſſeth upon the wife to
him;<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 4 5.</note> wives love your husbands, &amp;c. nothing is to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall
duty.</p>
               <p>But yet this I muſt adde,<note place="margin">Conjugall love, though a joint duty, to be carried in a ſeverall way.</note> that this ſo mutuall a duty, is yet
required of both in a different manner. For the more cleere
underſtanding whereof, obſerve, that as the love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Chriſt loves his Church is a more abundant and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
love, then that whereby ſhe loves him againe; yea, her
love is as her other grace, fetcht from his fulneſſe, which
he commun cates unto her by his ſpirit, ſo is the womans
love in the carriage thereof to the mans. And as the dimme
light of the Moone borrowed from that principle of light
the Sunne; ſo by proportion, the love of the wife is as bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from the love of the husband. He is the fountaine of
the relation, ſhe followes as the correlative, her love is
the ſtreame iſſuing from his ſpring. Love muſt decend from
him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 134. 2.</note> as the oile of <hi>Aarons</hi> head deſcended downe to his
beard, and his cloathing; So that the manner of this impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
love muſt be orderly: the husband is to offer, to beſtow,
and communicate himſelfe firſt to his wife; in a free, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
full love; ſhe is not ſo much bound to vie upon his
love, or to love bountifully and actively, as to reflect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
upon himſelfe his owne love, and that in a reverent,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58230:85"/>
amible and modeſt maner: Thence is it, that as oft
as <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth the charge of husbands loving their wives,
(which is very frequent) yet he very ſeldome, and but once
urgeth the woman to love her husband:<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 4.</note> (but as if he would
have them, their love and all to be drowned in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection)
he preſſeth them, to be ſubject to their husbands;
wives ſubmit your ſelves:<note place="margin">Ephe 5. 22. 24.</note> and, let the wife reverence her
husband: Noting, that although the married eſtate, be an
equall eſtate, yet the carriage of both muſt not be the ſame:
but the love of the one muſt be conveyed with royalneſſe
without tiranny, the other in loyall ſweet ſubjection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſlavery. So then, as the head and other inferior members,
are equally parts of one body, yet the head in a different and
more ſingular maner, then the reſt: ſo ought the caſe to
be betwixt husband and wife. And hence it is, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the cuſtome of all Nations, the husband ſeeketh the
wife, the wife loveth after ſhe is loved: except is be here and
there in ſome odde perſon,<note place="margin">What that way is.</note> noted for folly or immodeſty. The
mans authority mixed with the womans midneſſe, his
activeneſſe, with her paſſiveneſſe and acceptance, makes the
ſweet compound. As the Sun, exhaling vapours, out of the
earth, draweth them up into the aire, and having altered
their groſter quality, ſends them downe againe with more
foyſon and fatneſſe to refreſh the earth as with her owne
ſtore; ſo, the lovely diſpoſition of a vertuous wife, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
love from her husband, into her owne heart, ſweeteneth
the vapour, and returnes his owne upon him againe with
a double pleaſing grace and comlineſſe. And as we ſee,
that the meate, which the ſtomack receaveth, except it be
cold or hot, ſcarcely admits kindly digeſtion; becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
luke warme, it cannot worke upon that meate which
is like her owne temper; ſo, if you take away this temper
of natures, love is loathſome in one maner and fulſome.
For, what is more loathed by a diſcreet man, then a woman
manniſhly qualited? And, what is more yrkeſome to a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
woman, then a man effeminate? Therfore, let the man
keepe his liberty in loving; avoiding all baſe uxoriouſneſſe,
ſoftneſſe, and nice affection of his wife, and let the woman
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58230:86"/>
ſhunne all uncomely boldneſſe; and taking upon her with
authority in the carriage of her love towards him: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
him to play the Captaine and lead this ſervice of love,
and it beſeemes her, to tread the ſame ſteps, and follow.
This is the wiſeſt contention, whether ſhall love other with
the moſt cordiall affection, in a true way.</p>

excedingly to blame; in that they ſet the cart before the
horſe, dragging (in a ſort, as he thoſe oxen he had ſtollen,
into his denne by the tailes) ſo they, the wives which by
head and ſhoulders they have gotten, into their boſomes, the
contrary way: Sympathy of heart, or amiable qualities
which ſhould attract love towards their perſons, and cover
any ſuch defect as a carnall curious eye would ſtumble at,
theſe they ſet not in the firſt ranke, but as the kite upon the
prey, ſo fall they eagerly upon ſomething in the woman,
neither praiſe worthy nor amiable (for as the Philoſopher
ſaith who praiſes any for wealth, or that which is without)
but either profitable or ſenſually pleaſing: theſe they thinke
will carrie love after it. But by that time they have tried at
leaſure, and found that love is not compelled, but a thing
which muſt be perſwaded, and extracted by ſome deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingneſſe

of, let us alone, I warrant you, we love each other as much
as any body, there is no love loſt betweene us, we have one

when thou fooliſhly, ſlighteſt the due attendance of this

thou wonder, if this thy darling is loſt on the ſuddeine, for

thoſe firſt objects, which won thy love to thy companion:
not run up and downe into all places, with unſavorie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants
of husbandes, and wives! Not looking at the partes
of others, to eſtrange thine hearte at home. Love is a birde
with winges, ſoone gone out of the cage of thy boſome, if it
be careleſſely ſet open. Thou ſayſt thou haſt it in a boxe, but
what if thou looſe box and all? Therfore, ſhunne thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleints
which fools make! Oh! if my husband had the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of ſuch a man, were hee of ſuch underſtanding, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
parts of ſpeech and memory, tendernes and amiableneſſe,
that ſuch and ſuch a one is, how coulde I love him? Then
comes in hee with the like, if my wife had the properties of
ſuch a woman, ſo chaſt, ſo kind, ſo wiſe, ſo able to keep her
tongue, and obſerve the lawes of ſilence or of ſpeech; ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
provident, and the like, as other women have, how
worth were ſhe of love: Dare you thus dally in ſo weightie a
buſines? dare you like the gnat fondly fly about the candle,
as ſecure of burning? Oh unworthie of love, each from other!
ſhould you looke out abroad upon obiects which belong
not unto you, hurtfull, not helpful? to encreaſe emulation and
envie, not affection? what are you the neerer? Poare upon
your owne husband, and his parts, let him be the vaile of your

as the ſunbeames from the wall, that only can holde you in
an invincible league of amity! The marking of each others,
goodnes, compaſſion, fidelity, chaſtitie, which muſt continue
that firſt love, which at the firſt they cauſed. You need not
quench love: its enough that you withdraw this fuell, and
looke upon the infirmities of each other, (the onely dampe,
and choakepeare of affection,) theſe alone will kill it. And
when other fuell failes (as I ſayde before) let religion ſtep
in, and make it up: this will keep harmonie in other diſcord.

but never ſet the ſadle upon the right horſe: the diſeaſe
is within their boſomes, they have loſt their firſt love each to
other, they are waxen ſapleſſe and unſavory in their ſpirit
and affection one to another. While that laſted, all went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

there is a diſſolution of the frame, and a ſhattering of all.

thoſe hideous preſidents, of conſpiracies one againſt the

themſelves to a defilement of their bodies, to be revenged
each of other: meere hatred and ſpite hath drawne them to
ſuch ſinne as luſt alone would not have done. This taſt may
be ſufficient, to warne all, who be not forlorne, to looke to
themſelves to beware how they embeſſel that ſacred ſtocke,
which God hath inſpired all ſuch married ones withall,
whom he meanes to ſuſteine in this ſtate, with integrity

of it entire which is love. Its like that Image in the Capitall,

they kept it in a moſt affected ſecrecy and ſafety. God
hath beſtowed it to make the difficulties of the married life
tolerable; (which elſe, the multitude of them would make

thus, he bids it who better knows the uſe of it, the danger of
the contrary, then ſuch ſilly ones as we. Commands of God,
are folemne things, eſpecially ſuch as ſerve for a trench, for
a fortreſſe, a fence to hedge in an ordinance. He that dares
violate it, ſhall pay for it ſweetly. Therefore, ſet your heart
to obey this rule, and ſay its life or death: Its the crutch of

as full of ſorrow and woe, as its wide and broad, without this

I will therefore reach out one or two motives in particular,
to each party: and becauſe arguments for time paſt, as
former covenants made, great affections in the firſt heat
of youth, like May bees file away, and are ſoone forgot:
I will mention ſuch, as afford themſelves daily to couples
in the courſe of their life. To the man, I ſay, thy wife is
bone of thy bone,<note place="margin">2. Gen. 23.</note> and fleſh of thy fleſh: She is another ſelfe,

deſerving object of love and compaſſion: ſhe hath done
that for thy ſake, which thou wouldſt not have done for her:
for ſhe hath not onely equalled thee in forſaking her father
and mother, and family, that ſhe might be one fleſh with
thine, but ſhe hath forgone her name, and put all her ſtate
and livelyhood into thine hand: if thou ſtick to her, ſhe is
well, if thou forſake her, ſhe hath put her ſelfe out of all her
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58230:89"/>
other ſuccours. Her ſubſiſting is imperfect in her ſelf, its who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubſtantive and real (under God) in thee? As the Lord Ieſus
ſpeakes of the eie, that all the ſight of the body, is within it,
if therfore that be darke how great is that darkneſſe? So, if
thou deſert thy poore ſhiftleſſe wife, and leave her mends in
her own hands, how great is that deſertion? Thirdly, conſider
how much labour is put upon a weake veſſell, daily, in dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
in ſtirring up the commodities of the houſe, in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon children and family, and ſuch providence as is
required of her: Her trouble is great in the peculiar acts of
marriage, great are her paines in conception, in her bearing,
in her travaile and bringing forth, in her nurcery and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, till they be out of hand at leaſt: and ſome women
exceed others in this kind: for ſome ſhift off this work care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly,
and commit their babes to ſtrangers, as if they were
too good to nurſe them, when as yet their breaſts are full,
and their bodies ſtrong: whereas others put forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the uttermoſt, and therefore deſerve double affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Conſider oh man, if not the drudgery of thy wife in this
kind, (if there were not a command and promſe to make it
ſweet) then that finger of God, and providence, diſpoſing
ſo, that a weake one ſhould doe that with patience and
cheerefulneſſe, (as a worke of her place) which all thy
ſtrength were not able to turne thy hand unto: Love her for
that impreſſion of divine wiſedom, which thou ſeeſt ſtamped
upon her: what man were able to endure that clamor, annoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and clutter which ſhe goes through without complaint
among poore nurſlines, clothing, feeding, dreſſing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing

of God, in ſo fraile a creature: the wiſedome of the ſpirit
ſhining in her wordes, counſells, actions, examples, ſhould
bee moſt admirable of all, and the chiefe loadſtone to draw
affection from the husband,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 39.</note> as in <hi>Davids</hi> eſteeme of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail</hi>

               <p>The like may be ſayde of the man,<note place="margin">Motives to the wife to love him.</note> to draw reſpect and
honor from the woman, (if ſhe bee not degenerate) and to
love her husband: For why? In him may ſhee beholde yet
more manifeſt ſteppes of Gods image then in her ſelfe. They
ſay, there is in ſome kindes as much of the Creator in the Ant,
as in the Lyon: in the former, excellent skilfulnes, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
power and majeſty: So here. In the man ſhines out
more authority, government, forecaſt, ſoveraignty, then in
the woman: By the man, as ſhee at firſt received her being;

honor: in a worde (under God) light and defence.
To theſe adde, They entred their league ſolemnly, but they
ſhall part ſadly; A time there is to embrace, but there ſhall
bee a time farre from embracing. Improve it well therefore,
love, live, and leave. Bitter elſe will the review bee of a life
paſt, repreſenting the fruits of a loveleſſe marriage, a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pilgrimage, whereas the memorie of a loving husband or
wife ſhall allay the bitternes of death to the ſurvivor. And
indeed if that indenture which couples firſt make ſolemnly
to God, to keepe this ſacred knot inviolable, and unſtayned,
were well kept: this darling would grow up in the houſe,
as that poore mans onely lambe did, wherof <hi>Nathan</hi> tells
<hi>David,</hi>

die with them together. Some dreame that old folkes are
paſt love: and fooliſhly impropriate it to the heate of youth:
but alas, the anciently married (if right) may as ill want it
as the young; yea worſt of all when old age hath prooved it
to be ſounde; then may the marryed ceaſe to love when they
ceaſe to live. Therfore roll each ſtone to find this grace: buy
it whatſoever it coſt, fell it not, whatſoever you may have
for it: leſt you bee as he who ſolde his birthright: which once
gone coulde be no more recovered, though ſought with
never ſo many teares. And truly for the moſt part, its noted,
that when it once gets a fall, it prooves almoſt impoſſible to
ſoder it againe; beeing as the native heate and moyſture of
the body, which once ſpent (they ſay) is irrecoverable.

is this, if the chaſtity therof be empaired. The wante of other
happineſſes may in a ſort, be ſupplyed in this: the wife is
ſheepiſh, or ſhrewiſh, or the like; but the comfort is, ſhe is
chaſt. Wheras if ſhe be unchaſt, there is no comfort in it, that
ſhe is fayre, rich, perſonable or well bred. The peculiarity of
Marriage ſtandes in chaſtity. I am deſirous that my money,
my land, my friende bee my peculiar ones, and that no man
may have a right in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſave my ſelfe; yet rather then I ſhould
wante them, I had rather have them in a community, then
want them altogether: But chaſtity is ſuch a peculiar of
marriage, that I rather chuſe infintely to have no husband,
no wife at all, then one that is unchaſt. Many endowments
ſo honor marriage, when they are preſent, as that yet being
abſent, they diſannull her not: they make it a ſad, an uncheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
one, but undoe it not: chaſtity is ſo reall, ſo eſſentiall an

and entireneſſe of ſpirit, ſuch as the marryed couples ought
to embrace, cannot ſubſiſt in multitude: the firſt number, two,
are enough, to grow into one fleſh: and love would vaniſh
into luſt, baſenes and brutiſh commonnes, if the bridle were
let looſe into manifolde copulation. Sin not therefore (ſaith
the Prophet) againſt the husband and wife of thy fleſh: nay
ſin not againſt him that made them one fleſh, and onely
them: for that were to taxe his ſpirit and ordinance. And
wherin do rationall creatures differ from ſenſuall, ſave in
this honorable peculiarneſſe, and propriety? which, not the
ſcriptures have revealed, but the verie lawe of nature hath
dictated and engraven in the minds of the very heathens:
who have cenſured promiſcuous luſte with as ſevere
lawes, as the word it ſelfe; many of them I ſay, eſpecially in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58230:91"/>
caſe of adultery. As for that looſenes of the firſt times, where
in men tooke the liberty, both of many wives, and of thoſe
frequent divorces, wherby they ſtayned their bodies with
unbridled pollutious: although the former were permitted
in the firſt tymes of the churche, the number wherof was
ſcant, (being cooped within the narrow boundes of one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily)
and the latter winked at by the Lord, and his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the unavoydable hardnes and rebellion of that
Iewiſh nation: yet neither was allowed of, but abhorred,
&amp; as the tymes grew more enlightned, ſo ſuch commonneſſe
and vagrancy of luſt, grew to be reſtreyned, till it was quite
out of practice. Hence that of the Apoſtle, having diſſwaded
marriage in times of danger and perſecution: Nevertheleſſe
(ſayth he) to avoyde Fornication,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 2.</note> let every man have his
owne wife, and woman, her husband. And in the rules given
to Miniſters, the ſame Apoſtle foreſeeing what a ſad preſident
the common ſorte would ſnatch to themſelves from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Miniſter; preciſely chargeth him, that if he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
(which he forbiddes not) yet he ſhould bee the husband
of one wife.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 2.</note> Noting doubtleſſe, that all Chaſtity is not ſeene
in abſtinence from ſtrange fleſh: but in the reſtreint of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
from colouring over uncleannes, with a marrying of
many; which is a double ſin, not onely mocke-adultery, but
a defiling of an ordinance with that pollution which it
abhorres, and ſinne (as it were) by priviledge. And let
every man (ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> learne how to preſerve the veſſel of
his owne body,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4. 4.</note> in holines and honor: marke how the one
goes with the other!<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 16. 17.</note> why doth he preſſe it? becauſe its the
<hi>Temple</hi> of the holy Ghoſt; and he who defiles the temple of
God, him will God deſtroy. We neede go no further to prove
this duty of Chaſtity, to be the Crowne of marriage, then that

he having humbled her: whats that? Surelye he hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her
honor of chaſtity away: her credit is gone. And fitly in this
text, the Apoſtle prooves marriage to be Honorable by the
undefiledneſſe of the bed: God (ſaith he) hath put honor upon
it (as carnall a thing as it ſeemes) powre not you any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

who ſeeke to maintaine their honour unſtained, nothing
doth cleave ſo deeply to marriage as this: I have noted
before ſome accidentall ſtaines by unequalneſſe, when La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and their horskeepers, young girles and old men match
together, when a Prince marries a beggar, a bad with a
good, a chriſtian with an heathen or heretique, or if marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
proove contentious and unpleaſant, who ſees not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach?
But theſe are ſuch ſtaines, as may be waſht out in
time; either by repentance, or (in a ſort) by ſecond better
marriages. Onely the ſtaine of unchaſtneſſe, is like an iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mole,
which nothing can fetch out; its like the leproſie
which fretted into the walls; no ſcraping the ſtones could
clenſe it,<note place="margin">Levit. 14 44. 45.</note> but it muſt be demoliſhed: Death may end the
parties, but not the memory of the ſhame: <hi>Davids</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
tooke away the guilt, but not the reproach, that abides
to this day. So then, as I have began with the duty of love,
(which muſt be the firſt, and inward cement of couples (for
whats chriſtall worth if it be broken?) I ſay, as loves is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
band of preſerving, becauſe the outward action fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the affection: ſo now, I proceed with chaſtity,
which is the maine Charter of love, and the patent thereof,
evidencing that the heart loves entirely, becauſe the bodies
are kept pure from pollution. I deny not, but there are
thouſands of none of the moſt loving ones, nor religious
ones, who yet loath adultery and filthineſſe in this kind:
but yet there are many alſo, not the worſt for repute, whoſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58230:92"/>
marriages are ſpotted with this ſtaine: and all to ſhew,
that where the roote wants, ten to one, if the branches doe
not wither. The reſtraint of providence is ſuch by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
light, that many are kept perforce from this diſhonour.
And yet this proves not, but that the inclinations and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of others are ſuch, that they lie open to this ſnare,
as much as to any. We muſt not neglect the urging of the
duty, becauſe ſome are innocent: for ſome are ſo in ſame who
are not in deed, and ſome in deed, who are not in ſpirit, and
ſome in ſpirit and yet no thanke to them: let the point faſten
as it may: and fynd out the guilty: (the guiltleſſe are out of
the compaſſe of it.) But the age is generally debauched, and
iniquity carryes all as a flood before it; Although the ſecond
part of this Treatiſe, treating of the denunciation againſt
this ſin, may perhaps more fully diſcover this diſeaſe with
the cure of it: yet here (by ſo fit occaſion) I ſhall preſſe
the jointneſſe and honor of the duty, by a few reaſons, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and motives.</p>

No other fault (if once the marriage be lawfully conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated)
doth jnferre iuſt ſeparation (by authority of the
word) ſave this of uncleanneſſe. Therfore needes muſt
that which mainteins union bee the greateſt pillar and prop
of marriage. Proſtitution of the body, profanes the honor
of it and caſts it into the myre: and therfore the Cardinall
vertue that muſt beare it up, muſt be this Chaſtity. If ſo, then
ought it by joint conſent to be maynteyned by both parties.</p>

honor of pure marriage requires both to conſpire in mutuall 
chaſtity, yet the defilement of eyther party is ſufficient to
overthrowe the honor of it.<note place="margin">The defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of each party, is enough to defile the whole ſtate of marriage.</note> As we ſay of a vertuous action,
all points muſt concurre to make it good, but any one defect

doth not need the conſent of both the parties diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty:
if one be diſloiall, its as good as both. Not before God
in point of guilt: but men in point of honor: for to manward,
guilt and reproach, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58230:93"/>
difference: the innocent party, being pittied with as much
diſhonour, as the guilty is reproached. Therefore this joint
duty of chaſtity muſt be ſupported moſt carefully, by the
joint care and pureneſſe of both parties. Adde hereto, that
defect of this joint cloſeneſſe may bring a ſhame upon mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
(though perhaps not ſo great yet as true) as well as
a greater crime committed. As the Philoſopher ſaith, glory
is not in the glorified, he is but the object; the agent is the
glorifier. Therefore fame and report is well called by ſome,
the married ones Saint. For by fame they either ſtand or
ſinke. Now, how eaſily may fame ſnatch the leaſt neglect
of the married in this kind, to raiſe ſuſpicions? How cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
curious had they need be of their courſe, and pureneſſe,
who cannot keepe their owne honour in their owne power
ſometime, doe what they can? Is it not the miſery of manie
to be defamed without cauſe? Neither ſmoke nor fire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
but perhaps ſome miſtake, error, or advantage of a
foule mouth being the ſparke that kindleth the fire: And
yet it ſometimes little availes (for the point it ſelfe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)
whether a man be guilty, or be taken ſo. How great

it is a law of the members, in a double ſenſe, a dye in graine;
but yet, ſo long as it is abhorred, oppoſed, and quenched by
all poſſible diligence, it ſhall not be imputed: (provided that
the meanes to ſubdue it, bee not ſlighted.) But I ſpeake of an

God hath not ſeparated: I give to all who would ſhunne
this plague, the counſell belonging to it, ſoone, farre, ſlowly:
Get from ſuch occaſions, as ſoone: goe from them as farre;
and returne to them as ſlowly as poſſible thou canſt. If
thine eie, thy right hand, or foote cauſe thee to offend, pluck
them out, and cut them off, (not as <hi>Origen</hi> did carnally) and
caſt them from thee; but make thy ſelfe a ſpirituall Eunuch
for the Kingdome of God, and for chaſtity, uſe all contrary
meanes, of holding under thy fleſh, and boxing it till it be
black and blue (to uſe <hi>Pauls</hi> word) if thou wilt preſerve
thy veſſell in honour:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> yea, count all too little. If this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
be meet for the married themſelves who are under the

touch not pitch leſt thou be defiled.<note place="margin">Iob. 31. 1.</note> Make covenants with

your knife to your throates, if ye be given to your appetite,
and venture not upon forbidden dainties, to try if they will
ſurfet you. But, if after all meanes, both of prevention, and
preſervation of body and ſpirit from this tainte, yet you
feele your natures to recoile, and concupiſcence to want
eares,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 7.</note> then heare that voice behind you, ſaying, marry

carry this rule of prevention with you into that eſtate,
leſt you marry and burne too, and ſo the diſeaſe will, if
not be worſe for the remedy, yet may prove never the better
for it.</p>
               <p>The third is,<note place="margin">The third, chaſtity of the bed.</note> the chaſtity of the bed. The Apoſtle tells
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58230:97"/>
us here, the bed is undefiled. Surely (as hee told his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
at his death, they ſhould find their Kingdome, ſo I may
ſay of this) It is as its uſed, and kept. For its the great
wiſdome of God, which hath ſo concealed our infirmity, and
covered it with honour, that the bed ſhould be honourable.
But it imports us ſo to keepe it then: and that, againſt a
double infirmity. The one of ſnaring, the other of defiling
us.<note place="margin">Two extremes here.</note> By ſnaring, I meane, defrauding each other, by any
meanes, under any colors: as when by diſcord, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of mindes, the body is diſabled: when the one party,
denies due benevolence to the other;<note place="margin">The firſt.</note> by pretended ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes,
to ſatisfie a baſe heart: when religion and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or infirmity are falſely alledged to croſſe the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
In this caſe let the Apoſtle overrule: Let the husband
and wife,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 3.</note> yield each to other, &amp;c. refuſe not the lawful and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
uſe of the remedy, (except when both in private conſent
in ſome extraordinary duty, for ſome little ſeaſon before) ſome
adde the preparation of the Sabbath, rather I ſuppoſe from a
pious heart, then the warrant of the word, although I
wholly yeeld to the equity of that abſtinence, ſo there be no
ſnare of a rule: for hee that generally followes this light
muſt not be ſnared by any rule (except he have vowed it
voluntarily, and then it bindes in another kinde.) But, I
leave the deciſion of that, to the wiſdome of ſuch as can
diſcerne between expediency and inexpediencie, leſt Satan
prevent us: for we know his devices how he ſeekes to ſnare
them that are weake, againſt their intentions, and under
colour of a better pureneſſe, hee ſeekes to breed a wearineſſe
and diſdeine of the ordinance. He is an uncleane ſpirit, and
cannot brooke that which holineſſe hath invented, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
ſin. Let ſuch as are privy to this rebellion, humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and repent, remembring that marriage takes off the
propriety which each had before in himſelf, and gives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the power of the body of each to other without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
And, there is more in this, then moſt will take
notice of. And ſome openly profeſſe that they abhor this
judgement, being yet expreſſely grounded upon the letter
of Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:58230:97"/>
The ſecond extreme is on the left hand,<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> when men abuſe
marriage to a defiling of themſelves, and under pretence of
generall lawfulneſſe, runne into exceſſe. This is as odious
as the former. Its not the wiſdome of a Chriſtian, to chuſe
the uttermoſt brinke of the river to walke upon, becauſe it
threatens ſlipping in: nor of his liberty, becauſe its allowed.
Our greateſt offences are commonly about thinges lawfull,
when as we dare not attempt the unlawfull: whereas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is much more tried in the uſe of liberties allowed us.
And its ſtrange under what ſorry and thin covers, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of one will ſhroud it ſelfe when as once it hath caſt
off the love of cloſeneſſe: halfe a loafe is better to a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
then no bread. Whereas a ſound ſpirit ſhould thinke
thus, In this God tries me, what mettall I am made of, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to betender of a command, when I have the bridle laid
upon my owne neck, or to runne away with my uttermoſt
liberty, when I have ſome granted to me. Doubtleſſe hee
who will take all that he can, in liberties, ſhewes he is but
kept in by violence, in commands, and but for ſhame, would
deſire Gods cordes were more ſlacke, and ſuted to his luſtes.
I ſpeak, becauſe it might ſcarceſly be believed what baſenes,
immoderateneſſe, and licentiouſneſſe growes in many even
by the occaſion of the former point, of benevolence. They
will ſtretch it beyond the boundes of modeſty, and bring

place ſhould teach the younger to be ſober) ſhould rather
aime at being under the line, then above it. But as it is not
youth (where there is a chaſt ſpirit) that can provoke to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
in this kind: ſo neither is it age (in any profeſſion) if it
be once tainted with defiledneſſe, which will perſwade men
to moderateneſſe: but as bruite beaſts, their will is their law,
and even in thoſe things they know, yet they corrupt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the griefe and ſad woe of their companions, who
know not how to redreſſe it. Loth I am to ſpeake that in this
argument, with many ſentences, yea in two wordes, if one
might ſerve; and heartily wiſh, which yet never will bee
obteined, that (at leaſt) the religious might be lawes to
themſelves in ſuch kinds. But the experience of the contrary
may plead ſome pardon for that little I have ſaid. Some
muſt ſpeake, and where more aptly, then in a treatiſe for
the nonce.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall we know when this due meaſure is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?<note place="margin">Markes to know the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the bed.</note>
Surely then when ſnaring concupiſcence is prevented,
and fitneſſe of body and minde therby purchaſed, freely to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58230:98"/>
walke with God, and to diſcharge duties of calling, without
diſtraction or annoyance. And ſo doing, much fredome may
be enjoyed (both the former extremities being avoyded) and
Gods wrath prevented: which I cannot ſay, whether it more
hangs over the heads of ſuperſtitious Papiſts, for vowing a
forced chaſtity, contrary to the expreſſe rule of the word, or
upon married perſons,<note place="margin">Popiſh forced chaſtity.</note> for abuſes in eyther of the two kindes.
Concerning the former, we know both into what odious
enormity of luſte the Lord hath ſuffred them to be plunged,
both unnaturall, and unlawfull; making them the execration
of the world, for their luſt. Touching the latter, I leave it to
the experience of the wiſe to conſider;<note place="margin">And affected Abſtinence from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Bed compared.</note> Both what vexation

each other; who afterwards, ſeeing what wofull ſnares they
have brought themſelves into, as ſeeking the Company of
harlots and adulterers, have bin deeply terrifyed, wiſhing too
late, with ſorrow, that they had denyed themſelves and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
them to the ordinance. And ſo for the other extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
when due regard of Chaſtity hath bin neglected, what
weaknes, diſeaſes, inability of body and minde to calling
and duty hath enſued!<note place="margin">Inconve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſence of both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt abſtinence and exceſſe of liberty compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> Yea further, when preſumptuous luſt
hath broken boundes, of womanly modeſty, compting all
ſeaſons alike, what markes hath God ſet upon their owne
bodies for their incontinency, &amp; ſo upon the bodies of their
Children, yea and upon their mindes, and whole conſtitution,
the one by diſguizement of countenance, the other by defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledneſſe
with the like ſin, (for what was bred in bone,
will not eazily out in fleſh:) when as I ſay, men have met
with theſe penalties, then they have juſtly confeſſed wrath
to ceaze upon them. And indeed, although there were no
religion, yet if men were but Philoſophers, to underſtand the
naturall miſchief and poiſon of ſuch wayes, they coulde
not but loath them. Therfore, let a wiſe mediocrity be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:
ſanctifying our fellowſhip and fruite of bodies by
earneſt prayer, that both may be cleane to us; Make not that
helpe, which God hath given as water to quench, as oile to
enflame; There is a white Devill aſwell to corrupt, as a black
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58230:99"/>
to abhorre the remedie. But ſuch debauched filthines the
looſenes of our age is come to, in all kind of luſt, that I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
thinke if thoſe chaſt <hi>Platos</hi> and Lawgivers of old times,
were now living, although Heathens, yet would be ſcorned
by many Epicures and Libertines in the Church: who thinke
it a curbe to their will, not to live as they liſt, worſe then
beaſts, and Savages. Be we therfore, who ſtand to Gods barre,
a rule to our ſelves, following the ſteps and practice of
ſuch, as in our owne degree, and ranke go for the moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
in eyther ſexe. As hee ſaide of the endles queſtions
ariſing about morrall actions, let it bee, as a wiſe man would
judge, ſo I ſay of this: for queſtions of this nature are ſo
impoſſible to be decyded punctually, as other the like are of
faſhions, and liberties of our common life, that except they be
put to a comprimize, there wilbee no ende made. So much
for this third.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt Chaſtity is that of the body.<note place="margin">The fourth &amp; laſt head of the mutuall duty, is the Chaſtity of Body.</note> This I
make one duty by it ſelfe. For although its true, that if the
three former were kept, this would follow alone; yet I ſay,
when all is done, the body is not to be truſted too farre. This
ſin of uncleanneſſe is a running ſore in our fleſh, hardly cured.
Even many (otherwiſe good) perſons, though kept from
the act, yet by all their ſtrife have ſcarſe felt themſelves free,
through a bodily propenſeneſſe to this evill. And Satan is
ready to do in this, ſo in other ſins, even by how much the ſin
is loathed, by ſo much the more to exaſperate this ſin: not to
ſpeake of the falls of thoſe worthies in Scripture. So that,
except there bee a ſpeciall arming our ſelves, againſt Snares
objected and layd in our waies (which are innumerable in
the lives of ſuch men, as have to meddle in the affayres of
this life) and that, with reſolution, both before, and upon the
occaſion, to preſerve our ſelves: all our former courſe taking
to ſhunne temptations by our ſenſes and the like, will do us
no pleaſure, when they are brought home by the Devill to
our doore, and layde in our lap, preſented in a Lordly diſh,
with ſecrecie, eaſe and fayre Colors. Meere ſuddenneſſe of
affront (marke what I ſay) when nothing elſe could do it,
hath prevented ſome, that it hath made them all their life,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58230:99"/>
ſlaves and miſerable. Take heed, bring not uncleane bodies
to the marryed eſtate and bed: leſt being marryed, this dog
be not eaſily rated from the carrion. There muſt aſwell bee a
fidelity of body as ſpirit, an holy ſtrength to ward off blowes,
to cut off deadly temptations by the middle, by our well
ordred members, as not to call them in, by well awed ſenſes
and carriage. Chaſt <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was not only reſolved not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
himſelfe to ſin,<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 8.</note> but when he ws ſuddainly ſurprized by
the offer of an harlot unſought for, he abhorred the object,
as if he had beene warned beforehand. Its one thing for a
man to have grace, another thing to have ſuch a preſence of
it, that when our baſe hearts are in a readines to embrace,
preſent grace is nearer the doore to thruſt it away, &amp; abhor
it. There is more danger in a prepared ſnare, made ready
to our hande, then in the ſpeculation or foreſight of that,
which may poſſibly befall us. So much for this fourth: which
I call Chaſtity of the body, in a ſpeciall ſenſe, to note, even
how the whole man ought to be as well ſtrengthned againſt
the ſuddenneſſe of a temptation, as beforehand kept from
the meanes leading therto. And perhaps there are ſome ſorts
of men, whoſe ſad experience will conſtrue my meaning
herein, better then others can.</p>

hedge, thou mayſt feare leſt a ſerpent bite thee, how much

is the woman whom thou choſeſt for the companion of
thy youth: tranſgreſſe not againſt her therefore. Let her love
ſatisfie thee, and her affections equall thy embraces: let thine

of it, betweene you both: and keep chaſte till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58230:100"/>
of the Lord Ieſus. Know that this is an equall duty of
both, God having beſtowed the power of each over other,
upon both: Thinke not thy husband tyed to this rule, O wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
nor thou thy wife tied, O husband, and the other free:
the tye is equall.</p>
               <p>Its not jealouſie of each other,<note place="margin">Againſt baſe and unjuſt jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie it is moſt odious.</note> which can preſerve this
honor; no, its the Canker of marriage. Bathſheba deſcribing
the condition of a good woman, tells us, The husband of
ſuch a woman,<note place="margin">Pro. 31. 11.</note> reſts in her, his heart ſetles upon her. Nothing,
that a wiſe man, obſerving vertuous qualities in his wife,
iudgeth her the ſame towardes himſelfe, which he is to her.
A good man (ſuch an one as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was to <hi>Mary,</hi> a juſt man,
one that had no worſe thoughts of jealouſie towards her,
then ſhee had to him, loth to entertaine the leaſt ſuſpicious
thought againſt her) will alway eſteeme her by himſelfe.
Why ſhould I thinke, that her Conſcience, Chaſtity, is not
as tender to her, as mine to my ſelfe? what can it come from,
ſave a baſe heart, enclined to treachery againſt my wife,
that I ſhould imagine, my wife ſhould bee falſe to mee?
Surely were it not a ſin, to do ſuch a thing, or wiſh it done,
it were but juſt that an unjuſtly jealous husband ſhould
meete with that he feares, that ſo he might be jealous for
ſomewhat. Many civilly chaſt women, having bin drawne
to commit this folly, by no greater motive, then the vexation
of jealouſie: as not fearing God, and therfore thinking they
were as good commit it, as be alwayes falſely charged with
it. And marke it, Its commonly the ſin of couples unequall
in yeeres, who having marryed yonger husbandes, wives,
then themſelves, lye ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this temptation, Alas; I am too old
to give him, or her content, they ſeeke ſuch as are like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
when as yet the parties are as cleere from ſuch aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
as the child new borne: what? haſt thou offended once,
and is there no remedye but thou muſt ſoder it by a worſe?
I ſpeake not, as if I would make men Pandars and Bawdes
to their wives, through their folly and careleſſe confidence,
expoſing them to any temptations, and winking betweene
the fingers, for what is this, ſave to give ayme to a chaſte
woman, to be lewd? No, But to ſhame that impotencie and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58230:100"/>
baſeneſſe of either ſex, whereby each is prone, contrary to
the good cariage, and approoved converſation of the other,
yet to ſurmiſe in them, falſehood and ill meaning. What can
be ſuch an incendiary, to ſet all on fire between couples, as
this curſed miſchiefe of jealouſie? which is ofttimes (upon
meere miſtake of ſome word, guiſe, or action, nothing
tending that way) rooted in the ſpirit of man, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that neither all the aſſurances of truth betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
nor yet by mutuall friends, can compound the matter
ſo, but ſtill there muſt be a pad in the ſtraw, and ther ſmoke
muſt argue ſome fire: And yet when all is done, it prooves a
meere Idoll of fancie, nothing in all the world.</p>
               <p>The Lord indeed appointed a triall for the jealous man,
againſt his wife: but wee muſt not conceive this was to
breed or nouriſh cauſeleſſe conceits: it was no doubt firſt
brought to the judges in criminall cauſes, to determine
what the matter was, and (as our Inqueſts doe) to cut off
all meere ſurmiſes: elſe what a bondage had it beene for a
wife to be ſo hurried and defamed? And although it be true,
that for the hardneſſe of their hearts, the Lord permitted
more liberty to men at that time, (being ſturdy and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious)
ſhould that be any encouragement now to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to nouriſh ſuch traſh in themſelves to make their
ſpirits, their prayers, their whole life ſad and miſerable
to themſelves, and to be ſo imbittered each againſt other,
that even when they would faine ſhake off their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
they ſhould not be able? I ſay no more of this elfe of
cauſeleſſe jealouſies: but this for the party ſinning, no man
ſhall need to wiſh his greater torment, then himſelfe hath
created to himſelfe; let him thanke himſelfe, that his owne
ſinne hath eaten up the marrow of his bones. The greateſt
pity is to the party innocent and ſinned againſt, who is to
be adviſed, while there is any hope of recovery, to ſtrive by
all caution and exact circumſpection of carriage, to tender
the weakneſſe of the other, hoping that love rather then
anger hath bred it:<note place="margin">Remedy of the innocent party.</note> but by no meanes diſdaine them, and to
walke looſely under pretext of innocency. But if the diſeaſe
be ſo rooted, that it will not be healed; let them enjoy their

uprightneſſe (for the way of God, is ſtrength to the upright,
as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 29.) and not be diſmaied: but
looke up to God, who can cleare their righteouſneſſe as the
noone day, and plead their cauſe againſt their oppreſſour:
joyning prayer to God to quit them accordingly. This I
have ſaid of injuſt jealouſie: as for that which is juſt, I ſay
as much againſt the guilty party, wiſhing the law were as
ſtrong now, as it hath formerly beene againſt all violaters
of this ſacred knot. And for this branch ſo much.</p>

one judgement, one mind, one heart, one ſoule in two
bodies; the ſpirit of the wife in the husband, and his in the
Lord. That which the flatterer ſaith in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>edy, (the hatred
of the name beeing remooved) that ſhould the wife ſay to
the husband: Sayſt thou a thing? So ſay I. Denieſt thou? I deny
it too. And in a word; I am prepared for the nonce to agree
with thee in all things, good &amp; honeſt. What is more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to behold in marriage, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wherof it is a Reſembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
I meane, the harmony betweene the Lord Ieſus the head,
and the members, to wit his Church? Reade the Canticles:
See how the Church ecchoeth her husbands voyce, in all he
ſpeaks, ſee how ſhee pleaſes her ſelfe in his comely propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
attire, geſtures! And he againe in hers; how ſhee depends
wholly upon his becke and countenance, joies in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58230:103"/>
mournes in his abſence, repozes her ſelfe in his boſome,
beeing aſleep, watcheth his awaking, followes after him,
hangs upon him in his departing, longs for his returne, and
having loſt him, runs after him as one diſtracted, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraies
her life to be bound up in his, as <hi>Iacobs</hi> in <hi>Benjamins.</hi>
This inward complacence, welpleaſing, and welapayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of couples in each other, is the very quinteſſence of
marriage peace, and contentment. As in the myſticall body
of Chriſt, we ſee what an inſtinct is in them, to maynteine
their owne beeing in the welfare of each other. All envy,
wrath, ſuſpicion, jealouſie, unkindnes, pride, cenſure, and
whatſoever elſe ſavoring of ſelflove and ſeperation, beeing
odious to them. Each doing his owne ſervice, content
with his owne portion, mourning with any that is ill at
eaſe, and glad of their welfare.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this conſent muſt be in the ſpeech and language
of them both:<note place="margin">2 Conſent in ſpeech, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the married.</note> Its true generally, but in this point ſpecially,
That ſpeech is the diſcoverer of the mind: Looke what the
abundance of the heart is, that will vent it ſelfe at the mouth.
So the husband and wife ſhould anſwer to each other, as
<hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> to <hi>Iehoram,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Kings 3. 7.</note> I am as thou art, my people are as
thine,<note place="margin">Pro. 27. 19.</note> my horſes as thine. Yea, the ſpeech of each to other,
ſhould bee (without flattery) as the glaſſe, to behold each
other in. As face anſwers to face in the water, ſo doth a
man accomodate himſelfe to his friend (ſayth <hi>Salomon)</hi>
how much more the husband and wife to each other? They
ſhould even reſemble each the others frame and temper (in
the Lord) with all ingenuity. As the beames do repreſent the
Sun, in her heat and light: ſo ſhould the ſweet carriage of
the wife, argue the body which gives her influence, even her
husbands vertues.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, there ought not onely to be this harmony in
preſence onely,<note place="margin">3 Conſent in common life and occaſions of it.</note> but in abſence alſo, even in the way of their
Converſation: abroad in company, in duties of Sabbath, of
Chriſtian communion, whether together or aſunder, ſuch
ſhould be the reflexion of a wives carriage, that all that ſee
her, may ſee the wiſdome, thoughts, affections of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in her: not a carriage of her owne, as of one ſevered
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58230:104"/>
from his way ſlighting his, as if ſhee were wiſer; but humbly
ſubmitting judgment, will and ſpirit to his in the Lord: and
where there is any difference, ſo it be grounded, keeping it
ſecret, and acquainting God with it, as ſhee did when ſhe
felt ſtrife in her wombe, that he might reconcile it, and ſettle
it aright in time: For in ſuch a Caſe, diſcreet concealment
will far ſooner reduce them together, then open expreſſion
of their differences. The actions of the one ſhould bee the
ſhadow of the others, yea a modell thereof. As it was once

their Marriages! And that then they have quit themſelves

jarring and jangling, and pleaſing their froward, and ill

or dare you nevertheleſſe, board, converſe and bed together,

What a pageant is this for the Devill to laugh at? how out

all the darts of diſtempers. If the Lord will not be entreated
one way, ply him another: Remember an heart armed with
holy Reſolution in this kynd is ſhot free, and able to conquer
a city. The patient in ſpirit, is better then the haſty, and the
end of a thing is better then the beginning. Patience carryes
with it, halfe a releaſe, it is (as it were) boot in beame. If then,
thy wife and thine husband cannot be wonne to conſent,
yet, if thou canſt poſſeſſe thine owne ſpirit, thou ſhalt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer

Strange is the nature of a quiet ſpirit: it muſt prevaile at laſt,
becauſe it will wayt, till it have no nay. But eſpecially, it
hath this power in it, to quench any fiery dart, far better then
any reſiſtance, and wrath. If Cannon ſhot light upon the
Wool-packe, it loſeth his force: but if upon a ſtone wall,
it batters it to peeces; and a ſoft anſwer puttes away wrath.
Bring Ieſus into this ſhip he will allay all the waves: bring

It is not thy violence, to go to worke by ſtrong hand, to beare
downe thy wives ſtreame, by a ſtronger one of thine owne;
by eyther threats, or much leſſe blowes, (a baſe remedy, and
which I wonder ſhould eyther come into any wiſe mans
thoughts and pen to advize, or heart and hand to practiſe)
or any other Policie of ſhame and diſſwaſive, which God
hath bleſſed to effect it. If he had, it had ſurely more prevay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
then it hath. No, its the onely victory of heaven and
grace; whatſoever fleſhly Wiſedome, and raſhnes or device
of man, hath or may practiſe in this kind, I ſpeake not: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
may plead excuſe from the greatneſſe, but not the
realnes of the ſin. Nor yet do I deny but that a carnall way
(for the preſent) may helpe againſt the preſent occaſion.
As I heard lately that a man put to his wits ended, agreed
with his friends in London, that dwelt neer, it ſeemes, that
when they heard the Drumme ſound from his houſe, they
ſhould all make haſt to take his wife in her ſcolding veine,
and ſo ſhame her. So they might cut off a finger, but who
ſhall mortifie the ſpirit? ſurely the Drumme comes ſhort of
that cure, and a woman will ſcorne to yeeld up her weapons
at the found of ſuch a charme. No, alas! As the Popes bleſſing
makes no Armour of proofe: ſo neither is any Medicine of
mans deviſing, ſhrew, or ſcold proofe: for a ſuddeyne they
may pleaſe by their violence, but at time of yeere, the maladie
will have his courſe. To this, I might adde a contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
of carnall wit: That husbands thus matched will
ſeeke to flatter and demerit their baſe wives, ſerving their
owne wills, bee they never ſo waſtfull, and proud: ſuffering
them to be all in all, to carry all the ſtreame, and to
throw houſe out at windowes, and all to winne them to
ſome indifferency, ſlaviſhly ſubjecting themſelves to their
uſurping, and domineering ſpirit: They (forſooth) muſt buy,
ſell, let, hire, take all and pay all, ſtaving off their husbands
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58230:108"/>
from intermeddling, ſave at their owne curteſie, what they
ſhall weare, ſpend, or carrie in their purſe: Others, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
their peace, by caſting all the tacklings into ſea; let
their wives jolly and ruffle it out in what maner, meaſure,
or Companies they themſelves pleaſe to ſpend at their
pleaſure, keeping their husbands at a becke: yea, ſuffer them
to keepe and harbour Varlets under their noſes to defile
their beds and family with filth and baſtardy: and all that
they may bee rid of unquiteneſſe. And when upon theſe
tearmes, they have bought repentance too deere, then they
muſt either die in ſorrow, or live with baſenes and diſhonour.
In general I like your patience (for ſome yeelding doth well)
if limited: But, your cowardly, baſe heart, diſtruſting Gods
waies and method, except you releive your ſelves by ſinning,
that I abhorre, and affirme the remedy to be farre worſe then
the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Caveat 5.</note> I warne all couples, that they runne not beyond
the bounds ſet them by providence,<note place="margin">Keepe each party the bounds of his place.</note> to intermeddle with the
affaires concerning each other. Its the folly and boldneſſe
of many women, to be ſo curiouſly prying and pragmaticall,
about their husbands matters, (which concerne them not
to buſie themſelves about, but to reſt upon their fidelity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they ſee juſt exception) to be ſo inquiſitive into their
actions, companies, and occaſions, ſo jealous of them
(unjuſtly) that, although I allow not of the effect, yet I
ſay, its a juſt provocation to the ſpirit of a wiſe and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
man, to differ from his wife. And againe, many fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
husbands doe ſo intermeddle in the Element, and about
the peculiar emploiments of the women, taking upon them
the menaging of their Cookeries, their dayries and houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery,
as if they muſt have an oare in each boate. What
wiſe woman would not break into a mixt paſſion of fulſome
indignation and contempt? What husband would not bee
carried to extreame diſcontent? God hath appointed their
ſtation to them both, the one, without, the other within:
leſt by idleneſſe and ſloth, they wanting their ſeverall
workes, they ſhould waxe unſavory, and lie open to forraine
vice: But this is to turne the ordinance topſy turvie, and in
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58230:108"/>
ſtead of not doing, to overdoe, and cauſe diſcord at home.
Therefore keepe your ſtation: provoke not each other,
which gives occaſion (ofttimes) of that mutuall curioſity.
Mutuall conſent will not conſiſt with mutuall ſatagency in
this kind. To this, I might adde another caveat, againſt the
darkeneſſe and cloſeneſſe of carriage of couples, each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which doth breed this evill ſpoken of. For, though
each party is to be truſted in his or her owne ſphere, to act
and deale: yet neither muſt forget other, to beare an equall
ſhare in the common welfare; and therefore, to conceale
themſelves and walke aloofe as in the clouds, one from the
knowledge, of the other; as never to impart their mutuall
affaires, never to communicate together, or conſult each
with other, what is it, but a deſpiſing of that equipage, and
equality which marriage claimes? what is it, ſave provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of each other, to turne a mutuall ſpirit, into a private
one? To turne equanimity of love (that thinkes no evill,
but conſtrues all in the better ſenſe) into jealous ſuſpicion?
what imports it, ſave that their waies are unthrifty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
ſo that they are loth to diſcover them, till all be too
late? And then at laſt, endleſſe broyles grow upon ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
ſecrecy, and a neceſſity of violent ſparing, leſt all
ſhould periſh: both extremities, to be ſhunned by all wiſe
couples.</p>
               <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">Caveat 6.</note> as the Proverbe ſaith, take not counſell in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat:
for then,<note place="margin">Bee prepared for the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, before.</note> there is no ſeaſon for counſell, then the ſpirit is
in the power of paſſion, and temptation preſent, as a bowle
running downe the hill, is in the power of the deſcent.
Take counſell therefore before, and uſe thy skill in preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that which is hardly endured. Obſerve thy husbands
frame oh wife, and thy wives oh husband: Study each others
natures, and count it thy wiſdome and vantage, by that thou
ſhalt eaſily gueſſe, both what may provoke &amp; alſo prevent it;
and, what may both content and ſo procure it: But they
who let all goe at ſix and ſeven, ſuffer the upper milſtone to
runne upon the nether, they may bee ſure the divell will

Studious ſhunning of occaſions, with wiſdome and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58230:109"/>
pious caution, hath in time, wrought many an unquiet heart
to ſome calmeneſſe; except there be ſo curſed and churliſh
a nature, as delights in diſtemper, even to chuſe, and would
rather die fighting with it owne ſhadow then be at peace.

righteous then I: for I have ſought thy griefe, but thou haſt
overcome me with thy wiſdome and meeknes; thou haſt
heaped hot coales upon the head of a froward husband, and

orders his owne perſonall way of religion, conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

men: Then nextly he walkes before his wife, as a wiſe

have got the upperhand of himſelfe: But, having begun (as

then he preſcribes to others, I ſay that theſe and the like

               <p>For which purpoſe,<note place="margin">Particulars of this generall, two.</note> let this further be enquired into, in
what mayne things conſiſts this vertue of an husband, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
as a man of underſtanding toward his wife? I anſwer.
In theſe two, firſt in matters of God, then in ſuch as concern
the married relation. Both theſe will procure and maynteine
the honor of marriage on the husbands part: and, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> will proove diſhonorable. For the former, I will here
touch it only ſo farre as the purpoſe of the point requires:<note place="margin">It appears in matters of God.</note>
And firſt, its requiſite for the husband to handſell his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
with the matters of God. That he count it his
crowne, firſt, to ſeeke the Kingdome of God, and that for it
ſelfe; and from the ſavor therof, as one well grounded in the
Scriptures, to be able to expreſſe his knowledge to his wife
till ſhe conceive the like: And, having ſo done, that he ſet
himſelfe to walke accordingly towards his wife, both in the
generall, to inſtruct, admoniſh, comfort, reſolve, ſupport her,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58230:113"/>
and in ſpeciall in all private or family duties, to be her mouth
to God, and to preſent to him the wants and petitions of all
that depend upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. Both indeed ought to know, they have
ſeverall ſoules to ſave, and not to wrap up themſelves in
one anothers grace: Both ought to be a ſpirituall body of
Chriſt, annoynted which his prophecy and Prieſthood: yet, as
the man is the Image of God in ſpeciall, and her head, ſo
ought the Conſecration of God to reſt upon him, in more
abundance then upon her: that ſhee and all the reſt may be
repleniſhed therewith. So that he (for his part) muſt be as
her Prieſt, and his lips muſt preſerve knowledge for her: To
give ſome two or three inſtances of this point.<note place="margin">Inſtances wherein.</note> Firſt for the
diſcharge of family duties (wherof I have ſpoken before) he
muſt purchaſe for himſelfe an horne of oile, not onely (as one
ſaith) for his veſſell to be ſavory, but for his lampe to ſhine.
My meaning is not to force ſuch knowledge upon him as is
miniſterial, exact for degree (God requires no ſervice beyond
the ability and Talent received, be it one or three) Its not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
that he be an interpreter of the Scriptures; that he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
punctuall doctrines, to cleer doubts &amp; objections, or to
make diſtinctions &amp; applications beyond his calling: &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
This were but to make the Family duties a ſtall to vend
himſelf upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to pride himſelfe in his parts &amp; endowments
(as many have done ſo long,) while at laſt thinking themſel.
too fledge for their owne neſt, they have boldly leapt out of
their ſhops &amp; Trades, into the pulpit, thinking themſelves as
meet to preach as the moſt able Miniſters; no, in no ſort: (I
krow there is difference in men for their skill and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in matters of God, and for ſobriety and humblenes of
ſpirit, whom I much honor, and deſire not to trench upon, or
diſcourage any Governors in this kynd, eſpecially in ſuch a
profane world that runs a contrary ſtreame:) But impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I deſire to utter the truth by ſo juſt an occaſion: and this I
ſay, Its enough for a private perſon, to inſiſt upon ſuch points
of doctrine, and eſpecially of Catechiſme, as he hath by his
carefull attention, heard in the ordinary courſe of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique
Miniſterie handled; to cull out ſuch, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
them to his wife and family, in a familiar manner,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58230:114"/>
upon confeſſed groundes, and upon eaſie texts: whoſe ſenſe
and ſcope is plaine and undoubted; therupon, faſtening ſuch
exhortation, admonition and watch words as beſt befit him
to utter who ſhould be beſt acquainted with the ſtate of ſuch
as are under his roofe: rebuking ſin, preſſing duty; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
as for texts of darker nature, abſtayning from them, and
leaving them to a publique gift of interpreting: which is
abler to rectifie judgment, and anſwere doubts, and ſettle the
conſcience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is to apply himſelfe to his wife, as a man of
underſtanding, in the private way of her ſoule, helping her
out of her feares, anſwering her doubts and queſtions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the light he hath received abroad, to reconcile their
timorous and ſcrupulous ſpirits to God, by the promiſe, ſo
oft as they ſtagger, &amp; to enlarge them with thoſe comforts,
to acquaint them with ſuch directions for their walking
with God, as themſelves have had experience of in their
afflicted conditions, to fellow-feele them, to be afflicted with
them, to conferr with them about their growthes or decayes,
their ſlips and recoveries, and ſo about the fruite of their
both publique and private worſhip and ſervice of God: to
ſatiſfie them in any ſuch difficultyes and dangers as they
meet with, and ſo to helpe them aſwell in the extraordinary
duties of humiliation and Thanks, as occaſion requires: of
which I ſayde enough in the joint worſhip of God before.
And ſo thirdly (to conclude this point) he is alſo to bee a
man of ability, to encourage, hearten and quicken his wife in
reſpect of any outward burdens ſhe undergoes, to condole
with her in them,<note place="margin">Cant. 8 3.</note> to underlay her (as the beloved in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles)
doth his ſpouſe, that ſo two may beare that which one
cannot, and the toile may be the more cheerfuly undergone,

how farre are moſt husbands from this courſe? where are
they whoſe underſtanding, humblenes and love ſeekes the

to ſuch publique ordinances on the Sabbath or weeke
day to enable them in knowledge? or ſeeke the helpe of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58230:114"/>
or other to guide them? Or put caſe ſome heare or note
Sermons (which now is growne each mans caſe, and not
amiſſe except they finde that the gaine of writing, marre the
power of the truth in their affections) yet they ſhut up all
preſently in their Note-bookes, without meditation or ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
at the purchaſe of a lively ſtocke, of underſtanding;
nor thriving upon their hearings, by proofe and experience
of that they know? Or if they have knowledge, yet how
ſurly and conceited do they grow, drawing their wives
rather to errors, and fancies, and buſying themſelves rather,
about matters beyond their reach, and of leſſe conſequence,
ere they be grounded in the maine. How ſad are many women
for their want this way, that alas! when as they aske their
husbands at home, they are little the better, if not much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged!
Their husband eyther deſpiſing the light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and ſo walking like blocks and idiots in all matters of
God: or elſe filling themſelves ſo with other traſh, that
knowledge runs over, and is ſpilt upon the ground: or if they
have light, yet reſting in generalities, never comming to the
experience of the way of God, or life of faith. And by this,
they wax barren, &amp; tell their wyves, they are no Preachers,

obedience to God, but alſo in circumſtances, and matters
indifferent: for her company, for her ſolitarines, for ſilence or
ſpeech, ſhewing her what her perſon and place will admit
and beare, that ſhe doe not either over or under ſet up, or
caſt downe her ſailes, but live within the boundes of her
place, for her company, attire, houſhold furniture, expences
of children, what is pure, modeſt, ſober, of good report, what
not; who are ſafely to be converſed with, and truſted in ſo
bad a world as we live in, who to be ſhunned: he muſt be her
eye to ſee by, her hand to worke, her foote to walke with, to
diſcerne things, and perſons, how they differ: And theſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58230:115"/>
things ſhee muſt not onely learn by the eare fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his diſcourſe
but diſcover by marking his practice &amp; example: Beholding
in his glaſſe an image of underſtanding, how wiſely he can
conceal things not to be uttered, how warily preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t danger
to life, name, ſtate: how he can avoyde the ſnares which are
layde for him; how he ſhunneth ill company, remooves of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
from the bad, keep peace upon good and ſafe termes
with all men, handle buſines of weight both without equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating,
and reſervation of an ill conſcience; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, without betraying himſelfe, and expoſing himſelfe
to hazard: and in both how he preſerves innocency, and
uprightneſſe. Beſides theſe, ſhe may behold in him, neither
on the one ſide cowardize in a good cauſe, nor in the other,
folly in the bad handling of it: how cloſe and ſecret he is
to them that are faithfull friendes to God and himſelfe; how
he is neither baſely niggardly, nor yet vainly laviſh: that he is
neither lightly credulous, nor yet ſinfully diſtruſtfull: in his
liberties, neither taking the uttermoſt, nor yet ſcrupling the
moderate, and lawfull: Thus I ſay when ſhee ſees the image
of God ſhining in his underſtanding and behaviour, ſhe ſhall
be farre from deſpiſing him, at leaſt juſtly, for grace is hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and makes the face to ſhine, even before ſuch as have
little good in them; much more ſuch as can obſerve it; Nay
more, ſhee ſhall honor him, as her head, ſee cauſe of entirely
loving him, devoting her ſelfe, firſt to God in thanks, for ſuch

ſave a <hi>Micol</hi> can find any diſdaine in her heart of ſuch an

dutie of the husband, &amp; that is in one word, Providence.
As he is the husband in name, ſo muſt he bee in deed: he muſt
play the good husband. Neither hath he his namo fer noght:
for the husband is as the houſe-band, which (as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
to the ſides of the building) holde in all the parts of
the houſe: which would ſoone diſſolve and cracke, if (under
God)
his providence did not ſupport it. He is the ſteward
both for his wife, and himſelfe: eſpecially without dores:
He is not to put his wife to it, as one inſufficient himſelfe to
menage it, but (conſidering ſhee hath her handsfull at home)
he is to undertake the whole burden abroad: as beeing the
party, to whom (by divine diſpenſation) the credit of the
well-improoving it, doth belong: and therfore upon whom,
the ſhame of the contrary muſt lye. God hath put into him
a ſpirit of deeper inſight, forecaſt, prudence and prevention,
then the woman, to this very end. And to ſay the truth; The
Lord hath impoſed this burden upon him in <hi>Adam,</hi> inſtantly
upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his fall, as the penalty for his baſe yeelding up his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to his wife, &amp; enſlaving his ſpirit to hers when yet his fre
will abode enite. True it is <hi>Adam</hi> was to til the garden before
his fall, even during his innocency: but that was a labor moſt
ſweet &amp; contentfull unto him. To the ſinner doth God give
toile and ſorrow (ſayth <hi>Salomon)</hi> and ſo,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 2. 26.</note> ſince his ſin, labor is
waxen a toyle and vexation to him, and is, ſo that now in
the ſweat of his brows, he muſt get his living. He that ſhakes
off this yoke, is a double <hi>Rebell,</hi> both againſt the firſt charge
in innocency, of not diſobeying, and ſecondly againſt the
penalty of ſuebjcting himſelfe to travaile. In reſpect heerof,
<hi>Iob</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">Iob. 5. 7.</note> Man is as naturally borne to labor, as the ſparkes to
fly upward: as naturally deputed by God to the one, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
by his owne ſin to the other; as the <hi>Ebrew</hi> word <hi>[gnaval]</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:58230:119"/>
imports, which includes ſin and toyle in one. The woman
brings all her ſtate and ſtocke, putting it into his handes,
reſigning it up to him as her agent, and the more able party
to improove it: if he faile her, he betrayes both his truſt to
trechery, and her ſtate to embezeling. There be two ſorts
of Infidells taxed by the Holy Ghoſt: the one in our Saviors
wordes, Take yee no thought what ye ſhall put on, or eate;
for your father knowes what is meet for you. And why?
The infidells do but ſo:<note place="margin">Math. 6. 25. 26</note> And the other by <hi>Paul.</hi> He that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
not for his family, hath forſaken the faith, and is worſe
then an Infidell:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 8.</note> Exceſſe of providence, aſwell as defect of
it, both are taxed by the name of heatheniſme. Therfore, ſo
farre as good conſcience will permit, the man is bound to
the Law of providence. He muſt overſee the affaires of his
owne houſehold,<note place="margin">Prov. 27. 23.</note> as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes, he muſt looke to the
flockes of ſheep, and heards of cattel, laying in proviſion for
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: by this one, urging the whole Baylywick of providence
requiſite for the ſupport of the family. And that which the
Apoſtle ſpeakes,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 33.</note> is to the ſame purpoſe, That the husband
lookes in his way, after the things of the world, that he may
pleaſe his wife: he ſpeakes not of it, as of their blemiſh (ſo
they adde no exceſſe and ſin to the act) but as a neceſſity
impos'd by Gods Command.</p>
               <p>Now as touching that point,<note place="margin">Reaſon of it in generall, he honors his marriage by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and how?</note> that the husband in ſeverall
muſt cloſe with this ſpeciall duty of Providence, appeares by
the honor which hereby he procures to the marryed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And this I ſuppoſe no man will queſtion. For why?
Wherein ſtands the Princes honor, ſave in the wealth of his
ſubjects? And wherin is the honor of a State ſave in both?
what peace can ſubſiſt, what ware can be ſupported without
wealth? Even ſo here. The husband is the Prince of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if he be baſe and beggerly, what is more ridiculous?
what is ſo pittifull to behold, as a poore King, a
titular Prince, that hath nothing to ſupport his ſtate,
ſave a bare right? beeing the whileſt moſt forlorne and for
ſaken? So, how ſhall things belonging to the diet, attire and
welfare of the family, be provided, if the Treaſure faile? And
how can that chuſe but faile, if Providence the channel of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:58230:119"/>
this fountayne faile? If the Pilot of the ſhip be idle or a ſleep,
what ſhall become of the ſhip? Muſt it not needes run on
ground, and be ſwallowed up in the quick-ſands? And, what
a diſhonor is it for him who ſhould compt it a more bleſſed
thing to give, then to receive, who ſhould reach out an almes
to ſix and ſeven, and do much good? himſelfe and his family
to become burdenſome to others by his penury? Eſpecially
when, not the hande of God, (which can overthrow the beſt
providence) but the improvidence of the ydle or ill occupied
husband hath procured it. Again, when the husband honors
marriage by this Providence, thoſe who fare well by it, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
him backe againe with the rendition of his owne. The
weake woman and the ſhiftleſſe children, ſeeing what a
prop, and father of a family the Lord hath ſet over them,
acknowledge his care, with honor to God, and reverencing
him, as the inſtrument of their welfare, next under God. He
reſembleth after a ſort,<note place="margin">Epheſ 3. 15.</note> God himſelfe, whom <hi>Paul</hi> calls the
Father upon whom all the families of the earth depend, and
are called by his name: whoſe honor it is to fill all with his
bleſſing, to provide for all creatures their due food in ſeaſon,
as they need it, with clothing and other things both for
need and comfort: even ſo, the eyes of all the family media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
looke up to the Maſter therof, looking that by him as
a ſteward, the Lord ſhould furniſh them with neceſſaries; yea,
to end this, how honorable is ſuch an husband, even in the
eyes of them, among whom he lives? How is both Church,
Commonwealth, &amp; Towne beholding to ſuch, as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
for the upholding of peace, the Goſpell, &amp; the poore?
If all were careles Husbands what muſt become of all theſe?
Some I grant ſhall ever be poor, but theſe ſubſiſt in all theſe
reſpects, by the aide of the Provident, when as ſpend thrifts
do nothing but pull downe the houſe with their hands.
The concluſion is, If the perſonall diligence of the husband
do ſo much honor his marriage, he hath good cauſe to put
to his beſt care, to be provident.</p>

Yet, we muſt know a little ſtock is a ſtock, as well
as a great one, all have not the like abilities, but all ſorts muſt
be occupied about their ſtocks, more or leſſe. They who have
but one talent, have ſutable expences, or contentment in

bee but ſmall, yet thy latter end ſhall bee full of encreaſe.
Although other trades outſtrip them by their ſtockes, yet
they go not ſo faſt forwarde but providence and bleſſing
may follow, and ſometymes overtake them, if there be faith
and patience to wayte, and not be diſcouraged. Each mans
ſtocke is his owne, or ought to bee; Such as have not

competent ſtock followed with moderate diligence, though
it be ſure of no great encreaſe, yet (uſually) frees the owner,

To bee as ready to put off, or take in, without eyther raſhnes
in the one, or covetouſnes in the other; are all meet proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for a provident husband. The Apoſtle Rom. 12. 11. hath
one ſweet rule for this: Not ſlothfull in buſineſſe, but fervent
in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord. q. d. So far as Gods worke is not
hindred by our owne, its a comely ſight to ſee a man active

each thing as if (for the preſent) I did nothing elſe. Its a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſaying, He that keepes his ſhop, his ſhop will keep him.
The ſpeech is uſuall. Its not enough, not to be idle, except a

ſtill ſhew that thy trade is not thine onely object. I deny
not, but ſome caſes there may be, where the trade may be

to pick quarrells with our trades, that we might turne to ſuch

               <p>Yet ſince this occaſion is offred, I ſpeake not, as if all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
of a calling,<note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects a man may change or divert from his calling.</note> or diverſion from it, for a time, were
unwarranted. For ſometime it ſo falls out by providence,
that a man deſerts Country and all, and departs to ſuch a
place, as will not admit a poſſibilitie of the exerciſe of his
calling: ſo that in the one, he muſt needes yeeld the other.
Againe, ſometimes the outward members, ſenſes, and the
inward abilities of a man deſert him, and diſable him from
his calling: when as yet ſome ſlighter employment may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
befit him well enough. Neceſſity of baniſhment cauſed
many holy men, to make buttons and points for their living,
who before had ſtudied and written books. So alſo the trade
may bee ſo growne out of requeſt, eyther by multitude of
Traders, or by deadneſſe of the wares, that they cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the workemen: or they may bee ſo low, and require ſo
much work to be done for mony, that a trader cannot live on
them. Shall then the mayntenance of the family, hang upon
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58230:126"/>
the ſtrict point of not change of a calling? No in no ſort.
But in theſe or any the like caſes, (wherof are many) the end
muſt rule the meanes, and any other lawfull courſe, which
lies neereſt to the skill or ſleight of the workman, is allowed,
for the ſupport of the family. Onely let men beware, leſt out
of a fickle, ungrounded, lazy, weariſome, covetous, reaching,
aſpiring ſpirit, they deſert not their Callings: and, if they
needs muſt, yet let them chuze to divert rather from them
for a tyme, and returne to them after, when providence
yeelds opportunitie for it, then ſhew that they willingly and
ſlightly were mooved to abandon them at the firſt. But this

bleſſed compeere into the world. Now, its true, the wife in
this reſpect,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 18. 29.</note> oweth the like tye of tenderneſſe towards him:
But, we muſt know, this firſt lyes upon the man; to her ward,
becauſe he is the roote of the relation. Wee ſay, that love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendes
from the Father to the Child, becauſe he is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the reference. Not, but that mutualneſſe is required;
But the Originall roote muſt firſt impart himſelfe; Now upon
this roote of union, the Apoſtle enforceth this duty: No
man ever hated his owne fleſh; But nouriſhed &amp; theri ſhed it
as himſelfe: He then that hates his wife, is an unnaturall
monſter, and devoures his owne fleſh. He that loveth his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58230:127"/>
wife, loveth himſelfe. We know, how it is in the body.
Vnion of parts cauſing ſameneſſe and uniforme ſubſiſting

and ſympathie betwixt each member. So that although the
foot ſtumble and give the body a fall, yet a man will not be
ſo mad as to ſmite it, becauſe its one with it ſelfe, and ſuffers
the ſame fall with it. So here. The ſameneſſe of fleſh, which
the woman hath with the man, makes him naturall and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiſing
towards her: and not to hurt or hate her in her
weakneſſe, and ſtumblings, but to bear with her, condole her,
and count himſelfe to ſuffer in her; his content, joy and

and hate himſelfe, as to hurt her.</p>

wherein two bodies may truly be ſaid to be linked into one
ſoule. Here then to affect a ſingularity, a privacy in ſo cloſe
an union, and for the husband to be a man by himſelfe apart,
from her who is one and the ſame fleſh with him, what a
podigious ſelflove is it? union breedes love, and love, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
and compaſſion; but where ſelflove abides, union and
love are abſent. And from hence it is, that in another place,
the Apoſtle addeth,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 7.</note> giving honour to the woman, as to the
weaker veſſell: which giving of honour, is nothing elſe
ſave the peculiar office of the husband to his wife, (and
as I may tearme it, the way of his tenderneſſe) when as
he willingly reſignes up his manly authority ſometimes, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:58230:128"/>
wiſely abridgeth himſelfe of that power to the utter moſt,
which elſe he might uſurp over his weaker wife. And in
ſtead therof, wiſely conſiders, its the honour of a man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
to be under himſelfe, to forget his ſtrength: there is a
providence, in the government of this vaſt world, and it
ſtands in the overruling of ſome inferior creatures, that they
may not know their ſtrength over the ſuperior, but be kept
within compaſſe (as it were) by a neceſſary and naturall
reſtraint. Even ſuch a voluntary tye hath the Lord put upon
the more fierce and rough nature of the male to the female,
that there may not onely be a conſent, from hurting and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
each other; (for ſo Lions and Wolves agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
but further, that there might be a vertuous and more
generous forbearance of authority over the weake veſſel:
As acknowledging, the headſhip of the man is given him
not to diſcourage or deſtroy: but to direct, benefit and build
up the wife. That as God cloathes the weaker members
with the more honour; ſo, wee ſhould condeſcend and
vouchſafe the like reſpect to the womans weakneſſe. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a proud, and baſe ſpirit would hold his owne, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the hedge, where it is loweſt; yet a wiſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
head, will of his owne accord yeeld, and give
honour and reſpect unto the woman as to the weaker veſſel.
Surely if a father be ſaid to ſpare his owne ſonne who feares
him: and the Lord will be maſter even over the Parent, that
he bee not bitter to his children to tread them under feete,
but count it his honour to paſſe by the corrigible errors of
his children: then what ſhould that ſparing eye, that indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
heart and hand, that honour and reſpectiveneſſe bee,
wherby God ſwayeth the husband (being but her equall)
towards his yielding and tender wife? And in a word, I
ſay this giving of honour, is the more ſpeciall way of the
man, then of the woman: for though ſhe be ſo to him, yet
in a divers way, and in a more naturall kinde, as it were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her frame: for who takes it not for granted that
a thing naturally framed to tenderneſſe, ſhould act her own
property, and give honour as due deſert to the husband? But
in the mans giving honour to her, there is a more vertuous
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58230:128"/>
and royall diſpoſition, that is, an abatement of the right
inveſted in man, leſt exceſſe of right might proove exceſſe
of injury? and a yeelding of that tenderneſſe and ſympathy,
out of mercy and love, which elſe neither perhaps the
merit of the wife would require, but to be ſure the ſurlines &amp;
roughneſſe of the man would not eaſily contribute.</p>

thee to, the Lord Ieſus: As he loved his Church, and gave
himſelfe for it to the death, that ſhee might eſcape it, ſo
oughtſt thou to redeeme thy wife in caſe of ſuch a danger,
when thy bearing will laten the blow from her. When the
Lord Ieſus was taken by the ſouldiers, If yee ſeeke mee
(ſaith he) let theſe my chickens depart: Take not the damme
on the neaſt with her birdes: Let theſe be free: let all the
danger light upon my ſelfe. If then this tenderneſſe muſt
extend to life it ſelfe, ſurely then well may this tribute of an
inferior ranke be ſhewed. But, I ceaſe to diſcourſe the point

which thy ſelfe wouldſt either wiſh or look for from
Chriſt thy head? Teach thy ſelf, therby, thy office to thy wife,
(in the meaſure of thy Grace) &amp; tender it to her. Doſt thou
deſire alway to be accepted of him, &amp; find grace in his ſight?
Let thy wife finde the like from thee. Wouldeſt thou have
him doe all thy workes in thee and for the? Show thou the
like Grace to her, do thou likewiſe: require not the uttermoſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58230:129"/>
ſervice from her, but let her doe all in the comfort of thy love
&amp; acceptance. Wouldeſt thou have him compt all thy deeds,
not according to ſtrict law and performance of full
meaſure, but according to ſincerity of endeavor? Do thou
alſo ſo eſteeme of hers, according to the will and affection
whence they proceed, though they faile never ſo in degree.
Wouldſt thou have him to eſteeme thee according to the
better and not the worſer part? So doe thou interpret her.
Wouldſt thou have him ſave thee from ſorrow? So protect
thou her, and let thy love be her banner. Wouldſt thou have
him to feed, thee, and fight for thee, to bee thy Protector and
Champion? Should he ſtave off thine Enemies, and catch
their woundes in his owne ſide, which ſhould elſe light on
thee? Wouldſt thou have him to ſtop the mouth of each dog
from barking or biting thee, yea even to keep each cold
wynd from nipping and blaſting thee? Even ſo, ſtand thou
betweene they wife &amp; her harmes, and cover her head in the
ſtorme &amp; raine, not only with thy cloake, but thy beſt prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
againſt any annoiance. Wouldſt thou have Chriſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with thee in all thy troubles, to pitty thee, ſuffer with,
and ſuſteyne thee, by his patience, courage, &amp; long ſuffring?
So, let thy blood run in her veynes, and thy marrow in her
bones: ſuſtaine her like wiſe by thy meeknes, and long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance,
ſhee is alſo fleſh of thy fleſh, and bone of thy bone.
Doſt thou expect at laſt, that he ſhould at laſt redeeme thee
out of all thy troubles? Doſt thou alſo (as far as lyes in thee)
ſeeke reſt for her from all hers: let no enemy of hers, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her alone, but know he hath a double enemy to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
noteaſy to conteſt with. Thine are hers, hers are thine;
rejoice to ſee herrid of all, if God ſee good, which way it
ſeemes beſt to himſelfe to deliver her: meane time, be thou
active, paſſive in all with her. In a word, whatſoever thou
wouldſt have Chriſt do for thee, the ſame doe for her, for
this doubtleſſe is to be conformed to thine head, and to do
the part of an honoring and reſpective husband to her.</p>
               <p>Theſe generalls had need be branched out into ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:
elſe perhaps,<note place="margin">Particulars of the husbands Tendernes.</note> it will not be eaſie for every one to
conceive them. Theſe therfore that follow may ſerve. Firſt,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58230:130"/>
let this reſpect begin at her ſoule: procure to that, the cheefe
good, that it may fare well. The tender love of Chriſt ſtands
in this, that he gave himſelfe for the Church; why? Not to
make her ſuch as ſhee her ſelfe woulde,<note place="margin">Branch 1.</note> not to give her the
full ſwinge and ſwaye of her owne will;<note place="margin">Tendernes to the ſoule of the wife the firſt duty of the husband.</note> But, to waſh her, to
purge her, to ſanctify her, as peculiar to himſelfe, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpot, nor wrinkle; So do thou: begin with this, and this
ſhall guide all the reſt: Thinke not this to be thy tenderneſſe
to thy wife, to deale by her as <hi>David</hi> by Adonija, whom his
father would never from his youth, ſpeake a wry unto, that
is, aske him, what doſt thou? But rather in this is thy tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
if by any wayes of God, allurements, yea milde and well
ſeaſoned reproofes (if need be) thou mayſt be an inſtrument
of her good. Its not tendernes, but exceeding and degenerate
ſoftnes in an husband, that, becauſe his wife is well pleaſing
to him in ſome carriages, therfore he ſhould rather ſuffer her
to go on in deep ignorance of God, and her ſelfe, and go the
broad way to perdition, rather then he would grieve her, or
ſpeake one worde amiſſe: eſpecialy, to be ſo baſe and remiſſe,
that, when he knows he might winne her by his loving ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes,
he ſhoulde rather neglect her by his Careleſſenes,
No, if thou be tender truly, her ſoule wilbee thy principall
object, and thou wilt preſent to her thoſe tender mercies of
Chriſt, thoſe bowels of compaſſion in him to the church:
never linning till Chriſt hath by his blood waſht her ſoule
from the naturall uncleannes of it, forgiven her, and taken
away her guilt and blemiſhes. If her face were ſtayned with
ſome ſpots, how ſtudious would he bee to tell her of them,
that ſhe might waſh them off? how much more that Chriſt
Ieſus might call her his Hephziba and Beulah:<note place="margin">Iſa. 62. 4.</note> his dove, faire
one, and pretiouſly beloved? that he might behold her waſht
and cleane (as the ſheep comming from the rivers to ſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring)
from her ſcurffe, accepted of God, and (as much as
fleſh may bee) without ſpot or wrinckle, eyther of guilt, or
apparant corruption: a veſſel purged and prepared for every
good worke. No worke ſo honorable as this to make thy
wife a veſſel of honor to God firſt, and then for marriage.
Thus <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes that tenderneſſe of Chriſt: and yet, that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58230:130"/>
waſhing and rinſing of her, muſt coſt ſome hardneſſe, ſave
that Mercy and love overſweetens it: and then it will ſeeme
pleſant. Nouriſh and cheriſh and hate not thy owne fleſh, in
this firſt reſpect,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 13. 3.</note> as <hi>Nathans</hi> lambe, in the true boſome of the
Lord Ieſus, the tendereſt husband that ever was.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Branch. 2.</note> this thy Reſpect and Tenderneſſe muſt reach
to her perſon,<note place="margin">Tendernes to the Perſon of the Wife ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note> and that in her Safegard and Defence. Thy
wife walkes (under God) in the ſhaddow of thy wings and
protection. Thou muſt bee as a vaile to her eye, to keep off
the dint of all luſt and ſtrange deſires, as <hi>Abimelec</hi> told <hi>Sara</hi>
of <hi>Abraham:</hi> As the eyelid is made by nature a tender filme
and very mooveable, and watchfull to the body of the eye,
that no duſt or mote fall into it to offend it; ſo muſt the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
husband come betweene the leaſt aſperſion of reproach
and infamy caſt upon the name of his wife wrongfully: And
when thou art dead, let her reſt ſafe in the Ark of Gods prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
by the benefit of thy living prayers, before ſent up for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
her,<note place="margin">In protection.</note> to the throne of grace, that God would be an husband to
the widdow; that ſo even when dead, yet thou mayſt ſpeake.
But, while thou art living, thou muſt bee as a wall of fire to
her; let everie one that hath ill will to thy wife, (as many will
have, even for that which deſerves honor) knowe that they
maligne thy ſelfe; Nay, herein love her better then thy ſelfe
that thou wiltright ſome wrongs done to her, which perhaps
(if done to thy ſelfe) thou wouldſt paſſe by more ſtrongly:
Let her Name and honor, bee as ſweet oyntment unto thee.
The husband who ſhall content himſelfe in the generall
love of his wife, beeing yet ſupinely negligent of her repute, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
or enduring any,<note place="margin">In her repute.</note> within doores or without to diſeſteeme her,
without ſharpe rebuke: or to bee knowne himſelfe to
ſee any of her weakneſſes, with the leaſt contempt, is not
worthie to have the comfort of her vertues, or the love of a
religious companion. The like I ſay of her body, both in
health and ſickneſſe. Whatſoever diet, or warmth or ſhelter,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
either at home,<note place="margin">In her bodily in firmities.</note> or abroad, by thy ſelfe or others, thou ſeeſt
neceſſary for the preſerving her in health and vigor, from the
leaſt aſſault, or impreſſion, that neglect not: keepe away
wether, diſtemper, diſeaſe for her: be as a Phyſitian according
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58230:131"/>
to the diſcretion thou haſt, and the knowledge of her body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
frame and infirmities, in the abſence of better helpe; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all dangers from her which poſſibly might aſſault her;
and what ſoever ſorrow or ſad newes, ill and ſudden acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
thou deemeſt, would diſquiet her, turne them away if
it bee within thy power, or keepe them from her notice, leſt
they might overthrow her ſpirit, or weaken her body. Yea, as
our Lord Ieſus did, ſo do thou, if a danger muſt needs ceaze
upon thee, provide it may not come to her knowledge, or as
little amaze and affright her, as may bee. In her diſeaſedneſſe,
neglect no meanes, which either thy counſell, purſe, or
friends can helpe her to: adviſe for ſoule, phyſicke for body,
attendance and nurſery to perſon: Grudge not that ſhee lyes
upon thine hand, But, as thou wouldſt have (I ſay not her,
but) Chriſt himſelfe to tender thee in thine, ſo do thou her, in
her defects.<note place="margin">2. King. 4. 21.</note> Let it appeare to her cleerly that her life is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and her loſſe would be uncomfortable. If the poore

ſick that they might be well,<note place="margin">Deſcription of the husbands tendernes to the perſon of his wife.</note> and well, leſt they be ſicke:
If ſhe loſe a childe by the hand of God, or by caſualty, her
tender heart takes more thought for it in a day, then thy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpirit can in a moneth: the ſorrow of all lies upon her:
Shee had need to be eaſed of all that is eaſeable, becauſe ſhe
cannot be eaſed of the reſt. We reade in the fable that the
male ſparrow once accuſed the female, for that ſhe did not ſo
much take paines in building of their neſt, as he did: But ſhe
replied, There was cauſe why ſhee ſhould pleade exemption:
Shee had all the trouble of laying the egs, of ſitting, of hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; feeding them, and therfore ſome reaſon ſhe ſhould be
ſpared in the building of the neſt, let him do that, who did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, and ſhe prevailed. And ſhall not ſhee, who allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
for her ſelfe, with more reaſon? Get her aſleep if thou
can, but awake her not, till ſhe pleaſe. And, tell mee, ſhall not
her eaſe be thine? Or canſt thou have any, if ſhe want? Little
doſt thou thinke of thoſe gripings, checks &amp; pangs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſhe walketh, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as thou goeſt through ſtitch with thy
matters with an hardy courage. If all wives be not ſo, I ſpeak
not ſo much in their behalfe: but the good wife is uſually ſo;
yeeld her this fruite of tendernes, its all the milke thou giveſt.
Yea, let thy hollow cheeks, pale face, ſad heart, be as a Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
in which others may read thy wives infirmities, their
number, their meaſure, and how long they have continued. I
ſpeak not Rhetorique unto thee,<note place="margin">Two extremes of Tenderns.</note> but Divinity: As and husband
muſt loath uxoriouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Viz, Roughnes Vxoriouſnes.</note> ſo, much more Stoicall inſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
remembring who it is, who ſayth, Erre in her love: let
thy ſoule know no other objects while ſhee lives, let them be
abhorred. And when ſhe hath breathed out her laſt, yea, even
when ſhe lyes by the walles, yea in the mouldes, yet then is
there another honor due to her memory, when ſhee is not:
even this, that thy hand be upon thy ſide for the loſſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rib, thy ſweet companion; Mourne not for her without
hope, like an heathen, (ſhee is not loſt, but ſent before) but
yet as <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſo mourne thou, even till the dayes
thereof be accompliſhed: Bee not as the horſe, as the Fruit
Creature, without ſenſe of her worth, thy loſſe: Elſe
ſome beaſts will exceed thee in tendernes: thou art worſe;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58230:132"/>
a very blocke: And for this ſecond particular ſo much.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Branch 3.</note> ſhew this reſpect in thine ingenuity and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſſe.
Its an unkindneſſe alone,<note place="margin">Ingenuity and openhearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> not to ſhew love: to
walk overlooſely, diſmally, and darkely towards her. Thou
canſt doe no more to a ſtranger. I ſay not that ſhe is capable
of all ſecrets. There is a ſeaſon for all things. And had <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
been as wiſe at laſt, as at firſt to conceale his ſecrets,
he had done wiſely. But there is a golden meane: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
not thy ſelfe too farre from her. Impart whatſoever is
meete, let her know the difficulty of thy buſineſſe, if the
knowing it may either afford her content, or thy ſelfe adviſe.
Let not ſtrangers tell her of thy follies, to cauſe her to
ſuſpect thy reſpectiveneſſe:<note place="margin">Joſh. 6. 8.</note> She is but ſimple, that may not
ſpeake a word in ſeaſon: Rams hornes, and empty pitchers
have conquered cities,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 20. 18.</note> and armies: and the woman that
called herſelfe but a weake one, once delivered <hi>Abel:</hi> and
why may not thy wives helpe thee! Its no wrong to thee,
for her to deſire a voice in thine affaires, who muſt be ſure to
ſmart in thy bad ſucceſſe. There is (I ſay againe) a diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in ordering this buſineſſe. Neither to impart thoſe
things wherein griefe would overcome acceptance; nor
to conceale ſuch, as wherein by thy imparting them, either
her counſell might overweigh her griefe, or at leaſt, prevent
the ſuddenneſſe of a diſaſter. Its a thing wherein the weake
ſex counts it ſelfe graced and ſatisfied, not to bee made
a ſtranger to thoſe things, which love and ingenuity would
and ſhould impart. As for uttering any thing, which is
needleſſe, or might be a ſnare to her indiſcretion and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
its better kept a way. But, darkneſſe breeds ill blood
of jealouſie, hard thoughts, a ſtriving for the like darkneſſe of
behavior, or to ſeeke other boſomes to lay her complaints
in, when thou little thinkeſt of it, and perhaps worſe then all
theſe. She is laid in thy boſome by God, that thy boſome
thoughts, hopes, feares, deſires, together with thy ſelfe,
might lye in hers: So for this third.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Branch 4.</note> comfort her in all her heavineſſe, and firſt for her
ſoule and ſpirit;<note place="margin">Comfort in heavineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother peece of tenderneſſe.</note> The anguiſh thereof, and the wound of
conſcience, is of all other, moſt intolerable. Yea, though it
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58230:132"/>
be onely ſome outward greefe, yet if pierce the ſpirit with
any more then common diſtemper, it exceeds any ſicknes &amp;
empair of the body. Shew thy ſelf more tender to her therin,
then in all common troubles. If thine owne wiſedome, faith
or experience will not ſerve to heale it, ſeek out, and enquire
after an Interpreter, one of a thouſand, who may rightly
and duly weigh her eſtate, both the cauſes and effects therof.
Vpbrayde her not with her zeale, which were to aggravate
her diſeaſe. Fret not at her going to Sermons; lay not the
falt upon that, wiſhing thou hadſt never ſeene her eies, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
not at thy lot, accuſe not providence, becauſe thou ſeeſt
her in perplexities: perhaps God hath begun with her, that
he might end with thee. But however, lin not uſing all means,
till God have ſpoken a word in ſeaſon to her very ſoule,
ſaying, Deliver her, I have accepted a Ranſome: till her fleſh
come againe, as a little childes, and ſhe recover peace. Happy
art thou,<note place="margin">Iob. 33 24.</note> if God ſhall ſo make thee an inſtrument of her good
that thy ſelfe alſo mayſt bee drawne neerer to God by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
then proſperity could ever have brought thee. And,
put caſe that the diſtemper ceaze onely upon her naturall

by all which God cuts her ſhort of wonted liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

hath befallen thee which is not according to man: uſe
the beſt meanes of reſtoring her ſpirit againe, by Phyſick,
counſell, wiſe ſecrecy, cuſtody, tendernes of regard: and ſo
wayte with patience, till God reſtore her, or what ever be
the iſſue, charge not God fooliſhly.</p>
               <p>Fifthly ſpare her weake bodie,<note place="margin">Branch. 5.</note> from all toile and labor of

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58230:133"/>
her to lay aſide and free her ſelfe of ſo naturall, ſo religious a
worke, yet tell her, God loves mercy better then ſacrifice:
If God deny her ability, or breaſts, grudge not at God, at the
charge of nurſery abroad, to eaſe her at home. If ſhe have
not ſtrength to be both wife and ſervant, let the latter yield
to the former, redeeme the comfort of a wife, with the
charge of a ſervant. Provide her that aſſiſtance and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
which is meet for one, who chuſeth to be, to do all
in one for thy ſake, had not God denyed her. Strong ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are meeter for houſhold buſineſſe, then decaied ones:
and releeve her with ſeaſonable tenderneſſe, for there is a
ſhew of reſpect which appeares all at once, when the vitalls
are ſpent: a peny coſt in due time, will do more good to a
ſinking houſe, then a pound, when it is ready to fall downe.
So ſhe ſhall hold out the longer with cheerfulneſſe in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
duties: He that ſhould do otherwiſe, were not worthy

how oft, her faithfull biding by it at home, hath enlarged
thee to travaile abroad. Thy ground and ſoyle, if it want her
alternall revivings, and reſts, cannot laſt long: whether by
allowing her the converſe of her friends for bodily, or of
the ordinances (when ſhe is ſtraitned) both changes of
aires may doe well, and helpe both body and ſpirit. At other
times, ſome other releaſes of labour, ſuch as occaſion offers
in many kindes, either neerer hand, or further off, eft
one, eft another, may cauſe her to returne to that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
with alacrity, which elſe ſhe ſhould attend with an

               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Branch 7.</note> connive and conceale with wiſdome thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
defects,<note place="margin">Connivance at invincible infirmities.</note> ignorances, yea though it be uncapable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which either the frailty of her ſex, or the ſpeciall
frame of her minde, or perhaps the inexperience of one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trained
in ſome buſineſſe, may produce. A Camell cannot go
through a needles eie. According to her ſtrength, ſo is ſhe:
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:58230:133"/>
looke for no deed, beyond power, nor wiſdome above ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.
Oppoſe unto her invincible blemiſhes, her incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
graces: which no art, nor nature can attaine; no
fleſh and blood can teach. Satisfie not, neither pardon thy
ſelf, till that honour which thine heart can freely give her for
that which is pretious in her, make thee impotent to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
her for her infirmities. Though perhaps others would
note them, yet its thy beſt art to hide them. Remember this,
perhaps, even thy wives defects may make for thy contents.
If ſhe were a more compleat woman, ſhe would finde more
work to be humble; and in ſome of her abilities, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
give thee occaſion of leſs patience. Here now is the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of giving honour to the weaker ſex; becauſe God wil have
it ſo. Diſſemble what thou canſt not amend: Ofttimes, her
ſudden treafnes, or impatience come not ſo much from her
ſelfe, as from oppreſſion of mind, faintneſſe of ſpirits and
much employment. Encounter her not with like paſſion,
leſt God ſhew thee thy folly, ere thou die, in another
more unwelcome glaſſe. Many a fooliſh husband hath a
froward wife, becauſe he will have one, hath not the wit to
have any other, any better. What an honour were it to thy
wiſdome to beare with her confeſſed weakneſſe? as going
backward with <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> to cover that from the eies
of others, which thy ſelfe art ſorry to ſee. Perhaps ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of her qualities have not a little graced thee, cover
therefore the reſt with the mantle of thy wiſedome. And ſo
perhaps, with that painter, by veiling a blemiſh in the face,
which he was loth to expreſſe, thou ſhalt adde to her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to thy owne honour. When her paſſion ſhall be over,
and her error paſt, ſhe will more diſlike her ſelfe through thy
concealing of her wants, then thou canſt diſlike her for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
thy credit.</p>
               <p>Eightly,<note place="margin">Branch 8.</note> commend her vertues, without fooliſh flattery:
not as a man,<note place="margin">Commend her vertues.</note> who therfore markes them, that he might praiſe
them, (which is baſeneſſe) but therefore commends them,
becauſe tenderneſſe will not ſuffer thee to ſmoother them.
Grace can no more be coverd, then a blemiſh: both are as
oyle in the hand, Inward gifts, outward parts and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58230:134"/>
cannot but delight thy mind, and ſenſes: let both
in their ſeaſon, for her encouragement, breake out from
thee, by a tender, loving acknowledgement. But as for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayding
her before others, or traducing her in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by open reproofes, odious compariſons, unſavory im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations;
abhorre it. Knowing that all thine and her skill,
is little enough to keep her from contempt of inferiors: but
if thy contempt be added to the reſt, it will make a breach,
not to be repaired.</p>
               <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">Branch 9.</note> allow her all needfull, and ſome complementall
charges and ſupplies:<note place="margin">Supply of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries and comfortable ſupports.</note> let her have for comfort, as well as
neceſſity; conſidering how ſoone thy ſelfe wouldſt repine,
if God ſhould ſtraiten thee with the onely neceſſaries,
but not the overplus of Marriage comforts. Its not onely
thankfulneſſe to her, but to God alſo, to rejoice in ſeeing
thy wife walke and demeane her ſelfe chearfully, in the uſe
of that liberall allowance, which thy tender heart can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teame
her. I doe not here bid thee put the bridle out of
thine owne hand, yeelding to her the ſtroake of chuſing to
her ſelfe the faſhions, attire, company, and expences, which
ſhe pleaſeth, ſuch as ſute not with thy place, and ſober con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
(for alas! what poore thanke ſhould a woman give
her huband, for making her as proud as the worſt) but I ſay,
furniſh her with ſuch conveniences as thine own judgment
and reſpect thinkes meet for her, and her ſober mind and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
affect. M. <hi>Calvin,</hi> a man otherwiſe of ſome what a reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and auſtere diſpoſition, yet being married, perceived that
there be in women, (as he prettily cals them) many tolerable
follies and toyiſh vanities, which a tender husband ſhould do
better to overſee then denie her. He that wil needs wring his
noſe too hard, will draw forth blood, and there is a geniall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to be permitted to a womans liberties, companies, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,
toies and trinkets, which the gravity of an husband
ſhould ſhame it ſelfe in peering into. Many trifles they affect
for their children (of that ſex eſpecially) many complements
about themſelves, ſome rearedges to beſtow upon the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and lawfull merriments of their kind, which it were a
poore thing for an husband curiouſly to enquire after: and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:58230:134"/>
his wiſedome to be truſt her with, as knowing, ſhee knoweth
how to uſe them. (Perhaps the French exceeded the Engliſh
in theſe) But let this bee the rule, Better in ſuch a caſe, wherin
the ſpirit of a wife takes content, to be rather indulgent, then
too ſtrict: ſo long as the maine Canon of Modeſty, thrift and
deceny, bee not tranſgreſſed.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Branch. 10.</note> ſince rules in ſuch caſes can hardly bee given, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the morall Philoſopher biddes,<note place="margin">Reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt be the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</note> do in this caſe, as Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
and a Reſpective heart would advize. Thats ever the
beſt counſellor. Remember, thou ſeekſt the honor of thy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
Wherefore, whatſeover elſe is meet, loving, mercifull,
forbearing and tender, as thou expecteſt prayſe, honor, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall,
enſue it: give no way to ſtrict, unbeteaming, violent
wayes. He that handles a Chriſtall or Venice glaſſe harſhly,
deſerves to repent him for breaking that, which ſleight and
tenderneſſe might have ſaved. Precedencie in ſitting is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by an nationall cuſtome to the ſexe of women: by which,
all other priviledges of giving honor and content to the
weaker veſſel, are intimated. A wiſe reſigning up to her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie
of things within, jewels, plate, and things of price, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
her fidelity, and aſcribing to her wiſedome the overſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

without narrow, ſuſpicious inquiry after the expence
therof, not diſtruſting skill or faythfulnes: &amp; ſo in like caſes.
And thus much be ſayd in particular, for the anſwer to this

to proceed to the next branch in which the preſerving

(for as <hi>Paul</hi> Philip. 4. is not aſhamed to ſay of that grace
of contentation, that he had learned it, ſo may the woman
ſay of this) is a perfect woman. That, which was wont to be

not ſo here. But, after his conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:58230:136"/>
and frame ended, then was ſhe thought of. Secondly,
ſhe was not made of the ſame matter with the man equally;
but ſhe was made and framed of the man, by a rib taken
from the man, and being formed by God, into a woman, was
brought unto the man. And thirdly, ſhe was made for the

from the purpoſe of the Creator; who elſe might have done

ſameneſſe of generation, or relation of uſefulneſſe:
For, he might have made her without any ſuch precedency

the ſtronglier tying the woman,<note place="margin">From the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> being now in a fallen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
For this is ſure, that (notwithſtanding all I have
ſaid) yet the woman being ſo created by God in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
of nature had a moſt divine honour and partnerſhip
of his image, put upon her in her creation: yea ſuch as (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prejudice of thoſe three reſpects) might have held full
and ſweet correſpondence with her husband. But, her ſin
ſtill augmented her inequality, and brought her lower and
lower in her prerogative. For, ſince ſhe would take upon
her as a woman without reſpect to the order, dependance,
and uſe of her creation, to enterpriſe ſo ſad a buſineſſe, as to
jangle and demurre with the divell about ſo waighty a point
as her husbands freehold, and of her owne braine to lay
him and it under foot, without the leaſt parlee and conſent
of his: Obeying Satan before him, nay God himſelfe; ſo

that, till ſhe had put all beyond queſtion, and paſt amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and eaten, ſhe brought not the fruit to him to eate,
and ſo, became a divell to tempt him to eate; therefore the
Lord ſtrips her of this robe of her honour,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 16.</note> accurſing her with
this penalty, that her appetite ſhould bee to her husband.
Which law is not as the law of the Medes and Perſians, (for
that muſt alter) but a Law which bred a Law, an inſtinct
of unequall inferiority, and ſmote into the heart of <hi>Eve,</hi> a
falling from her ſtation, and ſubjected her to her husband.
This appetite here ſpoken of, not onely meaning her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of deſire for ſome ſpeciall end, as benevolence, reſpect,
or the like; but the totall ſubduing of the bent of her ſpirit
to him, not thinking her ſubſiſting enough without him, but
a confeſſed yeelding up of her inſufficient ſelfe (and that
after a penall ſort) to depend wholy upon him. A juſt hand
of God upon her, that ſhe who would be Paramount as a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
above him, in ſinning: ſhould bee fetcht downe to a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of feare and ſubjection under him whom ſhe had ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſhonored.</p>
               <p>And from this roote comes that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">roofes.</note> that the
woman ſinn'd,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 13.</note> and not the man, (meaning, not firſt) ſhe
was in the tranſgreſſion: and what then? Therfore let her be
ſubject.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 7.</note> Read the place. The man is the glory of God, but
the woman of the man: Therfore ſhe ought to have power
on her head, in token of ſubjection and modeſty. And againe,
I permit not the woman to uſurp authority over the man, but
to be in ſubjection.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 1.</note> And Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> let the women be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to their owne husbands, leſt the word be evill ſpoken
of.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 21.</note> And to the Epheſians. Wives ſubmit your ſelves to your
husbands, as to your head: for he is as Chriſt to the Church,
the ſaviour of his body.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 5. 6.</note> So <hi>Peter</hi> addes, As thoſe holy women
formerly were in ſubjection to their husbands: <hi>Sara</hi> by name
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> calling him Lord: By all theſe arguments theſe
two Apoſtles (not the one who was married, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unmarried) doe conclude the woman under ſubjection;
that without grudging, ſhe might reſigne up her ſelfe (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God) to her husband. And doubtleſſe, if it be asked, by
what commandement this ſubjection of the wife ſtands in
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:58230:137"/>
force, its doubtleſſe by the vertue of that fifth, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
obedience upon inferiors to their ſuperiors (although
in divers degrees) with an implied penalty of diſobedience.
And queſtionleſſe, if looke no further, then the ſinne and
curſe it ſelfe, in the letter therof, there is no leſſe threatned to
the woman then ſuch a ſubjection to the man, as had paine
and irking annexed unto it. Even as that other penalty alſo

of man:<note place="margin">He hath recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all things both in heaven and earth by Chriſt.</note> by whoſe induſtry, the wildeſt are tamed. I ſay, by

the releaſe of this penalty of women: for though for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing
the end of their creation by hurting &amp; deſtroying him,
whoſe helpers they were created to be; the Lord abaſed them
to a low degree of inferiority to the man,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 20.</note> and that juſtly:
yet through Chriſt, this extremity is diſpenced with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a tolerable mediocrity for the eaſe of womankind.
So that God can make that a royall and honorable equality
(after a ſort) which ſin made a yoak of tedious ſlavery. But to
the Elect its far better; Notwithſtanding, through bearing

of Children, ſhe ſhalbe ſaved, if ſhe continue in faith, holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

wholeſome meane to humble the ſoule under the mighty
hand of God, and the guilt of her nature, and ſo to drive her
to Chriſt. And not ſo alone, but is a continuall holder downe
of her ſoule under ſubjection to God, in the courſe of her
converſation. And both make her in this religious awe and
ſubjection to her husband, ſo much the more pretious in the
eye of God, and all that know her. Lo a penalty made an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,
very highly eſteem'd of God. And as for thoſe wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
who feare not God,<note place="margin">Pet 3. 4.</note> yet this indulgence of providence, if it be
not a meane to breake their hearts, and to ſeeke further to get

by this, that by ſubjections ſhe preſerves the honor of
her marriage in the integrity therof. She is called the crowne
of her husband. The Crowne Royall we know, is a rich thing,
and richly beſet: all to honour a true King, when its ſet upon
his head in his coronation, before all the people. But a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
made of ſubjection, is of a farre more pretious frame
and mettall then a Crowne, or any thing which goes to it:
and beeing ſet upon the head of her husband, honoreth him,
not onely in the day of his marriage, but all his life long, in
the eyes of all that behold her. No crowne glads the heart of
a King, ſo as ſhee makes glad the heart of her husband. He
is her King and Lord, though he ſhould want this Crowne;
for its not a wives rebellion, which can deveſt him of his
authority, and honor, in point of right: he may he a poore pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed
King, for lacke of this Crowne, but in right, he is a King
nevertheleſſe: having his Crowne deteined by violence from
him, and woe to them that deteyne the Crowne from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Prince: expoſing the perſon of ſo ſacred an one (whom
God hath made honorable) to reproach and diſhonor; So
here. God will revenge it, and make her that hath kept it

backe, to rue it, and to pay full deerly for her preſumption.
But when this Crowne is added to the heade of a lawfull
King, then is his honor made up to the full; &amp; ſuch honor is a
wife ſubject to her husband. Not as a Crown above but upon
his head: her honor is not in being a Crowne aloft, but upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;
for the husband; She is no Crowne of her ſelfe, but in reſpect
of him whom ſhe honors: receving back as much honor from
that head which ſhe Crowns, as ſhe affoards unto it. Neither,
is the honor of ſuch a marriage betweene themſel. alone, (for

               <p>What is then this ſubjection,<note place="margin">Subjection what it is?</note> and wherin ſtandes it? For
the former I ſay its ſuch a convincement of ſpirit in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

to acknowledge &amp; practize all ſuch reverence, as be cometh

this ſubjection ſtandes: to wit, cheefly in the ſpirit of the
wife,<note place="margin">Subjection two-fold.</note> and nextly in her demeanure, The former is that ſame,
wherof St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes of.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3 4.</note> The meeknes of the hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man of

Pride, (the ſeede of unſubjection) and then to the husband,
for his ſake. Although a woman have all outward accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments
this way, yet, if her outward ſubjection begins
before her inward (as many womens doth) it will vaniſh at
laſt, as a lampe for lacke of oile. No framing of a woman, by

ſtand, and as the husband may deſerve by his great learning,
wiſedome, gifts, grace, art, experience, or like abilities,
ſome woman might be content to reſigne up her ſelfe to her
husband, and be ſubject to him, as to her head. But, as for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
husbands, whoſe deſerts are ſmall, and their defects
great, (perhaps in ſome, or in moſt reſpects mentioned) it
would prove an hard taske for a woman ſo farre to deny her
ſelfe,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> as to be ſubject. To which I anſwere, God is not the
God of confuſion;<note place="margin">Husbands though but meanlye par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, deſerve ſubjection by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> he puts this burden of ſubjection upon no
woman, who takes not the yoke of marriage upon her ſelfe;
which the Lord doth force upon none, but allowes each
woman, to be her owne Refuſer, and to chuſe for her ſelfe
(if ſhe can) ſuch a man, as ſhe can yeeld ſubjection unto, for
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58230:139"/>
the excellencie of Gods image which ſhee beholdes in him.
And there is no more then needes, in this caution, to prevent
that baſe and carnall diſdaine, which elſe might ariſe in her
heart, againſt her husband, to wit, when ſhe ſhall meet with
an object of diſhonor, and find little to provoke due reſpect
towardes him: I ſay, the Lord, who knowes, that the ſpirit
that is in man luſts after envie and ſcorne, would have this
diſeaſe prevented to the uttermoſt, that ſo ſubjection might
ſeeme not to come from neceſſity, but from free will. But
yet, ſtill I ſay, if a woman will balke ſuch a command, and,
either out of a preſent humor, or out of a carnall conceit (at
firſt) that ſhee can lead and rule a ſimple man at her pleaſure
(which after ſhee findes an harder Theme then ſhe wiſt)
ſhall ſnare her ſelfe with ſuch an husband as ſhee cannot
deeme worthy of the honor of her heart: in this caſe, I will
wonder that ſhee would ſnare her ſelfe with ſuch a one: but
being maried to her, I will preſſe upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, the like duty of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
as if he were the moſt complete husband of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand:
like (I ſay) for kind, although not for meaſure. For,
tell mee, poore woman, who thus cavilleſt, what is it,
which God hath aym'd at in this Ordinance? at thine owne
endes, or his owne? and thy husbands? Art thou, ſo ſimple,
as to imagine, when God hath impoſed a yoke upon thee, to
tame thy Rebellion; that he will (at thy inſtance) turne it to
a Contentment of thy ſelflove? what ſingular thing doſt thou
in ſubmitting thy ſelfe to excellencies and parts in an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?
Is it not for thy ſelfe! And who ſhall finde out ſuch an
husband for thee, whom thou mayſt not except againſt, as
defective in ſome kynd or other? Know then, that God hath
ordeyned ſubjection to an husband, as an husband, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e he
what he may (he is ſuch an one as thou haſt though fit) and
therfore one whom God hath thought fit to receive thy
ſubjection. If he have but indifferent parts, and abilities, and
not many mens gifts united in one, then conſider, he hath but
the defects of one. And who art thou, O woman, haſt thou
the perfections of many women? Therfore looke upon
thine owne defects, and thy husbands wilbe overſeene. Count
thine owne parts but ordinary, and thine husbands will be
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:58230:140"/>
tolerable. Enlarge his a little, and diminiſh thine owne, and
ſo thou ſhalt meet in the halfe way, and make ſome equality.
But howſoever, God hath ſet thee in place of ſubjection,
howſoever: eyther to a man of worth, for his deſert, or to a
man worthleſſe, for conſcience ſake, and for the ſake of him
who hath ſubjected thee. If thou obey for a Command ſake,
there is thanke, or if not, then for neceſſity ſake, and wo to
thee in both reſpects, if thou be not ſubject. A Miniſter is
commanded to preach and watch for Conſcience ſake, not
for living, or by Reſpects: A ſubject hath not that name
for that he obeyes thoſe Lawes of his Prince which
pleaſe him, but becauſe his Prince Commandes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he will endure the penalties annexed: If then either a
Miniſter, or Subject will looke at God, whether gayne or no
gaine, whether good Prince or unjuſt, and obey, or els woe
to both: then looke alſo thou woman at the bare command
of God; diſpence not thou where God doth not. The ſame
power that is in Commanding all to obey their Parents, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
all to worſhip Idols, to commit ſacriledge; that

ſome kind of ſubjection. If thy husband ſtretch his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
beyond Gods bounds then and onely then, thou art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to reſtraine thy ſubjection in that kind, with yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a reaſon. It was not the ſinne of <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> (as I take it)
that ſhe offered not her beauty and perſon,<note place="margin">In caſe of un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> to a vainglorious
oſtentation before the multitude; for, that might have been
a ſnare to her as it was to others: but that ſhe ſubjected not
her ſelfe ſo farre, as was meet, to goe to the King, and to
acknowledge his Soveraignty in all lawfull, meet things, to
give a modeſt reaſon of her refuſall, promiſing to ſubmit her
ſelfe in all other. Even ſo here. Though the wife bee tied,
both in all direct charges of God, and in all other which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
not, I meane in things pure, comely, and good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
yet if her husband will try her in the contrary, ſhee
muſt in all humble modeſty refuſe, and ſay, whether it bee
meet herein to obey God or you, judge yee. So that, herein
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58230:140"/>
there muſt be wiſe caution uſed, that neither ſhe ſtreighten
her husbands power, nor yet enlarge her husbands tyrannie,
of her obedience to it. For (to digreſſe a little) not only the
husband may preſſe the ſubjection of a wife in things arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
but even in the omiſſion of ſome commands. An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of both wil cleer it. Two faſhions of Apparrel are offered
to a woman, equally decent and modeſt: ſhe inclines to the
one, he to the other. It were his diſcreſion herein, to yeeld
to her, the choice of her faſhion: howbeit, if he will hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to no reaſon, but urge upon her his faſhion, ſhe muſt be
obedient and denie her owne, for conſcience ſake. Againe,
put caſe the husband requires his wife at ſuch a time, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
the hearing of a good ſermon, and to heare another
at another congregation; or to forfeit the hearing of the
word, upon ſuch a Sabbath day, although in generall hee
oppoſe neither hearing the word, nor keeping a Sabbath in
the ſame kind and place; although its true, that the charge of
hearing and keeping of Sabbaths, is Gods: yet becauſe
theſe Commands tie not to every time and place, and may
in ſome caſes be omitted, therefore, let the husband looke to
himſelfe how ſafely he reſtreines her of her liberty (leſt
God curſe his uſurpation) or otherwiſe; and ſtand to his
owne adventures; But ſince ſuch a reſtreint may poſſibly be
lawfull, (though he harſhly conceale it from her) therefore
ſhee muſt not conteſt nor holde chat with her husband, why
he requires it, but yeelde for the preſent, and afterwardes
returne to her liberty againe. But if hereby, he encroach fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to forbid her the Ordinances, ſhee muſt diſobey. Onely
in a caſe of particular abſtinence, ſhe muſt thinke thus, my
husband ſees cauſe of ſuch a charge, I will not deſcant, if he
ſhould offend, yet I will not rebell, ſo long as any good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
may be made of it, but meekly ſtoope and obey. I
might be endleſſe in inſtances; I deny not, but many a good

good ſhee ſhould ſhare in the adviſe, and not be compelled
to obey perforce. An husband perhaps in ſuch caſes may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate
his wife to yeeld, but he doth her the more wrong,
for God in ſuch caſes leaves her to her freedome. Could a
Martyr in Queene <hi>Marles</hi> dayes compell his wife to ſuffer
in the ſame cauſe with himſelfe, although both were of the
ſame judgment? No: for her Conſcience was her owne, and
his meaſure might (haply) exceed hers, many degrees, both
in knowledge, faith and Courage. It hath bine by ſome very
ſtrangely determined, that if an husband be reſolved upon a
remote plantation, the wife muſt follow, by hand and by
head. But, under correction its neither ſo nor ſo: headſhip is
not given the husband to deſtroy, but to helpe and edifye.
She hath a judgement to inform as well as he, &amp; muſt ſee her
groundes cleere as wel as he: ſhe muſt have leaſure &amp; tyme,
to deliberate of it, as well as he, till ſhe be reſolved, that ſhe
may do that in faith, which ſhee doth. Therfore (with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
and diſcretion) its allowed her to deliberate, to alledge
her reaſons by her ſelfe, or by her friends, ſubmitting them
to the judgement of wiſer then her ſelfe, and as ſhee ſhalbe
caſt and adjudged, ſo to deny her ſelfe and obey either way.
And when Gods will is made knowne, eyther he or ſhee,
are to reſt, without further diſtemper each with other? Meane
while, the husband is not to inſult, threaten, and domineer
over her as a Lord, who had his wives will captived to his
owne: neither to deſert and depart from her in a deſperate
way, but by all loving waies tenderly to draw her, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
her by the ſtrength of reaſon, and the bowells of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.
God ſpeakes not now by lively voice from heaven,

ſaies little of that which is within, but leaves to them to
judge, who heare and ſee.<note place="margin">The 1.</note> And this practice of the womans
ſubjection,<note place="margin">In matters of God.</note> muſt appeare in theſe three particulars, in matters
of Gods worſhip, in matter of the world, and, in her marriage
converſe. For the firſt, ſhe is with an awful and ſingle eie, and
honouring heart, to behold in her husband the gifts of God;
As namely, that ability which God hath given him, to be in
Gods ſteed unto her, in all things pertayning unto her ſoule;
as alſo to menage the ſervices of God with her, either in the
family or apart; as to reade the word judiciouſly, to catechize
and informe in the grounds of religion diſtinctly; to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the family, againſt the ſinnes, and exhort inferiors to the
duties of their order and condition, wife, children, ſo jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
ſervants. I ſay, ſhe ought ſo to obſerve Gods image in
theſe gifts of her husband, as to feel no ſpirit in her to deſpiſe
him, to gain ſay, to compare, or cenſure them. Yea though her
own gifts be more then ordinary, yet to conceale &amp; ſuppreſs
them in this kind, (except her husband ſhall at any time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to bee partaker therof in private for his ſpirituall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and then with all humble ſelf deniall to impart her ſelfe
with him:) and enjoy them to her ſelf in ſubjection. Note it,
that the Apoſt. when he is in the midſt of his urging this duty
to the wife, then doth he touch this point, ſaying, let the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
learne in ſilence;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 11. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>2.</note> and, I ſuffer not the woman to teach, or
uſurpe authority over the man, but to be in ſilence. You muſt
note, that in this age, the ſpirit of God was powred upon all
fleſh, ſo that women as well as men had great gifts of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and prophecy vouchſafed them: which (no doubt)
might put them forward to expreſſe themſelves before their
husbands. Now, if ſuch women, then how much more muſt
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:58230:142"/>
ordinary wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſubject in this kind to their husbands? She
ought indeed to encourage her husband cordially, to proceed
in ſuch a courſe, ſhewing it to be the joy of her heart, when
ſhe ſees him to ſet up God in the family: She is to remove to
the uttermoſt, all lets and ſtops, which might offend; as unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
attendance upon buſineſſe (which commonly offers
it ſelfe moſt, when it leaſt ſhould, alſo the complaints and
trouble of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: with other occaſions of the family, as that
might by her wiſe prevention, be caſt upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other times as wel.
I ſay, ſhe is wiſely to procure the opportunities of worſhip;
but he is to menage and performe them: She being within
doores, muſt take it her part to prepare and forelay the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
for her husbands better eaſe and content in theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
a wiſe houſwife will bee alwaies beforehand in her
buſineſſe, that ſo the houſe may be empty, ſwept, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for God to come in. She muſt abhorre (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
to juſtle and ſhoulder out the ſolemne matters of God,
yea or to cut them off by the middle, and contract them, by
the colourable pretences of other matters. So tedious in her
dreſſing and trimming, that a pin muſt not be awry, ſo ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh
and lateward in her upriſing, ſo curious about her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
addreſſment, ſo tedious in her manifold proclamations
and turnagaines, that it would yrke any Chriſtian husband
to ſuſpend Gods worke upon ſuch fooleries, and yet either it
muſt be ſo, or worſe. No no, accompt theſe things bables
in reſpect of the other; that one thing neceſſary: learne to
outgrow all ſuch old cuſtomes as baſe, in Gods eſteeme. The
divell will never ſuffer a woman to want bones to throw in
the way of duty, if he ſpie a mind ready to admit them. If any
part muſt needs loſe, let the worlds part be the loſer. Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the husbands, will firſt begin with God: ſetting him up,
and affording him his due. Nothing will more encourage a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
husband, to be ſtrict and careful in his way, then when
he ſees his wives zeale in this kind: nor more diſmay and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble
him, then the ſlacknes and indifferency of the wife, that
ſhe is ſo far from forgetting herſelf for God, that ſhe will not
afford him that regard which lies within her place to expreſſe.</p>
               <p>But what then (will ſome ſay) is the wife then wholy out
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:58230:143"/>
off from the officiating of worſhip,<note place="margin">How far the wife may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the ſervice of God in her family.</note> in her family? I anſwer,
ſhe hath a great worke of it, to ſeeke God conſtantly by her

                  </label> I anſwer, touching her ſervants the caſe is
leſſe difficult, being her inferiors as well as her husbands,
and ſo ſhe doing the duty of a Governor to them, ſhe is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
eſpecially they being unable, ignorant, or unmeet
to bee ſo occupied, and ready to pearke up and trample the
Authority of the woman under feet, by ſuch occaſions. But,
touching the husband,<note place="margin">Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t with Cautions.</note> although the caſe be more difficult,
yet I doubt not, but ſhe may alſo before him, aſwell as the
other, performe theſe duties, if theſe cautions bee obſerved;
For why? ſerving of God in it ſelf can hinder no ſubjection,
but rather further it, in a lowly and humble ſpirit, privy to her
owne infirmities,<note place="margin">Caution. 1.</note> onely marke how? Firſt ſhe may attempt it,
in caſe of utter inſufficiency of parts in her husband, I meane
knowledge and underſtanding. 2. In caſe of invincible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of expreſſion and utterance in the husband. 3. And
much more, when there is an utter looſenes and careleſnes
in him to look after it, much more a vicious contempt,
ſo that (as far as lieth in him) the worke were like to be quite
caſhierd out of the family: 4. If her husband do allow
her with all cheerfulneſſe, or requeſt her to undertake it, for
Conſcience, or if not, yet bee content to give way to it upon
reaſonable termes, of connivence: yea, though not ſo equall
termes, but with ſome lowring, and with breakings out now
and then, or upbraydings of her; yet not forbidding and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,
ſhe muſt rather undergoe ſome brunts for God and
her family, and beare them as meekly as ſhee can, then under
ſuch pretence to abandon the duty. But, if he bee willing, and
able, though perhaps unqualified for grace, ſhee muſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon the office and diſauthoriſe her husband: but by
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:58230:143"/>
all ſweete meanes accepting that which is, and covering
defects, to draw him forward to that which is not, in token
of an heart truly ſubject. 5. If ſhe (beſide, her ableneſſe to
performe it) bee alſo, qualified with ſingular modeſty, and
humility, awe and reverence, both of God and his Angells,
and her husband, whoſe preſence ſhould alwaies be ſolemne,
and ballance her ſpirit to ſoberneſſe and ſubjection.<note place="margin">Women deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie muſt be pacient.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If God denie her that intereſt and Reſpect from her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
which ſhe deſerveth, ſo that he ſlights her parts, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
her graces, and will by no meanes endure her Service in
this kind; the effect is ſad, to behold God caſt out, and the
family deſerted, and expoſed to ruine: But her remedie is, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to mourne in ſecret, and by other wiſedome to ſeeke the
releefe of this burden, then to breake her boundes. On the
other ſide, if theſe reſpects be obſerved ſhe may. For the
Lord ties none ſo ſtrictly, that either one muſt do it, to wit,
the Mr. of the family, or none. No no: the Lord knowes, that
oftentimes he of all other parts of the houſehold, leaſt beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
his place; and beſides, if the head of the family himſelfe,
even when he is able, yet for reaſons may reſigne up his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to another, a ſtranger, who probably may honor God
and profit the family more, then himſelfe, (in which caſe to
ſtick to his Priviledge were a ſigne of pride and ſingularity)
much more may he (in the caſe of uſuall worſhip, when the
very ſubſtance of worſhip lies at the ſtake) authoriſe the
woman to performe it. For, although he diſhonor his head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
yet his ponance is juſt, for his ſin. Better it is, that he be
ſhent &amp; ſhamed for his ſin, (eſpecialy himſelf revenging it,)
then that God ſhould be barred of his due; by both his &amp; her
withdrawing the duty, &amp; the whole Family wanting the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.
It was Gods Lawe, that, if the Servant would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
abaſe himſelf to ſlaverie, his eare was to be boared: but
his Mr.<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 6.</note> was not to loſe his advantage. And the wife is as well
the Mother, as the man, the father of the family: She is a parte
of the houſeholdes head, as the husband is the wives head.
Now if ſhe be free from the dominion of her head, then is
ſhee the whole head of the family, and returnes to her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge:
ſo that without, checke or controll ſhee may (being
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:58230:144"/>
fitted) diſcharge the duty: But if beeing a widow, (never
uſed to it before) ſhe find this new taske to be over tedious
to her, then ought ſhe to reſigne it to another, as (if ſhee bee
of ability,) to one mainteined for that purpoſe, if not, yet to
ſuch a ſervant, as both for parts and humbleneſſe may bee
meete to take it upon him, without offence: for elſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
may proove worſe then the diſeaſe, through his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
It beeing to conteyne a thing within bounds, when
its out of his Element. As touching the husbands abſence (as
I have ſaid) ſhe may doubtleſſe more ſafely performe it
with the ſervants, then in his preſence. If it ſhould be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
There be in the family, ſuch, as whom ſhe may reſigne
up the duty unto, both for dexterity and humility, I ſay little
to that for the preſent, ſo long as her gifts be competent ſhe
is the Governeſſe, they inferiors, &amp; the ſad effects in bold ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of this courſe, doth not a little diſaffect me: yet I will not
deny a lawfulneſſe altogether for her to reſigne it, if ſhee be
adviſed to it by them that give counſell, as well as by her
ſelfe. But, if ſuch helps faile, what ſhould hinder her from the
cheerefull and free undertaking of it? And ſo much for this.</p>
               <p>Now ſecondly,<note place="margin">2. Branch</note> ſhee muſt alſo be ſubject to him, in matter
of his worldly eſtate.<note place="margin">Of practice.</note> Shee is not to ſtand upon ſtiffe termes,
and (as we ſay) upon her pantofles with her husband,<note place="margin">Matter of the world.</note> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her equality of right to his eſtate, and goods, with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
For here, the queſtion is not ſo much of right, as Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Now ſhe muſt not diſtract the common ſtocke from
her husbands hand, into her owne, to occupy it at pleaſure, to
diſpence the Charges of the family, as ſhe liſtes, or purſing of
the Commodity, as well as he: which were to ſeeke a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaſterſhip
with him; and to ſeeke a double, not the ſingle
wealth of the family jointly. No. Shee muſt know, God is the
God of order, both in Church and family: ſhe muſt holde no
Quarter with her husband in this buſineſſe. Two heades in
a family confound all: her Providence muſt bee under his,
and be directed by his; running in the ſame ſtreame with it,
tending to one Common wealth, purſe, and gaine, not her
owne, but his and the families. I ſay, while the husband is
himſelfe: for elſe, hee being diſabled either by age, or infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:58230:144"/>
or ſome ſudden diſtemper by Gods hand, which ſuffer
it not: ſhee is to ſet to her ſhoulders to the uttermoſt, rather
then the ſtate of the family be perverted. I adde alſo, if he
being a man carried by his in ordinate luſts,<note place="margin">Limitations of ſubjection in worldly things.</note> and feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to ſuffer his eſtate to decay, ſhall permit her to looke
into the affayres of the family, (there beeing no child nor
other to be truſted) ſhe may lawfully undertake the Charge,
rather then commit the ſhip to wind and wether. Moreover,
I doubt not but the wife, ſo far as her skill reacheth, beeing
endued with a gift and skill in ſome myſtery, which her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
is not, eſpecially the husband beeing ydle and ſlothfull
to improove his owne ſtocke, or perhaps having embeſſeled
it alreadie: may be occupied in that calling of hers: provided
that ſhe be comptable to her husband, whoſe ſtocke ſhe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupies:
For,<note place="margin">Prov. 31.</note> if ſhe occupy a borrowed ſtocke, ſhe is praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie
for her induſtrie, but comptable onely to her credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
in ſuch a caſe, if ſhe ſhare with him ſo farre as to keep
him from beggery, its enough, for ſhee aymes at the ſupport
of her family. One thing more I adde, if the husband ſhall
allow his wife to undertrade with him, that is, for her owne
vailes and content to uſe ſome petty ſtocke for her owne
advantage: ſo there be no prejudice hereby done to her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Huſwifery in family, nor to her husbands ſtocke, ſhe
may lawfully accept the kindneſſe, provided that in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of her owne skill, ſhe be guided by his counſell, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
dammage, and improve her gaines to the right endes,
not the maynteyning of ſin in her ſelfe, or hers. But, ſetting
theſe and the like limitations aſide, ſhee muſt be wholly in
all her courſe for him, &amp; his endes; Expecting from his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and love, ſuch recompence as is meet, for her honeſt
ſupport and mayntenance. I am not ignorant, that many hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
ſome for ſloth, others to avoid their wives diſcontents,
ſuppoſing to allay their fierceneſſe of ſpirit by reſigning their
right, others, under other color of Miniſteriall, or burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſervice, have, and do, put the bridle of providence, into
their wyves hand: (and that, when as none of the former
cautions do require it:) but whether this ſwerving from the
Ordinance, hath not weakned their Headſhip, animated the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:58230:145"/>
woman to an exceſſe ofſpirits, cauſing that nature which of
it ſelfe is too forward, to waxe more inſolent; let experience
judge. Inferiority is readie to deſpiſe authority, if occaſioned:
ſin is out of meaſure unbridled: eaſilier held off from the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
then reſtreyned under the occaſion. Beſides, that the
husbands hand is cut off, as it were by the wives Mortmayne
(for many wives peark up to meddle with the eſtate, ſuſpecting
that their husbands are more ready to do good then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
from that bounty, which both his place and will
would admit.</p>

firſt,  ſhe demaund her husbands conſent, which I ſpeak
becauſe ſome women might have from their husbands, if they
would aske, but either diſtruſt of their owne loſſe, or ſcorne
to give it, except they may give it with an high hand of their
owne, hinders them. A foule ſhame, for a Chriſtian wife who
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:58230:145"/>
ſhould rejoice in Gods way, and at the largenes of good 
doing, and honoring of God. <label type="milestone">

ſuch meanes, as might (without his notice) ſupply ſuch uſes,
which being done, although he ſhould ſeek to infringe that
grant by after-exceptions, yet ſhee ought not to yeeld to it in
conſcience, but with love and modeſty, hold her ſelfe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.
But the truth is, many women, who have power
enough to do good, do it not, yet blaming their husband,
whenas the ſin lies upon their owne baſe hearts: as alſo many
who have of their owne to do it, will ſpare themſelves &amp; do
it of their husbands, who indeed eate ſtollen bread, and drink
of the waters of a forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ciſterne. Now I mean by Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
only this, that they have acknowledged no more eſtate
to their husbands, then they wil yield upon marriage, deſiring 
their jointer to be according. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Except upon the yeelding up
of their whole eſtate to their husbands hands, they make ſuch
a mutuall compact together, that the wife ſhall enjoy ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie

it is unlawfull for the woman to put forth her hand to
her husbands eſtate, under any colour whatſoever. As, that
their eſtate is (God be thanked) great enough to admit it:
that they have ſmall charge, and do little by Conſent, any
way: or, that her husband is extreamly baſe, or that her dowry
was more then ordinary; or, if ſhe were againe to compact
with him, ſhe would not doe, as ſhe hath done; or, becauſe
her huſwifery is great, ſhe deſerveth the liberty by her great
gaines, or ſavings: or, her comparing her lot with other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
leſſe deſerving, then ſhee: or that ſhee is hardly handled,
or ſhee is to be pittied and pardoned, if (the need of the poor
ſo requiring) ſhe exceed the rule a little, for the greatnes of
the good which might ſo be done. I ſay not what God may
in mercie do in point of covering the goodneſſe of her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
if ſhee do it ignorantly, but what right ſhe hath to do
it, before God. Let ſuch women as enjoy their liberty bleſſe
God, and beware leſt they ſtumble at the ſtumbling block of
their iniquity: As for the reſt, leſt them mourne under their
croſſe, but not eaſe themſelves of ſubjection: knowing that
their deſies are accepted of God, for the deed, in greater ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
then theſe, and therfore reſting in their integrity, till
God grant them greater libertie. The worſt is, many women
whine and aske Queſtions, while they live under Covert of
their husbands; who yet, when the Lord hath ſet them free,
to try all that is in their hearts, have neither Queſtions nor
Anſwers to make, but are bounde with chaynes of their
owne, from all good doing: ſhewing that neither credit nor
Conſcience was their motive. And doubtles, where there is
a ſound heart to God, few women are ſo ſtraited by their
husbands, but they might by one meane or other winne them
to ſome indifferency. But for that which I ſpake touching the
neceſſitie of times, and danger of not affording of helpe to
the diſtreſſed, and the like caſes of extraordinary nature, its
ſufficient that the Church hath beene compeld to greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrations
then this, as appeares by Act. 1. and the act of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail</hi>

Subjection to my husband. In particular, take theſe. Firſt in

what husband ſo little delights in his wife, as not to allow
her that which is indifferent? But hereupon, to run before
the husband, even to that which is uncomely and exceſſive,
either for faſhion, or coſt, I muſt tell women, it ſutes not
with ſubjection.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 3.</note> Not in gold (ſayth he) broydred attire, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

ſhe: Love wilbe bountifull enough; &amp; ſelfe love may not be
truſted. But oh! the exceſſe of this ſexe, both in married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

Patternes to the world) is ſo woefull in theſe dayes, and ſo
hideous, that it doth not onely helpe to make a world of
Banque-rupts, but to fil the world with curioſity and Vanity!
wherfore, let this be taken for a rule, Never was there curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
proude, and faſhionable woman, who could ſtoop to be
ſubject; by their ruffling, flinging, flaring, curling, dreſſes, tirs,

thinkes) takes away offence: But by that rule, nothing ſhould
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:58230:147"/>
be evill in it ſelfe, but in opinion. But a ſubject wife puts
little oddes betweene ſuch opinion, and realnes: For ſhee
is knowne by her Modeſty, as abhorring to receive luſtre

ſubmiſſion &amp; privity to her weakneſſe. There muſt be a law,
that is an authority of Grace upon her lips, ordering her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and ſpeech, with a ſweet mediocrity, but even as a
threed going through a cloth, ſo a gift paſſing through the
whole man. That which is within, cannot lye hid: for, grace
will make the face to ſhine; Her very bluſh, is Ivy-buſh ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
ſhewing what is within. And on the other ſide loftie

lowde cry (as <hi>Salomon</hi> termes it) bewray to all men, what a

therfore ſhe utters it, equally and conſtantly. She feares not
that imputation juſtly caſt upon women, who abroad will
ſeeme very reſpective, good wife, lets have more of it at

and ſubjection cauſeth the wife to behold her duty,
in the countenance, projects, vertue and way of the husband
(as I noted before of conſent.) His ſervice to God, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to children, following of buſines, is the glaſſe, which
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58230:147"/>
repreſents her: for either ſhe ſees all good, if ſhe have skill to
diſcerne, or beleeves it in love, if ſhee have none. But as for
a controlling ſpirit before her head, ſhe hates it as impious,
degenerate. To takeupon her, to bee the houſhold Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,

to that which is at home:<note place="margin">Shee muſt hee ſubject abroad</note> as comming from one, not aſhamed
of that, which is her true honor. Many women are in their
extreames: Some, although in private, they will not offend,
yet, comming into company, thinke it a kinde of ſlavery, to
profeſſe the like honor, and eſteeme of their husbands. And
indeed, to flatter the husband, were but a baſe office for the
wife, whereſoever, at home, or abroad, arguing, that an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
loves it. Such cup, ſuch cover; But, wiſedome keepes a
meane, and abhorres as much to ſooth and gloze, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
and neglect; That due reverence and ſubjection,
which a good wife ſhewes abroad, ſhe ſhewes at home, and
contraily: Shee is loth to have her hand out. Others are in
another veyne, and, although at home, they make no bones,
to taunt, and take up their husbands, yet abroad, are quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
women, ſo ſollemne and ſubject, as if the Annointed of
the Lord were before her, as if ſhee were the ſubjecteſt, and

when ſhe was ſtretcht out in length beeing dead, but before
crooked, ſo thou ſhouldſt have lyved: ſo to theſe, This

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly her ſubjection alſo appeares in company. A gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

that is ſelfewilled and unſubject. And well he might: for

ſurely no husband can affect a woman of ſuch a trade, it is

troubled with them, then two. But whether he be ſo or not,
whether he like it, or diſlike it, he muſt beare it: Shee will
have her vagaries, her tongue is her owne, and ſhe upon her
owne bottome, and therefore not redeemd with a price,
ſtands and falls to her ſelfe, and what Lord ſhall controll
her? And ſure as ſhe coſt little, ſo ſhe is worth as little, and
may goe for naught. Alas ſhe is ſick of home! There ſhee
ſits, louring and powting, hath no liſt to ſay much: But leſt
you ſhould thinke ſhe hath loſt her tongue, ſhe doth but keep
it, till place and time pleaſe her, and there ſhe will bee as
much on the other ſide! She is like that ſidler, which was
long a getting to pull out his fiddle, but when it was
once out, there could be no putting it up, any more. Surely,
as ſome women are faine to fetch their husbands from their
Ale-bench to ſhame them; ſo had ſome husbands need fetch
their wives from their Goſſips, and yet, its a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were better to have left them where they were,
leſt they make a Tragedy at home, of a Comedy abroad; A
modeſt wife is of another ſpirit; Home hath her heart:
She hath worke enough within doores, and dwells moſt
within her ſelfe. She like the ſnaile, carrieth her houſe alway
upon her backe. She builds it with her hands, and beares it
up by her ſhoulders; never going abroad, but then when it
were an offence to keepe at home. And, being abroad, the
Law of grace is upon her lips; her words, are as the leaves
of the tree of life, healing: and as the fruit thereof, life it
ſelfe, and reſtorative. Out of the aboundance of the heart,
the tongue ſpeaketh: not ſo much, as well: not ſo long,
as ſweetly, ſeaſonably; and when ſhe holds her peace, its
with her, as with a beautifull face, wherein you know not
whether the white or red be fairer, for both are beauty: So
you cannot tell, whether ſpeech or ſilence doe moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

Looke upon thy breſts, whether dry, or milch; if there bee
milke its mine, and given thee (my deere mother) to bee
a nurſe, my nurſe: The ſubject wife ſtops not her eare to
this call: Shee ſeekes not breſts in her husbands purſe, but
in her owne boſome; and, according to her power, takes
her babe,<note place="margin">Ruth. 4. 16.</note> embraces and nurſeth it. <hi>Ruth</hi> gave her ſonne

child, let her not nurſe: Another Phyſitian adviſes the
contrary, if you love your health, nurſe your child: ſurely, if
the skale hang ſo even, if you pleaſe, let God caſt it,
there being no apparant let. A ſubject wife, will bewray it
this way, as ſoone as any: and the Apoſtle joynes it with
ſubjection, in the place ſo oft recited. She will doe it, if not
for her husbands ſake who lies in her boſome, yet for that
infants ſake which lay in her wombe? Though ſhe have
not ſuch wages as <hi>Moſes</hi> his mother had for her paines, yet
ſhee hath aſſurance of ſuch pay from a better Maſter, who
promiſes her ſhe ſhall bee ſaved, that ſhe will doe it for his
ſake, though for neither husbands, nor childes: That fee
and wages, next to faith and love, will cauſe her to looke
upon her babe even in the worſt pickle and hand that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs

 before, that ſhee is to be ſubject to her husband in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of God;<note place="margin">In Gods mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> yet this muzzles not the mouth of a good wife
in helpfull concurrence, but onely in bold uſurpation. Shee
may (without empeach to that,) caſt in her mites into Gods

welfare and content in knowing, beleeving, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying,

ſhee is to aske her husband at home in reſpect of any uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
yet (as the caſe may require) ſhe may, nay, ſhe muſt, in
due ſeaſon, being demanded, reflect back the fruite of that
mercy which the Lord hath ſhewed, and the coſt he hath
vouchſafed her for the good of her husband. And, as the
Lord hath gifted and graced many women above ſome men,
eſpecially with holy affections: ſo, I know not, why he ſhould
do it elſe, (for he was wiſe, and is not ſuperfluous in need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
things) ſave that, as a Pearle ſhining through a Chriſtall
glaſſe, ſo her excellency ſhining through her weakneſſe of

No: but, in reall Communicating of that Grace which
ſhe hath, to her husband eſpecially, as alſo to others in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

               <p>One thingh here comes to my minde;<note place="margin">Impudency of uſurping wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, eaxed.</note> I would not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to patronage the pride and licentious impudency of
women, who having ſhaken off the bridle of all ſubjection
to their husbands, take upon them to expound the Scriptures,
in private aſſemblyes, and to bee the mouth of God to both
Sexes. Not bluſhing one whit to undertake by the 4. or 5.
houres together, yea whole dayes (if their vainglorious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
masked under the colours of humility may be ſuffred) to
interpret the word: applying it according to their way by
Reproofe, comfort, Admonition, and the like, as if Shee-prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
were come abroad into the world. And yet theſe are
ſuch as dare oppoſe and confute the doctrine of faith, and
ſelfdeniall, taught by the moſt able Miniſters of Chriſt: and
tell their diſciples that there is another way to be walled in,
and that is the way of the ſpirit which muſt give ſuch a light
to the ſoule, and ſuch an aſſurance of ſalvation, as may rid
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:58230:151"/>
us at once of all doubtings, feares and unbeleefe, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
us into a confident and ſecure perſwaſion of the love of
Chriſt, without making queſtion. As for any waies, meanes,
trialls, motives, ſignes whereby the ſoule may come to bee
ſetled about the work of Regeneration, theſe they abhorre,
as ſavouring of the fleſh, and not of the ſpirit of light and
inward evidence. In this kind they undertake moſt boldly
to expound the Scriptures, and to reſiſt all who are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mind: Nor allow I others, who defending themſelves
by the practice of the primitive Church, when the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
gifts of Prophecy flouriſhed, whereby the mooving
of the ſpirit, men to men, and women to women, did exprefle
and utter their thoughts and judgements concerning divine
truths, which gift then was very neceſſary for the breeding
up of Miniſters, Doctors, and Proctors, they wanting other
helpes of furniture and ſupply: but appertains not unto us,
who both have ordinary waies of ſupply, and want that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
preſence of the ſpirit which that firſt Church had, to
guide and governe the uſe of ſuch gifts, orderly and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to ſuch endes as they belonged, without ſchiſme and
confuſion.</p>
               <p>God indeed promiſed by <hi>Joel</hi> to the Church of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,<note place="margin">Joel 2. 28.</note>
that he would poure out his pirit without difference to
all ages, ſexes, ſtates of people: But not in ſuch a diſorder, that
a woman ſhould dare in publique, or in a private place after
a publique manner to declare truthes of Religion: uſurping
over men, and encroaching upon the laws of Chriſt. Such
immodeſties and inſolencies of women, not able to containe
themſelves within boundes of ſilence and ſubjection, I am
ſo farre from warranting, that I here openly defie them as
ungrounded, and ungodly: and I cannot but wonder, that
any ſhould bee itching after novelties, as being preſent in
ſuch aſſemblies, eſpecially themſelves being publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and ſuch as ought to diſcerne better betweene things
that differ.<note place="margin">Admonition, to all uſurping women in matters of God.</note> To both I ſay, beware leſt your pride of gifts,

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58230:152"/>
in the ſinne of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> and <hi>Vzza,</hi> and <hi>Vzzia</hi> who
under pretext of holineſſe, adventured to profane hallowed
things: nay, of <hi>Cora</hi> and his complices, who murmured againſt
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> oppoſing their calling and office. If when
you bee convinced by the word, you will yet rebell, take
heed leſt you periſh in his contradiction as Saint <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks,
teaching others by their fearfull example becauſe they would
take none themſelves, If ſuch as theſe had beene from God
the divell would not have let them alone ſo long quiet in
their attempts: But hee knowes diſtraction in opinions,
makes him reigne in the world. And to theſe more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
perſons, I adde all ſuch undertaking women, who either
in families, companies, or in the private converſe with their
husband uſurpe authority, deſpiſing the graces of God in
their husbands and others, and taking upon them all the
ſpeech at the table, to diſcourſe of religion, to debate matters
in queſtion in the Church, to decide things of difficulty, to
ſpend all the time in hearing themſelves talke of good things:
Theſe although they thinke they have learned many things,
yet have not learned one great thing, to wit, wiſely to judge
what their ſex and ſtate will admit. And therefore though
haply what they ſpeake is good, yet its not comely for them,
its as a garment of good cloth but made into a garment very
unfit for the body, for lack of taking meaſure beforehand.
Theſe are not helpers, but hurters by their unſeaſonableneſſe.</p>
               <p>But I digreſſe not too farre. No reaſon there is, why the
impudence of the Rebellious ſhould prejudicate the gifts of
an humble wife, ſoberly improoved. Neither doth the holy
Ghoſt envie her the honour of her grace and helpful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
But as <hi>Bathſheba</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 31. Give her of the
fruit of her hands, and, let her workes praiſe her, in the
gates. Subjection and helpfulneſſe enterfeer not one whit,
both may agree well. Subjection cauſed the wife of <hi>Manoa,</hi>

to diſtruſt her ſelfe, and to call her husband; when God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres

her owne honour upon him. Howbeit afterward wee
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58230:152"/>
ſee, that (the caſe ſo requiring) when as upon the Angels
departure from them, <hi>Manoa</hi> was left in a carnall feare, leſt
he ſhould die, having ſeene God: his wife ſteps in with her
helpfulneſſe, betweene him and his feares, ſaying, if the Lord
would have ſlaine us, doubtleſſe he would not have revealed
himſelfe unto us in this ſort:<note place="margin">Judg. 13. 23.</note> to tell us we ſhall have a ſonne,
and yet to kill us. She ſaw further in this caſe, then hee, and
therefore gives him advice what to ſettle himſelfe upon.
What could more aptly have beene ſpoken? how is that of
<hi>Salomon</hi> verified, A word in ſeaſon, is like Apples of gold,
and Pictures of ſilver? And, how is <hi>Abigail</hi> honored, for her
wiſe counſell,<note place="margin">Sam 1. 25.</note> to a man, who for that her wiſdome, was ſo
farre from diſreputing of her, that he ſent for her to bee
his wife ſhortly after. So that, when <hi>David</hi> was in the way
of heate and reſolution to ſhed <hi>Nabals</hi> and his families blood,
ſhe encounters him, ſaying, let not my Lord doe ſuch a thing
as this! It ſhall not grieve him, when he ſhall ſit upon his
throne, that he hath not ſhed innocent blood: Oh! how
comly a thing it is for Chriſtian wives to come in thus with
humble ſubjection, ſomtimes with a ſoft word to allay wrath,
to ſtay the husband from prejudice againſt good perſons
and cauſes, to enterpret all in the better part; to obſerve
him when the word kindles any affections in his ſoule, and
preſently to follow them home, not to ſuffer them to ſlip out
and vaniſh: to provoke him to mercy and compaſſion, to
draw him from a naturall courſe to a morrall, from a morrall
to a ſpirituall, to perſwade him to equalneſſe and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
towards ſuch as are at controverſie, to debate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
things peaceably, to ſtay his hand from immoderate cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of children or ſervants, when ſhe ſees paſſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
againſt judgement: yea, and ſometimes with the ſame
meeckneſſe, and mildneſſe to convince him of an evill quality
or pang, as choler, diſcontent, worldlineſſe, cenſuring of
others, raſhneſſe and the like, admoniſhing alſo to beware of
the occaſions which might lead thereto: wherewith ſhee
herſelfe ſhould receive the like from him. Somtimes to win
his adverſe heart to a more entire love to Gods Sabbaths, to
his word preached, to his faithfull Miniſters, and ſervants:
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:58230:153"/>
to affect them, to aſſociate them, and to renounce all his old
company and fellowſhip in evill. To be alway darting ſome
ſavour of that which they have heard in publique, and
prompting him with it, that the world eat not up all. Oh!
theſe things come ſweetly, as the latter raine, from a woman,
who counts it her happineſſe, to ſee her husband to bee
brought home to Chriſt, who mournes for his rebellion, and
rejoices to ſee his heart broken: As <hi>Mordecai</hi> told <hi>Eſter,</hi>
ſo ſhould a good wife tell herſelfe, who knowes, whether
thou art come to thy place for ſuch a ſeaſon, even to bring
home one ſheep to Chriſts fould? Doubtleſſe if Satan were
not a profeſſed foe to ſuch helpfulneſſe, the worke would
proceed with more eaſe and ſucceſſe. So much for the firſt
branch.</p>
               <p>The next head of the wives helpfulneſſe is in matters of
the world.<note place="margin">2. Generall.</note> 
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> as truly ſaid of this as of any other vertue
of the wife;<note place="margin">Helpfulneſſe in matter of eſtate deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> that, a wiſe woman buildeth her houſe. For,
though it be little (in compariſon) which a poore woman
can add to the eſtate of her husband, yet ſhe muſt bee all in
all for the preſerving therof. So that an improvident wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is next a waſter in this only reſpect, and loſeth much:
But if ſhe be alſo a ſpendthrift, and really waſtfull, there is
no end of her ſpoile, till ſhe have brought all to nothing, and
overthrowne both her husbands ſtate and poſterity. She is the
Moth yea Canker of the marrow and beauty of his eſtate, and
by inſenſible morſels, devours at length, the whole ſubſtance.
And becauſe there bee many queazy women, (yet ſuch as
would be religious) that thinke it a peece of religion, to be
no houſewives, let <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> a Queene, who might more
ſtand upon her eſtate, then the proudeſt Dame may upon her
dowrie; in her inſtruction to <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeake. Shee deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
a godly and helpfull wife, (and not onely a thrifty
one) as it appeares from the 25. verſe to the end of the Chap.
doth couple her vertue and houſe wifery together:<note place="margin">Prov. 31.</note> She
openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the law of grace is
upon her lips: (there is her grace) and ſhe overſeeth the
waies of her houſhold, and eateth not the bread of idleneſſe:
(there is providence:) And, leſt any ſhould thinke this
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58230:153"/>
latter might be ſpared, its to be noted that ſhe ſpendeth the
whole Chapter in the deſcription therof, by divers paſſages:
wheras, the former ſhe ſhuts up in the end of that Chapter in
a verſe or two, although the more neceſſary: as taking it to
be more out of queſtion, then the other; nay note how the
holy Ghoſt wil needs convey that inſtruction by the counſel
of a woman, to all of her ſex, to make the thing leſſe ſubject
to exception: preſſing it ſtrongly in an Idea of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
helper: and that with pleaſing Rethorique and variety:
Why? ſave becauſe ſhe ſaw it a vertue meet to be urged, as
being that which many women will not acknowledge.
Neither can the greatneſſe and wealth of wives controll this
duty of Providence, and that not for ſhew neither, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
and praiſe, to let the world ſee what skill in ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in needle worke, or in other matters, they have, but for
conſcience ſake. In <hi>Bathſheba's</hi> daies, gold and ſilver were
common, and as plentifull as the ſtones and figtrees: and
therefore need there was not for Queenes or their maids to
work ſo hard; And yet, for the religion of the duty, ſhe ſpeaks
ſo, as one who had experience of it in her owne prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſon, and had the overſight alſo of her maydens in the
handling of the wheele and ſpindle, for flax and wool. And
ſurely in great families both ſexes had need to be yoked, and
awed from the ſins which come from ſloth and idleneſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I adde, in a mediocrity, leſt they trench upon the
contrary of covetouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>My meaning yet by all this,<note place="margin">Wives muſt not have any peculiar wealth apart from their husbands, but in common.</note> is not to allow any woman
the liberty of any ſuch peculiar houſewifery by her ſelfe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the common ſtreame and welfare of the husband
and family, but in common with, for, and under him, though
in a way of her owne, beſt fitting her ſex and education.
For, I know there be houſewives, who excell in providing
for themſelves, and (like the Steward in the Goſpell who to
prevent beggery, when he ſhould be turnd out of ſervice)
can ſhift for themſelves, who yet are but ill providers for
the good of their husbands whom (to uſe that Emperors
compariſon) I may liken, to the Spleene in the Body, which
when its fulleſt, makes the body emptieſt, and ſo commonly,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58230:154"/>
when the cofers of theſe Houſewives are fatteſt, their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
treaſure is leaneſt and lankeſt: wheras ſhee ſhould
rather be a pipe to conveigh into his ceſterne, then a ſponge
to ſucke from, or a Channel to dreyne from his fountayne.
This yet is a common vice: not only of ſecond wyves prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for their owne broodes, or kindred: But of all ſorts of
women; and, is cauſed by pride of Birth, of dowry, educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or perſon: which to godleſſe ones, are occaſions to
withdraw them from the yoke of ſuppoſed bondage, though
if a Queen may judge of helpfull &amp; houſwifely providence.
In ſome others its rather cauſed, by oldor late habits of
luxuriouſnes, riotous and lewde companionſhip: for
now wee have meetings of Women-drinkers, Tobacconiſts
and ſwaggerers,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3, 1. 2.</note> aſ well as men: leſt <hi>Pauls</hi> Prophecie of the
latter time ſhould be falſified, and (which is worſt of all)
ſecret and ſtollen liberties. Theſe vices, are like the daughters
of the horſeleach, crying, give, give, but like hell &amp; the grave,
never ſatisfied. In ſteed of the which licentious uſurping
over the husbands commodities, let women know, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have a true property and intereſt in their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
Eſtates, yet when the uſe of the ſame comes into
queſtion, the Lord will have it, as wel as other things, ordered
by the husband. Neither may the bad qualities of the man, as
his churliſhnes, Covetouſnes, and Enmity to vertue, authorize
the woman, to be her owne carver; leſt if this wicket be
ſet open to good wyves, the bad ones throng in with them
alſo; and uſurpe it to evill endes. Gods law is one, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
all ſorts indifferently.<note place="margin">If they deſire any ſtroake in diſpenſing the matters of the husband they muſt deſerve it by good carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> If women deſire a ſtroake this
way, (as indeed ſome may more cauſedly plead in then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in ſhew) let them labor by their good deſerts, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
with their husbands, and by their helpfulneſſe and love
to draw ſo good an opinion of themſelves that they may
with a willing mynd, yeeld this favor to their wives, as to uſe
their pleaſure in a ſober manner. (Provided that they ſpende
it upon honeſt and religious objects.) But, if God have layde
another burden upon them (as I noted in the former chap.)
of ill natured and ſtraithanded husbands: let them take up
and beare it, as the Croſſe which God hath ſet apart for
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58230:154"/>
them, without diſcontent or grudging. Eſpecially ſecond
wyves, having the charge of former brood depending upon
them, (further then by cheerfull conſent of their husbands,
they are allowed) let them beware, leſt herein they diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
their Profeſſion, by yeelding to the ſtrong and tempting
occaſions, of needy, unruly, and burdenſome children, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
their want, by injurious pillage of the husband, and
his poſteritie. This by the way.</p>
               <p>To conclude the point,<note place="margin">Three bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> theſe three ſpecialls concerne the
womans providence; firſt getting, then ſtoring, and laſtly
diſpenſing thoſe things which are committed to her charge.
The firſt of theſe three, is proper onely to thoſe women, who
ſell their husbands commodities, or are allowed to be chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of their wares, (which is the caſe of few) or ſuch as by
reaſon of ſome ſpeciall skill in any crafts or manufactures,
have ſome ſtocke allotted them by their husbands, to trade
and traffique withall. In which way, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they muſt uſe all good 
faythfulnes,<note place="margin">Act of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to bring ſomewhat in.</note> neither ſelling to their husbands loſſe, nor for
their owne ſecret gaine, nor the hurt of the buiers, all which
rules, are in all tradings, uſually tranſgreſſed. Beſides the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery
of many tradeſmens wives, who learne their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
skill, ſerve to the making of ſundry wares, which
ſerve to the upholding of the family, and eſtate. In which
caſe (as the other burden of family will admit) they are to
ſhew their beſt endeavor, both for the getting in of ſome
part of the mayntenance, and ſaving it from being ſpent
about ſuch houſhold expences, as, by paines and thrift at
home might be ſpared.<note place="margin">Pro. 31.</note> And this is that which <hi>Bathſheba</hi> moſt
inſiſteth upon; She laboureth cheerfully with her hands: ſhe
is like the Ships of Merchants: She bringes home her food
from a farre: Shee ariſeth while it is yet darkiſh, her candle
goeth not out, ſhe puts her hand to the wheele, and her
handes to the ſpindle. She makes ſheets and ſelleth them:
and giveth girdles to the merchant. Shee conſidereth a field,
and getteth it; and with her hands ſhe planteth a vineyard.
This is the image of the ſtirring houſewife. It were wel now
a daies if women would abate of their ſuperfluous eaſe and
needleſſe expences (which they do the more eaſily laviſh
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:58230:155"/>
out, becauſe they wholly relie upon their husbands purſe)
and in ſtead of great merchandize and ſelling of wares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
apply themſelves at home in private, about the ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the family wants, helping to cloath and lodge them
by their diligence: for better and more enduring is that ware
which is made, then that which is bought: taking occaſion
there by to buſie their Children in meet employments, and to
prevent ſloth, eaſe, gadding, ſtolle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liberties &amp; vanities which
the unbridled myndes of Maids, both of children, &amp; ſervants,
are in theſe daies peſtred with, loathing labor &amp; painfulnes,
and expoſing themſelves to the vices iſſuing from thence.</p>
               <p>The ſecond act of Providence in the wife, is, the Beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> &amp; ſafe ſtoring up, preſerving &amp; improving thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hath brought to her hand.<note place="margin">Women muſt bee their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſtorers and Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</note> Which,
as it is fit they ſhould be put to her truſt, ſo ought ſhe (ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in her husbands abſence) to be carefull of them, that they
decay notunder hand, that they be not open &amp; expoſed to the
ſtealth or ſpoil of Servants, or violence of others. And herein,
not onely her ſelfe in perſon is to be provident, but alſo to be
carefull to overſee the waies of ſuch ſervants or others, as
are under her, as inſtruments to act that, which other buſines,
or infirmity hinders her ſelfe from performing. A wiſe houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
will contrive and diſpoſe as well by ſitting ſtill, and
uſing her brayne, as ſome other by bending the force both
of ſoule &amp; body. Her ſelfe cannot keep things fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from Ruſt, from fuſt and ſpoile, from motheatings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caies:
cannot perhaps do each inferour worke ſerving to
keep all things neat and ſhining: but ſhe may ſo overſee the
waies of others, that they may prevent ſuch loſſes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
ſuch conveniences as are meet for the family. So that
ſhe may eaſe her husband from the inſpection and care of
ſuch things, as concerne not his providence: to which taske,
if he be put, either for the things themſelves or for the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
diſpatch therof, ſhee ſhould much diſcredit her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
and prudence, and burthen her husband: whoſe
worke lyes in a deeper and higher kinde. Not, as if the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
ſhould (as <hi>Laban</hi> of <hi>Jacob)</hi> exact each penie of the
wife which miſcarieth, or be implacable for thoſe loſſes
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:58230:155"/>
which cannot bee avoyded, (ſince his owne wiſedome
cannot prevent many.) But, that ſhee by her care muſt ſerve
providence that no ſuch complaints bee heard of as might
provoke him juſtly: As for loſſes which befall by the hand of
God,<note place="margin">Matt. 13. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>2.</note> both equally muſt patiently beare them: This is pithily
alluded unto, in that ſimile, where Chriſt like<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s a good ſcribe or
Diſciple taught to the kingdome of God unto the good houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife,
which ſtoreth up both old and new, that is family pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of all ſorts, which ſhe brings out in their ſeaſon, for
meet uſe. Otherwiſe, what comfort ſhould the man have, in
his bringing in ſupplies for family, houſehold ſtuffe, bedding,
linnen, Apparell, daily diet for the bodie, if he might not
truſt to her fidelity at home to preſerve them, to menage, to
dreſſe and proportion them to the uſe of the family? And
ſurely, if ſhe do her part wiſely herein, neither on the one
ſide being ſo looſe in her ſtorings that every one may com by
her commodities as freely and boldly as her ſelfe, to ſpend &amp;
ſpoile, to drinke &amp; imbezel at pleaſure; nor on the other ſide
abuſing her authority, and the power of the Keyes, ſo that ſhe
ſtraiten the family of their due, and ſtrangers of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitall

go in a wiſe middle betweene both: I ſay, ſo doing, it may be

the ſoule of the ſtate, the ſoule is wholly and in each finge
of the body, ſo ſhould my helpfulneſſe begin at husband, and
animate all the family. But eſpecially it ſhould be the life of
my husband; his ſoule I am bound chiefly to helpe, by godly
counſell: his ſpirit I muſt helpe, by my cheerfull behavior:
his body I muſt cheriſh with my beſt benevolence; his
name I muſt tenderly honour, his ſorrowes I muſt wiſely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate;
his joyes, I muſt ſympathize; his dangers, I muſt
prevent, his health and ſtate I muſt uphold: and when I have
thus done, as the Bee gathering hony, as the Sheep bearing
a fleece, as the Oxe plowing the ground, as the builder fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

oh Lord, let me look to! If I do it of a willing vertuous mind,
there is praiſe! If not, yet a neceſſity is layd upon me, and, wo
to me, if I be not an helper? who ever ſhunned or waived
the end of their creation, but vengeance purſued them as
traytors to Nature, to heaven! I was not made for my ſelfe,
but for another: each part of the houſe claiming a part of
me. As he ſaid once to a coy Virgin, thy virginity is not all
thine to diſpoſe of: in part its thy parents, father hath
a ſtroke in it, mother another, and kindred a third: Fight
not againſt all, but be his, whom they would have thee. So
ſay I to thee being a wife and an helper: Thy womanhood,
thy helpfulneſſe is not thine, its thy husbands, his body, ſtate,
poſterity claime it from thee: he laies claime to all, not as
that Tyrant did, all thy wives ſilver and gold is mine: but
as one that is inveſted in all thou haſt by peculiar providence.
I live not by rule or examples: the unhelpfull ſhall not teach
me to be a hurter: the helpfull ſhall not ſo teach me as if I
followed for their ſake only, but for his, who hath ſubjected
me to helpfulneſſe.</p>

As bleeding on the arme by art, ſtops unnaturall bleeding

to man. This grace becomes this ſexe, the rather, becauſe
it argues truth of grace: for elſe calmeneſſe of her frame,
naturally carries her to flatneſſe and fulſomneſſe. It muſt be
with a Chriſtian woman, as it is in nature with the female
ſexe of the creatures. Nature hath put a firceneſſe into the
female becauſe of the impotency thereof: therefore the ſhe
Beare, the Lyoneſſe, are the moſt raging, and cruell. But
grace makes that naturall impotency of the woman, turne
impotency for God: as to provoke her husband with ſweet
affections for his ſervants and worſhip.<note place="margin">1 King. 17. 9.</note> It was a great praiſe

medly of them, the temper of that ſpirit ariſing from them,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58230:165"/>
is that thing which makes the wife ſo gracefull. This muſt
come from that wiſe &amp; alſufficient skill of the ſpirit of grace,
which muſt teach her Reynes in the night ſeaſon, and put
into her the ſpirit of gracefulneſſe: He who hath given a gift
to the Bee to diſpoſe that honey ſhee hath gathered from
all flowers, in ſo wiſe a manner, that her workmanſhip makes
all the beholders to admire it; muſt in an higher kind teach
her to make her graces into one compound and temper; I
ſay muſt enable her to lay them all ſo ſweetly together, and
order her whole marriage courſe by the helpe of them; that
both every one may afford her ſpeciall influence into it, and
all of them together may make her face to ſhine, and the
beauty therof to appeare gracefull to all the beholders. Shee
muſt beg of God this ſpirit by Prayer: and as all the looſe

and then bound together with a thred, that they ſcatter
not:<note place="margin">Is, the ſweete union of all into one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</note> So the ſpirit of warineſſe and wiſedome muſt gird the

accommodate her ſelfe to every occaſion offered, in a ſutable
correſpondence,<note place="margin">Act. 22. 28.</note> that there be no gulfe nor interruption, no
unequalneſſe nor diſproportion in her carriage. No man
ſhall need to paint an exact beautifull face: nor teach her
that is faire, to ſhew it forth, it ſhewes it ſelfe to all naturaly
without trouble. As <hi>Paul</hi> told <hi>Liſias:</hi> That he was borne a free
man of Rome, it coſt him nothing: ſo where an heart is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
with grace, it will without any difficulty expreſſe it,
and caſt her ſavor abroad: That which will make an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
to toyle and ſweate, comes from grace with ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and facility; yet I deny not but as that Glyceris ſhewd
great skill in compounding the flowers of her poſies, and the
Iewells of a Crowne muſt be skilfully ſet into it, to make it
glorious: ſo, the more carefull the woman ſhalbe to marke
the circumſtances, the ſeaſons and all the occaſions of her life
ſo much the more wiſely ſhe ſhall be able to apply each of
theſe graces to their objects, and ſhew forth the luſtre of all
in her generall carriage. And ſuch as are the ingredients, ſuch
muſt needes the compound bee, if skill and diſcretion order
it well. Now, the expreſſion of all theſe in one is amiablenes:
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58230:165"/>
that is the way whereby ſhe utters her ſelfe, and in it, the
lovely bluſh of them all appears: humbly amiable, mercifully
amiable, amiable in the comely carriage of all, (as her bodie
is in the wearing of the moſt coſtly and beſt ſuted attire) moſt
comely and pleaſing. Eſpecialy when the grace of this grace
is added to it, that this is not in a pang, or good moode,
when all goes well, but comes from a principle within,
which cauſes her to goe on in an uniforme courſe: ſo that
looke how you ſee her at one time, you ſee her at another:
ſhee is alway her ſelfe: and as a Virgin of a comely face, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſhe bee all blubberd with teares, ſhe loſeth not her
beauty, but by the contrary, doth commend it: ſo, although the
occaſions of her life are ſad aſwell as cherefull, yet the cloud
doth not diſanull the ſun, but cauſes it to ſhine thorough

can equall the reflexion of thoſe graces, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor

it not even in affliction, utter it even in the midſt of bodily

oppoſition and ſorrowes, as the Sunne breakes through the
thick miſt, or darke cloudes, yea although eclipſed in part,
yet ſhine in part, and let a glimmering appeare; remember,
thou art a true friend, made for the day of adverſity; it is not
ſo thankeworthy for thee, to cheere thine husband, when
he can cheere thee, or himſelfe without thee while the day
of proſperity laſts; but then to play the ſweet orator, and
to make him merry, when all other comforts have forſaken
him, in the ſad ſeaſon of ſickneſſe, of ſorrow; this is better

her ſo, and brought her ſo framed, into thy boſome! Let her
finde by good experience, there is no love loſt; but, let thy
heart reſt in her and truſt to her: ſeale her a bond of thy ſure
and faithfull reſpect, againe, and let her ſee, ſhe hath not a

is pretious in her at a due rate. Set her as a ſignet on thy

who hath honoured thee, more then all thy wealth, or

and ſuffer none to eclipſe her worth. Give her of the worke

loiall awe, and yet with delight as under an eaſie yoke; is
moſt tender of his welfare, yea is glad, and thinkes not her

for the glad tidings they brought her: Shee compts no labor

keeps his counſell: Dares not proſtitute her ſelfe to any, not
only luſts, but even liberties, or companies which ſhee
thinkes may bee diſtaſtfull to him, yea but ſuſpicious; The
tokens he ſends her, as pledges of his favor, are moſt deere
unto her. She ſeeks no priviate welfare of her owne beſides
his: She diſtruſts not his proviſion, but truſts him confidently,
knowing ſhee ſhall not want: denies her ſelfe for his ſake,
&amp; rejoices that by this, her loyall heart may be tried: Thinkes
never the worſe of him, becauſe ſhe ſuffers for him, but rather
the more he coſts her, the deerer he is to her: No husband of
other women can ſtaine hers, for hers is above all, the cheef of
ten thouſand; the faſhions, gariſh &amp; whoriſh attires, paintings
and ſpangles of harlots come not about her neck, nor wreſtes
But ſhee frames her ſelfe to his contents, in all chaſtity ſhee

odious colors are here? I anſwer, Here is one terrible one,
which imports all the reſt. That which God himſelfe will in
perſon appeare againſt, and ſit upon the judgment ſeate to
enquire of, that muſt be a terrible crime; But God himſelf,
(not his Deputies only, for all men are lyars) will in perſon
ſit to judge it. Kings (we know) and Princes, come not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
to the Starre chamber or to the Kings Bench in perſon,
for ſlight crimes, but remarkable and notorious. When King
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8. to pleaſe that bloody Tyger <hi>Gardiner,</hi> came in

perſon to ſit upon that holy man and meeke lambe of Ieſus
Chriſt, <hi>Iohn Lambert,</hi> how terrible was his appearance, and
how frowning a brow caſt he upon that innocent Martyr?
What then is the brow of that God, that muſt ſit upon King
<hi>Henry</hi> himſelfe? Only the difference is, Princes make a long

boult out the truth; But, the Lord proceeds <hi>ex officio mero,</hi>
he needs no Informers, no Evidence, but is witneſſe, Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,

more upon this or that man,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 5.</note> and his crimes? By name he will
bee a ſwift witneſſe againſt the Adulterer, as <hi>Malachi</hi> ſpeaks;
And where the delinquent is his owne Accuſer, what need

and of this by name! The Iudge then, comming in perſon
making a ſwift worke of it, and having the ſinner himſelfe

who (as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaieth) only condemned adultery, ſuffring
youthes and maydes to defile themſelves without reſtraint, as

law is one, and Ceſars another. Alas, that weake Relique of
light which was in Heathens,<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> was ſoone overſhadowed:
It cauſed the Apoſtles to forbid the converted Gentiles, the
ſin of fornication, and Idolls, as equally promiſcuous among

have written Theaters of Gods judgements, the examples

daies wherin men will rather ſit upon God himſelfe and
ſcorne him to his face, then tremble at Gods ſitting in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

large ſupply us in this kind, if our hearts bee not quite ſunke
into a ſenſleſſenes of them. Even while I was writing this,
leſt I ſhould want unſought preſidents, a reporte came to
mine eares of a Black-ſmith neer Colcheſter, (whoſe wound
is as it were yet bleeding) who having made a Cheine to
hang a woman, that had murthered her husband, fell into ſuch
ſuddeine terrors by Gods hand oppreſſing his conſcience,
for his Adulterous life, that he cried out, ſaying, that he was

as wicked as ſhee for whom he had made the cheyne; ſo,
that he could not lin, till by cutting his own throate, he had
made an end of himſelfe. So the Lord pulles out ſome to be
ſpectacles of reproach and deteſtation to the world, though
thouſands ſcape. All are not drag'd out by the hand of God
openly as that bawdy Biſhop at the Councell of Trent, whom

In the proſecution of which three, if I ſhall haply
trench upon any thing before touched, through the neerneſſe
of the argument, let the reader conſider, that when I wrote,
that before upon the point of chaſtity, I intended not the
handling of this latter part of the verſe: but I hope, I ſhall
avoid any purpoſed repeatings of ought, which the neceſſity
of the order doth not inforce upon me, for the avoiding of

Abhorre thy ſelfe,<note place="margin">Abhorring ſomewhat</note> that inward originall corruption of

of the fountaine. Had it not beene (ſaith <hi>David)</hi> for my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
naturall ſtaine,<note place="margin">Thyne owne ſelfe.</note> I had never committed ſuch an actuall abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
as this. Alas! as the feelde of a poore man va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
in the Mappe of a whole towne, ſo doth this evill
of concupiſcence vaniſh in moſt mens eie, when they take
a ſurvey of ſinne; whereas this inward is the body: and that
which we ſe breaking out, is but a member, as it might be here
a toe, there a finger of defiled old <hi>Adam.</hi> Till then the mother
bee abhorred, the daughter will never be renounced. Put
caſe, thou couldeſt bitterly inveigh, yea incenſe thine
heart, againſt ſome actuall filthineſſe, yet, till this inward
dunghill bee raked, which is able to ſteame forth into an
hundered Adulterers, yea ſinnes without number; I ſay till
this furnace kindled by hell, as ready to defile thee againe
(when thou haſt ſeemed to waſh out many ſtains as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare)
with ten fold more wickedneſſe; looke for no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
of thy diſeaſe. Its a running ſoare, an iſſue of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and muſt firſt bee dreined, eare the paſſages drie up:
Theſeely man who ſaw the ſtreame of the River run very
ſwift, ſat him downe upon the banke and ſlept, thinking by
that time all would bee run out, and he might go over dry
ſhod! Poore ſoule! for that river ran ſtill, ever did, and
ever will. So is it here: till God dry up, or turne the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
it can be no otherwiſe. The due ſight of this thy bent
of heart, thy frame of ſpirit, alway inclining one way, never
to Purity, firſt tiring thee as a traveller, wurry thee as a dog,
purſue thee at heeles, as the Avenger of blood did the Man
ſlayer; is one of the beſt waies to quit thee of this miſcheefe.
Get an inward abhorring of thy ſelfe, ſee what an huge heap
of filth lies there; marke how its like the doore rolling the
ſame way on his hinges; and this weariſome ſight may
(perhaps) drinke up thy ſpirit, and caſheire all thy dawbings,
colours, and excuſes. I ſay, This may raſe thy forte it ſelfe,
and ſhake it from the foundations, and then the out works
will ſoone yeelde and fall to the ground. Looke upon this ſin
in that Glaſſe with that eye, which <hi>Paul</hi> looked in, when he
beheld luſt forbidden: and, (if any thing) this ſhall ſwallow
thy ſhip wholly up in the quickſands of ſelfe-abhorring.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:58230:187"/>
Say to thy ſoule thus, were I waſht with nitre, yea ſcoured
with ſope, yet the clothes I weare will defile mee as faſt:
Alas! I get nothing by all my outward abhorrings, luſt will
not bee ſcared away with Holy-water. I have a Boſome
Orator within, which will draw mee to luſt, twenty times,
one after another, and pull mee faſter to filth, then all my
owne, or others diſſwaſives can withdraw mee from it: Lord
then, draine this flood and overflow! teach mee to abhorre
my ſelfe in duſt and aſhes, if ever I get victory over my
actuall corruptions!</p>
               <p>Secondly, abhorre thy inward Actuall thoughts, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> uncleannes. Workmen proceeds according to an
Idaea and platforme in his mind,<note place="margin">Things to be abhorred,</note> ſet before him, in all his
projects and attempts:<note place="margin">Thoughts of Contemplative uncleannes.</note> ſo doth the Adulterer. The heart (ſayth
our Saviour,) is the Adulterer, all the miſchiefe is hatcht
there. What contemplations of villany, doth the forlorne ſtie
of Thoughts nouriſh in many? What uncleane man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is there, whoſe thoughts do not plod and contrive their
meetings, the places, the tyme, manner, and circumſtances?
What a Thoroughfare of ſuch ſcurfe, is that defiled ſpirit of
theirs, which they carry about them? Once, a learned man
was called a walking library: But of theſe, it may be ſayd,
They are a walking Stewes. Its as eaſie to pull their hearts
out of their bellies, as to alter and turne the courſe of theſe
ſuggeſtions: the Devill beeing the Preſenter, and the fancie
the Receiver. Mortify then and nip theſe thoughts; which
have the whole man at command: Senſes do not ſo much
hurt to thoughts, as thoughts to them and to the bodily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
The loathing of baſe, vaine, wanton, and cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thoughts, in this kind, were halfe the cure. Theſe vapou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up from the heart to the brayne, do ſo poſſeſſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguer
it that the affections are fired, and on thornes, till
they come to practiſe. Now, when the fewell is gone, or
leſſened, the fire muſt ceaſe: let originall corruption be once
abhorred truly, and this will follow. Thinke that God ſpeaks
to thee in St. <hi>Iames</hi> his phraſe,<note place="margin">Iames 4. 8.</note> clenſe your thoughts ye ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and purge your hearts, ye wantonly minded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Howlong
ſhall your uncleane thoughts abyde with and within you?
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:58230:187"/>
Know you not that Imaginations are the firſt moover of
the whole frame of corrupt Nature? If they moove, muſt not
all inferiour ones dance after their Pipe? And tell mee, when
Satan fires the whole man, whither doth he inject firſt his
fireballes? Is it not into the thoughts? If he would tempt,
accuſe, terrifie, how goes he to worke but by rayſing up a
commotion in the thoughts? And in what part is hell fire
kindled in the damned? Is it not firſt in the thoughts? Keep
then thy thoughts with all diligence! Foreſtall Satan and
uncleannes by good thoughts, chaſt, pure, contrary thoughts;
let the Chambers of the thoughts be prepoſſeſſed with theſe
gueſts: &amp; they will ſparre the doore from ſuch encroachers.
Eſpecially if the pure ſpirit bee the uſherer of them in, by
the word.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, abhorre all thoſe curſed colors, and mufflers of 
this ſin:<note place="margin">Things to be abhorred, Colors and Excuſes of it.</note> which the fertile heart, can deviſe abundantly, to
alleniate and leſſen this ſin! The Heart is the forge of all
theſe tricks, and evaſions. If the Lord have called this ſin
ſo terrible; let it bee enough to thee; abhorre the Divells
figleaves; &amp; behold the filth of this skirte with deteſtation.
Blaunch it not over with thy Nature, (that worſt of all) the
propenſion of thy conſtitution, the ſtrength of allurements,
the difficulty of preſerving thy ſelfe, the Generality of the
ſin, the ſlighty opinion of the Multitude. Abhorre theſe
cordially, or elſe the ſin abides ſtill, under diſpenſation and
connivence. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Then fourthly, as touching other inward fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters
of luſt, (of which I breefly ſpeake becauſe I have 
prevented my ſelfe in the point of Chaſtity before) Abhorre
thy covers and ſhelters,<note place="margin">All inward fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters.</note> hope of impunity, hiding thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes
under the ſhrowd of a married whore, or of thy
wicked friends and Abettors; ſuch as the Devill will rayſe up
to ſticke to thee, or any ſuch as for a baſe bribe, will ayde
thee, and keepe thee from open ſhame; Such impunity being
forecaſt in the minde is an hardnor of the Adulterer in his
ſin: Abhorre a luskiſh laſy heart, that delights in eaſe and
ydlenes, loath ſoftneſſe, effeminatenes and impurity of ſpirit,
(a throughfare for luſt) Alſo unarmedneſſe of the Soule,
lying open and expoſed to occaſion, empty, ſwept and
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:58230:188"/>
garniſht, fit for the next Devill that comes: Abhorre raſhnes
and unſtayedneſſe, which will on the ſuddeine betray thee,
to the occaſions of luſt. Renounce all ſelfconfidence, and
ventrouſnes upon thy ſtength, as rather ſcorning to be ſnared,
then humbly fearing ſnares, (for Alas! poore worme, who
art thou, if left to thy ſelfe?) Know this, that luſt will give
ſmall warning, it comes as a torrent: as the neceſſity of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
man: There is the ſame mettal in thee, which is in others;
and they are ſooneſt ſnared, who feare leaſt.</p>
               <p>Beware of ſelflove, which gives it ſelfe Allowance of the
largeſt ſiſe, as loth to deny it ſelfe nothing which it covets,
and counting nothing too pretious, no liberty or delight too
deare for it ſelfe; Abandon inconſtancy and giddines of
ſpirit, which cannot ſtand its owne ground, nor reſt in one
place, cleave to one taske. For the bent of ſpirit to one
ſettled object, ſtudie, calling, or lawfull object, will divert
the vaine minde from frothie fancies, and ideas of uncleane
thoughts, companies, and allurements. A ſpirit whoſe banks
runne full of employment, will hardly be unſettled: but holdes
Satan at ſtaves end. Aske thy gadding, roaving heart, whither
ſhe will, whence ſhee comes, and what is her buſines, (as
watchmen do Roagues) Examine the ground and warrant
of thy journeys, travailes, errands, and wandrings up and
downe, forſaking thy ſtation, and family: Set thy kinfe to thy
throate, if thou bee an Athenian, dayly luſting after new
places, companies, pleaſures, meetings, and delight? And
whatſoever ſavors of carnall and ſenſuall deſire, know it
cannot, but threaten miſcheefe, and diſpoſſeſſe thee of thy
watch: I ſpeake ſtill of ſuch, as in appearance have given
their names to Chirſt, even theſe, (for I judge none, let
every man judge himſelfe) have ſo ſarre taken liberties to
themſelves, in the brink, that they have fallen into the water.
One of them once much pleaſing himſelfe in admiring the
features and beauties of women, and ſtroaking the cheekes
of one with Wantonneſſe, was by his wiſer neighbour war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
therof, ſaying, Theſe crimſon faces (ſo he cald them) will
ſadly coſt you the ſetting on, one day: and ſo it fell out ſoone

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:58230:188"/>
whether true from man, or juſt with God) as brought his
hoary head to the grave with ſorrow. To teach all ſuch gnats
to beware how neere they fly to the candle, leſt they bee
burnt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And thus much for inward abhorrings: As touching out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
I will repeat nothing before ſaid,<note place="margin">All outward temptations.</note> in the chaſtity of
Prevention; onely, whatſoever occaſion, threatens any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
to the fort of Chaſtity, and the preſeving of the whole
man in integrity and honour, renounce it. And ſo much
for the firſt of the foure heads of counſell againſt this
ſinne of uncleanneſſe, to wit, Abhorring of ſomewhat, be
ſpoken.</p>
               <p>The ſecond counſell is,<note place="margin">Second Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</note> to meditate of ſomewhat. And
whereof? Surely of ſuch things as might helpe to quaſh and
quell luſt:<note place="margin">Meditate of ſóme what.</note> and that partly concerning the ſinne it ſelfe, and
partly the penalties thereof. And both theſe ſpecialls of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
muſt be attended with two properties in generall.
Firſt, that this meditation be wiſe, and ſecondly, that it bee
deepe.<note place="margin">2. Properties of it.</note> Firſt I ſay, wiſe: for I would have this noted, that
ſome things are of that nature, that ſome kind of muſing of
them,<note place="margin">1. It muſt be wiſe.</note> is rather an incenſing of the heart unto the ſinne, then
any checking thereof. As are all ſuch evills, as border upon
the ſenſuall appetite, and concupiſcible faculty: of which
ſort eſpecially is this ſinne of uncleanneſſe. Many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
that they muſe much, of the odiouſneſſe therof, that
ſo they might abhorre it. But they finde it more and more
to follow their hand: and to ſnare their ſpirit. And ſo the
remedy proves much worſe then the diſeaſe. And it fares with
ſuch, as it doth with two men at variance: who put their
quarrels to comprimiſe: But when wiſe men ſhould ſet them
at one, they fall on ripping up all circumſtances of unkindnes,
offered each to other, that they part worſe enemies then they
met, and ſo make the wound incurable. So here, men meditate
of the ſenſuall and carnall occurrents of this ſinne, their baſe
meetings, words, geſtures, unchaſte lookes and acts, under
pretence of a purpoſe more fully to deteſt and abhorre them:
But by this meane, the divel caſteth fire into the drie powder
of their concupiſcence; and inflameth them to it the more.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:58230:189"/>
The reaſon is, becauſe the ſenſe and fleſhly familiarity of the
thoughts, doe prevaile againſt the ſpirituall hatred thereof.
So it fares in other temptations, of an hideous nature, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſticall
thoughts againſt the Majeſty of God, or blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
thoughts againſt the Scriptures, or the eſſence, and
Attributes of God: the baſeneſſe whereof the more we plod
upon, (eſpecially while Satans wild fire is in the ſpirit) the
more we are ſnared therewith. Therefore in ſuch caſes as
theſe, the practice of <hi>Eliſha</hi> to the ſervant of <hi>Jehoram,</hi> is to
be followed: Wee muſt pray againſt the tenacity thereof,
and force our ſelves to handle ſuch thoughts roughly at the
doore; and in no ſort to give place to them: as knowing
their Maſters feet is not farre behind them. Toſſe not thoughts
off and on, about paſſages, which tickle the fancy, and wind
in deeplier into it, then it can bee rid thereof, yea though
they were moſt irkeſome to it: But take up the ſinne in the
whole lumpe and bundle: muſe of the bitter roote whence
it comes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> as <hi>David</hi> did, in his Meditations: Incenſe thy ſoule
againſt the body of corruption, whence it flowes, that
wherein thy Mother conceived thee; and thence deſcend
to the fruits of it, as, the wound which it leaves upon the
conſcence, the wrath of God, which it pulls upon it ſelfe;
the curſe of it, how it makes all the ſoile barren, blaſtes
and waſtes the grace of God, or the leaſt ſhew of any:
Keepe it thus at ſtaves end, but tamper not much with
pitch, leſt we be defiled. Such unwiſe meditation is not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to quench, but oile to encreaſe the flame.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Propertie.</note> let this meditation be deepe and ſolemne, both

hath appeared to all, and teacheth them to denie all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,

but yet inſeparable from ſpirituall wickedneſſe: for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
conſcience in point (not of morall light onely, as any
heathen might doe) but of grace, and mercy from God,
teaching him to abhorre it. Yea, this very thing was the
thing that made the Lord ſo ſeverely puniſh it, both then
and after; even becauſe hee fought againſt his ſpirituall
light, embracing a luſt, and the ſweet of a baſe heart, with
the loſſe of that ſweet mercy of God, which he had taſted:
Yea, againſt that ſweet communion with God, which hee
had formerly enjoyed: both which hee knew would bee

doe all they run, as play the uncleane beaſts under the cleere
light of the Goſpel? How do they lay the ſtumbling blocke
of their owne iniquities before themſelves? For although I
deny not a poſſibility of returning, ſo long as the ſpirit is
greeved onely, except it be deſpited alſo, yet who knoweth
how farre he may go in his deſcent, beeing not able to ſtop
himſelfe? And as for the Elect, how many beare themſelves
upon it, till they proove errant hypocrites? This Meditation
therfore, let all ſuch ponder deeply, who are given to ſlight

If it ſhut God out of his Temple, yea, out of Poarch and all:
I conclude, it behooves all, to beware leſt they conceive
that a more ſlight ſin then others, which God hath branded
with more peculiarneſſe then others. I do not here ſpeake
of that loathſomneſſe which followes the act: of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;

I ſpeak not this to exclud any Penitent from the free grace of

the Spirit of Chriſt be gone, what is the Name of Chriſt and

ſo that (ſave for his pleaſing himſelfe ſinfully) he
is never the better for it. For why? Doth not Conſcience
within tell him, All who would thrive by the Ordinances,
muſt caſt up their gorge? So ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> Caſting out all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity,

Miniſter into thy mouth, hearer into thine eares, beeing both

the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks) hinder the lifting up of pure hands,
and muſt not an uncleane conſcience much more? Can ſuch
a ſwine, comming into the Aſſembly to Sermon, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thinke himſelfe to bee in his place? Doth he not tell
himſelfe, a Stewes, an whores boſome are fitter for thee, then
ſuch a place as Gods houſe? Now, if outward Communion
(which yet many a ſinner will buy with his mony, or thruſt
himſelfe into boldly) bee ſo unproper for him, what then is
Communion with the Graces of God, with his Saints,
with the Duties of both Tables? Hath ſuch an one any joy
in his ſoule, peace with God, delight in his Service, exerciſe
of graces, as ſeale, faythe, meeknes, compaſſion, patience?
Or can he lay claime to an holy example? Are not theſe
irkeſome objects to ſuch, more fit to teare them in peices to
thinke themſelves cut off, then to comfort them! So then let
this bee a meditation of great weight, to gaſter the ſoule
from all uncleanneſſe, or to humble it beeing fallen, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what a Gulfe it ſets betweene the Lord, and the ſoule, ſo
that one cannot come at the other. And, woe bee to him,
that is alone! All ordinances, all duties, all graces, ſpeaking

For that laies-all Channels of the ſpirit dry,

they could not there reſt, till they had pitcht a new meeting,

can do it, how much more when luſt is added to it, as a

God ſhot through the livor of all ſuch uncleane ones; to be ſo

they have wrought thy heart to a due abhorring therof: yet,
leſt I might ſeeme to mention this point for nothing, let
me adde one outward Penalty to all the former, and that is,
That even Repentance it ſelfe is not able wholly to waſt off
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:58230:194"/>
the ſtaine of this ſin, from the Committers of it. Such is the
wounde that thoſe men give to the Name of God; his religion
and truth do ſuffer ſo deadly by their meanes, that God in
juſtice ſuffers them to expiate it by an outlaſting infamy.
This was Gods threat to <hi>David,</hi> Thou haſt made the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

ſorrow, as before I noted. He that comitteth folly with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
is deſtitute of underſtanding: his blot ſhall never goe

they are white and fayre in them, they are foule and blacke

to doe it, when as Repentance cannot do it. Who ſhould

ſo is this alway caſt upon him as his ſhame. God doth
not uſually upbrayde his people: But this he alway caſts him
in teeth withall: yet this Caution I adde by the way, It is not
lawfull hereby, to condemne whom God hath juſtified: but
to cover it rather for our parts: But for caution to others,
the Lord will rather make a Record of it, and hang it on
the file, then it ſhalbe forgotten. And when we heare the
uncharitable imputations of men, fret not at them, but ſay,
God is in it, he will keep it on foot: he will checke the ſoule

law hath no mercy for them: their ſinnes exceed it, ſo here.
But the Goſpell affords more grace: refuſeth to pardon no
ſinne, no offence, which the ſoule can be humbled for: I
grant this will not eaſily enter ſo debauch't a ſpirit, to dream
of a poſſibility of ſuch a grace; For, when that conſcience
which was ſo deeply benummed, is once ſtirred to the bottom,
it becomes as ſenſible, as ever it was ſenſeleſſe before; and
while conſcience holds under bondage, its no eaſie thing to
fee ſuch an hope of grace by the Goſpell. But yet, in this
thy amaſement, utter loſſe an deſpaire in thy ſelfe, thou muſt

Beg of the Lord to turne a terrified heart, into a melting one:
that it is, which muſt mould an uncleane ſoule, to a cleane,
and chaſt one: no hammer can doe this: mercy muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
it in the fornace of grace. Lin not, till thou feele that
heart, which hath beene drencht in the ſweetneſſe of luſt,
to bee ſteept in bitterneſſe, over head and eares, for thy
wounding the Lord of life, and his Virgin-pure fleſh, to death,
by thy unclenneſſe. Looke not upon other ſinners: thy

ſoughteſt to deſtroy his Godhead as well as his fleſh, if it had
beene in the power of thy ſinne! though there had been no
other ſinner in the world, thou hadſt beene enough. And
ſhouldſt thou not care (for thy baſe luſt ſake) to kill not a

that the curſe ſhall turne to a bleſſing; yea thou ſhalt ſee

that, which an habituall love of thy ſinne would have
ſmothered for ever. For, this opening and ingenuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
of thy ſinne, will make way for further mercy. Its
none of thy worke, but the ſpirit of grace, that makes way
for it. Now a franke heart is put into thee, to be as open,
as ever thou wert cloſe before, yea and to take as much
paines with thy ſelfe, how thou maiſt give glory to God, in
a full confeſſion, and turning up that curſed poake of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
from the bottome, pouring out all thy ſinne, as ever
thou tookeſt care before to ſweare thine heart to an helliſh
ſecrecy. Its with thee, as with a woman who hath many old
peeces of gold and jewells lying by her, which ſhe is loth to
forgoe, although ſhee might thereby make a ſumme for the
purchaſe of faire houſe and land, yet perhaps rather then
quite forgoe the purchaſe, ſhe will fetch them all, and poure
them downe upon the table. So, when hope of mercy offers
it ſelfe, oh the pearle thereof (exceeding all petty ſhreds)
wil make thee freely disburden thy ſoule of whatſoever loads
it, thy moſt beloved luſts: (I ſpeake not now of abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the habits of them, thats mortification following af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but of the cleere intention and meaning of thy heart
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:58230:196"/>

Gods ordinance may prevaile) thou wouldeſt chuſe that
place rathereſt to ſhame thy ſelfe in, where the ſolemne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God, his Angels and Church are gathered together.
Still I ſpeake with caution, if thy ſinne have broken out
publiquely: but if thou haſt kept it ſecret, thou art not tied to
make thy ſelf publique: nor to take witneſſe, except thy hard
heart require it, to confeſſe to others, for the breaking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
the reaſon is, becauſe the way of Church-correction for
open ſins, is one, and the Evangelicall correction of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Chriſt in private is another. But uſually theſe ſinnes are
open: and therefore openly to be proclaimed in confeſſion,
as in the committing: If mercy have toucht thee at the heart
never ſo little, it will worke in thee, as Gods voice in the
Whale, when ſhe vomited up <hi>Jona,</hi> upon the drie ground.
thou ſhalt no more take care what become of thy luſt, ſo thou
maiſt be rid of it: nor who ſhame thee, ſo thou be ſhamed,
and ſinne have her due! Thou takeſt more care, how
God may be honoured, in the abhorring of thy rebellion:
how others may be flaited from the like; how thine owne
heart may be melted upon melting: not, how thou may maiſt

in this confuſion I had lien for ever, had not mercy caſt an

the Altar, binde it thereto with cords, cut the throate of it,
with the ſacrificing knife of the Prieſt. Thy Prieſt will teach
thee to do that office very handſomely, to let out the ranke
blood of thy luſt, and the ſtrength and ſway which it bare
in thee; yea, it ſhall drag thine uncleane heart to Golgotha,
and naile it to the croſſe of thy Prieſt, with the ſame nailes
which nailed the body of Chriſt. It is happier to find out
thoſe Implements, Croſſe, blood, nayles, tombe, and all, then
ever <hi>Helen</hi> was, or any Popiſh relique-monger: and to
make uſe of them too, to better end then at this daie that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh

Turke, built Temples, Altais, and ſilver floores in honor of the
Paſſion. It ſhall cry in thy ſoule, Oh luſt, I wilbee thy death!
oh Concupiſcence, I wilbe thy deſtruction! The ſting of
fin is death, and the ſtrength of luſt, is the law: But, thanks be
to God in Ieſus Chriſt, who hath condemned ſin in the fleſh, &amp;
mortified it by the fleſh of his holy body! hat neither guilt nor
dominion might prevaile, Purſue the victory, the Lord is with
thee thou valiant man, and in this thy ſtrength, fight and lin

as beeing a revolt from the Grace of God, and the vow of

ſomewhat different from the former; Here then Remember

relapſe) might worke in thee, through unbeleefe added to it,
may gratiouſly bee kept off and ſo, thine heart may be ſtayd

is wholly departed from thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Counſell,</note> remember, that the covenant of God, cannot

tent muſt go as deepe as the ſore is feſtered, and fetch out
the bottome ſcurfe: content not thy ſelfe with ſuch an
humbling, as thy ſlight heart would admit: For this is one
attendant of this ſinne, to be light and wanton, and not to
bee able to bee ſerious. Therefore, ſet thine heart to it,
mocke not God: make not the remedy worſe then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
that thou ſhouldeſt even be fetcht in againe by Satans
clawes, ere thy repentance is finiſhed, which were to
unſettle the work of God in thee, and worke thy heart to
a deſpaire of recovery. It hath beene the portion of many
uncleane ones, never to get a ſerious ſpirit. If therefore
thine heart be once downe, hold it, as if thou ſhouldſt keepe
corke under water, and truſt it not: pray thus, withdraw
from me all objects of vanity, and teach me thy law grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly!
Arraigne, accuſe, condemne thy ſelfe, judge thy ſelfe,
leſt God judge thee: and till God raiſe thee, be content to
lye low, beare the indignation of the Lord, becauſe thou
haſt ſinned: and be glad, if any ſuch veine of wrath may
bee let into thy ſoule, as may truly ſubdue thee under the
mighty hand of God, that he may raiſe thee up. Thinke not
the time long, take leaſure; an heart long defiled, a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell

               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6 Counſell.</note> let faith alway come betweene thy ſinning and
thy repenting: ſoder not up a repentance of thine owne:
its bad in any ſinne, but deadly in this: ſuch ſudden leapings
out of one contrary to another, may admit as eaſie a relapſe
from this to the former. And ſo thou maiſt make thy fall, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a falling ſickneſſe, if the power of pardon and purging
come betweene thy ſin and thy redreſſe, then is the cure from
God, and from Chriſt the ſure Phyſition, whoſe healings are

Let the experience of thy revolt, bind thee to a double care

ſo do thou thine! How rare a ſight were it in theſe daies to
ſee ſuch an one, ſo ſwallowed up with ſorrow, that the
Church had need to comfort him, in all the haſte, for feare of
deſpairing? Oh! mourne for the waſting of the ſpirit of

cut off, moane thy condition in the eares of God, and beſeech
him to ſet thee ſo in joint againe, that thine heart may bee

reſtored to the Communion of Saints: be as an excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate

will be huddled up in the Court of heaven, without open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and more then ordinary humiliation. Moſt mens
plaiſters are too narrow for their ſores. But if wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

never ſo famous, as their repentings have beene eminent.

breadth of thine offence. Its to keepe downe thine heart,

(making open profeſſion of it) to live with their Harlots and

expelling them, and harbouring the other in their boſomes,
with deſpite. Do not through bribes, and flattery, or an ill

of the juſt plagues which ſhee is liable unto, for hatching
ſuch vipers in her Boſome. Bee vicegerents of God! will
you not judge them? Yes judge theſe ſinners, I ſay not ſtone
them (for its beyond your power, and the long impunity of
this ſin, hath hardned the hearts of men in their Impudence,)
but ſend them to the Carte, to the houſe of Correction, to the

I cannot omit, as having before grounded it in the text.
Marriage is Honorable, and the bed undefiled, and God
