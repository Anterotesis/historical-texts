            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that a clear display of actions

will hardly finde <hi>credit:</hi>
So long hath <hi>scandal</hi> had the

that the continual reiterating
of them, hath grounded in
them (as it were) a serious
opinion of their truth, whilest

who never knew how to wear

            <p>His wonderfull acts,
both in time of Peace

of humane Glory and
Greatnesse)</hi> by an obscure
Villain in one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
streets of his chief
City of <hi>Paris,</hi> stabbed to
death in his Coach, in
the midst of those tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for his Queen, the
Illustrious <hi>Maria di Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,</hi>
who then newly
had her brows begirt
with the Royal Diadem
of <hi>France,</hi> and when he
had lyen in readiness a
Potent Army in perfect


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56752:10"/>
Equipage, and composed
of stout and able old
souldiers, which made his
Neighbours round about
to tremble (none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on whom the effects
of so potent a Force
would fall) his intended
design continuing a riddle
to this day.</p>
            <p>He was at his first
coming to the Crown
very much enclined to
the <hi>Protestant</hi> Profession,
in which he had for the
most part been nurtured;
but the necessity of his
affairs, and the strength
of the <hi>Papists</hi> enforced
him to make a publique


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56752:10"/>
Confession of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholique Religion, and
condescend to them in
Ecclesiastical affairs; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
which he
was soon after by a young
Jesuite (who after the
fact, confessed he did it
because he thought him
not yet well setled and
grounded in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Faith, but too much
wavering towards the
<hi>Hugonots)</hi> stabbed in the
mouth with a knife:
Which made one of his
Confidents prophetically
to tell him: <hi>Sir, You may
see how just and punctual
GOD ALMIGHTY is


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56752:11"/>
in his Judgements: For I
hope you have denyed the
Religion you were first nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
in, but from the teeth
outwards, so he hath struck
you there, but take heed
your heart go not from it,
for he will strike you there
the next time:</hi> Which
proved exactly true.</p>
            <p>The Villain which
murthered him could by
no extremity of Torments
be induced to confess any
other then himself abettor
of his Crime, which he
did (as he said) out of
an inward motion he
had, that King <hi>Henry</hi> was
not yet fully confirmed in


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56752:11"/>
the <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
whereof he gathered
out of the great benefits
and Liberties still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</p>
            <p>'Twas but a very short
time before his violent
death,<note place="margin">The Queen born.</note> that his youngest
Daughter and last Childe
the Princesse <hi>Henrietta
Maria</hi> was born: So that
she had neither the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be an eye-witness of
those extraordinary Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
wherewith her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was endowed, nor
the means to imitate
them, otherwise then as
by an everlasting fame


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56752:12"/>
they were left to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Yet falling under the
care of the Illustrious <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
di Medices</hi> her Mother,
(a Princess of most rare
endowments, to whom
likewise the Charge of
Government was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
till the succeeding
King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
should come to
age) she was educated
suitable to her birth and
greatness, and those Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
cherished in her,
which seemed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
as appearing almost
in her very Cradle.</p>
            <p>Nor was she less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56752:12"/>
in that other
adorner of Women, <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
which though it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shone
not her Vertues,
yet it made them shine
with the greater lustre,
whilest they likewise
seemed to set it forth, and
blazon it like a cleer and
unclouded Sun.</p>
            <p>She was about the age
of Fifteen years when
Prince <hi>Charles</hi> first taking
that Adventurous,<note place="margin">Prince <hi>Charls</hi> his Voyage to <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> and
therefore Renowned Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

and the Royal <hi>Infanta,</hi>
in his passage through

               <hi>Paris,</hi> he <hi>incognito</hi> beheld
this Paragon of Vertue
and Beauty, and though
he were then going about
a business which must
necessarily obstruct his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
towards her,
yet he seemed very much
to like her, nor was she
in her affections lesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
to him, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to have said after
she had heard about what
business he was gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Spain, That he need not
have gone so far for a Wife.</hi>
So that it seemed that this
Match was concluded on
in Heaven, which no
worldly endeavours could
obstruct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56752:13"/>

indeed some resolutions

him) either to perswade
her to withdraw her self

This being the first example

For I look upon this now

                        <p>All justice then, as well

                        <p>This comfort I shall enjoy

of Noble extraction, and
took his Orders at <hi>Rome,</hi>
where Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth
then sitting in the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

earnestness upon his phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomy
told him, <hi>That

He was by the Queen
Mother first preferred to
be Bishop of <hi>Larone,</hi> and
then to the Kings Counsel,
whom she afterwards
commended to the Pope,
who sent him the Cap,
and after the famous siege
and forcing of <hi>Rochell,</hi> by
his policy and industry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the prime Minister
of State in the Kingdome
of <hi>France,</hi> and the King
growing up to age, insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
so much into his
favour, that he postponed
filial duty and brotherly
affection to his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, so his Policy


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56752:57"/>
taught him to be ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the highest degree
to those breasts which had
first cherished and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him.</p>
            <p>His minde was esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by most to be of the
same colour with his habit,
wholly sanguine, and
much of the temper of
that <hi>Spanish</hi> Cardinal, who
affirmed, <hi>That Gunpowder
in the field gave as sweet a
perfume as Incense at the
Altar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was observed to be
of an irreconcileable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where he once hated

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56752:57"/>
none from whom he
either had or judged he
might receive an injury.
The <hi>Marshal</hi> of <hi>Marillacks,</hi>
and many other prime
Peers of <hi>France,</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of his revenge.</p>
            <p>Yet his Counsels have
been by many great Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians
esteemed of high
conducement to the affairs
of <hi>France;</hi> for by them the
<hi>Hugonots</hi> were suppressed,
who were looked upon as
one of the greatest Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses

scourge he was to the

Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> whom
he chased out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to seek another habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>He was looked upon as
the greatest Incendiary and
Fomenter of the <hi>Scottish</hi>
and <hi>English</hi> Rebellions and
Disturbances. A man he
was of an infinite contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and sedulous spirit, as
<hi>solid</hi> as <hi>subtile,</hi> a thing rare
under the <hi>Gallick</hi> Clime,
insomuch that many have

A mighty Change there
was expected to follow in

their Husbands, her magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
spirit had certainly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their example.</p>
            <p>But since her Religion
(though it could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
her sorrow for her
murdered King and Husband)
restrained her from following
him in death,<note place="margin">The Qu. goes into a Monastery at <hi>Challons.</hi>
               </note> she is resolved to
spend the rest of her time in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and therefore retired her
self to the Monastery of <hi>Challons,</hi>
where she ceased not daily to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both his and her own hard
Fortune, his in coming to so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
an end by the treachery of
his Subjects, and her own in sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
him. Till at length over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by the importunities of the
King and Qu. Mother of <hi>France,</hi>


               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:56752:71"/>
she came to keep Court (though
with the most obscurity that
could be) in <hi>Pallace Royal,</hi> a Pallace
built by Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
yet never interposing in any
matters of Estate, except what
might be for the Promoting of the
interest of her Son King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second, who not only lost his
Father, but was deprived of his
Kingdoms by his Fathers Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
till it pleased God of late
to restore him, which sure does
in a great measure comfort this
disconsolate Princesse, though
Worlds cannot repair the loss of
such a Husband.</p>
            <p>A Prince he was of an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
piety, and so rare a pattern
of Conjugal love, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56752:72"/>
the Princess <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
the day before his death, to tell
her mother, <hi>That his thoughts had
never strayed from her, and that his
love had been the same to the last.</hi>
Nor were her Vertues less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendant,
which should I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to Characterize, I should
wrong what King <hi>Charles</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath done. I therefore only
conclude with this Wish: May
<hi>England</hi> ever be happy in such
Princes, but may never Princes
of <hi>England</hi> be so unhappy in
their Governments, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and Rebellion of some men
made Them to be.</p>
