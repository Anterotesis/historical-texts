         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AS the many Civilities receiv'd from You, moſt juſtly Challenge an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, ſo Your exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Perfections in Learning and Ingenuity, render this Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation duly applyed; by the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:53409:3"/>
former whereof, to own Your Candor and Generoſity, by the latter to beſpeak (by the Touch-Stone of Your peruſal and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation) a ſufficient Security from the Snarlings and Inſults of thoſe Carping <hi>Zoylus's,</hi> who are ſuch Self-Admirers, to approve of nothing of which themſelves are not Authors; and are more diſingeniouſly Witty in Criticiſing, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canting on others performances, than in rectifying and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they pretend ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective. And here, SIR, I am not ignorant, that while I am barely owning your Favours instead of a Compenſation, I am running farther on the Score,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:53409:3"/>
which I doubt not however, but your Goodneſs will readily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſince 'tis not practicable for one to pay, where another is not willing to receive.</p>
            <p>There is one things, SIR, I have omitted in the following Diſcourſe (as not being practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed till it was finiſhed,) <hi>i. e.</hi> To obſerve how great a Miſchief we are falling into, by giving conſiderable Sums of Money for the prompt payment of Bank and other Notes, of which the Rates grow ſo high, as 'tis to be feared will in a ſhort time ruine our Paper Credit, which uſed to be very conſiderable in the way of Trade, and which muſt needs be abated if not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:53409:4"/>
ruined thereby, unleſs the Government by ſome means or other put a ſpeeedy ſtop thereto; for Men are grown to that paſs, that few will pay their just Debts (tho' of Money lent, and they have conſiderable Sums by them,) unleſs you'l take a Note, which they have made by this ill Practice, at leaſt <hi>10 per Cent.</hi> leſs than Money: So that tho' we had our Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Running Caſh, we ſhall find, that if this practice be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, we ſhall never have Notes in better Credit, nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money paid in much more plenty than now it is, as I could eaſily prove by ſundry inſtances, were it not matter more proper
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:53409:4"/>
for another place, than this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle: Which before I. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I ſhall only further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That I look upon the great Miſtake of ſuch as are for having the nominal value of our Coin raiſed, the Alloy therein more, or the ſame Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lighter, to be owing chiefly to this miſguided Suppoſition; That we in this Iſland live in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependantly without having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to do with Foreign Countries, which did we do the making any thing currant by Stamp, that has little or no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue in it ſelf, would I coefeſs, be ſufficient to make it ſerve to moſt Ends and Purpoſes of Inland Trade and Bargains: But if
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:53409:5"/>
we conſider our ſelves, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Foreign Dealings and Traffique, we ſhall find we are ſo much the more at a loſs, by how much the Extrinſick value of our Coin exceeds the Real or Intrinſick.</p>
            <p>But leſt I ſhould by prolixity miſuſe the liberty of this Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and retain your Thoughts too long from the Entertainment of Subjects more Noble, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly Refined, I ſubſcribe my ſelf with all Sincerity,</p>

            <head>Decus &amp; Tutamen, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>SUCH is the Folly, as well as the Ambition and Envy of the preſent Age, that nothing can be propounded as advantagious to the Publick, that meets not with Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the great hindrance not only of the Riches and Proſperity of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo to the unſpeakable Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and Diſcouragement of its true Policy.</p>
            <p>And upon ſuch irregular Principles, no doubt but Sir <hi>Richard</hi> and the Doctor undertook, to write againſt Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Book concerning Coin; A Book which for its excellent Preſcriptions of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Remarks and Political Maxims on that Subject, cannot be ſufficiently va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, but by thoſe of equal judicious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, and clear Notions with himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53409:6"/>
But before I proceed, that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Remarkers may not think, this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe undertaken out of any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice conceived againſt them, I do ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely profeſs, I know neither of the two; but that this is publiſhed out of pure Zeal for Truth, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt any Party whatever.</p>
            <p>Firſt then in general, I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that Sir <hi>Richard Temple</hi> ſhould be the Author of ſuch miſtaken Notions concerning Coin and Trade, as he has publiſh't in his ſaid Remarks, in which I ſee not any thing of weight or reaſon in all his ſeven Objections; nor does he make out any thing he Aſſigns, to be an Erroneous Aſſertion of Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we muſt believe meerly becauſe he ſays it, whoſe Authority muſt be lookt upon unqueſtionable, becauſe of his Quality.</p>
            <p>But tho' theſe Gentlemen have taken the Pains to impoſe their Sentiments on the World, yet I hope they'l have no better reception than they had in the Honourable Houſe of Commons; for how much ſoever the leaving open the price of Guineas, and advancing the value of Coin, might have been to Sir
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53409:6"/>
               <hi>Richard,</hi> and to Dr. <hi>Barbon</hi> as to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Bank, (by which means the Sum ſubſcribed would have been ¼ more) yet ſure I am, we ſhould thereby have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had miſerable Convulſions in Trade, if not a total Ruine, before the next Seſſion of Parliament. And here I remember what the Doctor ſays in anſwer to this, in his Epiſtle: That he could have got more by melting down the New Coin of the preſent Standard, than he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to do by a New Coinage of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Crown Piece to Six Shillings and 3 pence. But this he ſhould talk to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or ſuch Projectors as himſelf; for I would fain know, Whether is ſafer and more for advantage, to gain 15 pence in a Crown Legally, or to gain but 1 penny, (for Bullion is but at 5 <hi>s.</hi> 1 <hi>d.</hi> per Ounce,) in a Crown, and incur there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Penalty of the Law againſt ſuch melting down.</p>
            <p>But I'll leave the Doctor a while, and return to Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> who in his firſt Remark ſays; <q>Firſt, That an Ounce of Silver is equal to an Ounce of Silver of the ſame Weight and Fineneſs, but that an Ounce of Silver will buy an Ounce of Silver, of like fineneſs (he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53409:7"/>
ſays) is abſur'd, ſince there is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for any Barter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Remark conſiſts of Two Parts: The firſt he grants, the ſecond he denies; and I think the firſt, which is that he grants, is more abſur'd, or at leaſt has more inpropriety in it than the latter; for two Ounces of Silver of the ſame Fineneſs, he needs not queſtion are of the ſame weight; for an Ounce Troy is always equal to an Ounce Troy; ſo that he had better have left [of the ſame Weight] out.</p>
            <p>Then as to his Second Part, I dare Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all the world, Whether it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd to Barter Silver for Silver; I am ſure, its a thing done every day, and no doubt but Sir <hi>R.</hi> has done it himſelf, unleſs he always paid for his Plate with Farthings and Halfpence, which few Goldſmiths would take, unleſs the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity bought were inconſiderable; ſo that its juſt as abſur'd to ſay, that an Ounce of Silver will buy an Ounce of Silver of the ſame Fineneſs, as it is to ſay, an Ounce of Sterling Plate is ſold for a Sterling Crown Piece; and that's no Abſurdity at all, for the Plate bought is an Ounce of Silver, and the Crown
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53409:7"/>
that paid for it is near 1 ℥ of ſterling Silver of the ſame Fineneſs, which Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is very proper and practicable; and therefore his Reaſon [ſince there is no occaſion for any Barter] is vain and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, ſince nothing is more true, than that Silver Coin and Old Plate are daily Bartered for New Plate.</p>
            <p>
               <label>His Second Remark, is,</label>
               <q>That the intrinſick Value of Silver is the true Inſtrument or Meaſure of Commerce, (he ſays) is partly true and partly falſe; for the Money of every Country is the Meaſure of Commerce there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer, That tho' the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of a Country is the Inſtrument of Commerce, yet the intrinſick value of Silver is nevertheleſs the true Meaſure thereof, by being the meaſure of that Money; for by how much the more there is of Silver in any Money, by ſo much the more it is valuable; and by how much the more is is valuable, by ſo much the more of any Commodity it will purchaſe: And in all Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Selling, and Bartering, tho' the Perſons concerned were guided as to the Worth of the thing, Bought, Sold, or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53409:8"/>
Bartered, by the Coin of the place where ſuch Bargains are tranſacted. Yet all or the greateſt part of the Coin in all Countries, being either Silver or Gold, whoſe value is computed by that Silver. To ſay, That becauſe Coin is the Inſtrument of Commerce, that Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not ſo, (as the Doctor does poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and Sir <hi>R.</hi> in part affirm) is to ſay, That the Coin of all Trading Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is no Silver, which is falſe, and the Remark very weak.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor ſays, pag. 24. <q>That if Men made their Bargains only for the Quantity of Silver, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is there any Copper Money Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which reckoning one Country with another, is ⅓ part of the Money in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, That Copper Money is in all places, except <hi>Sweedland,</hi> deſigned only for conveniency in paying ſmall Sums, which cannot ſo well be paid in Silver, becauſe the quantity thereof being very ſmall, wou'd be (and is as we ſee in our Silver ½ pence, pence, two pences, &amp;c.) in danger of being loſt. And as to there being ⅓ of the Coin in <hi>Europe</hi> made only of Copper, I dare affirm, and appeal to all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53409:8"/>
and Travellers in <hi>England,</hi> that not one hundredth part of the Coin in all the Traffiquing Nations in the world, except <hi>Sweedland,</hi> is any thing but Gold or Silver; And I am farther confirmed in this Opinion, not only becauſe I have ſome knowledge of the ſeveral Coins, but from this computation of it in our own Nations Coin.</p>
            <p>The moſt ingenious Calculator Sir <hi>William Petty</hi> has told us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That 50000 <hi>l.</hi> in Farthings and Half pence, is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of Copper Money for <hi>England:</hi> But I am of opinion, that we have not ſo many now, becauſe we want.

And therefore as to what the Doctor ſays, page 15. 'That there are more Bargains made with Copper Money than either with Gold or Silver, and would make good this Aſſertion by an inſtance of half penny Loaves being bought and ſold, (which by the way is a ridiculous one.) I ſay, it is egregiouſly falſe, to inſtance in ſome uſeful things for the Body and Mind, (as the Doctor has it, page 2.) In a Whole-ſale Trade, where the Commodities bought and ſold are not cutt or divided into leſſer parts than they were brought in. Daily Experience tells us, there is no ſuch thing as paying in Copper Money, for it is a ſmall Whole-ſale Parcel that is not worth 6 <hi>d.</hi> and all or moſt Parcels above (not to ſay ſome below) that price, are paid for in Silver; and tho' the Copper Money has the King's ſtamp on it, which the Doctor lays ſuch ſtreſs on, pag. 13. 'yet ſo prudent and wiſe were our Law-makers, that no one can be forced to take this Money for Rent or Debt, becauſe it has not a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Value, nor was intended to be receiv'd or pay'd in large Sums in the way of Trade, by reaſon of its being
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53409:9"/>
far leſs portable than Silver; 3 far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things weighing 14 grains more, and taking up as much room as half a Crown in Silver, and conſequently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Grains 100 <hi>l.</hi> in Copper, as much as 4000 <hi>l.</hi> in Silver; and at this rate, how troubleſom would it be for a Man to be obliged to receive Copper Money for Packs of Sheeps Wool, or Sacks of Cotton, Bales of Silk, Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads of Sugar, Wine, Brandy, &amp;c. nay, if this mony were paid for the greateſt part of Bargains, as the Doctor ſays it is, it would coſt leſs money to carry moſt ſorts of Goods to a Fair or Mart, than the Money thoſe Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities were ſold for home again; but to come nearer the Doctors half penny Loaves, how few are there that pay for either Victuals, Apparel or Lodging in this ſort of Money? For does any Man pay for a Years Board, or ſo much as a Joint of Meat at the Market in farthings? Does any man pay for a Hatt, Coat, &amp;c. or ſo much as Gloves or Thread Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in Farthings? Does any one pay their Houſe-rent, or ſo much as for a half Peck Loaf in Copper Money? Nay, to come to the Doctors own inſtance, of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53409:10"/>
the vaſt number of Half penny and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny loaves that are bought, I dare Engage ¾ thereof are paid for in Silver Coin; for the Baker I'le warrant, never buys a Buſhel of Wheat, and pays for't in Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things or Copper Money, nor the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualler (in whoſe Houſe moſt of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Half Penny Loaves are ſpent,) pays for a dozen or two (than which he has ſeldom leſs) in Copper Money, no nor even the Perſon who buys theſe of the Victualler for his own Eating, comes to his Houſe only to eat; for 'tis a hundred to one, but this Gueſt and his Friend, (for few drink alone) if he calls for a Role or two, but he has ſome Cheeſe or Butter, and two Tankards of Ale, which makes 6 <hi>d.</hi> in all which Trade, there is no Copper Money uſed; and I think all theſe Caſes may and do happen every day. And as for Books, there's ſcarce a bound one in any Volume bought under 6 <hi>d.</hi> And where one pounds worth is bought with Copper Money, 1000 <hi>l</hi>'s. worth are bought with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. All which is ſufficient to ſhew, that it is with Silver Money and not Copper (as the Doctor ſays,) that our Inland
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53409:10"/>
Trade is managed, and conſequently that Silver is the Meaſure thereof.</p>
            <p>And after the ſame manner is the Traffique of other Nations, their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney being for the moſt part made of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, contrary to what the Doctor ſays, page 14. <hi>viz.</hi>

               <q>That the Merchants both in their Bills of Exchange, and in their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts do as often reckon by the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Money as the Silver Money.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This I utterly deny, and will prove it a Miſtake in the Doctor, by ſhewing what Money other Nations keep their Accompts in. And in what Money they exchange with <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That all Trading Nations that have Commerce with <hi>England,</hi> do keep their Accompts in, and buy and ſell with and for Silver Money, for the moſt part will appear as follows:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Netherlands, viz.</hi> at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, Rottordam,</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts are kept in pounds, ſhill. and pence, <hi>Flemiſh,</hi> or in <hi>Guilders</hi> and <hi>Stiver;</hi> there is likewiſe current the <hi>Holland Dollar, Duccatoon,</hi> and other pieces, all of Silver, ſome 9, ſome 10, and ſome 11 ounces fine.</p>

            <p n="3">3. In <hi>Spain</hi> Accounts are kept in ſome places, <hi>viz.

But the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is made with <hi>London</hi> upon the <hi>Mill-Ree,</hi> which is <hi>Par</hi> with 6 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> Sterling; All theſe Denominations of money, except the <hi>Rees</hi> are Silver, ſome 10 ounces 7 pw. and ſome of 11 ounces fine.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In <hi>Germany</hi> the Coins of ſilver are too tedious to mention here; the moſt

uſual of which in Traſſique, are the <hi>Rix Dollar</hi> above 11 ounces fine, <hi>Creutzers</hi> of 10 ounces, 10 pw. fine of Silver; and at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> Accounts are kept in pounds, ſhill. and pence, in which they likewiſe exchange with <hi>London</hi> 32 ſhill. being <hi>Par</hi> there, with one one pound Sterling.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In <hi>Italy,</hi> as at <hi>Leghorn</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> Accounts are kept in pounds, ſhill. and pence <hi>De Ovo,</hi> the <hi>Teſtoons</hi> of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> of 11 ounces, 5 pw. fine, alſo <hi>Ducats, Tary,</hi> and many other ſilver Coins, too tedious to relate here; but we exchange with <hi>Venice</hi> and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereabout, upon the <hi>Ducat de Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> which is <hi>Par</hi> with 52 pence Sterling, and with <hi>Legorn</hi> upon the Crown <hi>de Ovo,</hi> which is <hi>Par</hi> with 67½ <hi>d.</hi> Sterling.</p>
            <p n="7">7.

            </p>
            <p n="8">8. The Money of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is <hi>Pounds, Marks, Nobles,</hi> and ſmall Pieces, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of 11 ℥. 2 pw. (or Sterling) fine. And in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53409:12"/>
ſhort, all other Trading Countrys, except <hi>Sweedland,</hi> have their Commerce car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on chiefly by ſilver Coin, as the <hi>Rupee</hi> and ½ <hi>Rupee</hi> of <hi>Eaſt India,</hi> all ſine, the piece of Eight, <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> fine as aboveſaid; The 8 <hi>s.

And in <hi>Sweeden,</hi> beſides their Copper Dollars, they have the <hi>Sweeds</hi> Dollar of the ſame fineneſs, with the <hi>Rix Dollar</hi> of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and half its value; tho' I confeſs, a great part of their Trade is carryed on with the Copper Money; but the like is not done (as appears by the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account) in any other Nation, and no doubt but the <hi>Sweeds</hi> would glad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be rid of it for Silver, were it not the Product and Manufacture of their own, and that they are very poor: for as the Learned and Ingenuous <hi>Malynes</hi> ſays on the ſame Subject, <hi>Neceſſitas non habet Legem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I think, I have ſufficiently proved from matter of Fact, That more Bargains are made with Silver than Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Money, ſince there is abundantly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53409:12"/>
more of the former than of the latter, and conſequently that Silver is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Commerce: And I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe proved, That Merchants do not either in their Accounts or Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, reckon any thing near ſo much in Copper Money as in Silver. For whereas the Doctor ſays, pag. 13. As in <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Merchant often draws his Bills of Exchange, to be paid in <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi> of 400 <hi>Rees;</hi> and ſays he, And ſo in <hi>Spain,</hi> he draws his Bill to be paid in <hi>Rials</hi> of 372 <hi>Malvadies.</hi> He is in this very much out, as well as in his Copper Money bargains; for our Exchange to <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> is in <hi>Milrees</hi> of 6 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> Sterling per <hi>Millree,</hi> &amp; to 7 <hi>s.</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Circa</hi> &amp; to <hi>Cadiz.</hi> The <hi>Par</hi> is 54. <hi>d.</hi> ſterling for one piece of Eight; and the courſe (now) 60 <hi>d.</hi> and upward; to which two places are the principal Exchange of that Country with <hi>London</hi> made; and what they do among themſelves, is nothing to us.</p>
            <p>And therefore it does not appear, that the Doctor has any more Experience in theſe matters than Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> (nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) notwithſtanding his great Profeſſion, in condemning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. <hi>Locks</hi> definition of the <hi>Par</hi> of Exchange,

               </gap>ll incert as follows, and leave it to thoſe that have long known the Practick part, whether of the two is the moſt true and genuine.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Mr. <hi>Lock's</hi> Definition of the <hi>Par.</hi>
               </label>
The <hi>Par</hi> of Exchange (pag. 18. of his Conſiderations) is a certain number of Pieces of the Coin of one Country, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in them an equal quantity of Silver to that in another number of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Coin of another Country.</p>
            <p>
               <label>The Doctor's Definition.</label>
The <hi>Par</hi> of Money is made by compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the valuation that the ſeveral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments ſet on their Coins, which is not from the equal quantity of ſilver in each piece of Money.</p>
            <p>Now I take the Doctors Notion of the <hi>Par</hi> of Exchange, to be very falſe, and what was never thought of being the <hi>Par</hi> by any but himſelf; for to ſay that the value of Money (for I take the <hi>Par</hi> to be value,) is made by computing the valuation that the ſeveral Governments ſet on their Coin, is not only falſe and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53409:13"/>
nonſenſical Contradiction; but alſo (if he means, that one Nation muſt take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers Money for what they pleaſe to call it,) pernicious to Trade, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the very foundation of all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and a thing never practiſed. For inſtance, Suppoſe in the Year 89, I had paid 100 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> that my Factor or Correſpondent might receive the value at <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the Perſon on whom the Bill was drawn, pays my Factor 800 Copper Half Crowns, which were equal to my 800 ſilver ones which I paid here, according to the Doctors <hi>Par</hi> of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation the Government had put on them, (tho' in truth, they were not above 800 Half Pence, or 33 <hi>s.</hi> 4. <hi>d.</hi> of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney the value was paid in <hi>England.)</hi> Now ſuppoſe the Government had changed after my Correſpondent had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd theſe Copper Pieces, and before he had put them off again; and that this new Government had put a ſtop to the Currency of the Copper Money, and made Half a Crown currant for Half a Penny (as was reaſonable enough) I ſhould here have loſt 98 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> by the Bargain; and ſuch loſs is every Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant liable to, that regards not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53409:14"/>
the Mony his Correſpondent is to receive Beyond-Sea, be ſomething near the <hi>Par</hi> of the Money paid by himſelf here, by having ſo many more pieces al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in Exchange, by how much thoſe pieces are deficient in weight and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe paid firſt: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I would fain know, to what end all the Mints of <hi>Europe</hi> keep ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Accompts of the fineneſs of their Coins, for they might know without that, what value (by denomination) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Governments put upon their Coin. Or to what end was there ſuch care taken by <hi>Edw.</hi> III. and other Kings of <hi>England,</hi> to fix Tables of the <hi>Par</hi> of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change in publick places, ſetting forth the true weight and fineneſs of Foreign Coins, to prevent our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants being impoſed on in their Exchanges?</p>
            <p>And the truth is, the matter is not ſo difficult as the Doctor would make it, by his ſingular way of expreſſing it: For the very word implies the meaning, <hi>Par pro pari, i. e.</hi> value for value, not as the Government puts upon it (with reſpect to Foreign Exchange,) but as it is in weight and fineneſs.</p>
            <p>For as Silver is the meaſure of all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53409:14"/>
kind of Commodities, ſo is it of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change too; for as in Commutation or Barter of Goods, the ſeveral ſorts muſt firſt be valued by the ſtanding mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Silver before it can be known how much of one muſt be given for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind: So is it in Exchanges, where the true value of each Coin being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Silver, it is eaſily known how many pieces of one Coin muſt be given for ſo many of another.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, I offer this as a Proof, that the quantity of Silver in Exchange, is conſidered, and not the nominal value the Government gives to Money; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for theſe two years paſt, ſince our Money has been ſo very much clipt and debaſed, and our Guinea's ſo high, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes have run very low againſt us; the <hi>Dutch</hi> (and other places proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable) allowing us but 26 <hi>s.</hi> and 27 <hi>s. Flem.</hi> for a pound Sterling; whereas within theſe 4 or 5 years, they allowed 35 <hi>s.</hi> per pound Sterling; and ſince our Coin has been amending, and Guinea's lowered, the <hi>Dutch</hi> allow 29 and 30 <hi>s.</hi> for 20 <hi>s.</hi> Sterling.</p>
            <p>

               <label>Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Third Remark, is,</label>
               <q>Bullion is a Commodity, and has no certain univerſal ſtated price or value.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>And ſays the Doctor in the firſt of his contrary Propoſitions:</label>
               <q>That there is no intrinſick value in Silver, or any fixt or certain Eſtimate that common Conſent has plac't on it, but that it is a Commodity, and riſeth and falleth as other Commodities do.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs I have this advantage in anſwering this: That no body is of the Doctors mind, and therefore a little may ſerve to ſay againſt him in this caſe, for 'tis a hard matter to introduce a new Opinion at beſt; but more eſpecially when that Opinion is contrary to all men's Reaſon.</p>
            <p>That there is a natural or intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Goodneſs in Silver above all other Metals (except Gold) ſuch as ſolidneſs, &amp; not porous, cleanneſs &amp; not apt to ruſt, fineneſs and beautiful to the Eye, I think no body can gainſay.</p>
            <p>And that upon and for the ſake of theſe natural Perfections and Qualities, Silver has obtain'd an Univerſal Eſteem and Value above all other Mettals (except
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53409:15"/>
Gold) in all the moſt civiliz'd Nations and earlieſt of times, is as undoubted a Truth.</p>
            <p>For as to its univerſal value, it is much the ſame at the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> in <hi>Turkey</hi> and <hi>Eaſtland,</hi> in <hi>Ruſſia, Poland,</hi> and all over the Commercial World, as it is here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the early eſteem it had in the world, we find it the common Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Commerce in Sacred Hiſtory, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 488 years after the Flood which was in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time; and no doubt but it was ſo long before: And tho' Silver is a Commodity becauſe it is bought and ſold, yet I deny that it riſes and falls ſo as other Commodities do, nor is there any Commodity that keeps ſuch a certainty as to price, as Silver does; it being in no part of the World worth leſs than 5 <hi>s.</hi> an ounce, and in few places worth much more; and the reaſon of this will appear, by comparing it with other Commodities, moſt of which are the Product of more Countries than one or two, and the ſame ſort of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities are made better and worſe, which with many other Circumſtances, as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, Plenty, Scarcity, &amp;c. much alters
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53409:16"/>
the price of Commodities that are for Wear, (as the moſt ſtaple ones are.)</p>
            <p>But Silver coming chiefly from the Mines of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> and not ſubject to any of the aboveſaid Cauſes of riſing and falling, the price thereof is much at one; ſo that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick value of Silver, may properly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be ſaid to be 5 <hi>s.</hi> per ounce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will fetch ſo much in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> if not of the World, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the fitteſt meaſure of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and this is no more than Sir <hi>Richard</hi> grants at the latter end of his third Remark. Tho' the Doctor is much more poſitive in denying the whole, to make good the credit of his Copper Money Extrinſick value, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Fourth Remark.</label>
               <q>That advancing the denomination, or leſſening the weight and fineneſs of Coin, will be no loſs to the Landed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in their Rents, &amp;c. And that ſuch a change can have no ſuch effect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>And ſays the Doctor in the Tenth of his contrary Propoſitions.</label>
               <q>That if the Money be raiſed ⅕, the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53409:16"/>
Landlord will not loſe any part of his Rent, or the Creditor any part of his Debt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The truth of theſe Aſſertions depend on this:</p>
            <p>That raiſing the value of Coin by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, will not inhance the price of any Commodity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore firſt prove, That the raiſing the denomination of the Coin, and making the 5 <hi>s.</hi> piece to paſs for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sum more, will analogically (at leaſt) advance the price of all things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Shew how the Landlords and other Perſons, having Annuities or Stypends, will become loſers by ſuch advance of Coin and Commodities.</p>
            <p>We have ſufficient matter of Fact, to prove, That the raiſing the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Coin, does alſo advance every Commodity proportionable; for that which was worth but 20 pence, in <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the firſt's time, is now worth 5 <hi>s.</hi> and that all Commodities did riſe near ⅓ from <hi>July,</hi> 94. (when Guinea's began to riſe) to the time they were at 30 <hi>s.</hi> is alſo matter of Fact; and that ſince Guinea's have been ſetled at 22 <hi>s.</hi> all Commodities have fallen is alſo true,

Wool and Woolen Cloth (the chief of our Commodities,) is a Proof thereof, and is that I chooſe for inſtance; the firſt being fallen 8 <hi>s.</hi> per Tod, the ſecond 4 or 5 <hi>s.</hi> per Yard. Which advance of Commodities according to the advance of Coin, made the wiſe and good Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Declaration, <hi>Anno</hi> 1559. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the amending the Coin, debaſed by <hi>H.</hi> VIII. expreſs theſe words: <hi>[Alſo by continuance of this ſort of baſe Moneys, altho' Almighty God hath given now of late Years, plentiful increaſe by the Earth, yet the Prices of all things growing or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the Earth, hath daily riſen, as Grain, Fruit, Cattel, Victuals, Wool, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſuch-like, and no remedy could be deviſed to amend the ſame, but to cauſe that the ſame baſe Monies ſhould be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for no more than they were in juſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.]</hi> And the reaſon of the Riſe or Fall of Commodities as Money does, is plain, becauſe Money is that which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures every thing; and therefore if Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney riſe, Commodities muſt riſe; if it falls, they muſt fall. And the chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this, is our being ſo deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Commerce with Foreigners, who will never take our Money for what
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53409:17"/>
we are pleas'd to call it, but what it is really worth with them, and will be taken from them for, in other places. Thus, if an Ironmonger buyeth of a <hi>Dutch-man</hi> Chimney-backs, to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of 825 pounds <hi>Flemiſh,</hi> he might have paid for them before the advance or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing of our Coin (the Exchange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leaſt 33 <hi>s. Flem.</hi> per pound Sterl.) with 500 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling; but our pound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advanced to 24 <hi>s.</hi> the <hi>Dutch-man</hi> lowers his Exchange proportionable (as they always do; Witneſs the extream low Exchange juſt before the Regulation of our Coin, and the advance of it ſince,) which is to 27 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d Flem.</hi> for 1 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling; at which Rate 600 <hi>l.</hi> will but pay the pounds <hi>Flem.</hi> 825. So that here is evidently ⅕ loſt to the <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> who muſt fetch it up by ſelling his Goods ⅕ dearer than formerly. Or if he Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for Goods of our own Product or Manufacture, as ſuppoſe Iron in the Bar, the ſeller of this Iron will advance it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to what the Chimney Backs are advanced, which ⅕. And thus 'tis plain, the raiſing our Coin advances For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Exchange; that raiſeth Foreign Commodities, and Foreign Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53409:18"/>
riſing, does many ways advance the Product of our own Country; for if Chimney Backs, Sword Blades, &amp;c. coming from <hi>Holland,</hi> ſhould by raiſing our Coin grow dear, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> would generally content themſelves with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Blades, and Grates, and Chimneys of our own make, which would much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the price. And tho' I have only inſtanced in one or two Commodities from <hi>Holland,</hi> yet the ſame conſequence would happen by the raiſing our Coin to all other Goods or Merchandize, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that Country, but all others with whom we have any Commerce. And thus I have proved, That raiſing our Coin would neceſſarily advance the price of all things, and ſhall therefore proceed to ſhew:</p>
            <p n="2">2. That by this advance of Coin and Commodities, all ſuch as have made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts before this advance, muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be loſers, till ſuch time as they can advance the Terms of their Contracts proportionable to the advance of things. Thus,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Landlords whoſe Eſtates are let out by Leaſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Perſons having certain yearly Stipends or Sallaries.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53409:18"/>
3. All Creditors whoſe Debts were contracted before the advance of our Coin, and not paid till afterwards; muſt all unavoidably be at a loſs by the advance of Coin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to Landlords, whoſe Eſtates are lett out by Leaſe for 7, 11, 21, 31 or 40 years, (the uſual terms Leaſes are grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for,) will be ſo much the greater lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, by how much the longer the Leaſes they have granted are: becauſe here is an advance of Coin that has advanced the price of things, and ſtill the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord has but the ſame Rent. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if I have 500 <hi>l.</hi> per <hi>Ann.</hi> let out by Leaſe for 40 years, to be paid in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money; after this, the Coin of the Nation is advanced ⅕, and other things proportionable, yet I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived but 500 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> of this New Money; ſo that if I expended yearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the advance of Coin 300 <hi>l.</hi> and laid up 200 <hi>l.</hi> now the Coin is advanced, that which coſt me 300 <hi>l.</hi> will coſt me 360 <hi>l.</hi> ſo that I can lay by me but 140 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> The intereſt of which at 6 <hi>l. per Cent,</hi> is but 8 <hi>l.</hi> 8 <hi>s.</hi> Whereas it is plain, the intereſt of my 200 <hi>l.</hi> which I laid up before the advance of Coin, is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53409:19"/>
12 <hi>l.</hi> So that here is evidently a loſs of 3 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> in 12 <hi>l.</hi> which is above ¼ loſs to the Money'd Man.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, That this Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord or Money'd Man, muſt be ſuppos'd to have Money by him when this change of Coin happens, which will be ⅕ more, as if he had 1500 <hi>l.</hi> of the Old Money, it would be 1800 <hi>l.</hi> of the New, which is 300 <hi>l.</hi> gain to him.</p>
            <p>To this it may be anſwered, That this Gain will be more than loſt in a ſhort time after, when much Money by the dearneſs of things is drawn out of the Landed or Monyed Man's, into the Trades-man's hands. And the Money of the Nation being thus encreaſed ⅕, does naturally encreaſe the number of Uſerers and Purchaſers, and the number of Uſerers and Purchaſers encreaſeth the value of Land, and lowers the Rate of Intereſt. So, if with this Money he would purchaſe, Land is advanced; or if he would lend it on Uſury, Intereſt is lowered; ſo that he muſt neceſſarily Ioſe by this means notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Landlord, whoſe Eſtate is lett out by Leaſe, muſt loſe until his Leaſes are expir'd, and he can advance
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53409:19"/>
his Rents proportionable to the price of all other things: So likewiſe it will go with ſuch as have Employments, whoſe Sallaries are certain, and cannot be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennly (if ever) advanced in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Victuals, Cloaths, &amp;c. on which they live, ſo that they muſt alſo be great loſers by this advance of things, which is occaſioned by the riſe of our Coin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All Creditors whoſe Debts were contracted before the riſe of Coin, and not paid till afterward, muſt loſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Debt was contracted before the riſe of things, and according to the value of Money then; but now Money is raiſed and Commodities likewiſe, this (when paid the Creditor in the New Money) will not purchaſe ſo much by ⅕ as if it had been paid him before this Revolution of Coin; beſides, had the Debt been in the Creditors hands before the alteration of Coin, it would of it ſelf encreaſed ⅕, which he alſo loſeth.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Day-Labourers. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Landed-men having Tenants at Will, need not loſe by this Alteration of Coin, becauſe they may advance the Prices of their work, and Income pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53409:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the advance of Money and Commodities, which loſs muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fall,</p>
            <p n="1">1. On ſuch as have occaſion to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy theſe Labourers, as Builders, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On theſe Tenants at Will, who muſt advance the Rent of the Houſes or Lands they hold; ſo that I think nothing can be made more apparent, than that advancing the currant value of Money, will be a loſs not only to Landed-men, but to moſt others.</p>
            <p>What is material in Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Fifth Remark, is already Anſwered: I ſhall therefore ſay no more to it, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <label>Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Sixth Remark.</label>
               <q>To keep up an old Standard under an old Denomination below the value of Bullion, is the greateſt Folly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and for which we have paid dear; for it firſt carryed away all our Gold and Broad Money, and laſtly all our Mill'd Money,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <label>And the Doctor ſays in the Eighth of his contrary Propoſitions,</label>
               <q>That it is the Practice of all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in <hi>Europe,</hi> to raiſe their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as the price of Silver riſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:53409:20"/>
To Sir <hi>R.</hi> I anſwer, That nothing can be greater Folly than to alter the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of our Coin, as the price of any Commodity is altered; for Money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meaſure of Commerce (as both Sir <hi>R.</hi> and the Doctor ſay it is,) to alter Money, is to alter the Meaſure of all things; and that I am ſure, unleſs there is abſolute neceſſity, is both Folly and Injuſtice, and is as tho' the Buyer of Timber or Deal Boards, ſhould have his two Foot Rule made longer in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to what the ſeller advanceth the price of his Wood.</p>
            <p>'Tis great Folly to advance the value of our Coin in proportion to Bullion, or any other Commodity, becauſe it will never anſwer the end for which it is raiſed. I have ſufficiently proved, That raiſing the Coin will inhance the price of all Commodities; and therefore to advance the value of Money, to bring it to the ſame price with Bullion, inſtead of that, it would advance the value of Bullion, that being a Commodity as well as other things, and is indeed beginning at the wrong end, as if we ſhould bring the Cart to the Horſes; Not that I can ſee that Bullion before the Regulation of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53409:21"/>
our Coin was advanced (properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to 6 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> per ounce, as ſome fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; altho' it was frequently ſold for that price, yet if we conſider that that 6 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> of Clipt Mony, was <hi>bona fide,</hi> worth but 5 <hi>s.</hi> of our true Mill'd Coin; it then follows, That Bullion was not advanced ſo much as other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but was all along at the old price of 5 <hi>s.</hi> per ounce, if you would pay for it with Money of full weight and fineneſs. And to confirm this truth, I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with ſeveral Eminent Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, who have great dealing in Plate, and they tell me, That what I have here aſſerted is true; and I am ſure, it is reaſonable. For (as the ingenious Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> obſerves) it is impoſſible there ſhould ever be 15 <hi>d.</hi> difference between an ounce of Sterling Silver coined and an ounce uncoined, tho' there may be 2 <hi>d.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> or 4 <hi>d.</hi> per ounce difference, becauſe Bullion may be exported and coined Silver may not. And becauſe a Crown Piece wants 2 <hi>d.</hi> of being 1 ℥. of Silver.</p>
            <p>And as the ill Policy of coining our Money lighter, or making it go for ¼ or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> more than it is worth in other Nations,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53409:21"/>
would appear; ſo would it be great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, becauſe it would injure ſeveral ſorts of people. The King for Example, muſt loſe ⅕ of what he takes over to bear his Expences in <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſo muſt the Officers and every private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, which would fall eſpecially very heavy on the latter: who out of their 3 <hi>s.</hi> a week Allowance, muſt but have ½ a Crowns worth (at moſt) of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Victuals, Drink, &amp;c. and ſo would it likewiſe be a manifeſt Injury to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned in Foreign Affairs, as I have ſufficiently proved before; ſo that inſtead of being the greateſt Folly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to keep our Coin to the old Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard for Weight and Fineneſs, I think if rightly conſider'd, it will appear to be the moſt prudent and advantagious thing the Government can do, to keep it where it is; and that more eſpecially, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering we are ſo deeply engag'd in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Concerns: And as to out Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Affairs, many (I have ſhewed) will be loſers by this advance of Coin, but none can be gainers; the truth is, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Trader's (purely living upon that) will loſe the leaſt, tho' they'l gain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for what they will gain by the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53409:22"/>
advance of their Stock and Caſh juſt upon the Revolution thereof, they will in ſhort time loſe, by paying dearer for Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturing their Goods, and all Neceſſaries.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, tho' we can gain nothing but loſs by advance of Coin, yet we ſhall be great Gainers by continuing the preſent Standard, becauſe Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will take out Money (upon occaſion) at the ſame price we take it at, and it will keep all Commodities both Foreign and Inland, at a reaſonable price. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Honour and Eſteem the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would juſtly gain thereby in the eyes of Foreigners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, as the ingenious Sir <hi>William Betty</hi> ſays of raiſing the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Coin, That it's like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding to pay a Debt, and is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſign of a Bankrupt, and poor Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo on the other hand, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Coin to its Primitive Weight and Purity, is an Indication of its Wealth and Riches.</p>
            <p>As to the continuing our Coin on the preſent foot, being the cauſe of carrying away all our Broad and Mill'd Money.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That of the three parts, <hi>viz.</hi> what is Exported, Hoarded, and Melted down, I really believe the part carryed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53409:22"/>
away to be the leaſt, and the part Hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greateſt. And this will appear by conſidering, in whoſe Hands the greateſt part of this Caſh lyeth: It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deny'd, but that the Nobility, Gentry, and Inland Traders together, are Richer, and have more Money than either the Merchants actually Trading beyond the Sea, on the Manufacturers of Plate, called Goldſmiths; and therefore 'tis moſt certain, the greateſt part of our Milled and Broad Money, is hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the Nobility and Gentry have no other uſe to make of the ſurplus of their Expences, unleſs to purchaſe with, or put out to Intereſt, or into the Bankers Hands; and ſo long as the major part of the Caſh currant is Clipt, they'l di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of that theſe ways, and keep the Mill'd and Broad Money in their own Hands; ſo that I may ſafely affirm, that in ſome meaſure to my own knowledge, beſides what Reaſon ſuggeſts, That there is not a Gentleman in <hi>England,</hi> that lives not up to the heighth of his Eſtate, but who has conſiderable Sums of Milled, and Broad Money by him; and tho' the Bankers and Goldſmiths are reputed to have melted down much, yet they are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53409:23"/>
not all ſo ill principl'd, to act againſt the Laws, Conſtitution and Intereſt of the Nation; for I know a Banker who upon this Revolution of Coin, had by him to anſwer Payments in Old Mill'd Money, to the value of 10000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis but reaſonable to conclude, That the Bankers have much more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in their Hands than the Merchants; for they have generally the poſſeſſion of the Merchants Money. And if a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant has a great Sum to receive, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his Goldſmith to do it, who has therefore the priviledge of picking and culling out the Mill'd or Broad, to hoard or melt down, and ſatisfieth the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant with ordinary Clipt Money; ſo that it's plain almoſt to a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the greateſt part of our Mill'd and Broad Money is hoarded, the next to that is melted down, and the leaſt part of all is exported.</p>
            <p>And as to what the Doctor ſays, That it is the practice of all the Governments in <hi>Europe,</hi> to raiſe their Money as the price of Silver riſes: And at the latter end of his Book, pretends to give ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Examples of it, and what was the conſequence thereof. I do not ſee that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53409:23"/>
thing he ſays makes for him, but rather againſt the Raiſing of our Coin, whoſe Circumſtances do by no means run pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with theirs. For pag. 61, 62, and 63. he tells us, The <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>French</hi> did uſe to raiſe their Coin; but what is that to us; they were lead by their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to be engag'd in long and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wars; the former, with moſt part of the World; the latter, with moſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> And therefore, let the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be never ſo fatal to their Foreign Commerce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (of which the <hi>Romans</hi> had little, and the <hi>French</hi> of late have as little or leſs,) yet they muſt have Money to ſupply their preſent Exigencies, which they could not poſſibly acquire any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, but by multiplying their Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Coin. But for us to follow their Example, ſince we can eaſily raiſe our Money without that beggarly way of Compounding; and ſince we have ſo vaſt a Foreign Trade, which is the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Glory of our Nation, and which muſt be much abated, if not ruined by ſuch advance of Coin, as I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved above: I ſay, theſe and many other miſerable conſequences un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably attending, for us to follow
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53409:24"/>
their Example, would be the worſt piece of Policy imaginable: For indeed, the conſequence of this advance of Coin was no more than (as the Doctor confeſſes, pag. 62 and 63,) they themſelves grew weary of; for (ſays he) it created a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance. And pag. 82. they called in ſuch Money as had been greatly raiſed, and reduced the value of it to its uſual Bounds; which I think they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done, had they not found this raiſing of their Coin very prejudicial to them; for People are not willing to let go what they find by Experience will be their intereſt to retain. And pag. 84. the Doctor confeſſes, that the Nation was never at Peace in their Commerce and Traffique, till the value of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was reduced within their Bounds. So that the Doctors Example of raiſing Coin, is neither a Reaſon why we ſhould do the like, nor any Encouragement, but quite contrary; from the ill Effects, he tells us, The raiſing their Coin had as I have ſhewed above; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe miſerable Effects, the Doctor wiſhes heartily, pag. 71. That we had a Power to raiſe our Coin 40 or 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Which Power no doubt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53409:24"/>
but we have, ſo that he needs not wiſh forit; but bleſſed be God, they that have this Power, have more Reaſon and Ingenuity, than to make uſe of it in a caſe that would be of ſo miſerable and deſtructive conſequence.</p>
            <p>The truth is, could the Doctor prove, That Bullion were 6 <hi>s.</hi> or upward per ounce in Foreign parts, with whom we have great Commerce, and that this price were ſo conſtant and ordinary, that there were no hopes of its Fall, then it would be time to advance the price of Bullion likewiſe in <hi>England,</hi> otherwiſe we ſhould have none Imported, but what we have would be Exported; and if we ſhould by that means, be forc'd to advance the price of Bullion from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>s.</hi> 1 <hi>d.</hi> per ounce (which it is at now,) to Six Shillings, we muſt neceſſarily advance the price of coined Silver as well as Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, otherwiſe the price of Bullion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much above that of Coined Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, we could neither make up the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference by Impoſition, as I have hinted afterwards; nor could we poſſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Melting Down and Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, the Encouragement being ſo great; but ſince that high price of Silver cannot
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53409:25"/>
for a conſtancy happen in Foreign parts, ſince the diſcovery of thoſe rich Mines in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and ſince the price of Bullion is now much the ſame with us as in other Trading Countrys; and ſince the value of Bullion and Coined Silver is at this time much the ſame here, there not being a penny per ounce difference, I ſee not the leaſt Reaſon why we ſhould advance the value of our Money.</p>
            <p>As to what the Doctor ſays, pag. 80. That Trade makes people Rich, and Gold and Silver are the Badges of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and therefore, as the People grow Rich, Gold &amp; Silver muſt riſe. I Anſwer, That his Premiſes do by no means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch Conſequences; for by this he would ſuppoſe, that we have only a certain quantity of Gold and Silver here in <hi>Europe,</hi> which can no ways encreaſe but by the advance of the Specie, not conſidering that many Years ſome Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of pounds are brought over into <hi>Europe</hi> from the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> which greatly encreaſes our Stock, keeps the price pretty certain, and prevents us ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any occaſion for the Doctors multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying our Caſh by inhancing its nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal value.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:53409:25"/>
Sir <hi>Richard</hi> under his laſt Remark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has chiefly this, worth Anſwering, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That the Fall of Guinea's was not only unneceſſary, but highly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is eaſily proved a miſtake, by proving that the lowering of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced extreamly much to our advantage, eſpecially in our Foreign Trade. For if in the greatneſs of our Foreign Trade conſiſts the Riches and Glory of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as all hands do agree it chiefly does, and if the highneſs of Guinea's ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd our Merchants that they could not poſſibly carry on their Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce without great Difficulty and Loſs, and if all this put the Merchants upon petitioning the Parliament for bringing Guinea's lower, which was done at their Requeſt; then I think it's plain, that the lowering them was not diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to us, but abſolutely, neceſſary for the carrying on of Foreign Commerce, and maintaining the Riches and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of this Nation: For the high price of Guinea's firſt advanced the courſe of Exchange againſt us, and all Foreign Commodities; and ſecondly,

the price of Inland Goods, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more plain, than that low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering of them has brought down; and I could give inſtances almoſt in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities that have fallen ſince Guinea's were brought Low: So that the Gain thereby extends to all that have occaſion either for Apparel or Victuals, whereas the loſs by lowering them chiefly fell on ſuch as had great Sums in their hands, and who probably got as much or more by the Riſe of Guineas as they loſt by their Fall.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt Raiſing our Coin, of which tho' I might have ſaid much more, if my Buſineſs other ways would have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet I think the foregoing Lines are ſufficient to prove, That the Raiſing our Coin will infallibly bring great loſs to the whole Body of this Nation, by raiſing Foreign Goods, and the courſe of Exchange, and likewiſe all Inland Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: Whereas the Loſs to us by continuing the Coin at the preſent Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, is meerly accidental, and can only prove ſo by our Coins being either mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted down, counterfeited or hoarded; all which, it would be no leſs ſubject to,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53409:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were it Coined lighter, or the value rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as they would have it, ſhould the price of Bullion riſe proportionably to what we advance our Coin, which 'tis more than probable it would. And therefore, ſince our Coin (tho' it were advanced) would ſtill be lyable to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Miſchiefs; the way to prevent and ſalve them, will not be to Coin our Money lighter or baſer, or raiſe its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, but it will be to endeavour by all means poſſible to prevent theſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, in order whereunto I have made the following Eſſay.</p>
            <p>Since many have taken upon them to preſcribe Rules for the prevention of theſe great Prejudices to the Nation, of Hoarding, Melting down, &amp;c. I ſhall take the liberty to throw in my Mite, for the preſervation of the Publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For the truth is, tho' the curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſuch Money as is of full weight and fineneſs, would conduce much to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitating all Receipts and Payments, and tend extreamly to the Honour and Advantage of the Nation in ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. Yet if we cannot find means to prevent the great miſchiefs of Hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53409:27"/>
Melting down, Exporting, &amp;c. it is to be fear'd, we ſhall have a greater diminution of our Coin by theſe irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ill Practices, than we can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly make up by our Mint: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humbly propoſe,</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>Firſt, To prevent hoarding our Coin.</head>
               <p>This is certainly the leaſt blameable of any of the ill Practices, becauſe the Money remains in Specie in the Nation, which on emergent occaſions would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be brought to light, as we ſee great Sums are of Broad Money at this time; it is therefore the exceſſive Hoarding that is miſchievous to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when Men have ſuch a love to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, either for its Beauty, or intrinſick Worth, that rather than part with it, they will let their juſt Debts remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid after due, in hopes, or upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation that a Sum will ſhortly come into their hands that is leſs valuable, tho' in the mean time perhaps the Labourer, and other Artificers, who have but juſt from hand to mouth want Bread for themſelves and Families.</p>
               <p>This is the caſe of ſuch Nations as have two ſorts of Coin currant, a better and a worſe of the ſame denomination,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53409:27"/>
and this has long been our own caſe. We have had the Crown, ½ Crown, Shilling and Six Pence, New and Old, Unclipt and Clipt; and the conſequence of that has been, that our Mill'd and Broad Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney has been Hoarded, and the Clipt only currant.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if ever we would prevent the exceſſive Hoarding of our Coin, we muſt have it coined all of full Weight, by calling all our Money in that admits but of ſuſpition of being Clipt, and when that is new Coined, and all our Coin is Milled, or Broad unclipt, we ſhall find not a penny Hoarded that will any ways be a detriment to the Nation: And for any Gentleman, &amp;c. to hoard ſo much Money as is over and above what will defray all their Expences and pay their Debts, can never hurt us.</p>
               <p>But then, this calling in our Old Coin will beſt be done gradually, as the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Parliament hath begun, to their exceeding great Commendation. And in my poor opinion, if the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſpace of ſix Months (by which time we ſhall have a Million and a half of New Money, beſides the great quantity of Old Mill'd Coin and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea's,)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53409:28"/>
ſhould call in all our preſent clipt Money, it would I preſume, effectually prevent exceſſive Hoarding, and we ſhould have much more plenty of Money currant, and eaſe in telling it, than we have now; which we can never expect, ſo long as any of theſe Clipt Sixpences, &amp;c. are permitted to go, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>That the Officers concerned in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and diſpoſing of this Bullion, ſhall be ſworn to deal juſtly and fairly, and likewiſe give good Security for the ſame.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The occaſion of carrying away our Coin, is taken to be,</p>

               <p n="4">4. To maintain Gentlemen in their Travels abroad, till they can receive Money in Exchange.</p>
               <p>The firſt and third of theſe are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the moſt material, the other two more inconſiderable; the ſecond being only while the War laſteth, and may wholly, or for the moſt part, be avoided by our agreeing with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to take
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53409:30"/>
ſo much of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commodities, as ſhall be equivalent to the Expence of our Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to be paid out of the Exchequer for ſuch Commodities; and the fourth, which is very inconſiderable, may be ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the ſame method the firſt and third are.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, The paying the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of our Trade. The Reader is to know, That if <hi>England</hi> Export not as many Goods as it imports from all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the World, (reckoning the prime coſt of the Foreign Goods imported, and Charges, and the ſelling price of thoſe Exported, with Charges) it muſt be in debt; and in this caſe, the Ballance of Trade is ſaid to run againſt us.</p>
               <p>That this Ballance of Trade, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to run againſt us, runs us ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into debt; and if the courſe of Trade does not alter, that we pay this debt or Ballance with Commodities, we muſt pay it with Gold or Silver; for we cannot pay it with Bills of Exchange, becauſe that implies a Debt both ways; as if I owe a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant 100 <hi>l.</hi> and another <hi>Dutch Man</hi> oweth me 100 <hi>l.</hi> I can draw a Bill on the <hi>Dutch Man</hi> that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53409:30"/>
oweth me 100 <hi>l.</hi> to pay it to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant, to whom I am indebted. But if I have no 100 <hi>l.</hi> owing me in <hi>Holland,</hi> nor any other place to which they Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, then I muſt pay this 100 <hi>l.</hi> in Specie, becauſe I cannot draw a Bill.</p>
               <p>This is the common notion of the Ballance of Trade, and of carrying our Money over to pay it; but I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that unleſs the ſeveral Countries we trade with, kept an account of the Trade in the Groſs Bulk thereof, by all the Merchants comparing Accompts of their Imports and Exports, I cannot ſee how this Ballance ſhould upon any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain grounds be known. So that tho' we may pay dear for the Ballance of Trade running againſt us, by its being and cauſe of Exchange running againſt us, which is cauſed by our having occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to pay more Sums in Foreign Parts, than they have to pay here, yet the Sums carryed over to Ballance Trade withal, are very inconſiderable if any at all.</p>
               <p>The chief occaſion then of carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our Coin, is to buy Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities with (not to pay Debts,) in places where we have no Exchange, as chiefly in the <hi>Eaſt Indies:</hi> And this is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53409:31"/>
done, either becauſe the Goods we carry thither are more bulky in proportion to their price; ſo that the value of the Ships Cargoe outward, will not lade her home in Goods, whoſe value lye in a little room, unleſs Silver be taken to make it up; for in ſuch long Voyages, the Merchant is very unwilling to come home without a full Cargo; or elſe it is done becauſe the Merchant can go out (ſuppoſing the Goods of like value Bulk for Bulk,) without a full Cargo, and make up what is wanting by taking Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion or Coin privately, which ſaves a great deal both in Cuſtom outward, and in Freight.</p>
               <p>But however, let the deſign of taking away our Coin be what it will, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on all hands, that much of it is taken from us, and eſpecially to carry to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> which is one great reaſon why I believe that Trade does us more damage than it does us good. And tho' I am a great Admirer of every thing the Ingenious and Accompliſhed Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Sir <hi>Joſiah Child</hi> ſays, in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning Trade, yet I muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this of the great advantage that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, by the <hi>Eaſt</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:53409:31"/>
                  <hi>India</hi> Trade; and my chief reaſon for not fully conforming to his opinion in this matter, is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Trade to the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> robs us of our Coin, without which 'tis impoſſible the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould ſubſiſt, as we have too great proof of at this time, when no man can get 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of Bankers, tho' his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities are never ſo preſſing: And <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Becauſe the Commodities we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from <hi>India,</hi> are fully manufactured, as Silks, Muſlins, and Callico's, whereby our own Artificers have no Advantage, as they have by the <hi>Turky, Hamburgh,</hi> and moſt other Trades. But this being partly a Digreſſion from my Subject, I ſhall return to ſhew, That this Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Coin will be prevented, by the aforeſaid reducing the value of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion below that of our Coin. For,</p>
               <p>As when our Coin is Richer than Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, <hi>i. e.</hi> a 5 ſhill. piece is worth as much Bullion as 5 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> or upward, and then our Coin is more likely to be carryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way than Bullion; ſo on the other hand, when Bullion is reduced as aforeſaid to 5 <hi>s</hi> per ounce, it will be Richer than our Coin (as I have ſhewed before,) and conſequently be more advantagious to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53409:32"/>
carry away than Coin. But becauſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the price of Silver is thus ſetled as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, it may ſometimes happen, that Bullion may not be eaſily got to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and that rather than go without, the Traders to the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away our Coin. Therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> I humbly propoſe, That before any Ship be permitted to Sail that is bound to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> the Governour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitty-men of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company (if the Ship is on their Account) ſhall make Affidavit, as ſhall alſo the Maſter of ſuch Ship, with his Mates and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur. That none of the currant Coin of <hi>England,</hi> or Bullion made thereof in all or in part, is laden or deſigned to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on Board ſuch Ship, or otherwiſe to be conveyed to the ſaid <hi>Indies,</hi> by any means directly or indirectly, to their or any of their knowledge or privity, other than permitted by Act of Parliament. And if the Ship is an Interloper, ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Oath may be taken by the Owners, Supercargo, Captain, &amp;c. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And if any one ſhall diſcover any Sum ſo to be carryed away of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coin, one Moiety ſhall be the Kings, the other the Informers. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And if it can be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53409:32"/>
proved, That any of the Company or Owners were privy to the taking away ſuch Sums of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coin, then the whole Ships Cargo ſhall be forfeited; and if the Captain be proved privy to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (unleſs he makes ſuch Diſcovery,) he ſhall be utterly uncapable of Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Captain, any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and his whole Eſtate confiſcated.</p>
               <p>But there is a <hi>Fifth</hi> occaſion of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away our Coin, and which, next to the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Trade, robs us of the moſt; and that is, what is taken from us by the <hi>Sweeds, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who when they bring us of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, do not take enough of ours to Ballance the Trade with them, but take very conſiderable Sums of our Coin, to our great Detriment, and which I think deſerves to be prevented, either by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Act of Navigation, that we have none of their Commodities, but what our Merchants fetch from them, or by laying ſevere Penalties on all ſuch as buy their Pitch, Hemp, Tarr, &amp;c. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they pay with Goods of our own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture.</p>
               <p>Theſe or ſuch-like Penalties and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements will certainly prove effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53409:33"/>
to prevent our Coin from being Exported, or carryed out of <hi>England;</hi> the preſervation of which is of the greateſt conſequence to us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves certainly ſome ſpeedy methods to be taken in order thereto; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all our Coining at the Mint is in vain.</p>

               <p>Now, that which I would infer from theſe Analogies of Silver to other Mettals, is to ſhew, how we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute when a piece of Money is too light by Counterfeiting, and when too light by wear. As in this Table of Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a falſe Crown Piece made of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and only waſhed over, (if it does
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53409:34"/>
not much exceed a true Crown in Bulk) it will want 2 pw. 13 grs. the difference between 16 pw. 19 grs. and 19 pw. 8 grs. which it is impoſſible it ſhould be worn lighter in 700 Years. And to prove this, I have weigh'd ſome of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d's Crown Pieces, and find of thoſe coined 27 Years ago, to be worn about two Grains; now if I ſtrike off the two Years laſt paſt, wherein this Coin could not wear much, becauſe Hoarded; then the Proportion will be, That a Crown Piece will wear 29 grains in 25 years. By which it may be eaſily gathered, what any other Piece will wear in any other number of years, which cannot be worth taking notice of in any piece un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 50 or 100 years; in which laſt time a Crown Piece will want but a penny of full weight, if the lightneſs proceed only from the wear.</p>
               <p>To inſtance in other Pieces, Suppoſe I would know what a Shilling ſhould wear that has been coined 120 years: By this Proportion it will appear, it will but wear 1 26/29 Grains, which is not quite two Grains. For</p>

So that it can never countervail the trouble of Rogues and Villains, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit any Pieces of Coin, but it will be eaſily diſcovered by weight, making a ſufficient Allowance both for wear and difference in weight of the ſame pieces, occaſioned by the negligence of the Weigher at the Mint. A Crown Piece, if they ſhould take but 6 <hi>d.</hi> in Silver out, and put the like quantity of Copper therein, this would make 7 Grains dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the weight, between that Crown Piece and a true one, which a true Crown would not wear in leſs than 87 years. And if this extraordinary Alloy were Braſs, or any other Metals, the want of weight would be much greater.</p>
               <p>And, if every Banker and Caſhier were obliged to keep in their Publick Shops or Offices, a good pair of Scales and Weights for Silver, to be for the common uſe of thoſe with whom they deal, it would be very eaſie to diſcover this Cheat, either in ſingle Pieces or in great Sums together, allowing however a ſmall matter for wear. And for the Aſſiſtance of thoſe concerned, I have here inſerted a Table what any Sum of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53409:35"/>
our New Coin ſhould weigh preciſely, from 6 <hi>d.</hi> to 100 <hi>l.</hi> and may ſerve for much greater Sums; which Table is calculated at the rate of the 5 <hi>s.</hi> piece weighing 19 pw. 8151, 612, 903, 225 grains, or 19 pw. 8 grains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſomething more than ½ a grain.</p>

All which Rogueries ſome ill diſpoſed people are forward to ſay, The Parliament might have prevented: <hi>Firſt,</hi> By giving longer time for bringing the Clipt Money into the Exchequer: And <hi>Secondly,</hi> By not lowering the price of Guinea's; not conſidering at the ſame time, That we had little or no Silver Coin currant from about laſt <hi>Midſummer</hi> till after <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> laſt, the Guinea's all that time being a ſufficient Running Caſh, which they would have been, till we had a ſufficient quantity of our New Silver Coin, had we not had ſome mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Men among us. And as for the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering of Guinea's 3 <hi>s.</hi> too low, which ſay they, is the occaſion of their being carryed to <hi>Holland, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe they go there for 23 <hi>s.</hi> 24 <hi>s.</hi> and 25 <hi>s.</hi> each. I ſay in Anſwer, that it was but reaſonable to conclude, that as the high price of Guinea's in <hi>England,</hi> was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Riſe in theſe three places; ſo the lowering of our own Coin ſhould have cauſed theſe Nations to do the like, which it has done in part: And no doubt, but ſo long as we can have Gold as now, at near 4 <hi>l.</hi> per ℥. if the Parliament ſhould think fit to permit the Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of more Guinea's, we might afford to let the <hi>Dutch</hi> or others take them from us at 23 <hi>s.</hi> till

               <p>But, if every body were on my mind, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs theſe Bankers could make it appear by their Books, and their own Oaths, that they cannot make their Payments, I would quickly make them tir'd with the Trade of Cheating; for if a Man has receiv d a Sum of Money of another, for which he has given his Note to repay at demand, I think 't is but reaſonable, that if this Demand is made, and the Money is not paid, the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould have the Improvement of that Money from the time ſuch Demand is made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I doubt not but a Court of Equity wou'd give it, and which if duly proſecuted, would ſoon make theſe Sparks weary of their Trade of Cheating, in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what they can the Current Money <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
