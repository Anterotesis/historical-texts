            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Here is the
whole institution of
the Lords Supper.
Now let us compare
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15486:11"/>
Christs Supper with
your Popish and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Masse, and see
how well Christs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and yours agree
together. If ye be the
Ministers of Christ,
and not of Antichtist,
the servants of God,
and not of the Divell,
then will you follow
your Master Christ,
which saith,<note place="margin">Iohn 13.</note> 
               <hi>I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you an example,</hi> that
as I have done, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
yee should doe.
Let us now then goe
in hand with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>First, we reade, that
Christ before hee fed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15486:12"/>
his Disciples, with the
mysticall food of his
body and bloud, made
a Sermon unto them,<note place="margin">Christ prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before his Supper.</note>
wherewith, as with a
certaine most whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
preparative, hee
made meet the minds
of his Disciples, unto
so worthy a banket,
giving all faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
an example,
that whensoever they
with the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doe come together
to celebrate the Lords
Supper, there should
be some Sermon or
exhortation made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the people, that
they might the better
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15486:12"/>
examine themselves,
and the more deepely
consider the thing
that they goe about.
And according to the
example of Christ, not
only the Apostle, but
all the holy Fathers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of the Primitive
church used the trade,
and so did it continue
in the Church of
Christ, till Antichrist,
the Bishop of Rome,
had driven Christ out
of place, and set up
himselfe as God: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
till hee had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
the Supper of
the Lord, and set up
his owne peevish, yea
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15486:13"/>
theevish Idolatrous
Masse, as wee may see
in the monuments of
the ancient Writers.
They continued, saith
blessed <hi>Luke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
doctrine and
fellowshippe, and in
breaking of bread, and
in prayers. And Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> As often as
ye shall eat this bread,
and drinke of the cup,
shew, set forth, declare
and preach the Lords
death till he come. A
practise hereof have
we in the Acts of the
Apostles,<note place="margin">Acts 20.</note> where wee
reade; That upon one
of the Sabbath dayes,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15486:13"/>
when the Disciples,
came together for to
breake bread (so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
S. <hi>Luke</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christs body
and blood) blessed
<hi>Paul</hi> preached unto
them, and continued
the preaching unto
midnight. And the
Sermon ended, they
brake bread, ate, than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
God and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.<note place="margin">Note.</note>
For if the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so comfortable,
yet if they bee not
known what they are,
to what use they were
instituted, what joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Here is Baptism &amp; the
preaching of the word
joyned together. And
as concerning the
blessed Sacrament of
Christs body and
blood did not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ preach at
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15486:15"/>
the institution and
ministration of it? Are
we not also comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
that whensoever
wee come to receive
the blessed Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
the death of the
Lord should be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
declared, and set
forth?<note place="margin">Ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacraments without preaching, profiteth little.</note> Did not the
Apostles of Christ,
and all the godly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of the primitive
Church, observe the
same order? They
considered right well
how little the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
availeth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the preaching of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15486:15"/>
the Word: For as S.
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, how shall
they believe without
a Preacher? Faith
commeth by hearing,
and hearing commeth
by the Word of God.
None therefore of
the Lords Sacraments
ought publickely to
be administred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preaching of the
word; yea, &amp; that not
in a strange tongue,<note place="margin">In Ioan tract. 80.</note>
but in such a speech
as the people under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
or else it were
as good to speake the
words unto a s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt of

them that are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15486:16"/>
together at the
ministration of any
Sacrament. And this
meant Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi>
when hee said, Take
away the Word, and
what is Water but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
But let the word
bee added to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
&amp; it is made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
Whence hath
the water such a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that it should touch
body, and wash the
heart? but by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of working of the
word, not because it
is spoken, but because
it is beleeved. The
word signifyeth here
not only the speaking
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15486:16"/>
of <hi>Ego baptizote, &amp;c.</hi> or
<hi>Hoc est corpus meum,
&amp;c.</hi> pronounced by
the Priest in a strange
tongue, but the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word of
God uttered by the
mouth of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in such a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
as the people
understand, or else
how shall they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve?
It is not the
utterance of Gods
word in an unknowne
speech that bringeth
faith, but when it is
so spoken, that it is
understood of them
that heare it, and that
faith through the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15486:17"/>
of the holy
Ghost ensueth, which
otherwise is cold, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
idle, and worketh
nothing in the heart
of the hearer: for as
S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, Take
away the Word, and
what is Water but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
that is to say, take
away the preaching of
Gods word from the
Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Baptism,
which declareth what
Baptisme is, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
it, to what use
it was ordained, what
fruits and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
wee receive by it,
&amp;c. And what doth
the water of Baptisme
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15486:17"/>
profit, I speake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
such as are
come to the use of
reason, or such as are
present at the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Baptisme.
And so likewise may
wee say of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christs body
and bloud. Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the word, and
what is Bread but
Bread? What is wine
but wine? that is to
say, Take away the
preaching of the Lords
death from the holy
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, and what
doth it profit to eat &amp;
drinke the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
bread and wine?
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15486:18"/>
seeing the mystery is
not knowne nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
But put the
preaching of the word
to the Elements, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
bread, and wine,
and so are they made
holy and honourable
Sacraments, full of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
joy and great
comfort, as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
saith, Let the
word be added to the
Element, and it is
made a Sacrament.
Therefore where the
Lords Supper is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ministred,<note place="margin">What things ought to be preached at the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Lords Supper.</note> there is
declared the death and
passion of Christ, there
is shewed forth the

misery of man, from
the which hee could
have beene no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
released, but only
by the death of Christ;
there is taught what
the Sacrament is, what
it signifyeth, and to
what use Christ our
Saviour did institute
it, there are the people
exhorted not rashly,
nor with unwashed
feet, as they use to
say, to come unto the

they come with

that most worthy

mystery, as they
ought, least they eat
and drinke their own

they stored up unto
the workes of mercie
toward the poore, and
unto hearty thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

his Son Christ, there
also are they put in

set forth, preach and
declare to the people
the holy Gospell of
God, and yee intend
nothing lesse. For as
God is neither in your
heart, nor in your
mouth; so doe ye not
preach the holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
of God to the
people, but onely yee
rehearse a few Latine
sentences out of the
Gospel, which neither
ye your selves, for the

is all your preaching.
Here is the whole

Are not the

Have yee not played
the good Schoole-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15486:29"/>
Have ye not wel

Tell mee of goodfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
whose disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

Christs that

that preach
not? Looke whose or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
yee follow, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
are yee. But
Christs order follow
yee not, therefore are
ye not the disciples of
Christ, but the vile
slaves of Antichrist.
Here see yee then one
foule fault, which you
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15486:29"/>
Masse-mongers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in your wicked
Masses. The best part
ye utterly leave out, I
meane the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospell,
which our Saviour
Christ his Apostles,
and all true Ministers
in all ages, chiefly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
at the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
And in this
behalfe yee agree not
with Christ, neither is
your Masse any thing
like the LORDS
Supper.</p>
            <p>After the Sermon<note place="margin">Christ mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred his Supper at a Table.</note>
Christ came to the
Table, where he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15486:30"/>
the Sacrament of
his Body and Bloud to
his Disciples. Now
compare your doings
with Christs. Christ
came to a Table to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
his holy Supper.
You come to an Altar
for to say your popish
and Idolatrous Masse.
Christ tabled the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and yee alter it.
Oh, how well-favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
ye agree? even as
Christ and <hi>Belial.</hi> God
and the Divell, light
and darkenesse, or as
the use to say, Like

Christ ministred his

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:15486:30"/>
so did it continue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine<note place="margin">The Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church used no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, but Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note>

the selfe truth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
giver of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
But if you, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the example
of Antichrist, like
bloudie sacrificers, fall
in hand with Altars, as
though ye had sheepe
and oxen to kil. Christ
willing to declare that
all bloudie offerings
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15486:31"/>
and sacrifices were
come to an end, which
were but signes, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
and shadowes
of him, being the true
and alone acceptable
sacrifice for the sinnes
of the world, came
not unto an Altar, but
unto a Table, and there
ordained &amp; ministed
his holy Supper, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby, that not
onely the bloudie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
but also all Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
which were built
for bloudie sacrifices
sake, doe now cease,
and are utterly aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
But yee whose
desire alwayes is to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15486:31"/>
come as neere unto
Christ, or unto his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ordinance, as the
Hare covets to come
nigh unto a Tabret, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
Christs order, and
dispise the table, spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
calling it an Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-board,
and like
heathenish and Iewish
Priests, yee build Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
and upon them
you offer your vile and
stinking sacrifice, not
unto God, but unto
the Divell, and unto
Antichrist. Christ and
his Apostles, with all
the holy Bishops and
reverend Fathers of
the Primitive Church
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15486:32"/>
ministred the Lords
Supper at a Table, and
dare ye, O yee Masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,

is, as it were, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,

concerning his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamanitie,
and not
here in earth (as the

dreame) upon whom,
and by whom we doe
offer sacrifice of praise
alwayes to God, that
is to say, the fruit of

is our alone Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour,

Altar (CHRIST) the
faithfull congregation
knoweth none, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in earth. All other
Altars, therefore,
which ye have in your

and by no meanes
to be suffered, where
God is truely honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and his holy

by maintaining your
Altars, than shew
your selves very Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,

to GODS holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and as much as

CHRIST is not yet

come, or at the least
have not offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a sacrifice to God
the Father for the sins
of the people? All
bloudie sacrifice for
sinne, cease now in the
New Testament, for
the which Altars ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
therefore Christ
ministred unto his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
the Sacrament

not at an Altar, but at

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15486:34"/>
Have ye gone so long
to Schoole with that

doe ye stand at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars

and take upon you to
offer sacrifice for the
sinnes of the people,
as though all such
things were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ended in the

Christ? If your Altars
be of God, shew it by
the holy Scriptures.
But this can you not
doe, therfore are your
Altars not of God, but
of the Divell; not of
Christ, but of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.
Is this to walke
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15486:35"/>
as Christ hath wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked?
Is this to doe as

God amend you,

But how come yee in

yee follow Christ in

               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:15486:42"/>
in the Law, are now
perfectly fulfilled in
Christ, that Lambe of
God, which was slaine
from the beginning of
the world, and there
are no more Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to bee looked
for, nor none other
doctrine to bee enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for, neither the
Iewes <hi>Talmuth,</hi> nor
Mahomets <hi>Alkaron,</hi>
nor the Popes <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi>
nor yet the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
<hi>Interim,</hi> but
the doctrine onely,
which Christ hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
taught, and
left in writing by the
hands of his Apostles.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15486:43"/>
The Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both concerning
Sacraments and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">The doctrine of Christ is perfect and sufficient for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note>
is now by
Christ brought to such
a consummate perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation,
that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as necessarie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
for our salvation.
Therfore doth Christ
with his Apostles sit
at the receiving of the
Sacrament, and not
stand; after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Iewes, even
as they, which travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
by the way, are
come unto their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes
end, are wont to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15486:43"/>
sit downe and to take
their rest. Here have
wee an example of
Christ to sit at the
Lords Table, when
wee receive the holy
Communion, and not
to kneele. But this
doe ye Papists neither
observe your selves,
nor suffer other so to
doe. Ye are like those
lewd Lawyers, subtill
Scribes, boysterous
Bishops, sawcie Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,
fine Pharisees,
pratling Priests, and
hollow Hypocrites, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
on this manner.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15486:44"/>
Woe unto ye Scribes
and Pharisees,<note place="margin">Matth 23.</note> ye Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
for yee shut
up the Kingdome of
heaven before men, ye
neither goe in your
selves, neither suffer
ye them that come, to
enter in. There may
bee no sitting at your
ministration, though
wee have Christ for a
president never so
much. The servant
may not follow his
Lord, nor the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
his Master. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Christ practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
we may not doe,
but what Antichrist
deviseth, that must we
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15486:44"/>
needs doe. Therefore
doe ye Papists, which
be alwayes enemies to
Christ and to his holy
ordinances, binde all
your captives to kneel
at the receiving of
the Sacrament, and so
makes them plain Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
in worshipping
the bread for a god. O
wicked soule-slayers!
But why binde ye the
people rather to kneel
at the ministration
of the Lords S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pper,
than at the ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Baptisme, seeing
Christ is no lesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the one,<note place="margin">Christ is no lesse present at Baptisme than at the Supper.</note> than
at the other, and by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:15486:45"/>
his holy Spirit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no lesse effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Baptisme, than he
doth in the Supper?
Why doe yee not also
compell the people to
kneele at the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gods Word
seeing it is of no lesse
authoritie, than the
Sacrament of Christs
bodie and bloud. But
I know your subtilties
right well. Ye will say,
the Sacrament of the
Altar (I use your own
tearmes) is God and
man in forme of
bread,<note place="margin">An error of the Papists.</note> and therefore
it cannot have too
much reverence, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:15486:45"/>
and honour given
unto it. I answer: It is
sooner said,<note place="margin">A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son between the old Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Priests and ours.</note> than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
As the old Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters

and worshipped
them, so have yee a

which ye your

compell other so to do
likewise. And as the
old Idolatrous Priests

lived an idle and

being turned into the

and the accidents of
the bread onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
according to
the doctrine of Pope
<hi>Nicholas,</hi> and Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</hi>
O wonderfull
Creators and makers!
O marveilous fathers,
which beget a childe

and after yee have
made him, yee teare
him in pieces, yee eat
him, yee digest him,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:15486:48"/>
and send him downe

upon their marrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones.
O false and
subtil hypocrits, right
cousens to the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
priests of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;
For as they made
the King beleeve, and
his Nobility, with all
the Commons, that
<hi>Bel</hi> was a living god,
and that there must
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15486:48"/>
bee prepared for him
every day twelve
cakes,<note place="margin">Dan. 14.</note> forty sheepe,
and sixe great pots of
wine, to eate and
drinke; so doe yee
make the Queene, her
Counsell, the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and commons of
this Realme for the
most part beleeve that
the little thin round
white cake, which ye
hold up above your
head, at your abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Masse, after yee
once said these five
words over it, <hi>Hoc est
corpus meum,</hi> and have
blowed, blasted, and
breathed over it, is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15486:49"/>
straightwayes both a
living God, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
living man, even
Christ God and man,
as he was borne of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
the Virgine. But
full falsely doe ye lie,
and dissemble with
the Queene, with her
Couunsell, and with
the commons of this
Realme, even as those
Idolatrous priests of
Babylon did with the
King, and with hi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
subjects. For as that
Idol <hi>Bel</hi> was not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
god, but an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
made of clay
within, and of metall
without, so likewise
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15486:49"/>
for all your consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
blowing, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
and breathing,
your little Cake is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a living God, nor
a living man, but as it
was bread before yee
brought it to your
Idolatrous Altar, so
is it, when yee both
hold it up and eat it.
But as the Idolatrous
priests of Babylon
taught the people
plainely, that <hi>Bel</hi> was
a living God, that
they by that meanes
might live in wealth
and idlenesse, so do ye
likewise stoutly both
at <hi>Pauls</hi> Crosse, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:15486:50"/>
else where preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the people, that the
Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
is the true, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
reall, corporall,
carnall, and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
body of Christ,
God and man, even
he was borne of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Marie,</hi> &amp; hung on
the Altar of the crosse,
flesh, bloud and bone,
that ye by this meanes
may maintaine your
popish kingdome, and
live idly and pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the labours of
other mens hands.
But if a <hi>Daniel</hi> might
sit at the Queens Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
talke with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15486:50"/>
and preach to
the Commons of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
the jugling of
the Papists should
soone be espyed. God
for his mercies sake
&amp; for the deare heart-bloud
of his most
deare Son, send us a
<hi>Daniel,</hi> and open the
eyes of the Queene, of
her Councell, and of
all the Inhabitants of
this Realme, that they
perceiving your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
iugling and crafty

you to be, as yee are,
even very Antichrists,
hisse you out of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

ever after beware of

Amen.</p>
            <p>After that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ was set
downe at the Table

of this prayer I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

good, that I thinke

what thinke yee of

unto the dishonour
of GOD, and the

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:15486:63"/>
Yee must answer, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the little round
cake, or else the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
or the wine and
water that is in it.<note place="margin">Idolatry.</note> To

it? To <hi>Mary</hi> the

yee will lacke no

Wherefore doe ye of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that oblation? For
the salvation of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and for the rest
or quietnesse of all the

Ah, who ever heard
of such a sacrifice or
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:15486:63"/>
oblation? A wafer

If <hi>Adams</hi> Posteritie

obtaine salvation for

greatly overseene to

for the redemption of
man? If thousands of

take away the sinnes
of the people, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

to be thought, that a

wafer cake and a

offered by Antichrist,
is a sufficient oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and rest and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for the dead? O
Damnable Idolatrie!
There is no Sacrifice
that can save us,<note place="margin">The death of Christ is the alone sacrifice for sinne.</note> but
the glorious Passion,
and precious Death
of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ Iesus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
saith: <hi>God forbid, that I

To God alone?
Nay, but to blessed

dee yee doubt of the

faith so strong, that
yee doubt, whether
God will heare you,
and receive your sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

you may right well
call it a new Sacrifice,
for it was never heard

is your doing after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
When ye have

offered, yee trudge
straight-wayes to the

your hands. To what
end I know not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it bee, that you
have defiled your

the faithfull that are
dead, and thinke by
the washing of your

from the abominable
spirituall whoredome,
which yee have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

suppose yee learned
this washing of your

when for favour of the

condemned CHRIST
unto death, called for

wash his hands, and
said, <hi>I am cleane from
the bloud of this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man.</hi> But as he for
all his washing esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
not the vengeance
of God, but dyed a
most miserable death,
even so may yee bee
sure, though yee wash
your hands never so
oft, not to escape the
heavie hand of God,
for speaking such blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
against the
Lord and his annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
except yee out of
hand cease from your
abominable Massing,
which is nothing
else but very Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:15486:68"/>
meere blasphemy,
great dishonour to

ye speake in such sort,
that it were much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

O Antichrist. Here

By the vertue of these

               <hi>Hoc est enim cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus

CHRIST spake these
words of the bread, as
the holy Scriptures
and all ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
doe witnesse,<note place="margin">Iohn 15. 10.</note> and
so then followeth it,
that bread is Christs
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:15486:94"/>
body, and Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
is bread. And by
this meanes it must
needs be granted, that
Christ hath two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
one made of
bread, and another of
flesh, which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of <hi>Mary</hi> the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.
But yee answer,
Christs calling is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
Christ called the
bread his body, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is it made his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
I answer againe,
Christ called himselfe
a Vine, a Doore, a
Shepheard, and called
his Heavenly Father a
Plough-man, is Christ
therefore made a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:15486:95"/>
vine, a materiall
doore, a rusticall shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
and his Father
an husband-man of
the country? Christ
called <hi>Iohn Baptist Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 17</note>
Is <hi>Iohn</hi> therefore
made that <hi>Elias</hi> the
Thesbite, which prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in the time of
wicked King <hi>Achab?</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 King. 13.</note>
Christ called <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Evangelist <hi>Maries</hi> son,<note place="margin">Iohn 19.</note>
and called <hi>Mary</hi> his
mother: is <hi>Iohn</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made the naturall

mother of <hi>Iohn</hi> Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist?
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:15486:95"/>
I am sure yee
will not so say. No
more is the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Bread Christs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
body, although
Christ called it his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
but his bodie in a

as the old writers
testifie.<note place="margin">Libr 4.</note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> that

saith:<note place="margin">Cont. Marc.</note> Iesus taking

infinite number of
like sentences concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this matter, are
found in the ancient
Authors, which prove
evidently, that this
saying of Christ, <hi>Hoc

speech. Signes or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments

by the names of the

that Christ spake

but by signification.
Moreover it is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against the veritie
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:15486:97"/>
and truth of Christs

must be in an hundred

coat, and standing at

thinne round cake in

these five words, <hi>Hoc

with blowing and

the king of glory to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:15486:98"/>
come from the right

and to touch himselfe
in the Accidents of
the little cake, untill

and then trudge up
againe to heaven, till
<hi>Hoc est enim corpus meum</hi>
fetch him down again

And oh poore
wretched Christ, who

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:15486:98"/>
please, either to bee
torne asunder with

O ye vile and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Papists, that
though yee whisper
your five words never
so oft at your Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
altars, and breath
blast and blow, till yee

never plucke the Son
of God from the right

nor make that thinne
cake of yours Christs
naturall Body. The
article of our faith is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:15486:99"/>
that Christ is gone up
into heaven, and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
on the right hand
of God the Father
Almighty, and from
thence hee shall come
to judge the quicke
and the dead. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ told his
Disciples full oft, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before his passion,
that hee should leave
the world,<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 16.</note> and goe up
againe unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Saint <hi>Mark</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 16.</note> saith
that Christ was taken
up into heaven, and
sitteth on the right
hand of God. Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> that Christ
went away from his
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:15486:99"/>
Disciples, and was
carried up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
The Angell of
God said to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,<note place="margin">Acts 1.</note>
when Christ did
ascend up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
yee men of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile,
why stand ye ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
up into heaven.
This Iesus, which is
taken up from you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heaven, so shall hee
come, as ye have seen
him going into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Of these words
of the Angells wee
learne, that as Christ
went up visibly, and
was seene with the
corporall eyes of men,
but never man saw
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:15486:100"/>
him yet comming
downe with his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
eyes, therefore
never came he downe
corporally since his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension.
S. <hi>Stephen</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
saw Christ even
with his bodily eyes
as wee reade in the
Acts of the Apostles.
But where? Heere on
the earth between the
Priests hands? Nay,
but in heaven stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on the right hand
of God. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
heard Christ speake,
but from whence?
from the popish pixe?
yea rather from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:15486:100"/>
as blessed <hi>Luke</hi> testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note>
that Iesus Christ
must receive heaven,
till the time that all
things which God hath
spoken by the mouth
of all his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
since the world
beganne, bee restored
againe. This time is
till the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If ye will have
Christ therefore bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at your Masses, yee
must tarry till the day
of Iudgement. For

All these Authorities
of the holy Scripture

testifie that Christ as
concerning his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
presence is no
more in the earth, but
in heaven only. Christ
hath in him two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the nature of
God, and the nature
of man. As concerning
his divine nature, hee
is in heaven, in earth,
and in every place.
But as touching his
humane nature, hee
is in heaven onely,
and there shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

The Sonne of God,
saith he, as concerning
his Humanitie, is gone
away from us, but as
touching his Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
hee saith unto us:
Behold I am with you
alwayes unto the end
of the world. Againe,
forasmuch as the word
is every where, and
his flesh is not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that one and
the same CHRIST is
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:15486:103"/>
of both natures, and
that hee is in every
place as concerning
the nature of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
Againe, that
hee is contayned in a
place as touching the
nature of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
Of these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
doth it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
appeare, that
Christ, inasmuch as he
is God, is in every
place, but having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to that hee is a
man, he is only in one
place, that is to say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
heaven. If he bee only
in heaven inasmuch as
he is man, then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
yee, what is to be
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:15486:104"/>
thought of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Papists,
which teach that
Christs naturall body
is in every place
wheresoever his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
is. O Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs!
If this be not
to play the Hereticke
<hi>Marcions</hi> part, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
to destroy the
verity of Christs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, or of his
naturall body, what is
it? But Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
saith very well in
this behalfe,<note place="margin">Ad Dardan.</note> wee must
take heed (saith hee)
that we doe not so set
forth, maintaine or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the Godhead of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:15486:104"/>
the Man (Christ) that
wee take away or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the truth of his
body. For it doth
not follow, that that
which is in God,
should be every where
as God. Christ, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he is God, is
every where, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man, hee is onely
in heaven.<note place="margin">Note well the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie or almighty power of God.</note> But yee
will object, according
to your old wont, the
omnipotencie or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
power of God
and say, that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and almighty, he
may both make the

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:15486:105"/>
bee in as many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
concerning the
corporall presence, as
he list, that is to say,
in infinite places at
once. I answer, God
is not called Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
because he can doe
all things,<note place="margin">Why God is called Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</note> but because
he is able to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
his Godly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is to doe. For
there are certaine
things which God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
hee cannot denie
himselfe, hee cannot
lye, hee cannot save
such as die in infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
hee cannot make
another of like power
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:15486:105"/>
with himselfe, hee
cannot save the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,
nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the Elect,
which have their
names written in the
Booke of life, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his Word,
that cannot God doe;
But it is contrary to
the Word of God
for Christs body to
bee in more places at
once, than in one,
yea, to bee both in
heaven sitting at the
right hand of God
the Father, and heere
also in earth at
your popish Masses
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:15486:106"/>
in a thousand places at
once, therefore is not
God able to make
his body to bee in so
many places at once,
as ye faine, forasmuch
as the nature of God
onely is infinite, and
the nature of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
is contained in
some certaine one
place at once. But
here againe yee will
bring forth these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of CHRIST.<note place="margin">The promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Christ concerning concerning his presence.</note>

It is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

Behold saith he, I am
with you alwayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
heard wee before. Of
all these things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
spoken it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
body of Christ is
not here in earth, as
yee Masse-mongers
would gladly make us
beleeve, but in heaven
onely, and there shall
remaine untill the day
of Iudgement. Christ
in the mean season be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here present with

that the Sacramentall

would suffer such abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable

yet was it not thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

what need ye then to

the dead? Ye might as
well pray for dead
swine. For yee have
as good authority of
the holy Scriptures
for the one, as for the
other. But this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the dead hath
made your Kitchins
warme, your pots to

to turne merrily. It
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:15486:124"/>
hath fed your idle bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies

you to live in all joy,

Therefore no
marevell though such
things bee placed in

the praying for
the dead, and yee

an History of a
Christian &amp; of a Iew.<note place="margin">An history of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and a Iew.</note>
The Christian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Iew to bee
an honest civill man,
faithfull in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and upright in
his dealing toward all
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:15486:142"/>
men sorrowed greatly
in his heart, that hee
was not also of the
Christian beleefe. The
christian thinking that
the most ready way to
bring the Iew unto
Christ, was to leade
him to church, that he
might there heare and
see how well God was
served among them,
desired the Iew upon
a certaine Sabboth day
to goe with him
unto the temple of the
Christians, nothing
doubting, but if hee
would so doe, hee
should bee allured to
give over his Iewish
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:15486:142"/>
opinions, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a christian man.
The Iew consented
and went with him to
church where he qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
saw and beheld all
things. He heard iolly
ringing, pleasant sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
and merry or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
playing. Hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
a sort of gay
gawdy mawmets, and
a number of merry fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
in the quire sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
sometime high,
sometime low, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
in a meane, and
sometime nothing at
all. Hee saw also a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
with a shaven
crowne going up and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:15486:143"/>
downe in the church,
and casting water in
the peoples teeth, and
afterward having a iol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
coat upon his backe
he saw him goe about
the church-yard, after
an Image, all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
following him.
After all these things
hee saw that shaveling
cast off the gay-coat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and put on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
game plaiers gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
&amp; so to addres
himselfe unto an altar
covered with white
linnen cloathes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
was set, as hee
thought, meate, and
drinke, for he saw the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:15486:143"/>
cup there. After much
singing and piping, he
saw the sacrificer that
stood at the altar, lift
up a little thin round
cake, &amp; a cup of drinke
above his head. Here
will bee good cheere
thought the Iew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
for here are iolly
signes &amp; proffers. But
when he saw the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
fall downe &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the bread and cup
hee marvailed greatly
at their madnes. Masse
ended, hee looked al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should have beene
called to eat and drink
with Hicke-scorner
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:15486:144"/>
that heaved the bread
and cup over his head,
but no man had part
with him. He devourd
all alone like Sim slap
sauce: when they were
departed out of the
church going home
ward, the christian
willing to prove how
the Iew was affected
toward the christian
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, said unto him,
Sir, how like you our
religion and serving
of God? To whom
the Iew answered: ye
have in the temple
many things that
would make a sad man
glad, and one that is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:15486:144"/>
sorrowfull, cheerefull.
I meane your thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of bells, your
playing on the organs,
your merry singing,
the casting of water in
the peoples teeth, and
your running one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another about the
church-yard, like the
Prior of Prickling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
and his covent.
All these things seeme
to be matters of mirth
used among you, as I
thinke onely to make
you merry. But the
having of Idols in
your temples I do not
allow. I see you also
fall downe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:15486:145"/>
a peece of bread
and a silver cup, which
I iudge high abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and damnable
Idolatry. And another
thing there is used in
your temples, which
I also do nothing like.
What is that quoth
the christian. I will
tell you said the Iew.
Yee talke, cracke and
boast much of charity
but I say right well
that there is little used
among you. For there
was an Altar spred
with fine white cloths,
and meat and drinke
as I suppose, set upon
it, I alwaies looked,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:15486:145"/>
when ye should have
beene called to eate
and drinke together
according to the order
of charity, but that
shaveling that stood
at the altar in the gay
coat did both eat and
drink all alone, giving
you no part with him,
which is a token of
small charity &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
among you. Certs
you shal redresse these
great vices, and have
more charity among
you before I become
one of your order.
And so the Iew refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be made a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
God have mercy
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:15486:146"/>
on us. Among many
other notable faults,
which the Iew percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in our Temples,
this was not the least,
that one standing with
his backe toward the
people at an altar, did
eat and drink al alone,
giving no man part
with him, which is a

Whereas
