            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I know there are ſome, that make this <hi>Micah</hi>'s Religion to be perfect Idolatry, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Apoſtaſie from the Religion that Almighty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64778:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God by his Servant <hi>Moſes</hi> had eſtabliſhed among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>; but if ſo, what made him ſo fond of the Ephod, the Altar, the Cherub, the Levite, and every thing elſe that did but ſo much as Ape the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Tabernacle? Nay, what made him ſo joyful that he had got one of Gods Levites to be his Prieſts? or to make ſo many applications to the true God as he did? for my part I do (and thereunto I am obliged by <hi>Vatablus, Grotius</hi> and many others, to) think that he was <hi>veri Dei cultor,</hi> a worſhipper of the True God, though (Puritan like) in a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate way; inſomuch, that howbeit he might have a tincture of Idolatry in his worſhip, yet it was a fault in him, and a very great one too, that he had ſet up an houſe of his own; and therein an Ephod, an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, a Teraphim, a Prieſt in contradiction to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, the Ephod, the Altar, the Cherubims, and the eſtabliſhed Prieſts of God.

Thus it fared of old with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thus of late with <hi>England</hi>; for no ſooner began we to grow mad, and to bethink our ſelves of no King, but immediately (as if Hell it ſelf had broke looſe) all the worm-eaten exploded hereſies, from the very days of Chriſt, began to make head again; and there came upon the ſtage a revived rabble of <hi>Gnoſticks, Arrians, Macedonians, Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

And if we do but conſider how ſome men of late (good friends, no doubt, to <hi>Micah</hi>) to give eaſe to tender Conſciences would have eaſed us of our religion; and out of kindneſs to a little uncouth Proteſtantiſm to come into the Church, would have thruſt out the Reformation (nay Chriſtianity it ſelf) out of the Church, we may ſay, it was well for us then, that we alſo had a King.

                  <p n="1">1. It ſuppoſeth a government truly Monarchical. It hath been concluded by many, That theſe words [of having no King] bear a particular regard to the firſt forty years that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been in poſſeſſion of the Promiſed land from the death of <hi>Joſhua</hi>; the one part whereof, was under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (as ſome ſay) of the ſurviving Elders, which came into the land with <hi>Joſhua</hi>; as others ſay, under the Sanedrim or Senate of Elders as they were at firſt eſtabliſhed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and afterwards renewed by the people; The other part under <hi>Oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> their Judge, to whom though uſually the whole forty years be aſcribed, yet it is certain that many of them were paſs'd and gone afore ever he took the office of a Judge upon him (<hi>ch.</hi> 3.8.); and it is no leſs certain, that the abuſe done to the <hi>Levites</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine (which is one of the laſt recited Villanies committed in thoſe days) was acted in the time of <hi>Phineas</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the High Prieſt (<hi>ch.</hi> 20.28.), who came into that office upon the death of <hi>Eleazar</hi> about the death of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and continued in it (as Chronologers
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64778:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
compute) all the years aſcribed to <hi>Othniel,</hi> dying with or about the ſame time as <hi>Othniel</hi> did. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>in thoſe days there was no King</hi>; Elders there were (as you have heard) of the Tribes, and every Elder (as ſome conceive) governing his own Tribe; There were moreover the Elders of the Sanedrim ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending and governing the whole Nation of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>; Nay, as for part of thoſe days, there was a Judge among them; and yet great oppreſſion, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſorders, and all occaſioned by the want of a King. Which ſhews, That neither Ariſtocracy nor Democracy, the Rule of the Nobles, nor the Rule of the People (be it by themſelves or their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives) was able of it ſelf, or indeed capable to ſecure them from confuſion, impiety, oppreſſion. And therefore you ſhall find them endeavouring, and upon all occaſions labouring after a King; calling firſt to <hi>Gideon,</hi> Do thou King us (<hi>ch.</hi> 8.22.); afterwards to <hi>Samuel,</hi> to make them a King (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.5.) And its obſervable, that the nearer they approached to this kind of government, the better they were; but if at any time the Judge dy'd (who was inſtead of a King,) or the government came to be devolv'd upon their Sanedrim, all things preſently went to confuſion, and they reinforc'd to chuſe them a new Judge. And thus it is recorded of them in general (<hi>ch.</hi> 2.18, 19.) That <hi>when the Lord raiſed them up, Judges, the Lord was with the Judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies:</hi> but <hi>if the Judge dy'd, then it came to paſs, that they returned and corrupted themſelves more than their fathers had done.</hi> And in particular, thus it was when <hi>Othniel</hi> dy'd (<hi>ch.</hi> 3.12.), thus when <hi>Ehud</hi> dy'd (<hi>ch.</hi> 4.1.), thus when <hi>Deborah</hi> dy'd (<hi>ch.</hi> 6.1.) thus when <hi>Gideon</hi> dy'd (<hi>ch.</hi> 8.33.), and thus, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64778:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
almoſt always thus to the end of the whole govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Judges: which argues, that the nearer the advance is made to Kingſhip, the nearer people get to Order and good Government; and the further any ſtand off, ſtill the worſe, and every day worſe; for when there was not ſo much as a Judge among them, they fell not only into ſin but into ſlavery. So it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>Interregnum</hi> between <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Othniel,</hi> they were oppreſſed by <hi>Cuſhan</hi> eight years (<hi>ch.</hi> 3.8.), by <hi>Eglon</hi> upon the death of <hi>Othniel</hi> eighteen years (<hi>ch.</hi> 3.14.), by <hi>Jabin</hi> upon the death of <hi>Ehud</hi> twenty years (<hi>ch.</hi> 4.2.), by <hi>Midian</hi> upon the death of <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> ſeven years (<hi>ch.</hi> 6.1.), by <hi>Ammon</hi> upon the death of <hi>Jair</hi> eighteen years (<hi>ch.</hi> 10.8.), by the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> upon the death of <hi>Abdon</hi> forty years (<hi>ch.</hi> 13.1.), In all an hundred and eleven years; ſlavery enough (if people would be taught any thing) to convince them of the neceſſity of a King and Kingly government, as likewiſe of the defects, imperfections, calamities of all other rule, though it be that of a Senate or a Sanedrim.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A King ſuppoſeth a power Soveraign; One of a Supreme and indefeiſable authority; Superiour to all, to the very Senate and Sanedrim: To whom the appeal muſt lye, and from whom the final and decretory Sentence muſt come; accountable to none but to God, who is the King of Kings, and the laſt Judge of men, though in Conſcience oblig'd to do no evil himſelf, nor to ſuffer others to do it; as knowing that he muſt one day account to the God who firſt made him a man, and then gave him his authority. A perſon (I ſay) of ſuperiour and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable authority, for otherwiſe he is not Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and no better than one of the Judges of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64778:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
land; for the Judge was the Leader, the Prime and Principal of the reſt, had the chief honour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, but always ſubſervient to, and controllable by the Sanedrim; which bred mighty delays, huge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, many and laſting confuſions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon being wearied and tired out by the defects of that kind of government, they ſay to <hi>Samuel, Give us a King</hi>; and to <hi>Gideon, Be thou a King</hi> (a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign) <hi>to us,</hi> who by an inherent ſupercommanding authority may in times of neceſſity and danger not only ſilence the Faction of Tribes, but the heat of Senators; for they alſo may be faulty, as in the caſe of <hi>Korah,</hi> where no leſs than two hundred and fifty Princes of the Aſſembly roſe up againſt <hi>Moſes (Num.</hi> 16.2.). Nay, probably this was the reaſon why they ſaid to <hi>Samuel, Give us a King like other Nations</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.5.); not as if they were deſirous to be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized over, or made ſlaves as other nations too too often were; that's a thing they were reſolved to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rather than endure the known miſchiefs and barbariſms, that the jealouſies, delays, factions, of the Demagogues and men of renown in the Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim uſed to expoſe them unto. And what if the Prince ſhould be perſonally wanton, by nature cruel, upon experience covetous, deſigning, ſeeking his own and his family concerns, and thereupon pervert juſtice, take illegal occaſions to oppreſs and revenge? Nay, what if <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard be to be had, or the Veſſels of the Temple to be rifled, or religion it ſelf to be altered? If theſe doings are ſo criminal, ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous, ſo formidable, when confined to one, what will they be when they are the eſpouſed Sentiments of many? nay, made their intereſts and acted in all the corners and quarters of the land?

That <hi>he will take your ſons, and appoint them for himſelf, for his chariots and his horſemen</hi>; and <hi>ſet them to ear his corn, and to make his inſtruments of war?</hi> and what if <hi>he take your fields, your vineyards, and your oliveyards, and give them to his officers and Servants?</hi> This is the worſt that the very worſt of them will do: But put the caſe that this be done; yet if there be a <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri</hi> as at <hi>Rome</hi>; if thirty Tyrants, as at <hi>Athens</hi>; if two hundred and fifty, as in the Aſſembly of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>: Theſe may all (and every one of them) be as bad, as laſcivious, as covetous, as oppreſſive, as deſigning as that One; and ſo the Tyranny, oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, impiety be much greater and more ſpreading, but not ſo eaſily cur'd, nor ſo well endur'd. I am apt to think, that if our late Calamities (which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not full twenty years) were well reflected upon, there would be found more Tyranny to have been exerciſed, more outrages to have been committed, more injuſtice to have been done by the Aſſemblers and Senators of thoſe days, than ever there can be found among all our Kings ſince we have had a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, or (what's altogether the ſame) ſince we have been a Nation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A King ſuppoſeth one Hereditary; a King with an Heir and known Succeſſor at hand to ſtep into his place as ſoon as ever he himſelf is gone. Hence the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (full ſenſible of the want of ſuch a King) call unto <hi>Gideon, rule thou over us, thou and thy ſon, and thy ſons ſon, (ch.</hi> 8.22.) profering thereby an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail and inheritance; and intimating, that they ſhould never be well, nor out of danger, till they had a King; not a Judge (for ſo <hi>Gideon</hi> was, and had

done as great and as valiant things as ever any Judge had done,) but a King; and a King, with Off-ſpring and Progeny to ſucceed and to rule without any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnums</hi> or new choice, which had too too often proved factious and tedious, and moſtly fatal.

This is a moſt certain truth, that none illegitimately born could inherit, <hi>Thou ſhalt not inherit in our fathers houſe,</hi> (ſay the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> concerning <hi>Jephtha, ch.</hi> 11.2.) <hi>for thou art the ſon of a ſtrange woman</hi>: but if legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and firſt born of the family, there was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription (no Bill of Excluſion) to be made; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being ever accounted more horrid and vile among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> than to ſnarl, diſturb, interrupt or diſplace the Inheritance. Nay, though there had been more wives in the caſe (the wrong loved, and the right hated) yet the firſt-born of the hated was to have the Inheritance; <hi>the right of the firſt-born is his, (Deut.</hi> 21.17.)

Certainly it is not a Purple Robe, nor a Reed put into the hand, that will make <hi>Iſrael</hi> a King; the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo ſerved our Saviour, and withal <hi>bowed the Knee</hi> unto him, ſaying, <hi>Hail King of the Jews</hi>: but (ſays the Text) <hi>they firſt ſtripped him, and then they mocked him</hi>: and in ſooth if Kings come once to be ſtript of their own Robes (I mean their <hi>Jura regni,</hi> their Preheminences, Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Dignities, whereby they come to be Kings and to excell others) I cannot ſee but they are worthily made the People's ſcorn; and though Princely clad, yet no better than a Suppoſititious <hi>Perkin,</hi> or a bare King of Clouts. Nay, I cannot ſee, but that if King <hi>Adonibezek</hi> (notwithſtanding his eight Kings proſtrated and captivated by him) be himſelf to be bound and ſhackled at the will, and by the Votes of his Subjects, He muſt be adjudged to be himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlav'd, and as far (in reality) from being a King in <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ſence, as thoſe very Captivated Kings were, <hi>who lay gathering their Meat under his Table with their Thumbs and their Toes cut off.</hi> But to end this; The <hi>Rabbins</hi> have a ſaying, that there were three things enjoyned the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (whilſt they were in the Wilderneſs) to be performed by them when they entred into <hi>Canaan</hi>; <gap reason="foreign">

them a King. Its true they diſpleaſed <hi>Samuel</hi> in doing it (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.6.); nay, God tells them, that by ſo doing <hi>they had rejected him alſo,</hi> (verſ. 7.); from which and other like places the Rota-brained Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican takes an occaſion to Blaſpheme God and the King, and to decry their Government as if it were not only Tyrannical but Antitheocratical; and yet God promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſoon after that he promiſed him the Land) <hi>that Kings ſhould come out of his Loins</hi> (Gen. 17.6.); and by prediction from <hi>Jacob, that the Scepter ſhould not depart from Judah till Shiloh came,</hi> Gen. 49.10. and as they were going to the Land, he informed them what manner of King they were to chooſe, when they came thither (<hi>Deut.</hi> 17.15.); Yea, and when choice was made of <hi>Saul,</hi> God owned him, and promiſed bleſſings along with him, provided they would but fear God and walk in his ways (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14.); nay, the Scripture brands all the Male contents and thoſe who refuſed to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate his Choice, for Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> (1 Sam. 10.27.). So that if the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> offended in asking a King, it was <hi>in formâ non jure petendi,</hi> in the manner of ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not in the thing it ſelf: either becauſe they did it in a Seditious Tumultuating manner, affecting Innovation in the Government as ſome do conceive; or in an affrontive way to <hi>Samuel</hi> their preſent Judge, as others imagine; or to a wrong and evil deſign, hoping thereby to make an alteration in the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Religion of the Land, as a third ſort think. All which were not only evil in themſelves, but very culpable, and juſtly provoked God to ſay, that <hi>He would give them a King in his Anger</hi>: however the deſiring or having a King was not evil in it ſelf; for God gave them one upon their requeſt, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64778:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when that Perſon was dead, he appointed them another (even <hi>David,</hi> a man after his own heart;) and under that kind of Government he continued them ſo long as he continued them in <hi>Canaan.</hi> Which intimates, that the having a King in <hi>Iſrael</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

Judges will not do alone; neither <hi>Joſhua</hi> nor the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> muſt preſume too far; nay, the Sanedrim it ſelf muſt be modeſt and humble; theſe and every one of theſe in their proper Spheres may help on the bleſſing, but to make a Nation perfectly happy (<hi>Canaan</hi> like) God muſt give them a King. For though he had often changed their Government before, from Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to Judges, from Judges to Prieſts, yet having once given them a King, he there reſts; as having brought all to perfection, and never changed any more. Which argues, that Kings are not only Divine, but the beſt if not the only means to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the peace, and to propagate the welfare of a Nation. And ſo we paſs from the firſt cauſe of thoſe miſchiefs that befel the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they had no <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Magiſtrates and Judges (who then had the Rule) neglected their office, and neither ſuppreſſed ſin, nor puniſhed the offender, which was all one as if they had had no King in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It is ſaid of the inhabitants of <hi>Laiſh</hi> (afterwards <hi>Dan</hi>) <hi>that they lived careleſs, and after the manner of the

Zidonians</hi>; in Luſt and Luxury, in Vice and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in Idolatry and Prophaneneſs; and the reaſon given for it is (<hi>Chap.</hi> 18.7.) that <hi>there was no Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in the Land to put them to ſhame in any thing</hi>: Magiſtrates there were, but none that would enforce the Laws, or proſecute the offenders; none that would reſtrain them in their Vices, or be (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> phraſeth it) <hi>a terror to evil doers.</hi> The very caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> before us, for Magiſtrates they had, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers themſelves confeſs; but withal ſo backward and tardy in acting like Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as if they had been afraid to be Gods Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſo ſhy of executing the Laws, as if (like <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi>'s) they had been wrote in blood; and again ſo fearful of puniſhing, as if the whipping a <hi>Micah</hi> had been the Martyring a Saint; whereas Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ought not to prevaricate in their office. St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly tells them, <hi>they muſt not bear the Sword in vain</hi>; not hold it in their hands as if it were a bare Scepter of ornament for themſelves, but uſe it as a Sword <hi>to be a revenger, and to execute wrath upon them that do evil.</hi> Neither ought the wholſom precept of Charity and forgiveneſs (which our bleſſed Saviour ſo often, and ſo earneſtly inculcates) ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, much leſs evacuate this power; for it doth not hinder Parents from chaſtiſing their offending Children, nor Maſters from correcting their rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Servants; this were to licentiate Diſobedience, and to give a toleration to Diſorder. Suffer but this, and the Parent ſhall not rule his Child, nor the Maſter his Servant, no more than the Prince his Subject; nay, ſuffer but this, and the Child will ſoon make his Parent paſs through the fire for him to <hi>Moloch</hi>; the Servant will ſoon bore the ears of

his Maſter; and the Subject get into the Throne of his Soveraign, and be a thouſand times more inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than He. Let but this immunity be proclaimed as a voice from Heaven, and the world will ſoon be in flames about our ears. <hi>The children of God will fall in Love with the daughters of Men, and the daughters of Men</hi> as ſoon produce a race of <hi>ſtrong and mighty Giants</hi>; (a Crew of ſtubborn, wilful, diſobedient men) ſo mighty, that neither Reaſon ſhall perſwade, Kindneſs oblige, nor Government hold; <hi>Men of renown and famous in their Generations</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and their accomplices were ſaid to be); Giants <hi>Non tam corporum mole, quam latrociniis &amp; graſſandi libidine,</hi> Mighty not ſo much in bulk as in Will, not in body as in Humour; Mighty by their Stubbornneſs and Faction, by their Wickedneſs and Villany, to overthrow and confound a Nation. Wherefore let me perſwade you (You who are the preſent Guard of our Country; the eyes to find out, and the hands to puniſh Offenders) that as you have a King Enthron'd, ſo you would uſe your endeavours (as in Duty and Conſcience you are bound) to keep and preſerve him on his Throne. Let not the mighty Giants nor their <hi>Weavers-beams</hi> ſcare you; think not that <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> (the Raviſhers of Women, and the Riflers of Houſes) are our only Malefactors; but let <hi>Ephraim</hi> and his Idols, <hi>Micah</hi> and his Houſe of Gods be alike enquired into, and puniſhed; Practices ſuiting only Anarchy, and the worſt of Days when there is no King! and therefore ſince we have a King, let theſe practices (I pray you) have an end, that it may not be ſaid of us that we live as we did, or indeed as if there were, or rather as if we would have it ſo, that there ſhould

                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Micah</hi>'s Houſe and Religion is an Evil in the Land;</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is an Evil to be enquired into by the King and the Judges of the Land;</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That when no care is taken thereof, it is uſually the Mother Evil of the Land. But I know before I proceed, that I ſhall be accounted (for what I have to ſay) no friend to the Religion now on foot called <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi>; however I am ſure, that I am ſerving the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nay, diſſerving the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as much as if I were unreeving the <hi>Conclave,</hi> or pulling the <hi>Trentine</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out by the ears. For would we be perſwaded to keep to the Fold, and the Shepherd appointed us (be he on the Mountain or in the Planes) to the Shepherd whom God, his Church, and the lawful Preſidents thereof have ſet over us; the Wolves may howl for want of prey, the greedy <hi>Itinerant</hi> return a perfect <hi>Mendicant,</hi> the Seminaries abroad be forced to keep the brood they have hatch'd, and the <hi>Roman Eagle</hi> never more take pleaſure to quarry upon our <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhore: for it was <hi>Micah</hi>'s Houſe, and the High-places afterwards (like places of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration) that firſt brought Idolatry into <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and I am as confident that if it ever be brought into our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64778:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches again, theſe are the Houſes that muſt dreſs up the Idol, theſe the Seminaries that breed the <hi>Shavelin</hi> who will ſay <hi>Maſs</hi> afore it. But the Enditement is fram'd and drawn, come I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore briefly to prove the particulars of it; and,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Micah</hi>'s Houſe and Separation (though never ſo near a kin to the Religion of the Sanctuary) is one of the Evils of the Land. Thus it was in our <hi>Micah</hi>'s days: and thus no leſs in the days of <hi>Gideon</hi>; for (<hi>Chap.</hi> 8.27.) <hi>He made him an Ephod, and put it in his City (even in Ophra) and all Iſrael went thither a Whoreing after it.</hi> Now the <hi>Ephod</hi> (as you have heard) was one of the Garments that God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his own Prieſts; and his making an <hi>Ephod</hi> denotes, that he was reſolved to turn back upon the Tabernacle, and to have a Prieſt and an Houſe of his own; which was no ſooner effected, but (as if they were as naturally given to Faction, as to Luſt) all the laſcivious Saints and the wanton <hi>Satyrs,</hi> both He's and She's of the City and the Country round, went a Whoreing to it; <hi>But this</hi> (as it there follows) <hi>became a ſnare</hi> (an evil) <hi>to Gideon and to his houſe,</hi> and was (as ſome conceive) the provoking cauſe why God ſuffered the Sons of the ſaid <hi>Gideon</hi> to be ſlain in the ſelf ſame City, where this <hi>Ephod</hi> had its entertainment. The like we read of <hi>Judah, that they did evil in the ſight of the Lord</hi>; nay, <hi>they provoked him above all that their Fathers had done, for they built them High-places and Groves</hi> (1 Kings 14.22.); not contented with the places erected for them (ſuch at that time were the Temple, the Synagogues, the Sanctuaries of the Land) they would have Places of their own, High-places and Groves; where the fault (as I conceive)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64778:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was not, becauſe a Place of Worſhip was erected, for that Land was accounted unclean which had no Sacred place in it (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.19.); nor becauſe they were built on High, for the Temple was ſo, if not the Synagogues too (<hi>Prov.</hi> 8.2.); nor becauſe near unto or within a Grove, for the Sanctuaries were ſo (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.26.); nor altogether becauſe polluted with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for (as <hi>Menochius</hi> obſerves) many of them (thoſe eſpecially in the Land of <hi>Judah</hi>) had little elſe in them but the Service of the Temple. So that the Evil (ſo much cryed out upon) muſt be centred in this, and in this mainly, that they (not God, or their Governors for them, but they) for themſelves built to themſelves places of Worſhip, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Sanctions and decrees of their guides and Governours they would ſerve the Lord. The next thing to be proved upon them is,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this <hi>Micah</hi>'s Houſe and Worſhip is an Evil to be enquired into by the King, and the Judges of the Land; ſuch an Evil as is fit only for thoſe days when there was no King; and therefore if there be a King in the Land, there ought to be no ſuch Evil there. Thus it is added amongſt many other the good deeds of <hi>Jehoſophat,</hi> and as no ſmall commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to his Reign, that he took away the High-places and Groves out of <hi>Judah</hi> (2 Chron. 17.6.); but charged to the account of <hi>Aſa</hi> his Predeceſſor (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.14.) that though <hi>his heart was perfect with the Lord,</hi> and though otherwiſe he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, <hi>yet he ſuffered the High-places,</hi> (thoſe Aſſemblies and Meeting-places of Faction, Sedition, Contradiction) to remain in the Land: He otherwiſe did that which was right; intimating that he had done much better and more like a King,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64778:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if he had put down thoſe ſupernumerary and by-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of worſhip, and reduced the Service of God unto the Temple, which was the place of Gods own chuſing. And doubtleſs if it be an unexceptionable prerogative of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to have the ſame power from God as the godly Princes in Scripture had (and as our Church aſſerts;) it will inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow, that they muſt have the ſame power to reſtrain and ſuppreſs the irregular conventions of the Land, as the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> had, theſe being (ſome of them) the very beſt of Kings that the Scripture makes mention of; and upon that account ſo far to be eſteemed from doing evil thereby, or being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves irreligious for doing it, or indeed from having it done by others their Judges and Officers, as that God doth highly own and applaud the action, and will one day Crown them (both principal and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) with a reward for it. The laſt thing prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon them is</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That when no care is taken of this Houſe of <hi>Micah,</hi> or of the Ephod and the Teraphim therein, it is uſually the mother Evil of the Land; the Shore, the Chanel into all which the naſty, loathſome draughts of the Land empty themſelves. Is there any in diſtreſs, in debt, discontented? hither (as they did to <hi>David,</hi> hoping to be armed againſt their Soveraign) they all fly: Men ever ready at their Quiver and their Bow, reſolv'd to be gratified with the prey they aim at, or otherwiſe to prey upon their Prince, at leaſt to make Scepters and Crowns ſtoop unto their ambition and humour. <hi>What is the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of Iſrael</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Mic.</hi> 1.5.)? <hi>Is it not Samaria,</hi> the Schiſmatical Temple there? <hi>And what are the high places of Judah, are they not Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:64778:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Schiſmatical houſes there? Certainly theſe were the forges wherein all the Weapons of our late War were form'd; theſe the Cabals wherein the Leagues, the Covenants, the Aſſociations were fram'd; theſe the Chappels that Conſecrate all Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſions, Treaſons, Conſpiracies into holineſs to the Lord: the erecting and keeping up of which, was thought a fitting project for rebellious <hi>Jeroboam</hi> (that diſgrac'd, diſguſted Officer) to keep up the Faction he had raiſed, <hi>Jeroboam</hi>! that ſon of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who taught <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin: <hi>For</hi> (ſays he, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.27.) <hi>if this people go up to do Sacrifice in the houſe of the Lord, then ſhall the heart of this people turn again to Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am their</hi> Lawful <hi>King; whereupon he made him two Calves</hi> (two Teraphims) and Conſecrated Prieſts thereunto, and ſaid, <hi>it is too much for you to go up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeruſalem, behold your gods</hi> (or your houſe of gods) <hi>O Iſrael.</hi> Places eminent at home as well as abroad for Faction and Sedition, and upon known record for being enemies to Kings and Princes. You may talk of foreign Seminaries and Jeſuitical Societies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly eſteem them the Peſts and the bane of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (Sodalities erected on purpoſe to confront Kings, diſturb peace, and confound Government;) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, a Conventicle at home, or in the City of <hi>Ophra</hi> is as bad; nay conſidering the Principles they manage (every way as pernicious to Government and to the welfare of the land, as any Jeſuits Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in the world; <hi>Doway</hi> or St. <hi>Omers</hi> have not been more fatal to us than <hi>Micah</hi>'s houſe or <hi>Gideon</hi>'s City; I ſpeak not this to excuſe the Jeſuite or his Faction, but to alarm and caution all good Chriſtians and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects againſt ſuch places and perſons, and their (as they would have us formidably believe) invincible

I am not ignorant that there are other enormities whereunto my Text (as afterwards reiterated) bears a relation, and whereupon I might ſeaſonably animadvert; for (<hi>ch.</hi> 18.) there is Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary, Felony, Sacriledge; (<hi>ch.</hi> 19.) there are Riots, Rapes, Adultery, Murder; (<hi>ch.</hi> 20.) there is Civil war, a great deal of Bloudſhed, Firing of Cities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable depopulation of all that comes to hand; (<hi>ch.</hi> 21.) there is Spiriting of Women, enforced and unlawful marriages, (enough for the charge of a Judge, or the Inqueſt of a Jury;) and all this for want of a Judge to puniſh and reſtrain them: But theſe are matters of daily infliction, it is <hi>Micah</hi> and his houſe that is moſt apt to eſcape and be pitied. And hence you may obſerve how forward the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were to blame, yea, to revenge the outrage committed on the <hi>Levite</hi>'s Concubine, The like (ſay they) was never ſeen in <hi>Iſrael</hi>; nay, they were for the exciſion of a whole Tribe to expiate it; But as for this <hi>Micah</hi> and his houſe, no man ſaid a word againſt it, but paſſed it over as if it had not been an evil in <hi>Iſrael</hi>; though as injurious to God, and as prejudicial to Society as any other evil of the land can be, and indeed is the motive why I would have you ſo earneſtly to fix your eye upon it: Nay, I am prone to think, that though you ſhould rout the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64778:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whole Confederacy beſides, yet if you let this eſcape (with a Touch me not, for I am holier than thou) there will never be want of work for the Judges, nor the worſt of their Executioners, as long as the world endures. I confeſs their is another ſort of men among us, not altogether of <hi>Micah</hi>'s houſe, but of <hi>Micah</hi>'s principles and acquaintance, perfidious, falſe-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conformiſts; <hi>Men that can gorge themſelves upon the fat of the Altar, and yet for a fuller meal let out their barns to a Conventicle, and their Vicarages to the Preachers of them</hi>; that can with the Apoſtate Apoſtle take the Sop (the maintenance of the Church) from the hands of Chriſt, and yet at the ſame time have it in their hearts to betray him; known by their Liſping to be <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>; Men that have the <hi>lingua</hi> and holy dialect of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but withal an accent, a <hi>Sibboleth</hi> and twang of their own; who <hi>BLOOD</hi>-like take to themſelves the Prieſts habit, but upon no other deſign (nor for no other end) than to ſteal away the Crown: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Church-men in ſhew, but downright Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners to the Faction; dealing through their Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practices and deceitful behaviour with the poor Church their Mother, as the Prieſt did (<hi>ch.</hi> 19.) by his abuſed Concubine, hew her to pieces (limb from limb, bone from bone) and then ſend them to all the Tribes (the ſeveral parties and factions of the land) to make Proteſtants of them. This is alſo an evil in the Land, and if not looked after and reſtrained (how right ſoever it be in ſome mens eyes) they'l ſoon fill <hi>Micah</hi>'s houſe with their neighbourhood, and in a little while more turn Prieſts themſelves unto him. I might be as long winded in the cauſe as one of <hi>Micah</hi>'s Prieſts, but my time and your buſineſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids. However</p>

                  <p>IT hath been obſerved by no inconſiderable, nor unconſidering Man among us, That the firſt Authors and Beginners of the grand Miſchiefs and Diſorders among Men, have been ever as to their Perſons remarkably puniſhed in this Life; and I think I may (without preſumption) add, that as to their Memories they have no leſs been ſtigmatized to Poſterity for ever after. And this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently appears in the inſtance of the three great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners afore us (the firſt Publick Mutineers againſt Kingſhip and Prieſthood that we meet with in the world) <hi>Korah</hi> the Author and Leader, <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> his Seconds and Followers; the one a diſſatisfied aſpiring <hi>Levite,</hi> the other diſobliged diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted <hi>Reubenites.</hi> A ſin perhaps not ſo timely born into the world as ſome other ſins, but every way as luſcious and pleaſing to ſome ſort of Men; nay, as taking and as likely to laſt and to abide in the world as any one ſin, that the Scripture hath any where took notice of, or the great God at any time puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64778:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a ſin attended with the greateſt proſecution of vengeance from Heaven, and charged upon the Memories and Names of the Acters thereof with the greateſt and moſt durable marks of infamy. An argument certainly, that how ſweet and palatable, how popular and plauſible a thing ſoever Rebellion and Sedition may ſeem to be, yet they muſt be crimes highly diſpleaſing to Almighty God, ever to be ſhun'd and hated by the Sons of Men as very great Enormities; ſo great and ſo deteſtable, that they are not to be thought on without abhorrence, nor men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned without diſguſt and diſgrace. We have the whole ſtory of the matter in the Sixteenth of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> at the beginning of the thirty eighth Lecture of the Law, which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> entitle <hi>Korah,</hi> becauſe the Mutiny and Rebellion, wherein this <hi>Korah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> were engaged, is the principal and moſt remarkable matter there treated of. We meet with them again in my Text, then in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> then in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and ſo on to the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> but never without their ſin and their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment annexed; God being unwilling that ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and notorious Malefactors ſhould be had in remembrance without Dirt and Infamy to attend them: that which brings them upon the Stage here, is the muſter that was made for the diſtributing the Land among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whereunto they were now got; a time certainly to take notice of Rebels and of Schiſmaticks in, yea, and of their Poſterity too (if the earth hath not ſwallowed them up, or they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented them of their fathers ſins) leſt too much of the Land be given them, and they put into a capacity to rebel and to mutiny again: in this muſter the preference is given to the Tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64778:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Firſt-born of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and among other the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants thereof <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> are found; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a ſtop is put, and the muſter not ſuffered to go on, till their Names and Villanies are enrolled for a Sign and Memorial to all after Ages, (to the <hi>Reube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> from whom they deſcended in particular, to the whole Nation of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed in general) thereby hanging them up in <hi>Effigie,</hi> though otherwiſe deſtroyed, and leaving them to be pointed at by all that ſurvive or come after (ſo odious muſt Schiſm and Rebellion for ever be) with a <hi>This is that Dathan and Abiram, who ſtrove againſt Moſes and againſt Aaron in the Company of Korah, when they ſtrove againſt the Lord.</hi>

Though of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as bloody as <hi>Cain,</hi> as impoſing as <hi>Nimrod,</hi> as Sanctimoniouſly wicked as <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and altogether as reſolved to follow their ſteps and ways (to the dethroning of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the unprieſting of <hi>Aaron)</hi>; yet the gaping earth is not more horrid and ſcaring than the mouth of the Prieſt when opened upon them; they love to act, but they hate to hear, and though none more deſpicable to them than the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> when diſtant, and apart; yet an Army of Banners is not more terrible than the meaneſt of them, when got into his <hi>Ebal,</hi> or begirt with his linnen Ephod, he thunders out his Anathemas and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt them. Wherefore ſince it is my Task to day (if not to preach) at leaſt to point with my finger, it were folly in me to expect much kinder uſage (provided they be the inflicters) than what the earth and the fire afforded, even to be ſwallowed up and conſumed by them; eſpecially when there are ſo many undevoured <hi>Dathans</hi> and <hi>Abirams</hi> in the land, yea, and ſo many of their ſons too, who, inſtead of repenting them of their fathers ſins, go on in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ways. Hence their Cenſures and their Cenſers: their Cenſures to defame and bely our Perſons; their Cenſers to confront and diſturb our Office: However when the Muſter's made, theſe are to be made a ſign. Look we therefore</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Into the nature of their Crime; <hi>They ſtrove againſt Moſes and againſt Aaron</hi>; againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> their

King, againſt <hi>Aaron</hi> their Prieſt; perſons nominated and appointed by God himſelf to be their Leaders and Governours; The one as to their concerns in State; The other as to their concerns in Religion, yet at all times envy'd and accounted the worſt of men, no better than <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s wild beaſt, that muſt be hunted down, and at length made a Prey to the Leaders of them, <hi>men famous in the Congregation.</hi> Hitherto (ſay the <hi>Jews</hi>) all Dominion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the very days of <hi>Adam</hi> (to whom it was firſt given) had gone along with the firſt-born; whoſe Priviledges, Pre-eminences, Prerogatives the Law declareth to be very great, in that they were peculiarly given and conſecrated to God, <hi>(Exod.</hi> 22.29.) were next in honour to their parents, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 49.3.) had a double portion of their fathers goods, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 21.17.) ſucceeded them in the government of the family or kingdom, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.3.) and in the adminiſtration of the Prieſt-hood and ſervice of God, (<hi>Num.</hi> 8.17.) Neither was ever any of them (for ought that I can find) diſſeiz'd of that his right, but by ſpecial appointment from God, and only for ſome greater faults, as in the caſe of <hi>Reuben</hi> (from whoſe loins this our <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> deſcended); but was not to excel, becauſe he went up to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bed (<hi>Gen.</hi> 49.3, 4.). And thus it continued till ſuch time that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to be led out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> by the hands of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> (where they had been captives and ſlaves) to be a Nation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to have a land of their own to dwell in; for the better accompliſhment whereof the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given by God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prieſthood to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, adding the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> to them (whereof this <hi>Korah</hi> was one) to be aiding
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64778:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to them in all their miniſtrations (<hi>Num.</hi> 8.18.); and this I take to be the firſt occaſion of the Mutiny and Inſurrection here made. However let not private perſons (though as Sacred in their function as <hi>Korah,</hi> as great in their places as <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi>) here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon preſume to diſpoſe of birth-rights, or diſplace either Mitre or Crown; ſuch things are not to be touch'd, much leſs transferr'd, but by the ſpecial appointment of God. Nay, had <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> of themſelves attempted the diſlocation and change, and without immediate authority from above, they muſt have made themſelves criminals, and been every way as liable to puniſhment for ſtriving againſt the firſt-born to diſpoſſeſs them of their wonted birth-right, as this <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> afterwards were, when they ſtrove againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and againſt <hi>Aaron,</hi> to diſpoſſeſs the firſt of his Diadem, the ſecond of his Ephod, after God had ſo viſibly eſtabliſhed the one and the other upon them: Nothing but heaven (and by a voice of its own, thundring as it did from mount <hi>Sinai</hi>) can make ſuch an undertaking innocent. Wherefore for Subjects to beleaguer and beſet their King, as if like <hi>Moſes</hi> he were fitter to be wrapt up in Bulruſhes and thrown into the Sea, than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd upon his Throne; for them to Combine and Conſpire not only againſt his Servants (to ſtone and abuſe them) but againſt his Heir to ſeize his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance and deprive him of his Birth-right, with a <hi>Come, This is the heir, let us kill him, and take the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance to our ſelves</hi>; for them over and above, not only to defie and ſupplant the High-Prieſt and his Sons, but the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> (howbeit they have reconciled themſelves by their after Zeal) as if they were ſtill to endure the firſt curſe, and to be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

a new in Jacob, and ſcattered afreſh in Iſrael</hi>; doubtleſs it muſt be a ſin ſo tranſcendently ſinful and provoking to God (who hath ſet them up and owns them) that both his Heaven and his Earth muſt be too hot, the one to bear, the other to receive them. Nay, what can ſuch ſinners expect, ſince they have been ſo induſtrious to divide the Earth, and make Schiſms among the inhabitants thereof, but that the Earth in return ſhould divide and open upon them? what can they hope for but as they have been the Incendiaries among men, and ſet the Earth on fire (ever delighting like ſo many <hi>Salamanders</hi> to dwell in the flames) but that they ſhould live and die in the ſaid flames? why ſhould not their Periſhings as well as their Gainſayings be the ſame with <hi>Korahs</hi>? or why ſhould they not down to the Gulph with <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> when (whilſt living) they would have no Tents but theirs? ſuch another Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal we read of (<hi>Mark</hi> 15.7.) <hi>who for the Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection by him made, and the Murder thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> was caſt into Priſon and bound for Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet you ſhall find that when it was moved by <hi>Pilate</hi> whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> or He ſhould ſuffer, the People as one (well wiſhers all to the proceedings of the man) cried out, <hi>not Barabbas but Jeſus</hi>: and I am very apt to think, that if it were left unto the People ſtill to give their Vogue who are the ſinners of the Day (ſo poiſoned have they been of late) that it would not be <hi>Dathan</hi> nor <hi>Abiram,</hi> no nor any of the Sons of <hi>Korah</hi> (all, and every one of them God wot are Holy, <hi>Ignoramusly</hi> Holy) but <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> (Gods King and Gods Prieſt) that would be brought in for Guilty.

However he took, and he took, till he had took ſome of the chief Princes of the Land; no leſs than Two Hundred and Fifty of them that were within the walls of the Senate, <hi>Princes of the Aſſembly</hi> (Numb. 16.2.), more (as it may be preſumed) infinitely more, in and among the Families and Tribes whom they repreſented, and for whom they ſerved; queſtionleſs being <hi>Men of renown</hi> and name, they could not be without a Faction to cry them up, and (if need were) to follow them: neither indeed durſt they have been ſo bold and daring, in the very <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ſat, had they not had, and been ſecured of an intereſt ſuitable to their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and deſigns. However I cannot but remark, that they were all (every one of them) of the Company of <hi>Korah</hi>; Men addicted to Separation and Faction, having Tents, <hi>Conventicles, Levites</hi> of their own, in oppoſition to <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Tabernacle, and the Prieſthood of God. And therefore you ſhall find, that though the Cenſer and the burning of incenſe properly belonged to the Prieſt and to his Office (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.18.); yet there was not one of thoſe Factious Princes but had a Cenſer belonging to him, Two hundred and fifty Cenſers, for the Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Princes: (<hi>Numb.</hi> 16.18.); and I am apt to think, that if ever a Rebellion be kindled again in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it muſt be by ſuch Separatiſts, and through the Fire of their Cenſers.

brother to <hi>Amram</hi> their father (<hi>Exod.</hi> 6.18.); A <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi> of the family of the <hi>Kohathites,</hi> to whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed the charge of the moſt holy things within the Sanctuary, and the chiefeſt place next unto <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Prieſts about it (<hi>Num.</hi> 3.19.31.), which one would have thought might have been preferment enough for the man: But becauſe the firſt-born of <hi>Izhar,</hi> and moreover Couſin German to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who then had the power and the government in their hands, he thought his birth-right and blood might have been better conſider'd, at leaſt ſo far forth as not to have had himſelf and his family thruſt down for ever into the rank and claſs of ordinary petty <hi>Levites</hi>; much leſs to have <hi>Elizaphan</hi> the ſon of the youngeſt family of the <hi>Kohathites,</hi> made Prince over the ſons of <hi>Kohath,</hi> even over this very <hi>Korah</hi> who was of the elder houſe, and himſelf in the <hi>interim</hi> neglected (<hi>Num.</hi> 3.10.): all which put together raiſed his indignation and ſpleen, and ſet him firſt againſt his King, and then againſt his Prieſt (who ſhould not have degraded, if they had not preferr'd him) and was the firſt occaſion (as the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins ſay) that caus'd him to take men. Of the like nature was the diſguſt that <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> had taken; for they were of the poſterity of <hi>Reuben, (Num.</hi> 16.1.) <hi>who was the firſt-born of Iſrael (Gen.</hi> 49.3.), <hi>but foraſmuch as he defiled his fathers bed, his birth-right was given from him,</hi> (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.1.), that is to ſay, the Government to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prieſthood to <hi>Aaron,</hi> the double portion to <hi>Joſeph</hi>; all loſt in <hi>Reuben</hi>: but by his ſons ſought to be recovered, which was the occaſion alſo of their taking men, and joyning themſelves with <hi>Korah</hi>; hoping by him and his Company, to re-enſtate themſelves and their

poſterity into that Power and dignity (that Empire, Prieſthood, Eſtate) that originally and of old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd unto them. And I am apt to think, that if all after-Mutinyings and Rebellions were look'd into, (yea, that of this very day) the like diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, diſguſts, degradations would be found at the bottom of them all. But Rebellion hath always a mask and vizard, a <hi>Samuel</hi>'s mantle to cover its ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; Look we therefore</p>

Into the reaſon pretended, and ſpread abroad to draw in the populacy after them; which was Uſurpation in <hi>Aaron,</hi> Tyranny and breach of truſt in <hi>Moſes</hi>: the popular and uſual pretence that hunts down government, and gives birth and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all manner of anti-regal, anti-prieſtly facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and perhaps hath cauſed more Properties to be alter'd, more Birth-rights to be loſt, more Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be invaded, more Religion to be defaced, yea, and more Arbitrarineſs and Tyranny to be ſet up and exerciſed in the world, than any one thing elſe beſides. Hence ſays <hi>Korah</hi> to <hi>Aaron</hi> in behalf of himſelf and his Company, <hi>you take too much upon you, ſeeing all the congregation is holy, and the Lord is among them (Num.</hi> 16.3.); and hence again, <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> with their company in reference to <hi>Moſes, Is it a ſmall thing that thou haſt brought us out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderneſs, unleſs thou make thy ſelf Altogether a Prince over us,</hi> a Prince abſolute and uncontrolable (<hi>Num.</hi> 16.13.), which if either of them be your deſign, (of you <hi>Aaron</hi> to appropriate the Prieſthood, or of you <hi>Moſes</hi> to engroſs the Government to your ſelves) then farefall <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Kingdom; may <hi>Aegypt</hi>

have us before <hi>Canaan,</hi> the land of thraldom before the land of promiſe; if we muſt be ſlaves and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized over, then to our furnaces again, where we had Patriarchs to govern us, and Prieſts of our own to rule us; where as we were ſlaves to others, we were Princes our ſelves. And how of late did the like, but falſe, pretenſions prevail with, and befool us? whither did the out-cries of an Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of a proud and uſurping Prieſthood hurry us? As for the Church, her Beauty was defaced to have her Purity reſtored; they prophan'd her Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, plunder'd her Revenues, deſtroy'd her Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, poiſoned her Proſelytes with a thouſand follies and phrenſies (call'd indeed New Lights, but the black Enthuſiaſms of the Prince of darkneſs) and all to reform her; ſo they murdered the beſt of Kings for the good of Subjects; wrung the Scepter out of his hand, and tore the Crown from his head to make him a great and a glorious Prince; ſo were we ſlaves to our own ſlaves, a company of <hi>Tagaroons</hi> hired with our purſes to command our perſons, and whatever elſe was ours; many were no better than Servants, and Priſoners in their own homes, than Tenents and Farmers to their own eſtates, and this to preſerve the Rights and Liberties of the good People of <hi>England,</hi> the right forſooth of Plundering, Oppreſſing, Murdering. But for my part I wonder, that the good people of <hi>England</hi> did not all as one man riſe up in rage, and ſtone thoſe notorious impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Impoſtors, who ſo long abuſed their credulity, cheating them of their goods, and inthralling their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and (as much as in them lay) damning their Souls; I wonder (I ſay) that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation ſhould be ſo diſpirited and creſt-faln (as like <hi>Izzachars</hi>

Aſs) to be daily loaden with blows and burdens, and tamely to couch under them; that they ſhould be ſo ſtupid and inſenſible, of ſuch intolerable wrongs, and oppreſſions; but more, that any of us all (after ſuch ſad and woful Tragedies acted) ſhould be for the Furnace and Thraldom of <hi>Aegypt</hi> again; ever any more doat upon the holineſs of the Party, or the ſweet Song that the <hi>Syren</hi> makes. And ſo having conſidered the Motives, that induced them to the Conſpiracy, look we into,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Judgment paſſed upon it, <hi>This is that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and Abiram, who ſtrove againſt Moſes and againſt Aaron, when they ſtrove againſt the Lord</hi>; in ſhew no more than a ſtriving againſt them, but by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and in guilt, a <hi>ſtriving againſt the Lord.</hi> The iniquity whereof appears,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that it was a ſtriving againſt his right and power, to make an eſtabliſhment among them; as if the ſetting up of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> over them (the one in the Government, the other in the Prieſthood) had been an invaſion upon the peoples right, and not in the power of any, no, not of the great God himſelf to do it: which oppoſition (in as much as it was againſt the decrees of Heaven) is ſaid (in my Text) <hi>to be ſtriving againſt the Lord,</hi> and (<hi>Numb.</hi> 16.11.) to be <hi>a gathering together againſt the Lord.</hi> Thus when the people grew weary of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and threw off his Government, ſaith God in the caſe, <hi>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me</hi> (1 Sam. 8.7.), intimating, that the Government, in whoſe hands ſo ever regularly it be, is ſtill Gods; and that the ſtriving againſt, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64778:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of them that have it, is a ſtriving againſt and oppoſing of him; and will as ſeverely and ſurely be puniſhed, as if it were acted, or deſigned againſt his very Perſon and Throne. The like our bleſſed Saviour declares concerning his Miniſters, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me</hi> (Luke 10.16.); intimating, that he that caſts off, or riſes up againſt his Prieſt, doth in effect caſt off, and riſe up againſt God, whoſe Prieſt he is, and whoſe Prieſthood he exerciſes. And indeed it is not for Subjects to trouble themſelves about their Governours, whether Sacred or Civil, farther than to ſee that they be Gods off-spring, and are ſent by him; the reſt of their work is to obey and follow, yea, and with as much readineſs, regard, venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (if God be with them) as if the very Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were come down from Heaven among them. Now that <hi>Moſes</hi> was thus appointed (for we have ſpoken of <hi>Aaron</hi> before) is plain from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given him, which was firſt ſealed (<hi>Exod.</hi> 3.10.), afterwards ratified and confirm'd unto him <hi>(Exod.</hi> 4.) by a power to work Miracles, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing gainſayers, which was fully done, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Rod into a Serpent, and back into a Rod again; by making his hand Leprous, and then clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it of that Leproſie; by cauſing the water in the River to become blood upon the ground; though had there been neither Commiſſion at firſt, nor ratification afterwards, yet the works he had done, and the mighty deliverances, he had wrought for them (that eſpecially of raiſing them into a Nation by themſelves, when they were, and had been ſlaves to others) might have cauſed not only all the Tribes and Families, but all the firſt-born of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:64778:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to have ſurrendred their birth-rights, and become Subjects to him. The Government (thus transferr'd) was afterwards by a gift of the like nature, ſetled upon <hi>Joſhua,</hi> then upon the <hi>Judges,</hi> and then upon <hi>Kings,</hi> and at length appropriated, and entail'd, upon the Deſcendants and Line of <hi>David</hi> (2 Sam. 7.12.) which ſhews, that whatever alteration God is pleaſed to make, he is always pleaſed, with the thing called Succeſſion; for he ſetled his Prieſthood in it, afterwards the Government, and from thence never made nor ſuffered a deviation; and in truth is a moſt evident and plain demonſtration, that if God entails, none but God muſt cut off; and that every ſtriving afterwards againſt it, is <hi>a ſtriving againſt the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This <hi>ſtriving againſt Moſes and Aaron</hi> appears to be a <hi>ſtriving againſt the Lord,</hi> in that it was proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted againſt his declared reſolution to defend the eſtabliſhment he had made. One ſhould have thought, had they not been a Rebellious gain ſaying People indeed (a People, who like the Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> were reſolved to be too hard for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to die every one of them in the cauſe, rather than to give out) that the fire which broke out to conſume ſome of them, and the earth that opened its mouth to devour others of them, ſhould have enlightned the eyes, and ſtopt the mouths of all the ſurvivers of them from all after Murmurings. But no ſooner is the puniſhment over and they ſafe, but they grow as Mutinous as ever, enter upon new conſultations and freſh complaints; and thereupon gather themſelves the ſecond time together, and are a ſecond time puniſhed; a Plague from Heaven
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64778:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
devouring no leſs than <hi>Fourteen thouſand and ſeven hundred</hi> of them (<hi>verſe</hi> 49.); neither ſtay they here (ſo hard is it to put a ſtop to Faction), but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Miracle be further wrought for the particular vindication of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Prieſts, they'l die on, and ſtand the other and the other judgment; which in the laſt place was finiſhed and effected in the bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and bloſſoming of <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, amidſt the Rods of the ſeveral Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (laid by it) to confront and prove it; and becauſe it did ſo, (the other remaining ſapleſs and dry) it became a token againſt the Rebels, and ſo their Murmurings ended (<hi>Numb.</hi> 17.10.). And I am apt to think, that if ever a Mutiny or Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion be to be taken away, it muſt be by the budding and bloſſoming of <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod; for it was by <hi>Korah</hi> that the Faction began, and by his Company that it was carried on; and therefore by the Rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, it muſt be by <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Prieſts defeated. Hence ſaith God to <hi>Moſes</hi> (when he would have declined his office for want of an Aſſiſtant) <hi>Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know he can ſpeak well, and he ſhall be to thee inſtead of a mouth, and thou ſhalt be to him inſtead of a God</hi> (Exod. 4.16.) intimating, that if <hi>Moſes</hi> do but interpoſe, and by his Authority protect <hi>Aaron,</hi> to keep him ſafe in his Office and Duty that the Faction diſturb him not; <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Prieſts will do the like for <hi>Moſes,</hi> by Preaching up the Doctrine of Obedience, and upon all occaſions ſhewing the People, that they muſt <hi>be ſubject to Principalities and Powers,</hi> or elſe <hi>purchaſe to themſelves Damnation,</hi> and be thrown for ever, after <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> into the Fiery <hi>Aſſociation</hi> of Rebells. My Prayer therefore ſhall be, that the Rod (which hath been ſo long taken from <hi>Aaron,</hi> may be reſtored
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64778:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to him again; and when reſtored) that it may for ever bloſſom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit; and then I doubt not, but (as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the <hi>Iſralites,</hi> ſo) it will be to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>England,</hi> a laſting token againſt Rebels, and their Murmurings thereby be quite taken away. And ſo we paſs from their Crime,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To their Puniſhment; <hi>This is that Dathan and Abiram who ſtrove againſt Moſes and againſt Aaron</hi>; and who for their ſo ſtriving (as in the ſucceeding verſe) <hi>were ſent quick to deſtruction,</hi> and thereby made a Spectacle and ſign to all after Ages. To this judgment the Prophet hath reference, when praying againſt his enemies, he ſaith, <hi>Let them go down to Hell</hi> (Pſalm 55.15.); <hi>Now theſe things were our examples</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and were written for our admonition</hi>; that we remembring what was done by and upon theſe ſinners here, may take care of doing and becoming like them: every one of them (by the Sign and Spectacle they are made) Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Leſſion to all that come after, <gap reason="foreign">

And in order hereunto remark we,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:64778:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. That Sedition and Rebellion, are two ſuch ſins, that they deſervedly ſtain the memory of the engagers in them with perpetual Infamy, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; their Names muſt never after be mentioned without their Crimes; their Eſcutcheons muſt have their blot, their Arms a bar, their greatneſs an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; ſomething or other to make them infamous, for having once been famous. <hi>This, this is that Dathan and Abiram! This</hi> by way of contempt and diſgrace; <hi>This</hi> whom all Records muſt ſtigmatize, all <hi>Chronicles</hi> defame, all good men loath; <hi>This</hi> who if but caſually nam'd, muſt be ſpat at, ſpoke againſt, and made odious to Poſterity, for the crimes they have been guilty of. The like may every way be obſerved of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who for turning Rebel to his Lawful Soveraign, and for renouncing and caſting off the Prieſthood, and Service of the Temple, to become a King himſelf. And to have Service, and Prieſts of his own, (ſins ſcarce ever forgiven, but never in <hi>Hiſtory</hi> to be forgotten) is ſaid <hi>to have taught Iſrael to ſin</hi>; and for his ſo doing can never after be mentioned (though often and often in Scripture nam'd) without a record of that his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs affixt, with a <hi>This is that Jeroboam the ſon of Nebat, who taught Iſrael to ſin.</hi> Cuſtomary it was among the <hi>Jews,</hi> at the naming the name of <hi>Haman,</hi> to beat their fiſts upon the <hi>Planchers</hi> where they were, as if it had been upon <hi>Haman</hi>'s head; not willing that ſuch an enemy to Religion, and one that had deſerved ſo ill of it, ſhould have a naming among them, without a blow at the ſame time (if poſſible) to brain him. <hi>Now the reſt of the Acts of Zimri, and his Treaſon that he wrought, are they not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64778:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
written in the Chronicles of the Kings of Iſrael</hi> (1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 16.20.); ſuch ſort of ſinners muſt not off the ſtage and have their memories preſerved, unleſs it be to keep up their wickedneſs, and therewith their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, for an admonition to us that we be not in our generations like unto them. And wherefore then is it, O Son of <hi>Dathan</hi>! that thou canſt glory in thine or thy fathers ſhame? That thou canſt boaſt of the mutinies thou haſt made, of the battels thou haſt been engaged in, of the murders thou haſt therein committed? Doſt thou think that thoſe arms (thoſe Spears, which hang up as Trophies by thee of thy wickedneſs) do, or can give luſtre to thy name, or add any merit to thy family? Nay, canſt thou imagine, that thoſe ſinners upon whom the tower of <hi>Siloam</hi> fell, or rather thoſe ſinners whoſe limbs are yet upon the Tower, were ſinners above all other men? I tell you nay, <hi>but except you repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Remark we</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Sedition and Rebelion are two ſuch ſins, that God uſually puniſheth unto the third and fourth generation, unleſs by their poſterity they be repented of. Here you ſhall find the whole family of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> to be cut off; they and all that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd unto them, <hi>their wives, and their ſons, and their little children, (Num.</hi> 16.27.) Inſomuch that when the land was to be divided among the reſpective fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there was not one of the families either of <hi>Dathan</hi> or <hi>Abiram</hi> to be found (<hi>Num.</hi> 26.); which ſhews, that they all dyed with, for, or under their fathers ſins. Nay, look into the next Chapter, and you ſhall find the daughters of <hi>Zelophehad</hi> (though
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64778:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their father was dead) pleading for his inheritance, and uſing this for an argument why they ſhould not be overlook'd nor paſs'd by in the diviſion, becauſe though dead, yet he dyed in his own ſin and not in the company with <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram; Our father dyed in the wilderneſs, and he was not in the company of Korah, but dyed in his own ſin (v.</hi> 3.); intimating, that if he had been guilty of the Treaſon, or had been in the Conſpiaacy with thoſe Traitors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, his name had worthily been ſtruck out of the genealogy, and his poſterity juſtly diſinherited, and made objects of ſcorn, contempt and poverty to all after ages. The ſons indeed of <hi>Korah</hi> either were not ingag'd in, or at leaſt repented them of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſin; and therefore it is ſad (in the <hi>verſe</hi> ſave one ſucceeding my Text) <hi>that the children of Korah dyed not</hi>: nay, they not only ſurviv'd the deſolation, but they kept their office in <hi>Iſrael</hi>; for their genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy is reckoned, their poſterity appointed by <hi>David</hi> to be Singers in the houſe of the Lord, they had many Pſalms dedicated to them, of them came <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, and <hi>Heman</hi> who with his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring were ſingers (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.); and I dare ſay there is no man living who wiſheth well either to <hi>Moſes</hi> or to <hi>Aaron,</hi> that envies theirs or any other man's reconciliation or preferment. We know, and we deſire that the ſons integrity may expiate for their fathers ſedition, and their after Loyalty for all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Rebellions; <hi>there is joy in heaven</hi> (as our Saviour telleth us) <hi>over one ſinner that repenteth,</hi> and our trouble rather is, that there are not more, as great an appearance of them as ever march'd againſt their King, or quarrel'd their Prieſts: I ſhould then turn

my Sword into a Plough-ſhare, my Steleteuticks into Euges, my reproofs into Paeans; I would bleſs the day, and enter it not into my Rubrick (that perhaps may ſeem too bloody) but into my Calendar (which hath its <hi>atros</hi> as well as <hi>albos dies</hi>) that ever I ſaw ſuch a reformation; and inſtead of rearing up gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets with <hi>Haman,</hi> I would venture my life with <hi>Heſter</hi> (were my intereſt like hers) to lead ſuch <hi>Mordecaies</hi> to the King: but ſince I ſee, that the dog returns unto his vomit, and that not only the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have eaten ſowre grapes, but that their childrens teeth are ſet on edge by them,</hi> I hope it will not be amiſs to call unto ſuch to repent leſt the tower of <hi>Siloam</hi> fall alſo upon them, and they likewiſe periſh in the gain ſaying of <hi>Korah.</hi> For my part, had I been the ſon of a <hi>Korah,</hi> of a <hi>Dathan</hi> or <hi>Abiram,</hi> and had not repented me of my fathers ſins, yea, and given a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient demonſtration to the world of that my repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I ſhould dream of nothing but of murdered Biſhops and of martyr'd Kings, of <hi>Whitehal</hi> Scaffolds and of <hi>Edghill</hi> fights; <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> in their blood and armour would be all I ſhould ſee; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt miſerable Caitiff whom the earth hath not as yet ſwallowed, or whoſe limbs the juſtice of God hath not exalted to be a ſpectacle to Angels and men; I ſhould fanſie every corps I touch, would bleed; every grave I tread upon, would cry out like <hi>Abel</hi>'s againſt me; I ſhould conclude an hoſt of Loyaliſts and Churchmen always behind me, chace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to the judgment-ſeat to give an account of my actions; but how others do or can harden themſelves, unleſs they be their fathers own ſons in principles as in blood, I know not, may perhaps pity, but (I am
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64778:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
afraid) never reform. And yet verily there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men in the world who need none of this repentance; who have been neither enemies to their King nor oppoſers of their Prieſts; who in the heat of the mutiny have been neither Schiſmaticks with <hi>Korah,</hi> nor Rebels with <hi>Dathan</hi>; but <hi>fidi Achates,</hi> truſty and Loyal Subjects; good old <hi>Barzillai's,</hi> who are feign (God knows) to be content with their <hi>olim meminiſſe,</hi> their wounds and ſcars, and dy'd gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from <hi>Bozrah</hi>; the ſervices they have done, and the ſufferings they have undergone; yea, and others who following their fathers ſteps, have fought with beaſts at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ventur'd at the dens of Lyons, ſtood the ſhock of Schiſmatical envy and Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical fury; and whenever the records be ſearch'd, I wiſh their names and their merits may not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd. But and if this be that <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> or if theſe be the ſons of that <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> whoſe names are to be branded to all poſterity for their Schiſmatical rebellious doings, what ought to be done to thoſe that have been thus faithful and loyal, valiant and ſerviceable, ever ſtriving againſt the ſtrivers, and (as need requir'd) reſiſting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſters unto blood? Verily, Silver and Gold I have none, but what I have, give I heartily unto you; may the bleſſing therefore of <hi>Aaron</hi> and of his rod fall upon you, and follow you; may the King of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhurun</hi> (whoſe Champions and worthies you have been) with his oyl and his fatneſs reward you, and (when the day of account comes) may you never be found Rebels to your God, more than you have been unto your King.

                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:64778:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. That Sedition and Rebellion are two ſuch ſins that will deſtroy the whole fabrick of Government though never ſo well rear'd, and run it eftſoon into confuſion and ſlavery, if not timely and carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. They'l divide the houſe, and if the houſe be divided, truth it ſelf will tell us, that it cannot ſtand. Humanity will turn into cruelty, nature and friendſhip into Faction and fury; to kill one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will be called valour, to diſobey the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted loyalty; plain robbery and oppreſſion the beſt of zeal and Religion; the Sword (the bloody, heedleſs, devouring Sword) the only <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> of the Land. We ſhall ſoon ſee an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all order and Law, a confuſion in our duties both to God and man, and a Kingdom (which for its pleaſure may be a <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> for its Light a <hi>Goſhen,</hi> for its plenty a <hi>Canaan</hi>) chang'd into a <hi>Chaos,</hi> a worſer <hi>Chaos</hi> than that which the world came out of; for a word put an end to that (<hi>God ſpake, and the world was made,</hi> Pſalm 38.9.); nay, <hi>God divided the light from the darkneſs, and he called the light day, and the darkneſs he called night, and the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the Morning were the firſt Day</hi>: (Gen. 1.5.) But if theſe take place, Evening and Morning will be both alike, we may know their beginning, but never their ending; darkneſs and horror of darkneſs! till we our ſelves (if we be not careful) fall thereby into the pit of darkneſs. Wherefore let me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you (you who are this day to number the people, and to view the ſeveral inheritances among us, that there be no Mutineer nor Rebel in our Tribes or families.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:64778:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>To be careful and jealous in that your enquiry, that none ſuch paſs your Tribunal; much leſs go off from you with Ceremony and Complement (too cuſtomary a thing with ſome) as if you were lovers of their Nation, and would build them Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues. It is not their being an holy Congregation that will make them (when they are Seditious) Holy; neither will your puniſhing them be a ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people of the Lord. We live (you ſee) in an age full of Sedition and Conſpiracy, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our <hi>Moſes</hi> can well keep his Crown upon his head, nor our <hi>Aaron</hi> his Ephod upon his breaſt; the Seditious <hi>Levite</hi> on one hand, the Rebellious <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benite</hi> on the other, are ſo induſtriouſly concern'd in the undermining and ſupplanting them both, that if heaven interpoſe not to defend the one and to root out the other, both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Government muſt ſink and fall together. Wherefore to your reſpective Stations and Charge; and know</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Dathans</hi> Conſpiracy is ſtill on foot in the land, alive and alive like to be. The Cauſe (ſaith one of our late Regicides) lies in the boſom of Chriſt, and as ſure as Chriſt aroſe, the Cauſe will riſe again: I believe (ſaith another of them, no leſs Prophet than the former) that at long run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there is not a man that fears the Lord, will have any reaſon to be ſorrowful for engaging in the Cauſe; for though the Lord hath been pleaſed to let it be as it were the Sun-ſetting for a night, yet it will certainly ariſe next Morning very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64778:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
again. Neither was it (for ought that I cand find) ever thorowly brow-beaten, or hiſs'd off the ſtage; Theſe (ſaith the publiſhers of their death) all dy'd in the Faith; Saints who through Faith of the Goſpel have entered into reſt. Nay, who of the Company of them (eſpecially if they were famous either in the Aſſembly or in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation) ever went unto their graves (from that day to this) without an Herſe full of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Scutcheons, and Religious Labels? The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Juſt is bleſſed, precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints; enough to give credit to the worſt of Cauſes, and to draw all the Saints of the land after them: And yet (with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror be it ſpoken) ſome of them have had their bowels burnt alive, and went down into the earth like <hi>Dathan</hi>; others of them liv'd and dy'd in the company of <hi>Korah,</hi> and never repented them of their ſins though ſtained with the blood of the beſt of Kings, and the devouteſt of Prelates. Shall I re-mind you of what one of the <hi>Korathites</hi> ſtill living hath ſaid of himſelf? That he hath often ſearched into his heart whether he did lawfully engage in the late War againſt the King, or did well to encourage ſo many thouſands to it, and that he cannot as yet ſee that he was miſtaken in the Cauſe, neither dares he repent of it, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to do the ſame if it were to do again. And yet this man lives and repents him not; nay, hath his Company with him ſtill, to whom he preaches Sedition as of old, and with whom thouſands of the <hi>Dathanites</hi> and <hi>Abiramites</hi> of the land do Confederate; whereby you may ſee the ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64778:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and hopes of the Faction, and how the good <hi>Old Cauſe</hi> will go on, if God by his judgments, and the Magiſtrate by his care and ſeverity prevent it not. Awake and know,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Cauſe not only lives, but there are multitudes in the Land, ready fixt and prepar'd to carry it on: diſſatisfied <hi>Reubenites,</hi> who for their own, or their fathers ſins have loſt their offices, their honours, their birth-rights; and perhaps not a few of them neither even among the very Senators of the Land, who (by their having been there) gather hopes to recover the greatneſs they have loſt; at leaſt to make themſelves too great ever after to be cruſhed, or degraded again. But lodge they where they will, I will be bold to ſay, they are all of the Company of <hi>Korah,</hi> frequenters of his Tents, or lovers of his Company; let but his Conventions be ſearched, and you will find them all; <hi>for of this ſort are they which creep into houſes</hi> (2 Tim. 3.6.). However of ſuch pernicious influence they have been, that it will be difficult to ſay whether the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Powder once under the Senate, or the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles</hi> afterwards adjoyning, have been the moſt fitted and adapted to blow it up; or indeed whether <hi>Faux</hi> with his Dark Lanthorn and his Match in his hand, or theſe with their <hi>New lights</hi> and their white and black Caps on their heads, are the moſt likely to do the miſchief; pardon the expreſſion, but aſſuredly I my ſelf in my days of Curioſity, have heard ſuch dangerous Poſitions, ſuch Fiery concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch Flambeau Divinity vented in thoſe Aſſemblies, that I never read nor met with the like
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64778:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in <hi>Bellarmin, Mariana, Reynolds,</hi> nor the worſt of <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> Let the Pillar then ſtand for a laſting Monument, to inſtruct all that paſs by where the Fire (that conſumed the City and impoveriſhed the Nation) firſt began; but there are and have been of late ſo many incendiaries (Firers of the City and Country) for I look upon every <hi>Conventicler</hi> to be one, that if a Column were to be erected at every place where the Nation hath been enflam'd, we ſhould not have Purſe nor Piety enough to erect them. <hi>Habent &amp; Veſpae favos,</hi> It ſeems Waſps as well as Bees have got their hives; but if they be ſuffered to breed, and to plant new Colonies, the Hony of the Land will ſoon be eaten up, and the Bees that ſhould gather new deſtroy'd. Wherefore awake, awake, you <hi>Sampſons</hi> of the Age, (you men of Loyalty and of ſtrength) and know that the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins are upon you</hi>; think not that to Addreſs your ſelves to your King, to Congratulate his late pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is Loyalty enough; the better way in theſe times of Conſpiracy to expreſs it, will be to Addreſs your ſelves unto his buſineſs; to ſeize the Tents of <hi>Dathan,</hi> and to ſcatter the <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>Korah</hi>: for aſſuredly, if <hi>Korah</hi> hath his <hi>Company, Dathan</hi> will have his, and it ſhall not be long ere both of them <hi>take Men.</hi> May the God therefore of Peace, <hi>who ſtilleth the raging of the Sea, and the madneſs of the People,</hi> whoſe is the Kingdom and the Power, and who ſent his Son <hi>to reconcile the world unto himſelf,</hi> and each one therein unto the other, make us all <hi>to be of one mind and of one tongue; and through the aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit, to live in the true faith and fear of God, in humble Obedience to our King, in

brotherly love and Charity one to another,</hi> that there may be no more Schiſms nor Conſpiracies among us, but that we may (all and every one of us) <hi>obey them that have the rule over us, and ſubmit our ſelves to them who watch for our ſouls.</hi> To whom three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, one God, be aſcribed all Honour, Glory, Power, Adoration now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
