            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And they whiche here the worde of God with an earneſt and good hart, they holde it faſte, bryngynge forth fruyte in patience. Alſo Saint James deſcrybyng the expedient condition of chriſten prechers, and heuenly learning ſayth: who that among you is wyſe endued with connynge, lette hym ſhewe hys good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes out of a good conuerſation wyth ſoftenes of wyſedome. If ye haue ſower hatred and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryaunce amonge you in youre harte, wyll not ye reioyce, and be lyars agaynſt the truth? for thys is not the wyſdome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge from aboue, but earthly, beſtial and deuelyſh. Where as
<pb facs="tcp:1163:10"/>
is enmyte &amp; contention, there is inconſtancy and all noughty doyng. The wiſdom that deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth from God is fyrſte chaſte, and ſo peaſeable, mylde, treata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, full of mercy, and good fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, wythout any myſdemynge or dyſſymulatyon. Nowe to compare theſe fruites vnto the actes of theſe Lutheran facty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ye ſhall fynde a farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Wherefore ſeyng that by longe experyence I haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the faſhion, manner, and order of all ſtates among them, and was no ſmall whyle conuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaunt wyth thoſe whiche are of hyeſt reputation, both for theyr ſobernes of lyfe, and fame of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature: I haue thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the dyſcharge of my conſcience, and information of other, playnlye to ſhewe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytie

as I haue knowen, wyth out hatred of them or fauoure of any other perſons: which to performe I haue here compiled thys lytle proceſſe folowynge, vnder the forme of a breife dya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge. Wherein though ye ſhall rede ſome thynges ſo ſtraunge for the enormities of them, that diuers men, namelye the fauou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rers of theſe ſectes, wyll iudge them vnlykelye of trueth, and halfe impoſſyble to be vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong reſonable people endued wyth any wyſdom or learning: yet are they matter in dede, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge as ye ſhall ſee vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedlye declared. And be ye full aſſured that I reherſe not by a greate parte all the abuſes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfeſtlye knowen by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor ſo many as I could ſhew: whiche god wyllyng hereafter in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

A greate occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion why that many be ſo ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in fauorynge this Lutherane doctryne, is the vayne prayſes of much people commyng from thence, reportyng that there is ſo good order, ſuche charitable liberalitie, and euangelyke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, whiche is all to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe. And dyuers of ſuche tydyng cariers, leſt they might ſeme ignoraunte in a fewe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they frame theym ſelues wythoute ſhame, to lye in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye. It is harde for a renagate frere, a faytheleſſe apoſtata, a forlorne coopeman, a marchaun tes pre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyce, or an embaſſatours hoſtler, hauynge lytle learning, leſſe dyſcreſyon, ſmall deuocy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſcant a curteſy of wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: to make true reporte in

ſuch matters. And yet are ther of them which make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues full buſy, and are as redy to tell that they knowe not as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that they know, accordynge as they feale theyr affeccions deſpoſed whome they couet to pleaſe: by whiche meanes they attayne hye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations, made much of, &amp; ar called prety wyſe men &amp; proper perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many goodes bleſſynges vpon theyr hartes.

ſuche moderation that he was taken for a prophete of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them, and grew in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people dayly more and more.

Whereby within ſmall proceſſe of tyme, they toke ſuche a ſtomake, that the drede of God and man ſet aſyde, they aroſe vppe wyth open ſedicyon in dyuers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Germanye aboue the noumber of an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande perſannes, in ſuch a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faſſhion, that euerye man almooſte ſtoode in feare of hys lyfe. Wherfore M.

<pb facs="tcp:1163:23"/>
and daungerous diſplea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure of the prynces &amp; great men he wrote haſtelye a boke voyde of all Chryſten charitie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall compaſſion, agaynſte the ſayde commons or vpiandy ſhe people, ſo extremely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it would abhorre an he then hart to here or reade it, enforcynge euerye man wythoute anye reſpecte of pytie, to kyll and ſlee theym as houndes: of whome were my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerablye ſlayne in one place and another, aboue .iii. ſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perſons, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> reſydue beynge nowe a lyfe in farre greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery &amp; calamytie than euer they were afore. After thys fell a diſſention betwene M. Luther and Carolſtadius, aboute the Sacramente of the aultar. For Carolſtadius denyeth in it the bodelye preſence of Chriſte, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmynge
<pb facs="tcp:1163:23"/>
that when he ſpake theſe words: <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> he meant them of his owne cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porall bodye and not of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cramente: where as M.

Thys varyaunce endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge betwyxte them: dyuers forſoke M.

wyth fyſtes than with pacient arguments to trye their cauſe hadde they not bene ſondered. Notwithſtanding through fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the duke and other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyaunt frendes, M. Luther ſo preuayled agaynſt him that he was excommunicate: &amp; beyng a man of auncyent age, an olde preiſt newly maried, and ſome tyme archedeaken of Mytten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge, was fayne to leaue hys younge wyfe, and auoyde the domynyon of Saxony. After that he had wandred through dyuers cities and townes ſwa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dynge his opynion with ody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reporte, to the miniſhynge of M. Luthers fame: at laſte he cam to Scirich in Switzer lande, where he founde one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to hys execrable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petyte, named Swynglyus,
<pb facs="tcp:1163:24"/>
which was there an exceading ſetter forth of M. Luthers do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctryn. To whom as ſone as he had diſcloſed his deteſtable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſye agaynſt the bleſſed ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he gladly accepted hym, and in denyinge the corporall preſence of Chriſt, agreed both in one, ſauynge in this poynte they differed: where as Carol ſtadius ſayd that our ſaueour Chryſt ſpekyng theſe wordes: <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> meaned his cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porall preſence there ſyttynge with his diſciples at the table &amp; not in forme of bread: Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius affyrmed that they were not to be vnderſtanded lytte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye, but by a figure of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, ſo that <hi>eſt</hi> was taken for <hi>ſignificat,</hi> and theſe wordes of Chryſte, thys is my bodye, were as muche to ſaye, as this
<pb facs="tcp:1163:25"/>
ſygnifyeth my body. Of thys matter he wrote ſondry epiſtles to dyuers of his famylyar fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, gloryouſlye reioycing that he hadde founde oute the longe vnknowen true the, of ſo hyghe a myſterye: not by the occaſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Carolstadius (as he boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted) but through his own dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent readynge of Scripture, &amp; ſpecyally of Saynt Auguſtyns workes, whoe in verye dede is cleane contrary to his horryble hereſy. Neuertheleſſe many of M. Luthers adherentes aſſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted vnto hym, amonge whome the cheif was Oecolampadius: whiche beynge a ſeculer preiſte of .xl. yeares of age, entred the religion of ſaint Brygyttes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the prouince of Bauarye, and for hereſies that he hadde vttered both by preachyng and
<pb facs="tcp:1163:25"/>
wrytyng, ſtandinge in daunger of the Dukes attachiamente, he ranne awaye pryuylye wyth a nonne of the place, whome ſone after he forſoke, and gat him for refuge to a Lutheran Prynce named Fraunces de Sychken, a noble perſonnage by byrthe, but a cruell tyraunte of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueoure, a greate murtherer, a common ſpoiler of marchaunts and a rouere of hyghe wayes, whyche maynteyned hym and one Hutten a Knyghte of the newe Goſpel, geuen holy to miſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheife, tyll at the leaſt for fear of diſpleaſure of other prynces, he was driuen to put them away. Oecolampadius came then to Baſyl, and there he founde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye fauourers of M. Luthers faction: by whoſe ayde he was promoted to be curate of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhe

Where he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hys matters with ſuch clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hypocriſye, that he wanne many mennes hartes, craftely ſowynge ſedicious diſturbau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixte the temporalte &amp; the ſpiritualtye, in ſuch wyſe that the hole cytye was oftentimes in parell of inſurrection, and in daunger to be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>But thoughe he approued the oppynyon of Swinglius with preferrement aboue Carolſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius: yet conceiued he another pryuate vnderſtandynge, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> oughte thus to be interpreted: this is a fygure or a repreſentacyon of my bodye, allegyng Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liane, Chriſoſtome &amp; ſaynt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten for hys auctoritye, whom he vnderſtandeth a myſſe, and recyteth falſely, ſometyme ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
<pb facs="tcp:1163:26"/>
more to theyr wordes, ſometyme takynge away from theyr ſentences. In thys ſpace Martyn Luther wrote a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uycyous boke agaynſt Carol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadius, and he an aunſwere to the ſame of lyke ſpyryte, and ſemblable charyte, ſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius and his company whiles other menne wondred at theyr madneſſe, laughed them bothe to ſcorne. Carolſtadius percey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing that he was not ſo highly eſtemed as he reckened to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bene, alſoo longynge verye ſoore for the companye of hys yonge wyfe: at laſte he made meanes to be reconciled again to Martyn Luther and hys churche, which was graunted hym vpon condycyon that he ſhoulde reuoke his opinion of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſacrament, wherto he agreed
<pb facs="tcp:1163:27"/>
albeit he helde not longe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che with them. But as ſone as he had recouered his wyfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn, he gat him out of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> waye, into a vilage, &amp; there kept a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune tauerne, beſely vttryng his olde hereſyes. and dayly contryuynge newe.

Almaynes, that what ſo euer they be perſwaded vnto, agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to theyr affections, they ſhal be ready in a ſodeyn gyere to accomplyſh: regardyng no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daunger, nor commodite, though ſone after they repent theym. And lyke as the people of Iſrahell brought the iewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of theyr wyues &amp; chyldern to the makynge of the golden calfe: ſo dyd they brynge their iewelles, beades, rynges, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, with mony both gold and ſyluer, to the common hutches ſo haboundantly for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men doubted in ſome place, whether they had poore folke ſufficiente to conſume ſo excedynge heapes of ryches.</p>
               <p>But this dout was ſone made a playn caſe: for within a whyle after, the ardente heat of theyr

lyberall deuocion waxed cold. And becauſe they contynued not ſtyll in bryngynge in theyr oblations: the hutches and coffers were emptye ere men wyſt it. Then whyles it was compaſſed what waye myghte be beſte taken for the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ordynaunce, leaſte it ſhuld decaye, to theyr confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyon that began it: ſome gaue counſell that it ſhoulde be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarye to depryue the clergy of theyr goodes, and to dyſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute theyr poſſeſſions, landes, and rentes among lay people. And to throwe downe all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries &amp; churches, makyng coyne of croſſes, chaleſſes, and other ſacred iewels, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſuſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation of the poore as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged. This aduyſe with hole aſſent of certayne prynces and

               <p>In lyke maner by the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycy the comons mighte grow vnto ſuch welthye ſubſtaunce: that beggers and nedy people fewe or none ſhoulde be founde among them, whiche ought to be called a golden worlde, or a tyme of felicite. </p>
