            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For, as in War, where the King himself in Person, the Nobility, the rest of the Gentility, and the Yeomanry are, is the Force and Power of <hi>England</hi>; So in Peace and Consultation, where the Prince is to give Life, and the last and highest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; the Barony or Nobility for the higher, the Knights, Esquires, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Commons for the lower part of the Common-wealth; the Bishops for the Clergy, be present to advertise, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, and shew what is good and necessary for the Common-wealth, and to consult together; and upon mature deliberation, every Bill or Law being thrice read and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104240:4"/>
disputed upon in either House, the other two Parts, first each apart, and after the Prince himself, in presence of both the Parties, doth consent unto and alloweth. That is the Princes and whole Realms Deed; whereupon justly no man can complain, but must accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to find it good, and obey it.</p>
            <p>That which is done by this Consent is called firm, stable and <hi>sanctum,</hi> and is taken for Law. The Parliament abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth old Laws, maketh new, giveth order for things past, and for things hereafter to be followed, changeth Right and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions of private men, legitimateth Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards, establisheth Forms of Religion, altereth Weights and Measures, defineth of doubtful Rights, whereof is no Law already made, do appoint Subsidies, Talies, Taxes, and Impositions, giveth most free Pardons and Absolutions, restoreth in Blood and Name: as the highest Court, condemneth or absolveth them whom the Prince will put to Tryal: And to be short, all that ever the People of <hi>Rome</hi> might do, either <hi>Centuriatis Comitiis,</hi> or <hi>Tributis,</hi> the same may be done by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> which represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and hath the Power of the whole
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104240:4"/>
Realm, both the Head and Body. For every English-man is intended to be there present, either in Person, or by Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Atturney, of what Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, State, Dignity, or Quality soever he be, from the Prince, (be it King or Queen) to the lowest Person of <hi>England.</hi> And the Consent of the Parliament is taken to be every man's Consent.</p>
            <p>The Judges in Parliament are, the the King or Queen's Majesty, the Lords Temporal and Spiritual, the Commons, represented by the Knights and Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of every Shire and Burrough Town. These all, or the greater part of them, and that with the consent of the Prince for the time being, must agree to the making of Laws.</p>
            <p>The Officers in Parliament are the Speakers, two Clerks, the one for the Higher House, the other for the Lower, and Committees.</p>
            <p>The Speaker is he that doth commend and prefer the Bills exhibited into the Parliament, and is the Mouth of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. He is commonly appointed by the King or Queen, though accepted by the Assent of the House.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:104240:5"/>The Clerks are the Keepers of the Parliament-Rolls and Records, and of the Statutes made, and have the custody of the private Statutes not printed.</p>
            <p>The Committees are such as either the Lords in the higher House, or Burgesses in the lower House, do choose, to frame the Laws upon such Bills as are agreed upon, and afterward to be ratified by the same Houses.</p>

He sendeth also Writs to the Sheriffs of every Shire, to admonish the whole Shire to choose two Knights of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the name of the Shire, to hear, and reason, and to give their Advice and Consent in the name of the Shire; and to be present at that day: likewise to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City and Town, which of ancient time hath been wont to find Burgesses of the

               <p>These meeting at one day, the two who have the most of their voices, be chosen Knights of the Shire for that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: likewise by the plurality of the Voices of the Citizens and Burgesses, be the Burgesses elected. The first day of the Parliament, the Prince and all the Lords in their Robes of Parliament do meet in the higher House, where, after Prayers made, they that be present are written, and they that be absent, upon sickness, or some other reasonable cause (which the Prince will allow) do consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104240:8"/>
under their hand and Seal, some one of those who be present, as their Proxy or Atturney, to give Voice for them, so that by presence, or Atturney, and Proxy they be all there, all the Princes and Barons, and all Arch-Bishops and Bishops, and (when Abbots were) so many Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots as had Voice in Parliament. The place, where the assembly is, is richly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pessed and hanged, a Princely and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Throne, as appertaineth to a King, set in the midst of the higher place thereof. Next under the Prince sitteth the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, who is the Voyce and Oratour of the Prince. On the one side of that House or Chamber, sitteth the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops and Bishops, each in his rank, on the other side the Dukes and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.</p>
               <p>In the midst thereof, upon Wool-sacks, sitteth the Judges of the Realm, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Rolls, and the Secretaries of Estate; But these that sit on the Wool-sacks have no Voyce in the House, but only sit there to answer their knowledge in the Law, when they be asked, if any doubt arise among the Lords. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries do answer of such Letters or things passed in Council, whereof they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104240:9"/>
have the custody or knowledge; and this is called the Upper House, whose Consent and Dissent is given by each man severally, and by himself; first, for himself, and then severally, for so many as he hath Letters and Proxies, when it cometh to the question, saying only, Content, or not content, without farther reasoning or replying. In the mean time, the Knights of the Shires, and Burgesses of Parliament (for so they are called that have Voice in Parliament, and are chosen (as I have said before) to the number of about five hundred and ten) are called by such as it pleaseth the Prince to appoint, into another great House or Chamber, by name, to which they answer; and declaring for what Town or Shire they answer: then they are willed to choose an able and discreet man, to be as it were the Mouth of them all, and to speak for, and in the name of them, and to present him so chosen by them to the Prince: which done, they coming all with him to a Barr, which is at the nether end of the upper House, there he first praiseth the Prince, then maketh his excuse of Inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and prayeth the Prince that he would command the Commons to choose ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104240:9"/>
The Chancellour, in the Prince's name, doth so much declare him able, as he did declare himself unable, and thanketh the Commons for chusing so Wise, Discreet, and Eloquent a man, and willeth them to go and consult of Laws for the Common-wealth. Then the Speaker maketh certain Requests to the Prince in the Commons Name, First, that his Majesty would be content that they may use and enjoy all their Liberties and Priviledges that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons House was wont to enjoy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That they may frankly and freely say their minds, in disputing of such Matters as may come in question, and that without offence to His Majesty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If any should chance, of that Lower House, to offend, or not to do or say as should become him, or if any should offend any of them, being called to that his Highness Court, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves might (according to the ancient custom) have the punishment of them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That if there come any doubt, whereupon they shall desire to have the Advice of, or Conference with his Majesty, or with any of the Lords, they might do it; All which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104240:10"/>
in the Commons names, that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall not abuse, but have such regard as most faithful, true, and loving Subjects ought to have to their Prince.</p>
               <p>The Chancellour answereth in the Prince's name, as appertaineth. And this is all that is done for one day, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for two. Besides the Chancellour, there is one in the upper House, who is called Clerk of the Parliament, who rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Bills. For all that cometh in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation either in the upper House or in the nether House, is put in writing first in Paper, which being once read, he that will, riseth up and speaketh for it or against it: and so one after another, so long as they shall think good. That done, they go to another, and so another Bill. After it hath been once or twice read, and doth appear that it is somewhat liked as reasonable, with such amendment in Words, and peradventure some Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as by disputation seemeth to be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: in the upper House the Chancellour asketh, if they will have it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ingross'd, that is to say, put into Parchment: which done, and read the third time, and that eft-soons; if any be disposed to object or dispute again among them, the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104240:10"/>
asketh, if they will go to the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? and if they agree to go to the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then he saith, Here is such a Law or Act concerning such a matter, which hath been thrice read here in this House, are ye content that it be enacted or no? If the Not-contents be most, then the Bill is dashed, that is to say, the Law is annihilated, and goeth no farther. If the Contents be the most, then the Clerk writeth underneath; <hi>Soit baile aux com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so when they see time, they send such Bills as they have approved, by two or three of those which do sit on the Wool-sacks to the Commons: who, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Licence, and coming into the House, with due reverence saith to the Speaker: Master Speaker, my Lords of the upper House have passed among them, and think good, that there should be enacted by Parliament such an Act, and such an Act, and so readeth the Titles of that Act or Acts. They pray you to consider of them, and shew them your advice; which done, they go their way. They being gon, and the door again shut, the Speaker rehearseth to the House what they said. And if they be not busie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104240:11"/>
at that time another Bill, he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them straightway if they will have that Bill, or (if there be more) one of them.</p>
               <p>In like manner in the lower House, the Speaker, sitting in a Seat, or Chair for that purpose, somewhat higher, that he may see and be seen of them all, hath before him, in a lower Seat, his Clerk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who readeth such Bills as be first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the lower House, or be sent down from the Lords. For in that point each House hath equal Authority, to propound what they think meet, either for the abrogating of some Law made before, or for making of a new. All Bills be thrice in three divers days read and disputed upon, before they come to the question. In the disputing is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous good order used in the lower House. He that standeth up bare-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is to be understood, that he will speak to the Bill. If more stand up, who that is first judged to arise, is first heard; though the one do praise the Law, the other disswade it, yet there is no passionate reasonings. For every man speaketh as to the Speaker, not as one to another, for that is against the Order of the House. It
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104240:11"/>
is also taken against the Order, to name him whom ye do confute, but by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umlocution, as he that speaketh with the Bill, or he that spake against the Bill, and gave this and this reason. And so with perpetual Oration, not with intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discourse, he goeth through till he have made an end. He that once hath spoken in a Bill, though he be confuted straight, that day may not reply, no, though he would change his Opinion. So that to one Bill in one day, one may not in that House speak twice, or else one or two with cross disputation would spend all the time. The next day he may, but then also but once.</p>
               <p>No reviling or nipping words must be used. For then all the House will cry, it is against the Order: and if any speak unreverently or seditiously against the Prince, or the Privy-Council, I have seen them not only interrupted, but it hath been moved after to the House, and they have sent them to the Tower. So that in such a multitude, and in such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Minds and Opinions, there is the greatest Modesty and Temperance of Speech that can be used. Nevertheless, with very mild and gentle Terms, they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104240:12"/>
make their reasons as violent, and as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement the one against the other as they may ordinarily, except it be for urgent causes, and hasting of time. At the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon they keep no Parliament. The Speaker hath no voice in the House, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they will not suffer him to speak in any Bill to move or disswade it. But when any Bill is read, the Speakers Office is, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> briefly and as plainly as he may, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Effect thereof to the House. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Commons do assent to such Bills as be sent to them first agreed upon from the Lords, thus subscribed, <hi>Les Communs ont assentus,</hi> so if the Lords do agree to such Bills as be first agreed upon by the Commons, they send them down to the Speaker thus subscribed, <hi>Les Seigneurs ont assentus,</hi> If they cannot agree, the two Houses (for every Bill from whenceso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it doth come, is thrice read in each of the Houses) if it be understood that there is any sticking, sometimes the Lords to the Commons, sometimes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the Lords, do require that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of each house may meet together, and so each part to be informed of others meaning, and this is always granted. After which meeting, for the most part,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104240:12"/>
not always, either part agrees to others Bills.</p>
               <p>In the upper House they give their assent and dissent, each man severally, and by himself, first, for himself, and then for so many as he hath Proxy. When the Chancellour hath demanded of them, whether they will go to the question, after the Bill hath been thrice read, they saying only, Content or not content, without further reasoning or replying: and as the greater number doth agree, so it is agreed on, or dashed.</p>
               <p>In the lower House, none of them that is elected, either Knight or Burgess, can give his Voice to another, nor his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or dissent by Proxy. The major part of them that be present only maketh the consent or dissent. After the Bill hath been twice read, and then ingrossed, and est-soons read and disputed on enough as is thought, the Speaker asketh, if they will go to the question? and if they agree, he holdeth the Bill up in his hand and saith: As many as will have this Bill go forward, which is concerning such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, say yea. Then they which allow the Bill, cry Yea, and as many as will not, say No; as the cry of the yea or no is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104240:13"/>
bigger, so the Bill is allowed or dashed. If it be a doubt which cry is bigger, they divide the House, the Speaker saying, as many as do allow the Bill go down with the Bill, and as many as do not, sit still. So they divide themselves, and being so divided they are numbred who made the major part, and so the Bill doth pass. It chanceth sometime that some part of the Bill is allowed, some other part hath much controversie and doubt made of it: and it is thought if it were amended it would go forward. Then they choose certain <hi>Committees</hi> of them who have spoken for the Bill and against it, to amend it, and bring it again so amended, as they amongst them shall think meet: and this is before it is ingrossed, yea, and sometime after. But the agreement of these <hi>Committees</hi> is no prejudice to the House. For at the last question they will either accept it or dash it, as it shall seem good, notwithstanding that whatsoever the <hi>Committees</hi> have done.</p>
               <p>Thus no Bill is an Act of Parliament, Ordinance, or Edict of Law, untill both the Houses severally have agreed unto it after the order aforesaid; no nor then neither. But the last day of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104240:13"/>
or Session, the Prince cometh in Person in his Parliament Robes, and sitteth in his state: all the upper House sitteth about the Prince in their states and order, in their Robes. The Speaker, with all the Common House, cometh to the Bar, and there, after thanksgiving first in the Lords Name by the Chancellour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the Commons Name by the Speaker to the Prince, for that he hath so great care of the good Government of his People, and for calling them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to advise of such things as should be for the Reformation. Establishing, and Ornament of the Common-wealth: the Chancellour, in the Prince's Name, giveth thanks to the Lords and Commons for their pains and travels taken, which, he saith, the Prince will remember and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence when time and occasion shall serve, and that he for his part is ready to declare his Pleasure concerning their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, whereby the same may have perfect Life and Accomplishment by his Princely Authority, and so have the whole Consent of the Realm. Then one reads the Titles of every Act which hath passed at that Session, but only in this fashion: An Act concerning such a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104240:14"/>
thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is marked there what the Prince doth allow, and to such he saith, <hi>Le Roy,</hi> or <hi>la Royne le veult.</hi> And those be taken now as perfect Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and none other, and, as soon as may be, put in print, except it be some private Case, or Law, made for the benefit or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of some private man, which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were wont to call <hi>Privilegía.</hi> These be only exemplified under the Seal of the Parliament, and for the most part not printed. To those which the Prince liketh not, he answereth, <hi>Le Roy,</hi> or <hi>la Rayne sadvisera,</hi> and those be accounted utterly dashed, and of none effect.</p>
               <p>This is the order and form of the highest and most authentical Court of <hi>England,</hi> by vertue whereof all those things be established whereof I spake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and no other means accounted available to make any new forfeiture of Life, Member, or Lands of any <hi>English</hi> man, where there was no Law ordained for it before.</p>

               <p>If the Lords will alter a Bill, in that which may stand with the Bill, they may so do, without remanding to the Commons; as if the Commons grant
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104240:25"/>
Poundage for four years, and the Lords will grant it but for two years, this Bill shall not be carried back again to the Commons. But if the Commons grant it but for two years, and the Lords will grant for four years, there the Bill shall be delivered to the Commons; and in this case the Lords ought to make a Schedule of their Intention, or indorse the Bill in this manner; <hi>The Lords have assented for the term of four years.</hi> And when the Commons have the Bill again, and they will not assent to it, this can be no Act. But if the Commons will assent, then they indorse their Answer upon the Margent of the Bill beneath in such form; <hi>The Commons have assented</hi> to the Schedule of the Lords annex'd to the same Bill, and then it is delivered to the Clerk of Parliament, <hi>ut supra.</hi> 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
               <p>If a Bill be first delivered to the Lords, and they pass it, they use not to make any Indorsement, but send the Bill to the Commons, and if it pass them, the use is to indorse it thus, <hi>Les Commons sont Assentants,</hi> and this proves that it passed the Lords before: And therefore if <hi>J. S.</hi> be attainted of Trespass by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Commons assent, that if he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104240:25"/>
does not come in by such a day, he shall forfeit such a Sum, and the Lords give him a longer day, and the Bill is not sent back to the Commons again, this is no Act, for that the Bill was not delivered back to the Commons after the inlargement of the day given by the Lords. 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6.17.</p>
               <p>Every Bill that passes the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, shall have relation to the first day of Parliament, although it come in at the end of the Parliament, and it is not the custom to make any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what day the Bill was delivered in to the Parliament; <hi>per Faukes</hi> Clerk of the Parliament. 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 17. unless a time be specially appointed by the Statute when it shall Commence. Com. 79.</p>
               <p>If the Parliament begin before <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost,</hi> and continue after <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and the Commons agree to a Bill after <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi> and give a day at <hi>Pentecost</hi> next, and the Lords do so too; Now for that, a Bill shall have relation to the first day of Parliament, if it be not ordered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; it shall be taken for this <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi> which is passed at this Sessions,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104240:26"/>
whereas the intent of the Lords and Commons, was, that it should be <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost</hi> after this Petition named in the Bill. <hi>Parliament B.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Altho the Lords and Commons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to a Bill, yet it is no Act, till the King has given his Royal Assent to it in proper Person, or under his great Seal, and if the King Assent, then is written upon the Bill, <hi>Le Roy veult</hi>; And if the King will not Assent, then it is indorsed, <hi>Le Roy advisera.</hi> 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 17. 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>Every Knight, Burgess, Baron of the Cinque Ports, or other call'd to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, shall have priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during the Parliament, or Session of Parliament, so that he that arrests any of them during that time, shall be imprisoned in the <hi>Tower</hi> by the Lower House, of which he is, and shall be put to a Fine, and the Keeper also, if he will not deliver him so arrested, when the Serjeant at Arms comes for him, by the command of the House of which he is. <hi>Dier,</hi> 60.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> in the Lower House, when a Bill is read, the Speaker does open the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104240:26"/>
parts of the Bill, so that each Member of the House may understand the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of each part of the Bill; and the like is done by the Lord Chancellour in the Upper House; then when it is read the second time, sometimes it is ingrossed without any Commitment, but then the Speaker makes question of it, in this manner: The question is, <hi>Whether this Bill shall be ingrossed or not? As many as would have the Bill ingrossed, shall say, Yea, and as many as would not, say, No.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the Upper House of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when such question is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Ingrossing, if there be no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the Lords do not deliver their Assent in saying, <hi>Content,</hi> or their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in saying, <hi>Not Content,</hi> for hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding the time: But if there be any Contradiction, it is tried <hi>Seriatim,</hi> by <hi>Content</hi> or <hi>Not Content</hi>; but neither in the Upper or Lower House, the Lord Chancellour or Speaker, shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat a Bill or an Amendment but once. <hi>Ibidem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When a Bill is committed to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reading, then if the Committees
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104240:27"/>
amend it in any point, then they shall write down their amendment in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and shall direct to a Line, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what words the Amendment shall be put in, or what words shall be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined, and then all shall be ingrossed in a Bill. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if a Bill pass in the Commons House, and the Lords amend the Bill when it is sent to the Upper House, they do as before shew the Line, and between what words, and after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments are ingrossed, with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular References, and the Bill with the Amendments, are sent again to the House of Commons, where they affirm them: The amendments are read three times, and then they insert them in the body of the Bill, and so <hi>ê Converso</hi> of a Bill which passeth first in the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per House. But Note, that in one of these Cases, the intire Bill shall not be read again in the House, wherein they first pass, but the amendments only, for no Bill shall be read above three times. <hi>Ibidem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No Lord ought to speak to the Bill twice in one day: Also no Knight, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104240:27"/>
or Burgess, ought to speak above once to one Bill in one day, unless sometimes by way of Explication.</p>
               <p>No private Bill ought to be read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the publick Bills, unless the one House or the other do require it. <hi>Coke lib.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> in the House of Commons, those that are for the new Bill, (if there be a question of Voices) shall go out of the House, and those who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Bill, and for the Common Law, or any former Law, shall sit still in the House; for they are in possession of the old Law, the other of the other, to number the Voices. <hi>Coke, lib.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>In both Houses, he which first stands up to speak, he shall first speak without any difference of Persons. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When a Bill is ingrossed, at the third reading it may be amended in the same House in any matter of Substance <hi>à fortiori</hi>; the Errour of the Clerk in the Ingrossing may be amended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi>; The Priviledge, Order, or Custom of Parliament, either of the Upper House, or of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, belongs to the Determination or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104240:28"/>
Decision only of the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And this appeareth by two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Precedents.</p>
               <p>The one, at a Parliament holden the twenty seventh Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> There was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie moved in the Upper House, between the Earls of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> and of <hi>Devon-shire,</hi> for their Seats, Places, and Preheminencies of the same, to be had in the King's Presence, as well in the High Court of Parliament, as in his Counsels, and else-where: The King, by the advice of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, committed the same to certain Lords of Parliament, who, for that they had not leisure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the same, it pleased the King, by the advice of the Lords at this Parliament, in <hi>Anno</hi> 27<hi>th.</hi> of his Reign, that the Judges of the Land should hear, see, and examine the Title, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to report what they conceive herein: The Judges
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104240:28"/>
made Report as followeth; That this matter (<hi>viz.</hi> of Honour and Precedency, between the two Earls, Lords of Parliament) was a matter of Parliament, and belonged to the King's Highness, and the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by them to be decided and determined; yet being there so commanded, they shewed what they found upon Examination, and their Opinions thereupon.</p>
               <p>Another Parliament in 31 <hi>H.</hi> 6. which Parliament begun the sixth of <hi>March,</hi> and after it had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some time, it was prorogued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the fourteenth of <hi>February</hi>; and afterwards in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term, <hi>Anno</hi> 31 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Thomas Thorpe,</hi> the Speaker of the Commons House, at the Suit of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> was condemned in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> in 1000 <hi>l.</hi> damages for a Trespass done to him: The fourteenth of <hi>February,</hi> the Commons moved in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104240:29"/>
the Upper House, That their Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker might be set at liberty to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his Place: The Lords referred this Case to the Judges; and <hi>Forte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue</hi> and <hi>Prisot,</hi> the two Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, in the name of all the Judges, after sad Consideration, and mature Deliberation had amongst them, answered, and said, that they ought not to answer to this Question, for it hath not been used aforetime, That the Justices should in any wise determine the Priviledge of this High Court of Parliament, for it is so High and Mighty in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it may make Laws, and that that is Law, it may make no Law: And the determination and knowledge of that Priviledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Lords of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not to the Justices: But as for the proceedings in the Lower Courts in such Cases, they delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Opinions. And in 12 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. in Sir <hi>John Paston</hi>'s Case, it is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104240:29"/>
holden, that every Court shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and decide the Privileges and Customs of the same Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>See <hi>Dier, Fol.</hi> 275.

               <p>See <hi>Hollinsked,</hi> in his Cronicle, <hi>Fol.</hi> 1584. The Case of one <hi>Ferrers,</hi> set at liberty, that was a Burgess of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and arrested, and put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>London,</hi> sitting the Parliament; and this was <hi>Anno</hi> 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and was the Case of <hi>Ferrers,</hi> as I believe, of which <hi>Dier, Fol.</hi> 275 speaks.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Lent</hi> Season, whilst the Parliament yet continued, one <hi>George Ferrers,</hi> Gentleman, Servant to the King, being elect a Burgess for the Town of <hi>Plimmouth</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> in going to the Parliament-House was arrested in <hi>London,</hi> by a Process out of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104240:30"/>
King's Bench, at the Suit of one <hi>White,</hi> for the Sum of two hundred Marks, or thereabouts, wherein he was late afore condemned, as a Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Debt of one <hi>Welden</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi>; which Arrest being sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to Sir <hi>Thomas Moile,</hi> Knight, then Speaker of the Parliament, and to the Knights and Burgesses there, Order was taken, that the Serjeant of the Parliament, called <hi>S. I.</hi> should forthwith repair to the Counter in <hi>Breadstreet,</hi> whither the said <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> was carried, and there to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand delivery of the Prisoner. The Serjeant, as he had in charge, went to the Counter, and declared to the Clerks there what he had in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but they, and other Officers of the City, were so far from obeying the said Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as, after many stout words, they forcibly resisted the said Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, whereof ensued a Fray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Counter-gates, between the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104240:30"/>
said <hi>Ferrers</hi> and the said Officers, not without hurt of either part, so that the said Serjeant was driven to defend himself with his Mace of Arms, and had the Crown thereof broken by bearing off a stroke, and his man strucken down. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Brawl, the Sheriffs of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> called <hi>Rowland Hill,</hi> and <hi>H. Suckley,</hi> came thither, to whom the Serjeant complained of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and required of them the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the said Burgess, as afore; but they bearing with their Officers, made little account either of his Complaint or his Message, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same contemptuously, with much proud Language, so as the Serjeant was forc'd to return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Prisoner; and finding the Speaker, and all the Knights and Burgesses set in their places, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them the whole cause as it fell out, who took the same in so ill part, that they all together
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104240:31"/>
(of whom there were not a few, as well of the King's Privy Council, as also of his Privy Chamber) would sit no longer without their Burgess, but rose up wholly and repaired to the Upper House, where the whole Case was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the mouth of the Speaker before Sir <hi>T. Audley,</hi> Knight, then Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> and all the Lords and Judges there assembled, who judging the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to be very great, referred the punishment thereof to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Common House. They returning to their places again, upon new debate of the Case, took order that their Serjeant should speedily repair to the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> and require delivery of the said Burgess, without any Writ or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant had for the same, but only as afore. Albeit the Lord Chancellour offered there to grant a Writ, which they of the Common House refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104240:31"/>
being in a clear Opinion, that all Commandments, and other Acts proceeding from the nether House, were to be done and executed by their Serjeant without Writ, only by shewing of his Mace, which was his Warrant. But before the Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's return into <hi>London,</hi> the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs having intelligence how hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously the matter was taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came somewhat more mild, so as upon the said second demand, they delivered the Prisoner up without any denial. But the Serjeant having then further in commandment from those of the nether House, charged the said Sheriffs to appear personally on the morrow by eight of the clock before the Speaker in the nether House, and to bring thither the Clerks of the Counter, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Officers as were Parties to the said Affray, and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to take into his custody the said <hi>White,</hi> which wittingly procured
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104240:32"/>
the said Arrest, in Contempt of the priviledge of the Parliament, which Commandment being done by the said Serjeant accordingly on the morrow, the two Sheriffs, with one of the Clerks of the Counter (which was the chief occasion of the said Affray) together with the said <hi>White</hi> appeared in the Common House, where the Speaker char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them with their Contempt and Misdemeanor aforesaid, they were compelled to make immediate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, without being admitted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Counsel. Albeit Sir <hi>Ro. Cholmley</hi> then Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> and other the Counsel of the City there present, offered to speak in the cause, which were all put to silence, and none suffered to speak, but the parties themselves, whereupon in conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the said Sheriffs and the same <hi>White</hi> were committed to the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and the said Clerk (which was the occasion of the Fray)
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104240:32"/>
to a place there called <hi>Little-ease,</hi> and the Officer of <hi>London</hi> which did the Arrest, called <hi>Tailor,</hi> with four Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained from the 28<hi>th</hi> until the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and then they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, not without humble suit made by the Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and other their Friends. And forasmuch as the said <hi>Ferrers</hi> being in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon a Condemnation of Debt, and set at large by priviledge of Parliament, was not by Law to be brought again into Execution, and fo the party without remedy for his Debt, as well against him as his principal Debtor; after long debate of the same, by the space of nine or ten days together, at last they resolved upon an Act of Parliament to be made, and to revive the Execution of the said Debt against the said <hi>Welden,</hi> which was Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Debtor, and to discharge the said <hi>Ferrers.</hi> But before this came
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104240:33"/>
to pass, the Common House was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided upon the Question: but in conclusion, the Act passed for the said <hi>Ferrers,</hi> who won by fourteen Voices. The King being then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised of all this proceeding, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led immediately before him the Lord Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> and his Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with the Speaker of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and other of the gravest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the nether House, to whom he declared his Opinion to this effect. First, commending their wisdom in maintaining the Privileges of their House (which he would not have to be infringed in any point) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, that-he being Head of the Parliament, and attending in his own Person upon the business there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ought in reason to have Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for him and all his Servants attending there upon him. So that if the said <hi>Ferrers</hi> had been no Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gess, but only his Servant, that in respect thereof, he was to have the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104240:33"/>
priviledge as well as any other. For I understand (quoth he) that you not only for your own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but also for your necessary Servants, even to your Cooks and Horse-keepers, enjoy the said Priviledge, insomuch as my Lord Chancellour here present, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Us, that he being Speaker of the Parliament, the Cook of the <hi>Temple</hi> was arrested in <hi>London,</hi> and in Execution upon a statute of the Staple: And forasmuch as the said Cook, during the Parliament ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Speaker in that Office, he was taken out of Execution by the priviledge of the Parliament: and farther, We be informed by our Judges, that We at no time stand so highly in our Estate Royal as in the time of Parliament, wherein We as Head, and you as Members, are conjoyned and knit together into one Body Politick, so as whatsoever Offence or Injury (during that time
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104240:34"/>
is offered) to the meanest Member of the House, is to be judged, as done against our Person, and the whole Court of Parliament, which Prerogative of the Court is so great (as our learned Counsel informeth us) as all Acts and Processes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of any other inferiour Courts, must for the time cease and give place to the highest. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Party, it was a great Presumption in him, knowing our Servant to be one of this House, and being warned thereof before, would nevertheless prosecute this matter out of time, and therefore was well worthy to have lost his Debt, which I would not wish, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do commend your Equity, that having lost the same by Law, have restored him to the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him who was his Debtor, and this may be a good Example to others, not to attempt any thing against the Priviledge of this Court,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104240:34"/>
but to take the time better; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Sir <hi>Edward Montague,</hi> then Lord Chief Justice, very gravely declared his Opinion, confirming by divers reasons all that the King had said, which was assented unto by all the Residue, none speaking to the contrary, the Act indeed passed not the higher House, for the Lords had not time to consider of it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the dissolution of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Because this Case hath been diversly reported, as is commonly alleged as a President for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Parliament, I have indeavoured my self to learn the Truth thereof, and to set it forth with the whole Circumstances at large, according to their Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons who ought best both to know and remember it.</p>

                  <hi>Vide Dier,</hi> 360. A Lord of <hi>Ireland</hi> shall not be tried in <hi>England</hi> for Treason done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor by his Peers, not by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, because he is a Subject of <hi>Ireland</hi>; And <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have several Seals; whereby it appeareth, that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> shall not bind those of <hi>Ireland</hi> for their Land. <hi>Dier,</hi> 303. A man has Goods in <hi>England,</hi> and other Goods in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and dies intestate in <hi>England</hi>; and the Intestate has an Obligation of a Merchant that dwells in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which Obligation was in <hi>England,</hi> when he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Son of the Intestate obtains the Administration of the Bishop of <hi>Dublin</hi> for the Goods there, and the Wife of the Intestate of the Goods in <hi>England,</hi> of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> within his Province, the Son relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to the Obligor in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in Debt by the Wife of the Intestate, who has the Obligation in her Hand. This Release was pleaded, and the issue taken was, whether the Obligation was in

                  <hi>England</hi> or in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when the Obligee died. Out of which it may be collected, that the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had to do with it, and not the Bishop of <hi>Dublin. Dier</hi> 305.</p>

               <p>A man has Restitution by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and a Writ of <hi>Ouster le main</hi> issued forth to the Escheator, and the Tenant that had the Land, upon a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse by him tendered, made <hi>Rescous</hi>: If he had not notice of this Restitution, he shall not be punished by Fine for that <hi>Rescous,</hi> and the reason may be, for that it is a special Act. 43. <hi>Lib.

                  <hi>Note</hi>; That a special Bill against <hi>J. P.</hi> was put into Parliament, 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. for Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing of a Woman, whereby it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that he come before the Lords within a certain day after the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by the Sheriff of the County of <hi>E.</hi> after <hi>Pentecost</hi> next, and if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not, then he should be attainted,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104240:60"/>
and pay a certain Sum to the Woman, and this Bill was exhibited to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons after <hi>Pentecost,</hi> which was within the time of Parliament, that begun 15 <hi>P.</hi> before; <hi>Anno Praedict'.</hi> And the Lords gave day to <hi>J. P.</hi> to appear after <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost, Anno</hi> 1457, which was 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a day certain after the Proclamation, and this Bill was not sent to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as it ought to have been, for that the Lords gave a longer time than the Commons gave, and after <hi>J. P.</hi> did not appear according to the Proclamation, whereupon he was taken, and sent into the King's-Bench, and there pleaded by his Counsel, that the Act was not an Act, for that the Lords had given a longer day, <hi>ut supra,</hi> and the Bill was transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed upon a <hi>Certiorari</hi> in Chancery, and by <hi>Mittimus</hi> of Chancery under the Seal there, was sent to the Justices, and the Writ was, <hi>Rex Justitiariis suis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptum cujusdam billae coram nobis in Cancellariam nostram in filacio,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit', &amp; authoritate ultimi Parliamenti nostri,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Confirm. versus</hi> J. P. <hi>Vobis mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus,</hi> by which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And altho it is not an Act of Parliament in Law, for that the Lords gave a longer time, <hi>ut supra,</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:104240:61"/>
yet the Clerk of Chancery made the Writ, which was confirm'd by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it was not so in Truth; And <hi>Fortescue,</hi> in the Exchequer Chamber, seems, that it cannot be intended but that the Act is good, for that the King by his Writ certified the Justices, that the Bill was confirm'd by Parliament; But <hi>Illingworth,</hi> Chief Baron, said, that it shall not be taken for an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the writing of a Clerk of Chancery cannot make an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament good, if it be vitious or void in it self; and after, <hi>Fortescue</hi> said, that this is an Act of Parliament, and he would be advised before he would make void an Act of Parliament; and so see, if a Certificat under the Seal of the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Record there, shall be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. <hi>Vide Com.</hi> 232. and 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3.40. that a Man shall not have an Averrment against a Certificat under the great Seal.</p>
