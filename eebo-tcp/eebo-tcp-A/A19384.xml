            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To THE RIGHT Honourable, Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Phillips, Knight, and Maister of the Rolles, at his house in Chancery-Lane, or VVanstead. From the Court of the most mighty Monarch, the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> resident in the Towne of <hi>Asmere,</hi> in the Easterne India, Anno <hi>1615.</hi>
            </head>
            <pb facs="tcp:9182:5"/>
            <opener>Right Honourable,</opener>
            <p>I Am perswaded, that if euer any accident wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euer happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto your honor in al your life time, it will be the receiuing of this present Letter, from me out of the Easterne <hi>India</hi>: yet perhaps it will seeme vnto you so wondrous, that I beleeue you will doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this bee the true hand-writing of your once <hi>Odcombiam</hi> Neighbor, <hi>Thomas Coryate.</hi> But your Honour may soone very infallibly and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly perceiue it to be true; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the forme of the style, which is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9182:5"/>
iust answerable to that manner of speech that you haue heard and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in me, sometimes in my Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie-woolsie Orations; and somtimes in my extrauagant discourses: and partly by the testimony of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer heereof, M. <hi>Peter Rogers,</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster at the time of his being in <hi>India,</hi> to the English Merchants resident at the Court of the most puissant Monarch the great <hi>Mogul,</hi> at a town called <hi>Asmere</hi>; whose comfortable and sweet company I enioyed at the same Court, about the space of foure Moneths.</p>
            <p>Now, though there hath itched a very burning desire in mee, within these few yeares, to suruay and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template some of the chiefest parts of this goodly Fabricke of the VVorld, besides mine owne natiue Country: yet neuer did I thinke it would haue broken out to such an ambitious vent, as to trauell all on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9182:6"/>
foote from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> so farre as the place where I wrote this Letter.</p>
            <p>Howbeit since Fortune, or rather (to speake more properly, in vsing a Christian word) the prouidence of the Almighty, (for <hi>Fatuus est,</hi> S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> saith, <hi>qui faro credit</hi>) hath so ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that I should securely passe so far into the Orientall world, with al humilitie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the bended knees of my hart, I thank my Creator &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful redeemer, Iesus Christ; (whose Sacrosanct Sepulcher I haue visited &amp; kissed, <hi>terque quaterque</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) &amp; do very much congratulate mine owne happines, that he hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to endued mee with health, (for in all my trauels since I came out of England, I haue enioyed as sound a constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of body, &amp; firme health, as euer I did since I first drew this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ayre) libertie, strength of limbs, agilitie of foot-manship, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Neither do I doubt, but that your Honour it selfe will likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9182:6"/>
the felicitie of our <hi>Sommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setshire,</hi> that in breeding me, hath produced such a traueller, as dooth for the diuersitie of the Countries he hath seene, and the multiplicitie of his obseruations, farre (I beleeue) out-strippe anie other whatsoeuer, that hath beene bred therein since the blessed Incarnation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior. Yea, I hope my generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of <hi>England,</hi> shall one day say, that <hi>Odde-combe,</hi> for one part of the word, may truelie be so called: (for <hi>Odde-combe</hi> consisteth of two words, odde, &amp; combe, which latter word in the olde Saxon tongue signifieth besides the vertical point of a cocks head, the side of a Hill, because the east side of the hill wheron <hi>Od-combe</hi> standeth, is very conspicuous, and seene afar off in the Country East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) for breeding an odde man, one that hath not his peere in the whole kingdome to match him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:9182:7"/>Three yeares and some few odde dayes I haue spent already, in this second peregrination, and I hope with as much profite (vnpartially will I speake it of my selfe, without any ouer-weening opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, to which most men are subiect) both for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning foure Languages more, then I had when I left my Country: viz. <hi>Italian, Arabian, Turkish,</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi>; and exact viewing of diuers of the most remarkeable matters of the Vniuerse; together with the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate description thereof, as most of my Countri-men that are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. Yet such is my insatiable greedinesse of seeing strange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: which exercise is indeede the very Queene of all the pleasures in the world, that I haue determined (if God shall say Amen) to spend full seauen yeares more, to the ende to make my voyage answerable for the time to the trauels of <hi>Vlysses</hi>; &amp;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9182:7"/>
then with vnspeakable ioy to reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site my Country; which I will euer entitle (notwith-standing all the goodly Regions that I haue seene in my two perambulations) with the stile of the true <hi>Canaan</hi> of the world, that flowes with Milke and Hony. Onely wish me good successe, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech your Honour, as I will from my heart, to you and all your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie; hoping to salute you after the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall catastrophe of my exoticke wanderings; when you shall bee in the great climacterical year of your age; you being about fifty three, if my coniecture doth not faile mee, when I tooke my leaue of you: a thing verie likely by the mercifull goodnesse of God. For your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that was my god-father, who imposed vpon me the name of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> liued more then eightie yeares.</p>

               <hi>Constantinople</hi> it selfe in greatnesse: but a dozen dayes before I came to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hore,</hi> I passed the famous Riuer <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> which is as broad againe as our <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and hath his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall out of the Mountaine <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casus,</hi> so much ennobled by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient both Poets and Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, <hi>Greeke &amp; Latine</hi>; which <hi>Plato</hi> for curiosity sake, in his trauelles of these parts, went to see.

presents of great value) to the King of <hi>Persia's</hi> Court; so gallantly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with all necessaries for their trauailes, that it was a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto me to see them in such a florishing estate.

For through <hi>Persia</hi> I haue determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (by Gods helpe) to returne to <hi>Aleppo.</hi> Besides, other rarities that they carried with them out of <hi>India</hi>; they had two Elephants, and eight Antlops, which were the first that euer I saw: but afterwards, when I came to the <hi>Moguls</hi> Court, J sawe great store of them. These they

meant to present to the <hi>Persia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               </hi> King. Both he and his Lady vsed me with singular respect, especially his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who bestowed forty shillings vpon me in <hi>Persian</hi> mony; and they seemed to exult for ioy to see mee, hauing promised me to bring mee in good grace with the <hi>Persian</hi> king,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9182:12"/>
and that they will enduce him to bestow some Princely benefit vpon me: this I hope will be partly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by my booke, for he is such a iocond Prince, that he will not be meanlie delighted with diuers of my factious Hieroglyphicks, if they are truelie and genuously expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto him. From the famous Citie of <hi>Lahore,</hi> I had twentie daies iourney to another goodly Citie called <hi>Agra,</hi> through such a delicate and eeuen tract of ground, as I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer saw before; and doubt whither the like bee to be found within the whole circumference of the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table world. Another thing also in this way, being no lesse memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the plainenesse of the ground; a row of Trees on each side of this way where people doe trauell, extending it selfe from the townes end of <hi>Lahore,</hi> to the townes end of <hi>Agra</hi>; the most incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

shew of that kinde, that euer my eies suruaied. Likewise wheras ther is a Mountaine some ten daies iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney betwixt <hi>Lahore</hi> and <hi>Agra,</hi> but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie neere ten miles out of the way on the left hand: the people that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite that Mountaine, obserue a custome very strange, that all the brothers of any familie, haue but one and the selfe-same wife; so that one woman sometimes doth serue 6 or 7 men: the like whereof I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I haue read in <hi>Strabo,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Arabians that inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Arabia felix. Agra</hi> is a verie great Citie, and the place where the <hi>Mogul</hi> did alwaies (sauing within these two yeares) keepe his Court; but in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie respect much inferior to <hi>Lahore.</hi> From thence to the <hi>Moguls</hi> Court I had ten daies iourney, at a Towne called <hi>Asmere,</hi> where I found a Cape Merchant of our English men, with nine more of my Countrimen, resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

there vpon termes of Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, for the right worshipfull Company of Merchants in Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> that trade for East India. I spent in my iourney betwixt <hi>Ierusalem</hi> &amp; this <hi>Moguls</hi> Court, 15. moneths and odde daies: all which way I trauersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, but with diuers paire of shooes, hauing beene such a Propateticke, (I will not cal my selfe Peripatetick, because you know it signifieth one that maketh a perambulation about a place, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, signifying to walk about) that is, a walker forward on foote, as I doubt whether you euer heard of the like in your life: for the totall way betwixt <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the <hi>Moguls</hi> court, containeth two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and seauen hundred English miles. My whole perambulation of this Asia the greater, is like to bee a passage of almost sixe thousande miles, by that time that in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe thorough Persia,

            <p>Now I am at the <hi>Moguls</hi> Court, I think you would be glad to receiue some narration thereof from mee, though succinctly handled: for I meane to be very compendious, lest I shold otherwise preoccupate that pleasure which you may here after this reape by my personall relation thereof. This present Prince is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie worthy person, by name <hi>Selim,</hi> of which name I neuer read or heard of any more then one Mahometan King, which was <hi>Suliam Selim</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> that liued about 80. years since; the same that conquered <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, Damascus, Aleppo, Caico,</hi> &amp;c: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the same to the <hi>Turkish</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9182:14"/>
He is 53. yeares of age, his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie daie hauing beene celebrated with wonderfull pompe since my arriuall here: for that daie he weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselffe in a paire of golden Scales, which by great chance I saw the same day (a custome that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth most inuioablie euery year) laying so much golde in the other scale as cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>teruaileth the weight of his body, and the same he afterward distributed to the poore. Hee is of complection neither white nor blacke, but of a middle betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: I know not how to expresse it with a more expressiue &amp; significant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitheton then Oliue: an Oliue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour his face presenteth: hee is of a seemelie composition of bodie, of a stature little vnequall (as I guesse not without grounds of probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) to mine, but much more corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then my selfe. The extent of his Dominion is verie spacious, beeing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9182:15"/>
in circuite, little lesse then 4000. English miles, which verie neere answereth the compas of the Turks territories: or if any thing be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in geometricall dimension of ground, it is with a great pleonas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me supplied by the fertility of his soyle: and in these two thinges hee exceedeth the Turks, in the fatnesse (as I haue said) of his Land, no part of the world yeelding a more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full veine of ground, then all that which lieth in his Empire, sauing that part of Babylonia, where the terrestriall Paradise once stoode: whereas a great part of the Turkes Land is extreme barren and sterill, as I haue obserued in my peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereof, especially in Syria, Mesopotamia and Armenia; many large portions thereof beeing so wonderfull fruitelesse, that it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no good thing at all, or if any thing, there <hi>Infelix lolium et steriles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minantur auenae.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:9182:15"/>Secondly, in the coniunction and vnion of all his Territories, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one &amp; the same goodly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of India, no Prince hauing a foote of land within him. But many parcels of the Turkes Countries are by a large distance of seas &amp; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise diuided asunder. Again, in his Reuenue he exceedeth the Turk &amp; the Persian his Neighbour by iust halfe: for his Reuenues are 40. mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Crownes of sixe shillings value, by the yeare: but the Turkes are no more then fifteene millions, as I was certainly informed in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople; and the Persians fiue millions <hi>plus minus,</hi> as I heard in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han. It is saide that he is vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, wherein he differeth from all the Mahometan Princes that euer were in the world.</p>
            <p>Hee speaketh very reuerently of our Sauiour, calling him in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian tongue, <hi>Ifazaret Eesa,</hi> that is,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9182:16"/>
the great Prophet, Iesus: and all Christians, especiallie vs English, he vseth so beneuolently, as no Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Prince the like Hee keepeth abundance of wilde Beasts, &amp; that of diuers sorts, as Lyons, Elephants Loepards, Beares, Antlops, Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes; whereof two I haue seene
<figure/>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:9182:16"/>
at his Court, the strangest beasts of the world: they were brought hither out of the Countrie of <hi>Bengala,</hi> which is a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of most singular fertilitie within the compasse of his Dominion, about foure moneths iourney from this, the midland parts therof being watered by diuers channels of the famous <hi>Ganges,</hi> which I haue not as yet seene, but (God willing) I meane to visite it before my departure out of this Countrie, the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest part of it beeing not aboue twelue daies iourny from this Court. The King presenteth himselfe thrice euery daie without faile to his Nobles, at the rising of the Sunne, which he adoreth by the eleuation of his hands; at noone, and at fiue of the clocke in the euening: but he standeth in a roome aloft, alone by him selfe, and looketh vppon them from a window that hath an embroidered sumptuous couerture, supported with two siluer pillasters to yeeld shaddowe vnto him. Twice euery week, Elephants fight before him, the brauest spectacle in the worlde: many of them are thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene

foot and a halfe high; and they seeme to iustle together like two little Mountaines, and were they not parted in the middest of their fighting by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fire-workes, they would excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly gore and cruentate one another by their murdering teeth. Of Elephants the King keepeth 30000. in his whole Kingdome at an vnmeasurable charge; in feeding of whom, and his Lyons, and other Beasts, he spendeth an incredible masse of money, at the least ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds sterling a day. I haue rid vpon an elephant since I came to this Court, determining one day (by Gods leaue) to haue my picture expressed in my next Booke, sitting vpon an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. The King keepeth a thousand women for his own body, whereof the chiefest (which is his Queene) is called <hi>Normal.</hi> I thinke I shall here after this, send another Letter vnto you, before my departure out of this Countrey, by a worthy man, which is the Minister &amp; Preacher of our Nation in this place, one M. <hi>Peter Rogers,</hi> a man to whom I

Since my arriuall heere, there was sent vnto this King one of the richest presents that I haue heard to be sent to any Prince in al my life time: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of diuers parcels; one beeing Elephants, whereof there were 31. and of those, two so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously adorned, as I neuer sawe the like, nor shal see the like again while I liue. For they wore foure chaines about their bodies all of beaten gold: two chains about their legges of the same;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9182:20"/>
furniture for their buttocks of pure gold: twoe Lyons vpon their heads of the like gold: the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of each, amounting to the value of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most eight thousand pound sterling: and the whole Present was worth ten of their Leakes, as they call them; a Leak being ten thousand pound sterling: the whole, a hundred thousand pounds sterling. Pray commend me to M. <hi>Protoplast,</hi> and all the Sireniacall gentlemen, to whom I wrote one Letter from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> after my being at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>; and another I intend to write before my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Asia.</hi> Their most elegant and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable safe-conduct that they haue graciously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon me, I haue left at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> not hauing made any vse of it as yet, neither shall I in all my peregrination of <hi>Asia</hi>: but when I shall one day arriue in Christendome, it will be very auaileable to me. I haue heere sent vnto you the coppy of certaine facetious verses, that were lately sent to me to this Court, from one of my Countrimen, one M. <hi>Iohn Browne,</hi> a Londoner borne, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident with diuers other English Merchants, at a Citie in <hi>India,</hi> fiue hundred miles from the place where I abide, called <hi>Amadauers,</hi> about sixe dayes iourney from the Sea: who vnderstanding of my arriuall at this Court, and of my tedious pedestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all peregrination all the way from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; vnderstanding it I say, by Latine and Italian Epistles, that vpon a certaine occasion I wrote to some of that company, made these pretty verses, and sent them me.

            <p>BY this present Letter, I am like to minister vnto you the occasion of two contrary matters; the one of comfort, the other of discomfort: of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, because I haue by the propitious assistance of the omnipotent <hi>Iehouah,</hi> performed such a notable voyage of <hi>Asia</hi> the greater, with purchase of great riches of experience, as I doubt whether any English man this hundred yeares haue done the like; hauing seene and very particularly obserued all the cheefest things in the Holy-land, called in times past <hi>Palaestina</hi>; as <hi>Ierusalem, Samaria, Nazareth, Bethlehem, Iericho, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus, Bethania,</hi> the Dead Sea, called by the Ancients <hi>Lacus Asphaltities,</hi> where <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> once stood; since that, many famous and renowned Cities and countries; <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> in the which I entred by the passage of the riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that watered Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; in which the Citty of <hi>Vr</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> was borne; both the <hi>Mediaes,</hi> the higher and the lower. <hi>Parthia, Armenia, Persia,</hi> through al which I haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed into the Eastern India, being now at the Court of the great <hi>Mogull,</hi> at a Towne called <hi>Asmere,</hi> the which from Ierusalem is the distance of two thousand and seauen hundred miles; and haue traced all this tedious way afoote, with no small toile of bodye and discomfort, because that beeing so exceeding
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9182:29"/>
farre from my sweet and most delicious Natiue soyle of England, you will doubt perhaps, how it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to returne home againe: but I hope I shall quickly remoue from you that opinion of discomfort, (if at the least you shall conceiue any such) because I would haue you know, that I alwayes go safely in the company of <hi>Carauans</hi> from place to place. A <hi>Carauan</hi> is a word much vsed in all <hi>Asia</hi>: by which is vnderstood a great multitude of people trauelling together vpon the way with Camels, Horses, Mules, Asses, &amp;c. on which they carry Merchandizes from one country to another, and Tents and Pauillions; vnder which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of houses they shelter themselues in open fields, being furnished also with all necessary prouision, and conuenient implements to dresse the same: in which <hi>Carauans</hi> I haue euer most securely passed betwixt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem and this Towne, a iourney of fifteene months and odde dayes: whereof foure wanting a VVeeke, spent in <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and two and fiue &amp; od dayes spent in <hi>Spahan</hi> the Metropolitan Citty of <hi>Persia,</hi> where the Persian King most commonly keepeth his Court: &amp; the occasion of my spending of sixe moneths of the foresaide fifteene, in those two Citties, was to waite for an opportunity of <hi>Carauans</hi> to Trauaile withall; which a traueller is not sure to finde presently, when he is ready to take his iourney, but must with patience expect a conuenient time; and the <hi>Carauan</hi> in which I trauelled betwixt <hi>Spahan</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> contained 2000. Camels, 1500. horses, 1000. and odde Mules, 800. Asses, and sixe thousand people. Let this therefore (deer Mother) minister vnto you a strong hope of my happy returne into England.</p>
            <p>Notwithstand all these lines for prouision for your
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9182:29"/>
Funerall, I hope for to see you aliue and sound in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; minde, about foure yeares hence; &amp; to kneele before you with effusion of teares, for ioy. Sweet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pray let not this wound your heart, that I say four yeares hence, &amp; not before; I humbly beseech you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon the knees of my heart, with all submissiue, supplications to pardon me for my long absence; for verily, I haue resolued by the fauour of the supernal powers, to spend 4. entire yeares more before my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and so to make it a Pilgrimage of 7. yeares, to the end I may very effectually and profitably contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate a great part of this worldly fabricke, determining by Gods special help, to go from <hi>India</hi> into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Scythia,</hi> now called <hi>Tartaria,</hi> to the Cittie <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marcanda,</hi> to see the Sepulcher of the greatest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror that euer was in the worlde. <hi>Tamberlaine</hi> the Great: thither it is a iourney of two months from the place I now remaine: from that I meane to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Persia</hi>; and therehence by the way of <hi>Babylon &amp; Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuy,</hi> and the Mountaine <hi>Ararat,</hi> where <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke rested, to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> to my Countrymen. From that, by the way of <hi>Damascus,</hi> and once againe to <hi>Gaza</hi> in the Land of the <hi>Philistims</hi> vnto <hi>Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi>: From that downe the <hi>Nilus</hi> to <hi>Alexandria</hi>: and therehence final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I hope to be imbarked for some part of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as either <hi>Venice,</hi> or &amp;c. After mine arriuall in Christendome, I shall desire to trauell two yeares in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> and both high &amp; low <hi>Germany,</hi> and then with all expedition into <hi>England,</hi> and to see you (I hope) with as great ioy as euer did any Trauailer his Father or Mother, going in that manner as I do like a poore Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim. I am like to passe with vndoubted securitie, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9182:30"/>
very small charge: for in my tenne months trauailes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Aleppo</hi> and this <hi>Moguls</hi> Court, I spent but three pounds sterling, and yet had sustenance enough to maintaine nature, liuing reasonably well, oftentimes a whole day, for so much of their money, as doeth counteruaile two pence sterling. But least I be ouer tedious vnto you, I will heere make an end. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I will now commend you to the most blessed prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Sauiour Iesus Christ; before whose holy Sepulcher at Ierusalem, I haue poured foorth mine ardent Orisons for you, to the most sacro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanct Trinity, beseeching it with all humilitie of heart, to blesse and preserue you in a solid health, &amp;c.</p>
