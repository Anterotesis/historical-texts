            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PROPOSAL
Offered to the
COMMITTEE
OF THE
<hi>Honourable Houſe of COMMONS,</hi>
APPOINTED
To conſider of Ways for the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for the POOR, and
ſetting them on Work.</head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>And now under their Conſideration.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THAT the Laws now in force about Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants,
Rogues, Beggars, Lewd Women,
Baſtards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alſo the Laws about
the Settlement of the Poor be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in one Statute, that ſo they may be more eaſily
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105486:2"/>
underſtood by thoſe who ſhall undertake the
Care of the Poor.</p>
            <p>That the Laws about Providing for and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
the Poor be ſtill in force, where new
Corporations for the Poor are not ſetled.</p>
            <p>That Encouragement be given for erecting Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitals,
Houſes of Correction, and Work-houſes
for Maintaining and Employing the Poor of this
Kingdom, in all the Counties, Cities, and Towns,
under the Management of Corporations, ſettled
either under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> or by
Act of Parliament; or by the Juſtices of the Peace
in their Quarter-Seſſions.</p>
            <p>That where theſe Corporations are ſettled in
Cities or Towns Corporate, the Poors Rates of
all the Pariſhes be united into One, and equally
raiſed on the Inhabitants, according to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
both Real and Perſonal; except in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
or other very large Places, which may be
divided into ſeveral Corporations, by diſcretion
of the Juſtices, who may bring the Charge to
an Equality, either by joyning rich Pariſhes with
poor, or by making the richer Corporations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the Poorer.</p>
            <p>That the Corporations in the Country be not
extended ſo large as to comprehend a whole
County, the Poor thereof being too many for
one Corporation to govern, but rather confined
to a Hundred or Hundreds, whoſe Pariſhes
to be comprehended in One, and each of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105486:2"/>
them to contribute to the Charge thereof, not by
bringing them to an equal Pound-rate on their
Lands and Perſonal Eſtates, which I fear will
diſcourage them from uniting; but by taxing every
Pariſh according to what it paid before, there not
being the ſame Parity of Reaſon for this way of
Rating in the Hundreds, as there is in Cities
and Towns; becauſe in the Hundreds the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
do not receive an equal Benefit from the
Labour of the Poor of other Pariſhes, as they
do in Cities and Towns; yet this may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Juſtices of the Peace to proportion,
which, I humbly conceive, is all can be done,
except you make this Law compulſive.</p>
            <p>That the Sums of Money to be raiſed for this
Work, ſhall not exceed what was paid in one
of the laſt Three Years for the Maintenance of
the Poor in all the Pariſhes thus united.</p>
            <p>That theſe Corporations ſhall be obliged to
maintain all the Poor impotent People within
their Juriſdictions; to provide Work for thoſe
who are willing, and to force thoſe to work
who are idle, and to aſſiſt thoſe poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whoſe Labour will not maintain their
Charge.</p>
            <p>That Hoſpitals, and Work-houſes, and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Correction, ſhall be erected in convenient
Places, under the Government of each Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration;
wherein the impotent Poor ſhall be
