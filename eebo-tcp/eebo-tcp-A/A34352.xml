            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

READER.</head>
            <p>THE Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the War of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi>
being at preſent the common Subject
of Diſcourſe, I preſume it will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
to you, if I give you a more faithful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Account of thoſe Succeſſes of the Chriſtian Arms
against the Turks, than hath yet been publiſhed; an
Account not collected from Fame, or Tranſcribed out
of <hi>Mercuries</hi> and <hi>Gazetts,</hi> but Original Letters
themſelves, which have been already ſeen and approv'd
off, by his MAJESTY and his ROYAL HIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS;
and thoſe written by a <hi>Cavalier</hi> of a
high Reputation, who was not only preſent in the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of which he writes, but being a general Officer in
the <hi>Imperial Army,</hi> bore a conſiderable Part in them
himſelf. This is the <hi>Lord Taaffe,</hi> a Subject of His
Majeſties, who to his Elder Brother the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford,</hi>
and to the <hi>Marquiſs</hi> of <hi>Grana</hi> Governor
of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſends theſe Letters, in which you may
not only diſcern a vein of Truth, but a certain Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
and Nobleneſs of Nature, ſince without arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any thing to himſelf, he does not omit to do Juſtice
to others; By theſe Qualities, and his prudent Conduct
in a <hi>Forreign</hi> COURT, he hath acquir'd much Esteem
<pb facs="tcp:48791:3"/>
and Truſt with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> whom he ſerves, the
Affection and Confidence of his Highneſs, the Duke
of <hi>Loranie,</hi> and a great Name over all the Empire.
So that he does honour not only to himſelf, but to his
Country, and to his Loyal Family, and Noble Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
of which he is deſcended. An Example to awake
the <hi>Vertue</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> and make all
Gentlemen ſenſible how much more it would be both for
their Intereſt and Honour to imploy their Swords in this
Occaſion for the Defence of Chriſtendom, than to waſt
their Youth in Gaming-houſes and Taverns, and kill one
another as they do in ſenſeleſs and brutal Quarrels,</p>

               <head>For the Earl of Carlingford at London.</head>
               <p>I Had the Honour to hear from you by
my Lord <hi>Lanſdowne,</hi> who had he not
been very full of Courage and Bravery,
the Unhappy State of Affairs here had
certainly diverted him from ſo generous
a Deſign, but ſince he is reſolv'd to try his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
with us, the Duty I owe to the King, and
his Royal Highneſs'<hi>s</hi> Commands, the pleaſure
I have in obliging ſo gallant a Gentleman as my
Lord <hi>Lanſdowne,</hi> and the Intereſt you take therein
ingages me to omit nothing for his Service, as
well as to ſeek an opportunity to acquire a
Friend of his merit.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of Seventy thouſand Men, which was
promis'd the Duke of <hi>Loraine</hi> to carry on this
Terrible War, he never muſter'd yet above
Thirty Thouſand; and for theſe two Months
we have lain in <hi>Hungary,</hi> we have been Idle, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
little for fear of leſſening our Strength
before the Arrival of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces, having
already, what through Sickneſs, and neceſſary
Detachments reduced our Army to Three and
Twenty Thouſand Men, and that was the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48791:4"/>
of our Force, when the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> on
the Seventh Inſtant, with an Army of at leaſt,
One Hundred and Threeſcore Thouſand Figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Men, poſted himſelf within Cannon-ſhot
of us, the ſmall River <hi>Raab</hi> running between,
neither do I ſpeak the moſt, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
all the Priſoners we have taken as well as
other Advices make them above Two hundred
Thouſand, beſides the <hi>Tartars</hi> and the <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Rebels.</hi> You may eaſily imagine, my Lord,
whether this Appearance did not ſurprize us, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
always pleas'd our ſelves with the hopes,
That our Alliance with <hi>Poland</hi> might have obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the <hi>Turk</hi> to divide his Forces, however tho
we ſound the contrary, we yet maintain'd our
Poſt that day, and repuls'd Twenty Thouſand
<hi>Tartars,</hi> who forded the River under our very
Noſes. The Enemy thus finding how difficult
it was to force his way to us, ordered out a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
of Thirty Thouſand Horſe to ſpread
themſelves all along the River over againſt our
Right Wing, with a Reſerve of <hi>Hungarians</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Count <hi>Budiani,</hi> a Nobleman of
that Country lately revolted, and being inform'd
at night, that the <hi>Turks</hi> were come over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
without any difficulty, <hi>Budiani,</hi> with the ſaid
<hi>Hungarian Rebels</hi> joyning with them, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48791:4"/>
for the Rebel <hi>Teckeley,</hi> as alſo conſidering
the diſproportion in our Numbers, that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was fordable in ſeveral Places, the Enemy
poſſeſt of all the advantageous Grounds, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
when they pleas'd, under protection of their
Canon to force this Paſſage, and at the ſame time
a great Body of their Horſe, who being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
on this ſide, were in a poſture to charge us,
either in Flank or Rear, his Highneſs judg'd that
Poſt not ſafe, quitting it that night, having firſt
put Six Thouſand Men into <hi>Raab,</hi> which of all
Places, ſeemed moſt in danger to be beſieged.
Our Foot marched towards <hi>Presburgh</hi> by the Iſle
of <hi>Schutz,</hi> where they were out of the reach of
their inſulting numbers, and our Horſe through
the Plains which extend from <hi>Raab</hi> to <hi>Presburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Thirteenth Inſtant,</hi> I commanded the Rear
Guard of Four hundred Horſe, when I was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd
by Two Thouſand <hi>Tartars</hi> upon the
Plains of <hi>Peternel,</hi> and at the ſame time as ill
luck would have it, they had Alarm'd our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaunt-Guard,
with a Party falling upon our
Baggage, and his Highneſs fearing leaſt the
Enemy might cut us off from <hi>Vienna,</hi> where the
Emperor with the whole Courtas yet was, made
the Horſe march with all poſſible ſpeed thither,
leaving only behind one Regiment to Mount
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48791:5"/>
the Guard; this Regiment ſeeing the haſty
march of the other <hi>Troops,</hi> ſuppoſing it was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
by the <hi>Terror</hi> of thoſe that fell upon us
in the Rear, under that apprehenſion in the
moſt ſhameful manner in the World fled, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
once drawing a Piſtol, or offering to ſtand
the leaſt ſhock of the Enemy; whereupon thoſe
Four hundred Horſe of the Rear Guard under
my Command were ſurrounded, and I cannot
tell by what Providence I was deliver'd, having
for at leaſt half an hour marcht <hi>peſle meſle</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Enemy; there was at this time ſo
great a duſt that thoſe who fled could not as yet
diſcern the coming of their Succours, and in
that confuſion diſordered ſeveral of our own
Squadrons that were wheeling to their Relief.
The firſt that rallyed were Five Troops of my
Regiment, one <hi>Squadron</hi> being wholely broken
by the <hi>Regiment</hi> which fled, the other behaved
themſelves ſo bravely, that the poor Prince of
<hi>Aremberg</hi> and Count <hi>Millini,</hi> Brother to a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of that Name, and at preſent <hi>Nuntio</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi>
both Captains in my <hi>Regiment,</hi> with Prince <hi>Arem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>'s
Cornet, and Eighty Cavaliers were kill'd
upon the place.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> at length having with
much difficulty drawn up the reſt of the Horſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48791:5"/>
haſtned himſelf to us, where finding the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Squadrons, yet under a panick Fear, aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from his Horſe at the Head of his Men to
let them ſee there was no danger, this Example
gave freſh Courage to our Troops, and the
Duſt being ſomewhat abated, we diſcovered,
that all this Diſorder was only occaſion'd by
Six Thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars;</hi> We made up
then to them, his Highneſs being in the Head
of us, but they would not endure the very ſight
of our <hi>Troops,</hi> and 'twas in vain to follow them
with our heavy <hi>German Horſe,</hi> ſince our Light
Horſe was wanting, the Enemy flying with an
incredible Swiftneſs: But we learn'd from this,
that which we ſince found, that theſe <hi>Six Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi>
Horſe were only to cover the groſs of their
Army, with the which they thinking it not ſo
much for their purpoſe to Attacque <hi>Raab,</hi> as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
was firſt deſign'd, were marching direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Vienna.</hi> You will perhaps think it very
ſtrange that we ſhould be no better inform'd of
the Deſign and Marches of the Enemy, but not
ſo much when you hear that all <hi>Hungary</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, and not ſo much as a <hi>Peaſant</hi> but for
<hi>Teckeley.</hi> And as for the Party that we ſent out
to ſcout on the <hi>Plains</hi> between <hi>Raab</hi> and <hi>Vienna,</hi>
there could not a Man of them ha've eſcaped
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48791:6"/>
had they been diſcovered; ſuch is the Number
and Swiftneſs of the Enemy. To conclude,
my Lord, we are in a very deſperate Condition.
All <hi>Hungary</hi> is againſt us, the Court removed to
<hi>Paſſaw,</hi> All <hi>Auſtria</hi> round <hi>Vienna</hi> from <hi>Newſtat</hi>
and <hi>St. Hippolitt</hi> in flames, and we not able to
hinder it, having now only a Body of <hi>Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi>
Horſe, at moſt, left with the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain;
Vienna</hi> has been beſieged theſe ten Days,
and had not his Highneſs, out of his great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Conduct, clapt in <hi>Ten</hi> or <hi>Eleven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi>
Men into the <hi>Town,</hi> in that nick of <hi>Time,</hi> and
the which was all the Foot he had in his Army,
by this time the Place had certainly been loſt.
<hi>Bavaria</hi> is ſending us <hi>Ten Thouſand</hi> brave, but
unexperienced Souldiers, and we ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced
with <hi>Ten Thouſand</hi> more from the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</hi>
The King of <hi>Poland</hi> is obliged by our
<hi>Treaty</hi> to march himſelf in Perſon at the Head
of his Army to the Relief of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the
leaſt Delay is lookt upon as moſt dangerous.
<hi>Saxony, Franconia</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> promiſe us
their <hi>Troops,</hi> God grant they may all come in
time. If <hi>Vienna</hi> ſhould be taken, I cannot ſee the
end of our miſeries, but I hope God will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
his Cauſe, nor the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> that has
been ever ſo devoted to him.</p>

               <head>For the Earl of Carlinford at London.</head>
               <p>I Received yours of the Seventeenth of
<hi>July</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> and render God a
thouſand Thanks for ſaving our <hi>Royal
Maſter</hi> the King and the Duke from that
execrable Deſign of thoſe wicked Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſines;
Good God! What Madneſs is this?
Let us view all <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſee, if we can find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Subjects ſo well treated, or who do enjoy
ſo bleſſed a Peace as thoſe of <hi>England;</hi> Or if
there be any Nations in the World that do not
envy the Happineſs of ours; I have ſo great a
Deteſtation for thoſe Infamous Villains, that I
ſhall henceforth look upon <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> as
the moſt honeſt Men. You have by this time
doubtleſs received the Account I ſent you of
our <hi>Campagne</hi> from <hi>Paſſaw.</hi> The Lord <hi>Lanſdowne</hi>
delivered it to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, who
promiſed to ſend it in his Pacquet to <hi>Don Petro
de Ronquillio</hi> into <hi>England.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
has ſince had the good Fortune with Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Thouſand Horſe to give a Defeat to <hi>Tcc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keley</hi>'s
Army, conſiſting of <hi>Twenty Thouſand
Hungarians,</hi> and <hi>Six Thouſand Turks</hi> near <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
where he was going to poſſeſs himſelf of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48791:7"/>
the Town, and to be Crowned King of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gary:</hi>
We marcht up towards them by a <hi>Defile,</hi>
[i. e. <hi>Narrow Paſſage</hi>] which they had lined with
<hi>Dragoons,</hi> and though the Enemy were drawn
up in good Order, they had not the Courage
to make any oppoſition: Our Avaunt Guard
was ſcarcely paſt, when a Panick Fear ſo ſeized
thoſe Rebels, that they preſently fled, leaving
the <hi>Turks</hi> to ſhift for themſelves, who for a time
retreated orderly, but the <hi>Poles</hi> ſeconded by
ſome Regiments of our <hi>Curiaſiers</hi> fell ſo furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon them that at laſt they were routed, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a <hi>Thouſand</hi> of their Men dead behind them,
with <hi>Twelve Hundred</hi> Wagons of Baggage,
whereof our Men had the plunder, the Rebels
Cavalry ſaving themſelves by the Swiftneſs of
their Horſes; and the few Foot they had in
Woods and Mountains, which were inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our Horſe; this blow was ſuch a <hi>Terror</hi>
to <hi>Teckeley</hi> that we ſaw him no more. <hi>Vienna</hi>
has now been five weeks beſieged, and although
the Enemy took their Poſt the Firſt day at the
Foot of the <hi>Glasſis</hi> under protection of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs,</hi>
which we neglected to demoliſh, they have
ſpent four weeks in only gaining one Point of
the Counterſcarp, betwixt the <hi>Baſtion</hi> of the
Pallace, and that of <hi>Lebell.</hi> Five days ago they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48791:7"/>
ſprung a Mine under the Point of the Ravelin
betwixt the ſaid two <hi>Baſtions,</hi> where they gave
a furious Aſſault, in hopes to have made a
Lodgment of it, but they were repuls'd with
great Loſs, and we have it from the Priſoners
themſelves, as well as Spies we have in their
Camp, that they have already loſt above <hi>Twelve
Thouſand Janizaries.</hi> The <hi>Bavarian</hi> Succours of
Nine Thouſand Men are already arrived at the
Bridge of <hi>Crembs,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Franconia</hi> being Eight
Thouſand will be here to Morrow. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Saxony</hi> with Ten Thouſand Men more
is upon his March, but can hardly be with us
before the end of the Month. The King of
<hi>Poland</hi> is alſo coming with Three or Four and
Twenty Thouſand Men, and we are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Three and Twenty Thouſand <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi>
with which Troops we are reſolved towards
the end of this Month to ſuccour <hi>Vienna,</hi> or dye
in the Attempt; but if the King of <hi>Poland</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
coming, and we find the Town much
preſs'd, we ſhall endeavour the Relief of it
without him; they aſſure us that the Emperor
intends to be with us in Perſon, and I heartily
wiſh it for his greater Glory. We think to paſs
the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Crembs,</hi> a little Town about <hi>Ten</hi>
Leagues up the River from <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Country
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48791:8"/>
thereabouts is very Mountainous and Woody,
till you come within a little League of the
place. We ſhall have a Body of <hi>Thirty Thouſand</hi>
Foot, if the Enemy come to meet us they muſt
then forſake ſome of their Poſts, if they do not
we ſhall have them betwixt us and the Town,
and the Scituation thereof is ſuch, that their
Horſe will be of little uſe to them, in which
conſiſts their greateſt Force. My Lord <hi>Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe</hi>
is in great eſteem with his Highneſs the
Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and extreamly beloved by all
the Officers and beſt Men of our Army.</p>

ſent in the Governour of <hi>Flanders</hi>'s Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
a faithful Account of the State
of Affairs here; as alſo what hath happened
moſt remarkable in this Campagne. The <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Firſt</hi> inſtant, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> left the <hi>Mark,</hi>
a little fordable River that divides <hi>Auſtria</hi> and
<hi>Moravia</hi> from <hi>Hungary,</hi> that he might the better
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48791:8"/>
get to the Banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> above <hi>Fulme</hi> and
<hi>Crembs,</hi> there to paſs over for the diſpoſing Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for the great Affair, I mean, the relieving of
<hi>Vienna,</hi> hoping that thoſe two blows the Enemy
had already received, as well as the King of
<hi>Poland</hi>'s March towards their Confines, might
for a while retard their advancing in the Siege.
Yeſterday we encamped at <hi>Stockeraw,</hi> where we
were told, that a conſiderable Body of <hi>Turks</hi> and
<hi>Tartars</hi> had paſt the <hi>Mark,</hi> and we were quickly
convinc'd of the Truth of it, by the Flames of
Five or Six Villages; which we ſaw Burning
within a few Miles of our Camp, it being a
barbarous Cuſtom amongſt thoſe Infidels to ſet
all on Fire whereſoever they march: Upon this
his Highneſs, with a Flying Body of <hi>Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi>
Horſe reſolved to march immediately to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; we found them, being about
<hi>Twelve Thouſand,</hi> drawn in <hi>Battalia</hi> near the
Bridg of <hi>Vienna.</hi> His Highneſs in perſon char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on the right Wing, where the <hi>Turks</hi> gave
a furious Onſet, diſordering ſome of our <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Troops, but being preſently ſeconded by
ſome of our <hi>German</hi> Horſe they were put to
flight, with the loſs of <hi>Three hundred</hi> of their Men,
and <hi>Five Hundred</hi> more that were ſent from the
<hi>Grand Viſier</hi>'s Camp over the <hi>Danube</hi> in Boats,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48791:9"/>
thinking by the ſame means to ſave themſelves,
were ſo hotly purſued, that they were moſt of
them drown'd in the River, leaving their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
for a booty behind them. Our right wing
extended it ſelf to a little Wood, the left Wing,
where I commanded ſpreading it ſelf all along
the Plains, which the Enemy ſeeing encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them to bend their chiefeſt Force againſt us,
that they might fall upon us both in the Flank
and Rear; but Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Badin</hi> ordering
ſome of the Horſe on the Right Wing, by eaſie
Movements to cloſe in with us, and the Enemy
finding after ſeveral Attempts that they could
not break us, but were always repulſed with
Loſs, deſpairing of Succeſs, they drew off
their Squadrons upon a little Hill within Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſhot
of us, by which they kept us from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Reſerve, that might poſſibly have lain
hid behind them. At the ſame time that they
ſeem'd thus ready to engage us, a <hi>hundred and
fifty</hi> deſperate <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> perceiving the
diſtance that was betwixt our Squadrons, and
the <hi>Right Wing,</hi> ſliping behind the Wood fell
upon us in the Rear, but I ordering two Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of our Second Line to charge them, they
were quickly diſperſt, and few of them eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.
We did expect the Enemy would have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48791:9"/>
made uſe of this Diſorder to attack us with
their whole Body, but it was far otherwiſe, it
ſerving them only as an opportunity to ſave
themſelves, by a haſty Retreat; We by this
time finding that thoſe Squadrons of theirs
drawn up before us upon the ſaid Hill were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to amuſe and cover the Retreat of the reſt,
and it had been time loſt to purſue them with
our <hi>Curiaſſeers,</hi> who could not overtake them
in a Race <hi>Campagne,</hi> they never keeping toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and are very nimble and run with great
Swiftneſs, and impoſſible to get them into a
Body, unleſs they pleaſe themſelves; Our <hi>Poles</hi>
might have indeed purſued them, but ſeem'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
and his Highneſs judging that they
might probably be reinforced by <hi>Teckeley,</hi> who
but few days before was encamped near the
<hi>Mark,</hi> thought not fit to purſue them any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but to return to mind the great Affair,
which now drew near: The Enemy loſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
thoſe kill'd on the place, ſeveral Kettle
Drums, and above twenty Colours in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.
His <hi>Highneſs</hi> with ſingular Courage and
Bravery conducted this Engagement with the
Enemy, but too much expoſed his Perſon, as
he does too often upon all occaſions. We are
here ſtill intent, and at the Eve of our great buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48791:10"/>
the Relief of <hi>Vienna.</hi> His Majeſty of
<hi>Poland</hi> with above <hi>Twenty Thouſand</hi> Men will be
with us in ſeven days. <hi>Bavaria, Saxony</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia</hi>
have already ſent us <hi>Seven and Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi>
Men, and we are above <hi>Twenty Thouſand
Imperialiſts.</hi> If God be not againſt us, I hope
in a few days to ſend you a Relation of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Victory. My Lord <hi>Lanſdowne</hi> did parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
ſignalize himſelf in this Action, being
always in that part of the Fight where it was
hotteſt, and he is certainly a very gallant young
Man.</p>

great News, and I muſt add, that never Victory
of ſo great Importance, coſt ſo little blood.
There were no Officers kill'd on our ſide but
the Brother of the Prince <hi>de Crouy,</hi> the Count <hi>de
Trantmanstorf</hi> Major, the Count <hi>de Batzi</hi> Captain
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48791:12"/>

the <hi>Poles,</hi> who ſtood the ſhock of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rude Encounter, with a Tranſcendent Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
If the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> had been Maſter of
his Trade, we could never have paſt from the
Hills of <hi>Kalemberg</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> without a bloody
and deſperate Engagement, and upon very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous
Terms, we having three terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Defiles</hi> to paſs from the Mountains to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
But God did ſo infatuate them, that they
let our Foot and Dragoons quietly poſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſuch manner, as to ſecure our Cavalry,
who paſſing but one and two at a time poſted
themſelves under their very Noſes. Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
was ſo haſty that they left us all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery

they are found, what in their Approaches and
Camp, to amount to above <hi>One hundred and
Twenty</hi> Pieces of Canon, with a prodigious
quantity of Proviſions both of Ammunition
and Victuals, and all their Camp, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
themſelves ſo much Time as to take down
a Tent. The Field was covered every where
with all ſorts of rich booty; Our <hi>German Troops</hi>
marching through the middle of all this Spoyl,
and not a Soldier, either Foot or Horſe went
one Step out of his Rank to pillage, and we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48791:12"/>
value the glory of this Continence and Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of military Diſcipline more than all the
Booty of the <hi>Poles,</hi> which was incredible, All
the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi>'s Treaſure fell to their ſhare,
the King confeſſeth he hath gotten great Riches
and the Equipage of the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi>'s alone,
which fell to his Lot is valued at <hi>One Hundred
Thouſand Crowns.</hi> The <hi>Poles</hi> have alſo taken the
Great Standard of <hi>Mahomett,</hi> and the Horſe Tails
which the <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelf gave the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi>
on this great Expedition. Some of our Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
next day in rummaging their Tents, found
betwixt <hi>Five</hi> and <hi>Six Thouſand Duckats</hi> in ready
Money, and amongſt other things the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Reſident, who following the Army, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got

Priſoners avow, that of <hi>Forty Thouſand
Janizaries</hi> which came before the place, there are
not gone off <hi>Eighteen Thouſand.</hi> If night had not
come on us, at the very <hi>Suburbs</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> we
had made it an entire Victory; having already
gain'd the <hi>Defiles,</hi> and the Enemy was in an
extream Confuſion, and had we but two hours
more of Day-light, we ſhould have driven
them to the little River of <hi>Shwechet,</hi> where we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48791:13"/>
might have had them at our Mercy, but they
paſt it in the night, and though the Duke of
<hi>Loraine</hi> would have next Morning purſued
them at Break of Day, yet the King of <hi>Poland</hi>
thought it not fit, becauſe his Horſe had not
drank in <hi>Eight</hi> and <hi>Forty hours</hi> before: But thoſe
who are given to detract ſay, that the <hi>Poliſh</hi>

to take ſome Place on the <hi>Frontier. Teckeley</hi>
applys himſelf to the King of <hi>Poland</hi> for his

<hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Buda,</hi> of two <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s and Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Officers to be cut off, this will be a ready
way to make an end of his Army, if he kill thus
on one ſide, and we on the other. <hi>Adieu, In

being two conſiderable Breaches in both the

the Garriſon which conſiſted of <hi>Twelve Thouſand

been by reaſon of the backwardneſs of the
<hi>Poles</hi> to follow the purſuit next day. But the
<hi>Grand Viſier</hi> being enrag'd at this Diſgrace, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
his Fury upon the Officers of his Army,
having ſtrangled the <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Buda,</hi> a Man
of Eighty years of Age, (and as he was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48791:14"/>
perhaps the moſt able Perſon of the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Empire, ſo would he have prov'd the more
dangerous Enemy to him) with four other <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi>'s,
and <hi>Four or Five Hundred</hi> other <hi>Officers,</hi> upon
pretence that they did not do their parts, and
diſobeyed his Orders. The Count <hi>Budiani</hi> an
<hi>Hungarian Lord,</hi> who after our Retreat at <hi>Raab,</hi>
revolted with a conſiderable Party of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men
to the Rebel <hi>Teckeley,</hi> to give the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
a convincing Proof of his ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
cut in pieces <hi>two thouſand Auxiliary Turks</hi>
that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> had ſent to reinforce him,
and tho the advantage we got by his Treaſon
was very great, yet we could not but abhor
the Traitor. On the <hi>Fifth</hi> inſtant the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
with our Cavalry paſt the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
leaving our foot one days march behind;
but the Duke of <hi>Loraine</hi> having reſolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
<hi>Barrakan,</hi> was forc'd to ſtay ſome time for
the Foot, becauſe thoſe of <hi>Bavaria</hi> were for ſome
unhappy Reaſons ſix days march from us: The
King being told that there were not above <hi>Five
Thouſand Turks</hi> in <hi>Barrakan</hi> made his Troops ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily
advance towards it, without once acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Highneſs with the Deſign, and thinking
himſelf ſure, and that his very Avaunt Guard
would have carried it, hè did not ſo much as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48791:14"/>
march his Troops in <hi>Battalia,</hi> but his Ambition
and the great contempt he had of the Enemy
upon the Succeſs of <hi>Vienna</hi> coſt him dear; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the <hi>Five Thouſand Men</hi> which he was
told of, he found in a bottom under the very
Cannon of <hi>Barrakan</hi> a Body of Twelve Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
who inſtantly attackt the Avaunt Guard
of the <hi>Poles</hi> with ſuch a Fury, that though they
behaved themſelves bravely, they were at laſt
forc'd into their main Body, and that in ſuch
confuſion, that the whole Army which had not
then time to draw up into <hi>Battaile</hi> ſeized with
a panick Fear had been entirely routed, had not
the Duke of <hi>Loraine</hi> (who by this time heard of
the Kings departure) made his Troops haſtily
follow, and ſo kept them from farther diſorder.
My Brigade had this day the Avaunt Guard,
and his Highneſs ordering me to make haſte,
tho we had a <hi>Defile</hi> to paſs about half an hours
march from the Enemy, yet our Troops carryed
on with a deſire to redreſs the loſs, and repair the
affront received by their Allies, paſt it with all
chearfulneſs, and ſo in a very little time we
drew up in a Line of Fifteen Squadrons. The
Arrival thus of our Troops put ſoon a ſtop
to the Carriere of the TURKS, and gave
us an Opportunity thereby of paſſing the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48791:15"/>
reſt of our Men, and to the <hi>Poles</hi> of knowing
each other. The Enemy thus contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the advantage they had gotten over
the <hi>Poles,</hi> retired in good order into the bottom
where they were firſt, and we thought it not
then ſafe to follow them farther with the <hi>Poles,</hi>
who were, as it were ſtund with the blow they
had received, and under an apprehenſion that
the <hi>Grand Viſier's</hi> whole Army was there; They
thereupon encamp'd themſelves about an hours
diſtance from <hi>Barrakan</hi> near the <hi>Danube,</hi> and the
King was then of opinion to ſtay for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of the Foot, before they ſhould attempt
any thing farther. There were about <hi>One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Poles</hi> kill'd moſt of them Dragoons, who
having alighted from their Horſes in a Plain
were abandoned by the Horſe, and ſo cut in
pieces by the Enemy; the King ventur'd as far
as any Man with his uſual undaunted Courage,
and had it not been for a <hi>German Cavalier</hi> that
ſerv'd him, he had then certainly been either
kill'd or taken Priſoner, and his Majeſty in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital
made him a <hi>Colonel.</hi> The next day the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
<hi>Comte de Staremberg</hi> who ſo bravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<hi>Vienna</hi> came with <hi>Eight Thouſand</hi> Foot to
us. The <hi>Poles</hi> were ſo diſheartened by their
wounds, which were yet bleeding, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48791:15"/>
that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> with the reſt of
his Army might be near at hand, that they did
endeavour to divert the King from any farther
vigorous Action at that time, but the Duke of
<hi>Loraine</hi> did ſo ſtrongly preſs the contrary, that
they were at laſt brought to it. We march'd in
<hi>Battalia</hi> the ninth inſtant towards the Enemy,
his Highneſs giving the <hi>Poles</hi> their choice where
to poſt themſelves, but inſtead of the right wing
which till then they always affected, they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themſelves on both the Wings, and on our
Reſerve. The Enemy ſeeing us thus march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them came out of their bottom, ranging
themſelves in <hi>Battaile,</hi> and by the Confeſſion of
thoſe Priſoners that make them the moſt, the
<hi>Turks</hi> did not exceed <hi>Sixteen Thouſand Men,</hi> and
certainly there never was committed a greater
nor worſe ſupported raſhneſs, but yet they ſtood
us with that boldneſs at firſt, that the whole
<hi>Grand Viſier</hi>'s Army could not have done more,
and not being able to front our whole Line, they
drew up to the Right, and without once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to attack the <hi>German Squadrons</hi> fell with
an incredible Fury on thoſe <hi>Poles</hi> they found on
our Left, hoping to find as cheap a buſineſs of't
as they had done the day before: But the Great
General of <hi>Poland Iablonouski</hi> receiv'd them ſo
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48791:16"/>
briskly, that it ſtopt their Fury, and at the ſame
time we charging them with our firſt Line of
<hi>Curiaſſeers</hi> put them totally into diſorder. The
Defeat of thoſe was immediately followed with
a general Rout of all their Troops, and the
ſhock of the firſt Line of our ſaid Left Wing
was ſo vigorous and ſuccesful, that neither my
Lord <hi>Lanſdowne,</hi> to whom I had given the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of a Squadron in my Regiment, nor I my
ſelf, who commanded the Second Line of the
Wing that was attacked had either of us occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to fire a Piſtol: His Highneſs let looſe the
firſt Line of <hi>Curiaſſeers,</hi> the <hi>Croats,</hi> and ſome
<hi>Poles</hi> to the purſuit of thoſe that fled, whom we
chaſed with the points of our Swords in their
backs to the very Fort of <hi>Barrakan,</hi> making a
moſt terrible Slaughter of them, the Crowd of
thoſe that thought to ſave themſelves by the
Bridge was ſo great, that the Bridge broak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, and there were abundance of them
who threw themſelves into the <hi>Danube</hi> rather
than they would ſtand the Fury of our Men,
and the Revenge of the <hi>Poles.</hi> It is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that with thoſe who were ſlain, and thoſe
who were drown'd, the better half of their
Number periſhed, and one ſhall ſeldome find in
a pitch'd Battle a greater loſs of Men, theſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48791:16"/>
were the very flower of the <hi>Turkiſh Army,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the new <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Buda, Ali Baſſa</hi> of
<hi>Aleppo,</hi> and Six other <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s, the <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi>
was kill'd the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> of <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Silestria</hi> are
taken Priſoners, and a third <hi>Baſſa</hi> was drown'd.
We have alſo ſaved about ſix hundred Priſoners
from the Fury of the <hi>Poles,</hi> and there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
taken above <hi>three thouſand Horſes</hi> and at
leaſt as many drown'd. The taking of <hi>Barra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan</hi>
was a conſequence of this Victory, our Men
entring it vvithout Oppoſition, though there
vvere ſeveral <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and many others reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into it. But the <hi>Poles</hi> having firſt ſackt and
pillaged, ſeeing ſome of their Comrades heads
vvhich the <hi>Turks</hi> had pitch'd in Parade all along
the Pallizadoes of the Fort, did brutally in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
burn that place of Importance vvhich
vve vvould have preſerved. Let us however
give thanks to God vvho has thus ſo viſibly
ſhewn himſelf in his ovvn, and our Cauſe by
delivering our Enemies into our hands, I ſhall
continue to Give you a Faithful Relation of
vvhat paſſes here, and do intreat you to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate

your Lord Lordship the News, by an Expreſs that
was diſpatched to the <hi>Marquiſs</hi> of <hi>Grana,</hi> and have

by the Enemy till they ſaw our Horſe appear,
which by good luck marched ſome two hours after
the <hi>Pelanders,</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Lorains</hi> Command,
who was in the head of them; upon which the <hi>Turks</hi>
ceaſed their purſuit, and retired under the Canon

the next day the <hi>Eight</hi> inſtant, that our Infantry came

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48791:17"/>
towards them, and found them poſted in the ſame
poſture to receive us; the firſt Line of our Left Wing a
bout'noon charged their Right with ſo much vigour &amp;
Succeſs, that the Infidels were forced to give way, and
not long afterwards their whole Army betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſlight, and were purſued by ours to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſide, into which they precipitated themſelves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch

ſame night we attacked <hi>Barrakan,</hi> a Fort on this ſide
of the <hi>Danube</hi> at the head of the Bridge of <hi>Gran,</hi> and
have taken it by Aſſault; Our Priſoners tell us, they
were Sixteen Thouſand Men choſen out of the beſt of
their Troops, and ſent thither by the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi>

had their Communication with the Rebels, <hi>Carama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mett

make War. The Eaſineſs that the Duke of <hi>Loraine</hi>

the Enemy was in, and that he ought to
make the beſt uſe of it. <hi>His Highneſs</hi> paſſed the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube</hi>
