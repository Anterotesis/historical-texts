            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Anceſtors with ſo much <hi>Zeal</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Diſdain</hi> had ſhaken off!</p>
            <p>But too plain it is, that our own over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great <hi>Security,</hi> the reſtleſs Conſpiracies of thoſe <hi>ſworn Enemies of our Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Connivance</hi> and baſe Practices of a too prevalent <hi>Faction,</hi> have within ſome years paſt, by <hi>dark</hi> Intrigues and <hi>ſilent Steps,</hi> ſo far advanc'd their <hi>Helliſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,</hi> as juſtly to awaken our moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Apprehenſions.

            <p>The main Policy of theſe <hi>Engineers of Hell</hi> is, to conceal their Stratagems, <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brazen</hi> their Villanies, and create a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, or at leaſt raiſe <hi>Miſrepreſentations</hi> of their deteſtable Deſignes.

<pb facs="tcp:52053:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and for a ſmall Charge,</hi> we have in the following Leaves ſet forth a <hi>punctual Summary</hi> of their Actings, and all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings</hi> that have hitherto been had for bringing ſome of the Conſpirators to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and to prevent the Miſchiefs threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Reſt.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, my Lords! and Gentlemen! ſome <hi>Prints</hi> have already pretended to give the world ſuch an Account; but we conceive, upon impartial peruſal, they will be found not to <hi>anſwer that End.</hi> The ſeveral TRYALS of the Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors carefully <hi>taken,</hi> and publiſhed by Authority, are ('tis acknowledged) very ſatisfactory, as to the <hi>Judicial procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;</hi> but beſides that many other <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral paſſages</hi> are moſt requiſite to a true underſtanding of this <hi>voluminous Plot,</hi> the ſaid Tryals (for we know not whoſe private advantages) are <hi>ſwel'd to ſuch a price,</hi> that every honeſt man can neither ſpare <hi>money</hi> to buy, nor <hi>time</hi> to peruſe them.</p>
            <p>With pretence to remedy the <hi>latter,</hi> there was ſome time ſince emitted an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment</hi> of thoſe Tryals, under the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of THE HISTORY OF THE PLOT, though many cannot apprehend how it
<pb facs="tcp:52053:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhould deſerve <hi>that Name,</hi> ſince it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not one word of the <hi>Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,</hi> the <hi>Preparatives,</hi> manner of <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> and other Remarkables <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to an <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> but onely epitomizes the Tryals, and even of them, <hi>omits Staley</hi>'s and <hi>Reading</hi>'s which yet ſure had ſome <hi>relation to the Plot.</hi> Beſides, the witty <hi>Epiſtle</hi> prefixt, ſeems to drown the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> with Suggeſtions of an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary one of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> no leſs (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) to be dreaded; and yet even the amuſing people with ſuch <hi>Stories,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly a Part of the grand Popiſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. And whereas it tells us, That not <hi>one material point is omitted,</hi> moſt <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> cannot finde the ſubſtantial part of Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s <hi>Evidence against Wakeman</hi> (p. 46. of the Tryal) ſo much as hinted at; not to mention the groſs <hi>Shuffles</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 77. and elſewhere. So that had not the <hi>Ingenious</hi> Mr. <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> in a late <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> intituled, The FREE-BORN SUBJECT, been pleaſed to own himſelf Compiler of that <hi>petite Hiſtory,</hi> its Author might have lain under <hi>Ill Suſpitions.</hi> And yet even there he happens to give but an <hi>unhappy</hi> Reaſon for his undertaking that pains, <hi>viz.
<pb facs="tcp:52053:5"/>
Becauſe he found in the printed Tryals MANY groſs Incoherences, and VERY MATERIAL MISTAKES</hi> (yet inſtances but <hi>One,</hi> and <hi>corrected</hi> too, as an Erratum at the end of the next Tryal printed.) Now though the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> being ſo well a <hi>known</hi> Proteſtant, meant, no doubt, very <hi>honeſtly,</hi> yet 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible a ſcurvy <hi>miſchief</hi> may thence happen: For when our <hi>Poſterity</hi> ſhall urge theſe Tryals for <hi>proof</hi> againſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> (which certainly was the deſigne of taking them ſo curiouſly, and not a little <hi>paltry profit)</hi> how eaſily may the <hi>ſubtle Villains</hi> ſtop their mouths, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging from <hi>this Author,</hi> That no <hi>heed is to be given to the ſaid Tryals,</hi> being ſo publickly own'd by a perſon of his Note and late Qualification, to be <hi>guilty</hi> of ſo <hi>many</hi> and ſuch very MATERIAL MISTAKES? But the Gentleman that diſcovers ſo <hi>many Errours,</hi> may be allow'd to make <hi>ſome,</hi> eſpecially ſince he was ſo perplext in the mighty buſineſs, that he aſſures us, <hi>That reflecting upon the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the printed Tryals, together with the almost-inextricable difficulty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving the Truth out of ſuch a confuſion of Tautologies and Forms, the Collection
<pb facs="tcp:52053:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being ſo bulkie too, and the Particulars lying ſo ſcatter'd, it was next to the Work of a RES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RRECTION, to ſet every part in its right place.</hi>—Free-born Subject, p. 15.</p>
            <p>The POPISH COMPENDIUM was the next that attempted any thing of this kinde; whoſe Author in the <hi>Preface</hi> ſcandalizes the <hi>laſt-mentioned,</hi> by ſaying, That <hi>he jumpt with him in the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne;</hi> and addes, That <hi>he has past by, or ſlubber'd over ſeveral things which the Parties concern'd may juſtly inſist upon to be of great force in their buſineſs.</hi> This we are ſure of; The Deſigne of this <hi>Compendium</hi> is to <hi>viliſie</hi> the King's <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> ſlubber over the <hi>Plot,</hi> and make people as <hi>ſtupid</hi> in <hi>Politicks</hi> as they would have them in <hi>Divinity,</hi> even to believe contrary both to their <hi>Reaſon</hi> and their <hi>Senſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What we have here performed, or how far <hi>uſeful</hi> it may be, is left to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial <hi>Cenſure,</hi> and the <hi>Iſſue</hi> of Time: Such as it is, it humbly caſts itſelf at the <hi>feet</hi> of this <hi>Illuſtrious Great Council</hi> for <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Protection;</hi> for it may have need of <hi>both;</hi> though the Errours being all <hi>involuntary,</hi> may better hope for
<pb facs="tcp:52053:6"/>
Excuſe, and the <hi>End</hi> being <hi>honeſt,</hi> doth not much dread the <hi>Snarlings</hi> of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Slanderers, nor the <hi>Frowns</hi> of mighty Criminals.</p>

               <p>In their great and (by them acknowledged) <hi>general, Lateran</hi> Council, held under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, in the year of our Lord 1215, it is expreſsly and Synodically concluded, <hi>Can. 3. de Haereticis,</hi> That <hi>the Pope may Depoſe Kings, Abſolve their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance,</hi> Et Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram exponere Catholicis occupandam, <hi>and give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Kingdoms to Catholicks.</hi> And this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Body of the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Ninth, <hi>cap.

               </p>
               <p>The moſt famous of their School-men, <hi>Thomas Aquinas, l. 22. q. 12. Art.</hi> 2. affirms, <hi>That any man ſinning by Infidelity, may be adjudged to loſe all right of Dominion: and therefore ſo ſoon as anyone ſhall, for diſowning the Faith, be judicially denounced Excommunicate,</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>his Subjects are Abſolved from his Government, and from any Oath of Allegiance whereby they were bound to him.</hi> Nay, another of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52053:10"/>
their Doctors, <hi>Dominicus Bannes,</hi> is yet more haſty; for he will have the Subjects diſcharged from all Obedience, even <hi>before</hi> their Prince is ſo ſolemnly pronounced an heretick. His words are theſe: Num. 22. pag. 590. <hi>Where there is evident know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Crime,</hi> [Hereſie he means; that is, whatever the Pope and his Prieſts pleaſe to call ſo,] <hi>the Subjects may lawfully, if they have ſtrength ſufficient,</hi> [pray mark!] <hi>exempt themſelves from the power of their Prince, even before the Sentence De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory.</hi> And this Concluſion (ſaith he) is followed by <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and is the more common opinion of the <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> who generally approve thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Kings become Hereticks, forthwith their Subjects are freed from their Government,</hi> ſaith <hi>Simancha</hi> in his <hi>Catholick Inſtitutions,</hi> (a Book printed with great Approbation of Superiors,) <hi>Titul. 23.

               </p>
               <p>Their great Oracle, Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine, de Rom. Pontif. lib. 5. cap.</hi> 6. avers, <hi>That the Pope, as chief Spiritual Prince, may change Kingdoms, and take them away from one to give to another, if it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the ſalvation of Souls.</hi> And in the ſeventh Chapter, he advanceth a little further: for ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Heretical Princes (as we know all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are in their ſence) he ſays, <hi>Omnium Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſu

               <p>The common excuſe which Papiſts make for all the before-mentioned Treaſons againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> is, to pretend her Illegitimate; and that what they did, was to advance the juſter Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> great Grandmother to our preſent Soveraign. Thus in their <hi>Apology</hi> publiſht ſoon after their <hi>Burning of London,</hi> ſpeaking of theſe pranks, they ſay: <hi>It was a queſtion har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than that of</hi> York <hi>and</hi> Lancaſter, <hi>who had moſt right, Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>or</hi> Mary Stuart: <hi>for ſince the whole Kingdom had Crowned and ſworn Allegiance to Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>they had owned her Lagitimate Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth; and therefore it was thought neceſſarily to follow by many, That if</hi> Mary <hi>was the true Child,</hi> Elizabeth <hi>was the Natural; which muſt then give way to the thrice-Noble Queen of</hi> Scots.

For firſt, The Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> though a Papiſt, in his Speech at the publiſhing Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Death, declared, <hi>That no man could doubt of the juſtneſs of

the Lady</hi> Elizabeths <hi>Title to ſucceed.</hi> Secondly, The whole Kingdom received and owned her more freely and generally than ever they did Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Thirdly, Forreign Princes and States owned her, the greateſt Monarchs in <hi>Europe</hi> offering Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to her, in certain expectation of gaining the Crown by her; as <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>France,</hi> reſpectively for themſelves; and the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> for his Brother <hi>Charles.</hi> Fourthly, the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> herſelf did acknowledge her, and claimed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than to be Heir to her; and ſo did King <hi>James</hi> that was her Succeſſour. The firſt that ever queſtioned her Title, was Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth, who would not acknowledge her, nor hear Sir <hi>Edward Kerne</hi> her Ambaſſadour, for ſeveral cauſes; of which the prime was, becauſe (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) <hi>The Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>is a Fee of the Papacy, and it was audaciouſly done of her to aſſume it without his leave:</hi> [See the Hiſtory of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent, l.</hi> 5.] And then in the next place, he ſtarted <hi>her being Illegitimate,</hi> which indeed <hi>onely he</hi> had reaſon to do; for if her Fathers Marriage were good, the Popes power of <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> (one of the faireſt flowers in the Triple Crown) muſt be naught. Fifthly, yet again, after all this, his Succeſſour Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, in his Letter by <hi>Parpaglia,</hi> dated the fifth of <hi>May</hi> 1560, did own her, and would have done any thing for her, ſo ſhe would but have owned him; which ſhe refuſing, the next Pope, meerly for the ſame, Anathematiz'd and Depos'd her, as you have heard; there not being the leaſt mention in that Bull of <hi>Baſtardy,</hi> but onely for <hi>Hereſie,</hi> that is, for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52053:24"/>
being a Proteſtant, and refuſing to truckle to the Romiſh See. Laſtly, the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in general, in a large Petition to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the Twenty ſeventh year of her Reign, by them afterwards publiſhed in Print, in a Book with this Jeſuitical Title: <hi>Proteſtants Plea and Petition for Prieſts and Papiſts, p.</hi> 39. do ſay and ſwear the words following: <hi>We do proteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the living God, that all and every Prieſt or Prieſts, who have at any time converſed with us, have recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized your Majeſty their undoubted and lawful Queen, Tam de Jure quam de Facto,</hi> as well in Right as Fact.</p>
               <p>Wherefore 'tis evident, that their Conſpiracies againſt her were not for any defect in her <hi>Title,</hi> but on the ſcore of her <hi>Religion.</hi> And no leſs plain, that their <hi>boaſted ſervices</hi> for the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> were onely bottom'd on <hi>ſelf-intereſt,</hi> not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to her Perſon; and indeed, ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any advantage to her, that they cauſed the untimely ruine of that <hi>gallant Princeſs.</hi> Illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and the right of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> was ſo little regarded at <hi>Rome,</hi> that his Holineſs Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth, having a Baſtard of his own, <hi>James Buoncompagno,</hi> to provide for, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Emperours, <hi>viz. Don John;</hi> to the firſt he gave the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and equipp'd <hi>Stukely,</hi> as aforefaid, to win it for him: to the laſt he gave the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and gave him leave to win it for himſelf; and what then would have become of the Title of the Queen of <hi>Scots?</hi> They indeed made the Houſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> their Cloke, and covered their Treaſons, for ſome time, with pretences of gaining that Queens Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52053:24"/>
and advancing her Intereſt: but being at laſt out of hopes of reſtoring their Religion by her, or her Son, (whom they already perceived not to be for their turn) began to ſet up a feigned Title for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and employed one of their Society into <hi>England,</hi> (as is diſcovered by <hi>Paſquier</hi> a French Author) to draw off the Gentry from fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with her, and to cloſe with the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and cloſely endeavoured to precipitate her into thoſe <hi>fatal Counſels</hi> which haſtned her end: for ſhe being diſcovered to be <hi>privy</hi> to moſt of the former Conſpiracies, and found <hi>guilty</hi> of that of <hi>Babington,</hi> was thereupon Condemned. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, a freſh provocation being given by the ſaid Attempt of <hi>Moody,</hi> which was found to have been deſigned on the ſame pretence, Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> by the repeated importunities of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, (who had Ratified the Judgment) was over-perſwaded to ſign the Warrant for Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereupon, ſhe was Beheaded the eighth of <hi>February</hi> following.

And this Diſcovery by him made, muſt be ſuppoſed to be done out of <hi>pure love</hi> (forſooth) to his Queen and Country; although but a little before, he was one of thoſe very men, who inſtigated <hi>Savage</hi> to his Vow to Murder her. The whole conduct whereof, ſhews it to be a proſecution of their late-hatcht Spaniſh Deſign, by removing the true Heir apparent, and excluding the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Race, to make way for the forg'd Title which they had ſtarted for ſome of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Which is farther demonſtrated by their ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent carriage; for after her Death, whatever zeal they before pretended to her <hi>Title and Family,</hi> there were not the leaſt effects, thereof ſhewed to her Son King <hi>James,</hi> to whom her Right devolv'd; but rather they uſed all Arts to put him by the Succeſſion, as we ſhall ſhew in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>In the mean time we muſt obſerve, that ſtill their Plots againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> went on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, by the Pope and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in Warlick preparations both for Land and Sea-ſervice; and at home by the Jeſuits and other Emiſſaries, in providing for their reception. To amuſe the <hi>Engliſh Council,</hi> they publiſh a <hi>Book,</hi> wherein their Brethren are very gravely admoniſhed, not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing againſt their Prince, but onely to make uſe of the old Chriſtian Weapons, <hi>Prayers and Tears,</hi> humble petitions, and patient ſufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a <hi>Treaty of Peace</hi> deſired and kept on foot

by the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> by the King of <hi>Spains</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, till in the memorable year 88, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compleated for execution; the Pope begins the Invaſion with a Bull, by which, once again, <hi>The Queen is Curſed and proſcribed, her Royalty and Right to the Kingdoms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; her Subjects not only abſolved from their Oaths and Allegiance to her, but threatned under danger of the wrath of God, not to aſſiſt her in any wiſe, but to uſe all their power to bring her to wort by puniſhment. And therefore commands all Inhabitants of theſe Realms to joyn with the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>and be obedient to the Duke of</hi> Parma <hi>their General. And finally, out of the Treaſury of the Church committed to his truſt, draws out his liberality, and grants a full Pardon of all their ſins, to all thoſe that ſhould engage in this Expedition:</hi> Which was to be looke upon as an <hi>Apoſtolick Miſſion</hi> againſt the Incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hereticks, to reduce them to the Obedience of the Church, and execute his Holineſſes, Sentence of Excommunication againſt that curſed Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd Woman.

in 1593, <hi>Hesket</hi> endeavours to perſwade the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> to aſſume the Crown, as deſcended from <hi>Mary</hi> Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing large aſſiſtance of Men and Money from the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and withal, threatning him with ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den deſtruction, if he did not do it, and conceal the buſineſs; which he honeſtly revealing, was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, 'tis thought, not long after taken off by Poiſon, according to their Menaces.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time divers perſons were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned and ſent into this Realm, ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſome <hi>Iriſh,</hi> corrupted by Money and Promiſes, and Reſolved and Conjured by Prieſts in Confeſſion to Murder the Queen; of whom ſeveral were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as <hi>Patrick Cullen</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Fencer, <hi>Richard Williams,</hi> and <hi>Edmond York;</hi> which two laſt were engaged by <hi>Holt</hi> a Jeſuite, by Oath upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to perform it, and he himſelf kiſſing the Conſecrated Hoſt, ſwore, <hi>That as ſoon as ſhe was diſpatcht, they ſhould be paid Forty thouſand Crowns.</hi> But amongſt all theſe Execrable undertakings, they relyed moſt upon Doctor <hi>Lopez,</hi> ſworn Phyſician of her Majeſties Houſhold, who was practiſed with by one <hi>Andrada,</hi> on the behalf of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to Poiſon her, for which he was to have Fifty thouſand Crowns; but the Letters from Count <hi>de Fuentes,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Juara,</hi> aſſuring the payment of the Money, being fortunately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, <hi>The great ſervice whereby ſhould ariſe an univerſal benefit to the whole world,</hi> (for ſo thoſe Letters expreſſed this intended Helliſh Murder) was prevented, and <hi>Lopez</hi> (having not ſo good luck as ſome of his Quality ſince) was found guilty, and hang'd at <hi>Tyburn.</hi> As was likewiſe afterwards, in

Whence we may judge, how little welcome they were like to afford him at his Entry; and of this, the worthy Authour of a Treatiſe publiſhed in the beginning of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, (before the Gun-powder-Treaſon) Intituled,—<hi>A Conſideration of the Papiſts Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> gives us a notable inſtance from his own Experience and Obſervation, in theſe words, p. 3. <hi>My ſelf can teſtifie, that here in</hi> Oxford, <hi>at what time His Majeſty was proclaimed King of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c. a man might eaſily have traced and culled out every Papiſt within this City, by his extraordinary howling and ſobbing for grief, that their hopes were fruſtrated, and their expectation all in vain; ſome of the ſimpler ſort crying out in expreſs terms,</hi> Alas! alas!

               <p>Their demeanor afterwards, was ſuitable to theſe beginnings; for ſoon after his arrival at <hi>London,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Watſon</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> two Secular Italianated Prieſts, wheadled in ſeveral of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, as the Lords <hi>Cobbam</hi> and <hi>Gray,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> Sir <hi>Griffin Markham, George Brooke,</hi> and others, into a dangerous Conſpiracy, to have ſurprized the Kings Perſon, and his Son Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and to keep them Priſoners in the <hi>Tower</hi> or <hi>Dover Caſtle,</hi> till by <hi>Dureſs</hi> they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their ends, <hi>viz.

'Tis obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>Watſon,</hi> though a Secular Prieſt, had yet learned the art of Equivocation, as well as the Jeſuits; For he inſiſted, that this Conſpiracy was <hi>no Treaſon againſt the King;</hi> and being at laſt put to explain himſelf, gave this doughty reaſon, <hi>That a King was no King before he was Anointed, and the Crown ſolemnly ſet on his head:</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> being not yet crowned, therefore they might lawfully conſpire againſt him, without commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any Treaſon.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other things which <hi>Watſon</hi> Confeſſed, one was, that he had endeavoured to draw in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Society of Jeſuits into this Plot, but they declined it; ſaying, <hi>They had another of their own then on foot, and that they would not mingle Deſigns with him, for fear of hindring one the other.</hi> [Vide <hi>Watſons</hi> Confeſſion.] What ſuch their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was, though <hi>he</hi> could not, yet <hi>time</hi> in few years after did <hi>diſcover:</hi> for in the next place appears that horrid never-to-be-forgotten <hi>Popiſh Pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der-plot,</hi> a Treaſon that as it exceeded all that had ever been before in the World, ſo it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, it would have ſurpaſſed in its miſchievous Deſign, Extent, and Cruelty, all that teeming Hell and <hi>Rome</hi> could have bred at any time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, had not this <hi>laſt Internal Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,</hi>

refer the Reader. Onely ſhall note here, that whereas Papiſts of late years have endeavoured to whiffle off that curſed Attempt, as a contrivance of Secretary <hi>Cecils,</hi> or ſome other Politicians, that had, to make the Romaniſts odious, cunningly drawn in onely a few deſperado's; and that but a very ſmall number of the Romiſh Party, and thoſe inconſiderable, were engaged therein; and ſo it ought not to be charged on their Church in general.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> the ſame is a moſt falſe and groundleſs Evaſion, coyn'd ſome ſcores of years after the thing Tranſacted; none of thoſe that ſuffered for it, alleadging or ſuſpecting one ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either at their Tryals or Deaths, of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo wheadled into the Conſpiracy; who yet were moſt like to know how, and by whom they were (if at all they had been) ſo <hi>drawn in,</hi> whom undoubtedly they would have diſcovered.

               <p>As to the ſecond, neither was the <hi>number</hi> even of thoſe that after all their <hi>Oaths of Secreſie,</hi> and cloſe contrivances were diſcovered, ſo <hi>ſmall,</hi> nor their <hi>Qualities</hi> ſo inconſiderable, as is now impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſuggeſted: for firſt, for Religious men there were many actually concerned in it, and perſons of the greateſt account, three or four of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially being Legiers and States-men; as <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> the Superiour or Provincial of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, [the ſame place that Father <hi>Whitebread</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

And that the Parliament vows to begin where they left, and will never give over until they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated him and his Poſterity. On the other ſide, the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52053:35"/>
ſame Parties, who are to be admired for their indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable Induſtry, inceſſantly foment Revenge and Jealouſie in the moſt of the Parliament-men; and eſpecially they work upon the pride and vain-glory of ſuch who have been Impriſoned, poſſeſſing them, They are the onely Martyrs and Worthies of their Countrey.</hi> London <hi>is as much diſtempered, as ever</hi> Florence <hi>was: for the Companies are at odds, and the Common Council have oppoſed the Magiſtrates againſt their own Cuſtoms, in the Election of the Knights, which hath bred a great heart-burning in the City; ſo that twice a day we could divulge what we liſt in</hi> Pauls, <hi>and upon the</hi> Exchange. <hi>And we have already rendred our irreconcileable Enemy the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>as odious as a Toad. For the people are apt to believe any thing againſt him; we hope to be revenged of that Ball of Wildfire, and quench his fury. You ſhall ſee the ſame Swords that have wounded us, (being drawn upon the Wounds, with an oyl we have) ſhall make us whole. And thus it ſhall be done: The Parliament as a great Ship hath daſht twice againſt the ſame Rock, and we have ſo wrought upon the ſeveral Complexions of Parliament-men, in charming the moſt Temperate and Wiſeſt, that the beſt way to overthrow the Duke, is by way of humble Petition to His Majeſty: But with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter ſort we have taken a contrary courſe, by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their paſſions, and inebriating their fancies with probabilities and Preſidents that were never heard of, That Favorites have not been Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; they may wraſtle a while, but at laſt the Parliament have overthrown them upon their backs. We encourage them with all the wit we have to fall upon the Duke, and perſwade them now is the time
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52053:36"/>
or never, the King being in ſuch neceſſity; inſomuch, as we aſſure our ſelves, God hath ſo forſaken them, that they ſhall not onely ſtrike and daſh upon the ſame Rock again, but ſink and wrack in the bottomleſs ſea of deſtruction.</hi>

                        <hi>We have now many ſtrings to our bow, and have ſtrongly fortified our Faction, having added two Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works more. For when King</hi> James <hi>lived, you know he was very violent againſt Arminianiſm, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted with his peſtilent Wit, and deep Learning, our ſtrong deſigns in</hi> Holland; <hi>and was a great friend to the old Rebel and Heretick the Prince of</hi> Orange. <hi>But now we have planted that Soveraign drug Arminianiſm, which we hope will purge the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants from their Hereſie, and it</hi> flouriſheth, <hi>and bears fruit in due ſeaſon. The materials which build up our other Bull-work, are the Projectors and Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars of all Ranks and qualities whatſoever. Both theſe Factions co-operate to deſtroy the Parliament, and introduce a new Species and Form of Government, which is Oligarchy; and ſerve as direct Mediums and Inſtruments to</hi> our <hi>end, which is, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Catholick Monarchy. Our Foundation muſt be Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, this Mutation will cauſe a Reluctation, which will ſerve as ſo many violent diſeaſes (as the Stone, the Gout,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>to the ſpeedy deſtruction of our perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and inſufferable anguiſh of Body, which is worſe than death it ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We proceed by Counſel and mature Deliberation, when and how to work upon the Dukes jealouſie and revenge; and in this we give the honour to thoſe who merit it, who are the Church-Catholicks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There is another matter of conſequence, which we take much into our conſideration and tender cares,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52053:36"/>
which is, to ſtave off the Puritans, that they hang not in the Dukes ears; they are impudent ſubtle people, and 'tis to be feared leſt they ſhould negotiate a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement between the Duke and the Parliament. 'Tis certain the Duke would have gladly reconciled himſelf to the Parliament at</hi> Oxford <hi>and</hi> Weſtminſter; <hi>but now we aſſure our ſelves, we have ſo handled theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that both Duke and Parliament are irreconcileable. For the better prevention of the</hi> Puritans, <hi>the</hi> Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians <hi>have already blockt up the Dukes ears, and we have thoſe of our Religion which ſtand continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at the Dukes Chamber, to ſee who comes in and out; and we cannot be too circumſpect in this regard. I cannot chooſe but laugh to ſee ſome of our Coat, how they have accoutred themſelves; you would ſcarce know them if you ſaw them; and it is admirable how in ſpeech and geſture they act the</hi> Puritans.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Cambridge-<hi>Scholars, to their woful experience, ſhall ſee we can act the</hi> Puritan <hi>a little better than they have done the Jeſuit: They abuſed our Sacred Patron</hi> Ignatius <hi>in jeſt, but we will make them ſmart for it in earneſt. I hope you will excuſe my merry di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; for I confeſs unto you, I am at this time tranſported with joy, to ſee how happily all inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and means, as well great as leſs, co-operate to our purpoſes. But to return to the main Fabrick, our Foundation is</hi> Arminianiſm; <hi>the</hi> Arminians <hi>and Projectors, as it appears in the premiſes, affect Mutation; this we ſecond and enforce by probable Arguments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the firſt place we take into conſideration the Kings Honour and preſent neceſſity; and we ſhew how the King may free himſelf of his Wardſhip, (as</hi> Lewis <hi>the Eleventh did) and for his greater ſplendour and luſtre, he may raiſe a vaſt Revenue, and not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beholding
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52053:37"/>
to his Subjects, which is by way of Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Exciſe. We inſtance the Low-Countries, and ſhew what a maſs of money they raiſe to pay their Forces by Sea and Land meerly out of Exciſe. Then our Church-Catholicks proceed to ſhew the means how to ſettle the Exciſe, which muſt be by a mercenary Army of Horſe and Foot. For the Horſe, we have made it ſure, they ſhall be Foraigners and</hi> Germans, <hi>who will eat out the Kings Revenue, and ſpoil the Countrey whereſoever they come, though they ſhould be well paid; what Havock then will they make, when they get no pay, or are not duely paid every Month! ſurely they will do much more miſchief than we hope the Catholick Army will do. We are provident and careful that this mercenary Army of 2000 Horſe, and 20000 Foot, ſhall be taken in, and in pay before the Exciſe be ſetled; and in forcing the Exciſe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is moſt like to riſe. If the mercenary Army ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate the Countrey, then the Souldiers and Projectors ſhall be paid out of the Confiſcations. If the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey be too hard for the Souldiers, then they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Mutiny; which is equally advantagious for us. Our Superlative Deſign, is to work the Proteſtants as well as the Catholicks, to welcome in a Conqueror, and that is by this means: we hope inſtantly to diſſolve all Trade, and hinder the Building of Ships, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing probable Deſigns, and put the State upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, (as that of</hi> Cadiz) <hi>in taking away the Merchants Ships, and putting them in hopes of taking the</hi> Weſt-India <hi>Fleet, (which is to ſeek a needle in a bottle of hay.) His Catholick Majeſty ſhall not want our beſt Intelligences; beſides, he hath Pinaces and Advice-Boats, which are ſtill abroad to diſcover; ſo that you cannot be ſurprized in any Harbour.</hi>

                        <hi>When Trade is ruined, and Shipping decayed, what will become of Exciſe? nay, what will become of Noblemens and Gentlemens Revenues? the poor Yeomen and Farmers, in which conſiſts the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and glory of the Kingdom, they will turn Rogues, and reſemble the Abject Peaſants in</hi> France, <hi>who are little better than Slaves.

               <p>In the Month of <hi>September</hi> 1640.

               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:52053:39"/>The general Contents whereof were:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there was then on foot a Plot laid by the Jeſuits and Papiſts, for Subverting the Realm and State of <hi>England,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying and Murthering his moſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Majeſty, <hi>p.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Original Author of this Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was born, bred up, and had for many years been Dignified in the Romiſh Church, and appointed by Cardinal <hi>Barberino</hi> to aſſiſt <hi>Con</hi> the Popes Legate in managing the ſaid Conſpiracy; the cruelty and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs whereof ſo terrified his Conſcience, that he abandoned that Communion, and embraced the Orthodox Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the ſaid <hi>Con</hi> was the chief Patron and Director of the buſineſs, and had his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at <hi>London,</hi> where he had endeavoured by various Arts to corrupt divers <hi>great men</hi> of the Kingdom; and particularly ſought to practice on the Arch-biſhop, by the offer of a Cardinals <hi>Cap;</hi> but finding no good to be done upon him, reſolv'd to <hi>cut off</hi> both the King and him, <hi>Art.</hi> 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That in order thereunto, they made it their buſineſs to inflame the <hi>Puritans</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſtir up the people in <hi>Scotland</hi> to Commotions, <hi>Art.</hi> 9.</p>

a general <hi>Liberty to Exerciſe the Popiſh Religion;</hi> which if he ſhould refuſe, then the King was to be <hi>diſpatcht;</hi> for an <hi>Indian</hi> Nut ſtuffed with moſt ſharp <hi>poyſon,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by the Society, (which <hi>Con</hi> at that time frequently in a boaſting manner had ſhewed to the Informant) wherein a Doſe was prepared for the King, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his Father, <hi>Artic.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Chaplain of the Marqueſs of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> (who oft was employed without effect by the King, to appeaſe the Scotiſh Tumults) held Correſpondence with <hi>Con,</hi> who being once askt in joque by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant, <hi>Whether the Jews alſo agreed with the Samaritans?</hi> the ſaid <hi>Con</hi> anſwered with a wiſh, <hi>That all Miniſters were but ſuch as he.</hi>

               <p>All this was diſcovered to the Ambaſſador un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Oath of <hi>Secreſie,</hi> and the moſt importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Requeſts to the King and Arch-biſhop to keep it cloſe till the buſineſs might be ripe, and to conceal whence they had theſe Advertiſements; for otherwiſe, the Diſcoverer would certainly be in danger of his life, from the Confederates and their Aſſociates.

               <p>WE have hitherto ſeen the reſtleſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable malice of the Romiſh Prieſts and Emiſſaries, continually conſpiring and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by all kind of Arts, ever ſince the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſubvert the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Government in theſe Nations; ſo that we may reckon the Raigns of our late Princes, by a Succeſſion of Popiſh Treaſons. In diſplaying whereof we have been the <hi>larger,</hi> as well that the World may take notice that their late <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Plot</hi> was nothing ſtrange or incredible; (for what wonder is it to hear an Horſe neigh, to find a Fox crafty, or a Tyger cruel, or ſee thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in Trayterous and bloody practices, whoſe Doctrines recommend the ſame as <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>Merit,</hi> and who have for ſo many Ages been inured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?) as alſo to ſatisfie the Reader, that the Conſpiracy which now threatned us, is all of a piece with thoſe under which our Anceſtors la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, that 'tis ſtill the ſame Tragedy, though the Scenes have been often <hi>ſhifted,</hi> and the Actors varied according to the different poſture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52053:49"/>
a continued <hi>ſtream</hi> of Treaſon flowing from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which though ſometimes interrupted, diverted, or (like the River <hi>Arethuſa)</hi> hid under ground, yet it perpetually, ſometimes ſwifter, ſometimes ſlower, kept on its courſe: but how and by what acceſſional <hi>Springs,</hi> Forreign <hi>Tides,</hi> or Domeſtick <hi>Land-floods,</hi> it came now to ſwell to ſo great and <hi>extraordinary an Head,</hi> juſt ready to ore-whelm us, may be worth inquiry. To give an exact account of <hi>all</hi> Circumſtances at <hi>home</hi> and <hi>abroad,</hi> that contributed to the ripening and facilitating of this Plot, and which favouring the Deſign, encouraged the Conſpirators to puſh forwards the ſame at <hi>this,</hi> rather then another time, requires more converſation in Court-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, than we dare pretend to.

               <p>For as this Plot aim'd not <hi>ſolely</hi> at theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but was truely <hi>Catholick,</hi> [general or univerſal] to root out the Proteſtant Religion from the face of the earth; ſo no man that conſiders the preſent State of Chriſtendome, can be ignorant what a <hi>vaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs</hi> within few years laſt paſt they have made, in order thereunto. The French Kings Arms no doubt are employed chiefly for <hi>Conqueſt and Glory;</hi> yet 'tis as unqueſtionable, that the <hi>Jeſuits and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52053:50"/>
Court of Rome</hi> know how to improve them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to their advantage. For if we reflect on the late proceedings of the <hi>French,</hi> and their modern Irruption which they made into <hi>Holland</hi> few years ſince, the manner of the Attempt, and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before and after; we may ſee that haughty Monarch hath plainly taken off his Mask, and is to be regarded in this Conjuncture, not onely in the ſame Character as Conquerors of former Ages, towards all Eſtates who had the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be adjacent to their Frontiers; but that he ought alſo to be formally look'd upon, as the declared <hi>Protector of the Tyrannick Deſigns of the Papacy;</hi> and conſequently, the pre-meditated and poſitive Enemy and deſtroyer of all the <hi>States and People</hi> whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> is oppoſite to that Tyranny. And though in his Declaration of War againſt the States-General, 27 <hi>March</hi> 1672. he was pleaſed to aſſign no reaſon but his <hi>Glory,</hi> yet 'tis averr'd in print, that by his Embaſſador to the Pope, he gave afterwards a more clear Account, <hi>viz. That he had not undertaken this War, but for the Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hereſie:</hi> and to the Emperour declared, <hi>That the</hi> Hollanders <hi>were a people, who having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken God, and being Hereticks, all good Chriſtians were in duty bound to aſſociate for their Extirpation, and ought to pray to God for a bleſſing upon ſo pious an Enterpriſe.</hi> And to other Popiſh Princes, <hi>That it was a War of Religion, and in order to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Catholick Faith.</hi> Purſuant to which, in the Second Article of his Demands afterwards to the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> it is in expreſs words contained: <hi>That thenceforth there ſhall be, not onely an entire Liberty, but a publick Exerciſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

Apoſtolick Roman Religion, throughout all the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> &amp;c. And as he hath been thus active to <hi>promote Popery abroad,</hi> ſo he has been no leſs buſie to <hi>deſtroy Proteſtants at home;</hi> having ſuppreſſed ſo many of their Churches, contrary to Solemn Edicts, put down their Academies, made them incapable of any Office or Preferment, and by all kind of diſcouragements and preſſures, endeavoured to ruine them. The Conſpirators therefore having ſuch a powerful friend to <hi>Abet</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſt</hi> them, who beſides the glorious <hi>Rattle</hi> of propagating Catholick Religion, a ſpecious motive in publick, is alſo obliged by <hi>reaſon of State,</hi> (a more Sacred Tye amongſt ſuch Princes) to <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> by all Arts, that in the mean time he may ſweep away the <hi>Trade</hi> of the World, (chiefly managed by theſe two) and put them both in a condition to be made abſolutely <hi>his Slaves,</hi> wherever he ſhould think fit to extend his yoak. 'Tis no wonder then, I ſay, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators <hi>venture bard,</hi> with ſuch encouragement, to accompliſh their Deſigns, in the drudging Secular Butchering part whereof, he hath already made ſo fair (or rather monſtrouſly foul) an advance.</p>
               <p>Long ſince have the Jeſuits learnt how to ſhrowd themſelves under the ambitious wings of the moſt <hi>potent active Princes,</hi> and by pretence of promoting <hi>their</hi> intereſts, to ſet up their <hi>own.</hi> When in the laſt <hi>Century</hi> the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family was in its <hi>ruffling grandeur</hi> graſping at Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, how entirely did they ſeem devoted to that Houſe?

more to a kind of Neutrality and indifference, by a too general debauching of the younger Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with Principles of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> no ſmall part of their Policy; for thoſe that were really of no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> were very fit to comply with theirs. To carry on the Intrigue, multitudes of <hi>Jeſuits, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> of ſeveral Orders daily came over without any let or puniſhment, and appeared almoſt <hi>publickly,</hi> as if in Contempt of Law, they car'd not who knew them to be ſuch; they ſaid Maſs up and down, and had their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in Engliſh frequently at their pleaſure; and the Popiſh <hi>Court-Merry-Andrew,</hi> that <hi>Buffoon-Prieſt</hi> Father <hi>Patrick,</hi> (who ſeemed to affect Father <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipers</hi> Title of <hi>Joculator Chriſti,</hi> Chriſt's Jeſter, as their Book of Conformities, <hi>p.</hi> 106. moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanely calls him) did not a little contribute to the miſchief, by the great intereſt he had obtained amongſt perſons of very high quality, by whoſe influence they afterwards ſcrew'd many of their Party into conſiderable Offices and places of Truſt <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military,</hi> at <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſpenſations to go to Church, receive the Sacrament, or take <hi>any Teſt,</hi> the better to colour the matter; and on the contrary, who ever they thought was of a ſpirit to oppoſe their Deſigns, they procured to be turned out, and diſgraced with the Title of a <hi>Fanatick,</hi> a <hi>Rumper,</hi> or <hi>diſaffected</hi> to the Government.</p>
               <p>This formidable <hi>increaſe</hi> of Popery, and Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of that Party, was not unregarded by judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men, but lookt upon as a thing very omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and of dangerous conſequence; inſomuch, that the then Parliament (though oft-times
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52053:52"/>
thought <hi>remiſs</hi> enough on ſuch occaſions) could not but take notice of it: for on Munday the 29th of <hi>April,</hi> 1678. theſe following Reaſons were agreed to be uſed at a Conference with the Lords, concerning the dangers the Nation is in by the growth of Popery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe Houſe of Commons taking into ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the dangers ariſing to this Kingdom from the reſtleſs endeavours of Prieſts and Jeſuits, and other Popiſh Recuſants, to ſubvert the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion planted amongſt us, and to reduce us again under the Bondage of Roman Superſtition and Idolatry; and finding how great boldneſs they have aſſumed to themſelves, from the great remiſneſs and connivance of His Majeſties Officers and Miniſters of Juſtice, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, whereby ſo many good and neceſſary Laws, heretofore made againſt them, have not of late times been put in any effectual exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They do therefore think it requiſite to apply ſame remedy to this growing Evil; eſpecially at this time, wherein the unity of Affections, and the mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence between His Majeſty and his People, dath ſo much conduce to the preſervation of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And becauſe they have found by experience, that all thoſe applications they have ſormerly made upon this Subject, have not produced any effects anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to their expectations, they have endeavoured to diſcover the Cauſes and Grounds thereof, which they conceive are principally theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The difficulty of convicting a Romiſh Prieſt by proving their Ordinations by Authority derived from
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52053:53"/>
the See of</hi> Rome; <hi>which makes them more confidently to appear in publick, and perform their Offices and Functions without fear of puniſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>That Juſtices of the Peace are diſcouraged, becauſe thoſe that have been forward in executing the Laws againſt Papiſts, in ſuch Countries where they do moſt abound, have been turned out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, without any apparent cauſe, whilſt others who have been Popiſhly inclined, have been continued in Commiſſion, or put in</hi> de novo.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>That in ſeveral Countries many Proteſtant Diſſenters have been Indicted under the notion of Popiſh Recuſants, and the penalties of the Act levyed upon ſuch Proteſtant Diſſenters, when the Papiſts there have been either totally, or for the moſt part diſcharged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>That the Papiſts do evade the penalties of the Laws, by making over their Eſtates, by ſecret Truſts, and fraudulent Conveyances, yet receiving the profits of them to their own uſe and benefit; whereas in former times, conſiderable Sums of money were raiſed by the Forfeitures of Popiſh Recuſants. That now, by the remiſneſs of ſome, and diſcouragements of others of His Majeſties Officers and Miniſters of Juſtice, little or nothing is levyed upon them, or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be levyed hereafter, unleſs the care thereof be committed to perſons Commiſſionated in the ſeveral Countries for the advancement of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which may encourage perſons to ſee it exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:52053:53"/>
V. <hi>That perſons are not diſcouraged to bring up their Children, or ſuffer them to be bred up in the Popiſh Religion, becauſe they are as capable of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting the Eſtates of their Parents, or Relations, as any other of His Majeſties Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Commons do therefore moſt earneſtly deſire your Lordſhips to conſider the danger and ſad conſequences that may befal this Kingdom by the ſpreading of that Religion amongſt us, and ſeriouſly and cordially to joyn with them in removing theſe and all other impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, which obſtruct the courſe of Juſtice, and the due execution of the Laws, either by expediting thoſe Remedies which have been offered by them to your Lordſhips, or by propoſing ſuch others as may be more effectual; and that this may be done with all Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe the Commons cannot think it ſuitable to their Truſt, for them to conſent to lay any further charge upon the people, how urgent ſoever the occaſions may be that require it, till their minds be ſatisfyed, that all care and diligence is uſed to ſecure the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and prevent the dangers that may ariſe from the prevalency and countenance that is given to that Party, by ſome more effectual courſe than hath been provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Parliament being ſoon after by the ill influences of unhappy Councils <hi>Prorogued,</hi> nothing was done, ſo that the Conſpirators went on with their Game more vigorouſly than ever; they had gain'd the <hi>Heir Preſumptive</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to own their Religion; whence they aſſumed no ſmall

                  <hi>confidence;</hi> they had made ſure of the French King for their <hi>Friend,</hi> and he made as ſure of ſeveral Engliſh Courtiers for his <hi>Penſioners:</hi> they had formed their deſign, engag'd great perſons in it at home, and ſetled Correſpondencies abroad: an Army was on foot ſo Officer'd, as might give them hopes to debauch it; or if that fail'd, they had got Commiſſions from the Pope to raiſe one of their own; and to Crown the work, his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs had provided an Engliſh Cardinal <hi>[Howard]</hi> like a ſecond <hi>Pool,</hi> to reconcile and receive us again into the boſome of Mother Church.—Thus all things were prepared; <hi>Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the Lamb?</hi> We cannot ſay here, <hi>Deus providebit;</hi> but we muſt ſay, theſe bloody Traytors had deſigned <hi>one for Sacrifice,</hi> even our <hi>gracious King;</hi> (whom God long preſerve) as knowing they could never deſtroy our <hi>Religion,</hi> till they had firſt deſtroyed him, who is (and <hi>long may he live to be)</hi> the <hi>Defender</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>And certainly whatever Papiſts may ſuggeſt, who becauſe the Conſpiracy did not take, would fain perſwade us there never was <hi>any,</hi> that next time they may do their buſineſs more effectually: and how lowd ſoever ſome very <hi>indifferent</hi> Proteſtants, and men of <hi>droll,</hi> may laugh at the mention of a <hi>Maſſacre,</hi> and the general deſtruction of all that ſhould not conform to the Romiſh Church in theſe Nations, as a thing more <hi>extravagant</hi> to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, more <hi>impoſſible</hi> to be effected, than any Romance-Adventure; yet conſiderate men will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that as things ſtood, and had not this Plot been diſcovered, nothing to an humane

               <p>AS Hell and <hi>Rome</hi> had <hi>improv'd</hi> all their skill and force to manage this hideous Plot, and bring it to perfection; ſo <hi>Almighty God</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the provocations of our manifold ſins) was graciouſly pleaſed to appear for our <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,</hi> by blaſting all their long-ſtudyed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and Deſigns with a Miſcarriage, juſt when they were ready for the <hi>Birth.</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument made uſe of by Providence, for this great work, was Mr <hi>Titus Oates,</hi> a Name which (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Slanders and Calumnies of his, becauſe our Religions and Nations Enemies) will be dear and honourable in after-Ages, as well as the preſent, to all true Proteſtants, eſpecially of theſe Kingdoms, whom he hath been ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſerviceable to preſerve; and therefore it will be requiſite here to give ſome brief account of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:52053:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As for his Education, it was <hi>Liberal,</hi> in the courſe of Learning, being bred a Student in St. <hi>John</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he took his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: and that as Heaven had endued him with good Natural parts, an inquiſitive Genius, quick Apprehenſion, wary Judgment, and tenacious Memory; ſo he had not been wanting in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe <hi>Talents,</hi> and cultivating thoſe happy ſeeds by pains and induſtry. For acquired Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, appears, by his proceeding Doctor in Divinity at <hi>Salamanca</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> no contemptible Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, where he performed all his <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> ſaid by experienced perſons to be more <hi>difficult</hi> than thoſe that are commonly exacted elſewhere. He was formerly Vicar at <hi>Bobbing</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> to which he came in the year 1672. but the Air not being good, left it, and was ſometime Miniſter near <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and afterwards came to be <hi>Chaplain</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> with an ample teſtimony of his Life and Converſation. In all theſe ſtations he was a perſon of a ſober Life, and never charged with Debauchery: whence 'tis plain, that all thoſe ſcandalous <hi>Aſperſions</hi> ſince ſpread abroad by the Romaniſts, are falſe, and raiſed by malice, ſince they were never heard of <hi>before</hi> he was engaged in this Diſcovery. Nor can it be imagined, that the Jeſuits would have eſteemed him ſo much, or truſted him ſo far as they did, had they not found him a perſon, as of good parts, ſo of a diſcreet, ſober deportment, fit to be employed in affairs of Moment.</p>
               <p>The manner and occaſion how he came enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged amongſt them, is thus related. Whilſt he was the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Chaplain, he over-heard
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52053:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſome <hi>whiſperings</hi> amongſt the Prieſts, (with whom that Family was ſufficiently haunted) That there was <hi>ſome grand Deſign on foot,</hi> but could not learn what it was in particular. He had heard from his Proteſtant Friends, and read in Sir <hi>Hamond L'Eſtrange</hi>'s Hiſtory of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and other judicious Authors, That the Papiſts had for many years carried on a Deſign to introduce Popery again into theſe Nations; which created in him a longing deſire to <hi>ſound the depth of it,</hi> and, if it were poſſible, <hi>to Countermine it.</hi> To this end, he entred more freely into Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſome of that Tribe concerning Religion; who greedy of gaining ſuch a Proſelyte, failed not to preſs him with variety of Arguments: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that at laſt he ſeemed as if he were <hi>diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed</hi> in ſome things concerning our Church, and deſired an opportunity to diſcourſe with ſome of their <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> as being vogued the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and able Men of that Party. This on ſome preliminary cautions was procured; and after ſundry Conferences with them, in which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to be overcome, he was formally reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shortly after this, ſeeming to aſpire to the higheſt degree of perfection, (which to be ſure the Jeſuits place in their Society, to which they have blaſphemouſly arrogated the Sacred Name of <hi>Jeſus)</hi> he requeſted ſome of thoſe Fathers that he might be <hi>admitted to their Order;</hi> which after three days conſideration they were willing to conſent to. And as a particular favour, becauſe he was a man of years, (being then about eight and twenty) they told him, they would not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52053:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him as uſually they did <hi>Novices,</hi> (for ſo they call their young Students) in drudgery for the firſt two years, but he ſhould ſpend that time in being a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> for their Society.</p>
               <p>This exactly fitted his Deſign; and ſo, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he was ſent with Letters to <hi>Valladolid</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> which by the way he dextrouſly <hi>opened,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by began to ſmell ſomething more of their Helliſh Deſigns: he diſpatcht this and ſome other affairs ſo much to their ſatisfaction, that after a little time, he was taken into their <hi>Conſults,</hi> as they call them, as a very <hi>confiding inſtrument,</hi> and thereby had an opportunity to ſee all that was on the <hi>Wheel</hi> at <hi>preſent,</hi> and liberty without ſuſpicion to <hi>enquire</hi> how any thing <hi>paſt</hi> had been carryed on. More particularly, he made it his buſineſs to inform himſelf of the beginning, progreſs, and concluſion of our late Wars; in all which he found the Jeſuits and Popiſh Party had a great hand. The Rebellion that led to it, being began in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where it was firſt laid by Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> His Majeſties irreconcileable Enemy: then it broke out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where it was bleſt with his Holineſſes Letters, and aſſiſted by his Nuncio, whom he ſent purpoſely to tend the fire there, as aforeſaid: afterwards they plaid their parts in diſguiſe in <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>unſettle</hi> the people, ſtart new <hi>Phanatical</hi> opinions, furniſh the Rabble with <hi>Arguments</hi> for Treaſon, raiſe needleſs occaſions of <hi>jealouſie,</hi> puſh on Rebellion, <hi>fruſtrate</hi> all endeavours of Accommodation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till they had deſtroyed the King, the Government, the <hi>Church,</hi> and brought us all into confuſion. By this means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he underſtood that the City of <hi>London</hi> in the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52053:57"/>
year 66. was fixed by their contrivance, and was told how <hi>that Plot</hi> was laid, and who were the Actors in the ſeveral <hi>Scenes; Richard Strange,</hi> heretofore Provincial of the Jeſuits, being <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector in Chief</hi> thereof, and how their Society got 14000 <hi>l.</hi> by the ſaid Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He kept (but very privately) ſhort <hi>Notes</hi> of all things of moment, that occurr'd from the time he was admitted amongſt their Society, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to produce them when they might be of <hi>uſe;</hi> by which means he was enabled to give an Account of ſo many <hi>hundred Particulars,</hi> which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by other Circumſtances and Collaterate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and have not in the leaſt <hi>Interfer'd</hi> with one another, nor with thoſe <hi>Papers</hi> which have been found elſewhere; or with the Informations which have been given in by <hi>other Perſons</hi> (though wholly Strangers to him) whom God hath ſince raiſed up further to clear and unmask this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable and Bloody Conſpiracy.</p>

               <p>And about the 20th. of <hi>Aug.</hi> Doctor <hi>Tongue offered to bring</hi> the ſaid <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> into St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park, that they might be <hi>taken with their Guns about them,</hi> his Informant having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them he could do it at any time, if the King would pleaſe to be walking there; but this was <hi>not accepted, or neglected.</hi> However, ſhortly after, Mr. <hi>Kirby</hi> ſhewed <hi>Pickering,</hi> as he attended the Prieſts at Maſs in <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi> to one of the Lord Treaſurers Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>The 26th. of <hi>Aug.</hi> Dr. <hi>Tonge</hi> told Mr. <hi>Kirby</hi> that he had Informed the Lord Treaſurer how he might Intercept Letters that come to <hi>Grove</hi> (which if it had been <hi>honeſtly done,</hi> muſt of neceſſity have very much laid open their Traiterous practices, the Jeſuits Letters being generally directed to him.)

               <p>During this time, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> wrote fair Copies of his Informations; and Dr. <hi>Tonge</hi> in vain ſought to give in farther Informations to the Treaſurer, but were both (and Mr. <hi>Kirkby</hi> alſo) much perplexed with apprehenſions of the <hi>danger</hi> they were in, and <hi>diſcouragements</hi> they had met with: Till on the 27th. at Night, one of the Treaſurers Servants meeting Mr. <hi>Kirkby,</hi> acquainted him he was come for Dr. <hi>Tonge</hi> to go to the Council, who with Mr. <hi>Kirkby</hi> immediately went, but the Council was riſen before they came, and order given them to attend next day: Whereupon they reſolved next Morning to get <hi>two more Copies</hi> Sworn unto, that each man might have an Authentick Copy, which accordingly they did (being 28th. of <hi>Sept.)</hi> before Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey,</hi> who would needs keep one of them, having never before peruſed the ſaid Informations: Then firſt Dr. <hi>Tonge</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kirkby,</hi> and afterwards Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> being ſent for, attended the Council, who upon Examination of Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> were pleaſed to order both him and Dr. <hi>Tonge,</hi> Lodgings in <hi>White-Hall</hi> for their

               <p>THE Diſcovery was made to the <hi>Council</hi> on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> the 28th of <hi>Septemb.</hi> (being <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Eve) as aforeſaid, in the Morning, where Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was a long time under Examination. In the Afternoon the Council ſat again, and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was imploy'd with a Guard, that Night, to ſearch after ſome Jeſuits, whom he took. On <hi>Sunday,</hi> in the Afternoon, the Council ſat again very long, and then he was <hi>Re-examin'd;</hi> and when they roſe, he was ſent abroad all that Night to Search the Lodgings of ſeveral Prieſts, and find out their Papers, which he did ſeize upon. On the ſaid <hi>Sunday</hi> Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> (the Queens Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician) before mentioned, was ſummoned to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Council, but was diſmiſs'd; being told by Sir <hi>Ph.

On <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> Morning the Council ſat again, and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was further Examined; and by reaſon of ſo long watching, and running up and down for two days and nights together, continually without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpit,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52053:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and in bad rainy weather, he was reduced to ſuch extream <hi>weakneſs</hi> and diſorder of body, that he could hardly ſtand or ſpeak: Then it was that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> again appeared, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf ſo ſtrangely, that the whole Council were amazed at the manner of it, for he did not <hi>ſeem to deny what he was charged with ſo poſitively, as one that was Innocent would have done,</hi> but uſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny boaſting expreſſions of his great fidelity and Loyalty to the King, and required Satisfaction and Reparation for the Injury done to his Honour. Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> did then ſet forth that he had ſeen a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>Whitebread</hi> to <hi>Fenwick,</hi> mentioning that Sir <hi>George</hi> had undertaken the <hi>Poiſoning</hi> of the King for 15000 <hi>l.</hi> of which 5000 <hi>l.</hi> had been paid him by <hi>Coleman:</hi> But a queſtion aroſe afterwards, at his Trial, Whether he then mentioned another Letter, which afterwards he inſiſted upon, written from Sir <hi>George</hi> himſelf to Father <hi>Aſhby;</hi> Sir <hi>George</hi> denying that he then ſaid any thing of it; but on the contrary, declared he had not any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to charge him with, and then endeavour'd to Invalidate his after-Evidence; whereas Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> alledged, the Council did not preſs him to his knowledge; and that the Omiſſion of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning that Letter, if he did omit it, as to the beſt of his memory he did not, was to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Weakneſs at that time; which the King and Council were ſo ſenſible of, that his Majeſty himſelf had like to have ſent him away once or twice before, becauſe he found him ſo Ill. <hi>[See</hi> Wakemans <hi>Trial,</hi> p. 55, 56, &amp; 59.] It not being improbable that a man under ſuch Circumſtances might forget to mention that, which at another

time he might well know and remember. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, things were ſo manag'd, that Sir <hi>George</hi> was not Committed at that time, nor till above three weeks afterwards.

up, to ſend him to <hi>Newgate,</hi> he was only for the preſent Committed to a <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> and a ſpecial Warrant granted to the Meſſenger to ſecure him againſt the ſaid firſt Order.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 2d. of <hi>Octob.</hi> his Majeſty went out of Town to <hi>New-Market;</hi> and a Committee being appointed to Examine ſeveral Papers, and Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> amongſt others, there were found in a Deal-box ſome, of ſuch dangerous Conſequence, as moved the Lords forthwith to Sign a Warrant for his Commitment to <hi>Newgate,</hi> dated the 4th. of <hi>October.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 7th. Mr. <hi>Richard Langhorn</hi> the Elder, a Councellor of the Temple; and on the 10th.

               <p>Hitherto the weight of this mighty work lay wholly upon Dr. <hi>Oats's</hi> ſhoulders and Reputation, and the deſign he mentioned, was in it ſelf, and its tendency ſo <hi>Horrid and Bloody,</hi> that good men (who are always <hi>Charitable)</hi> could ſcarce perſwade themſelves of its reality: The faſhionable men of the Town, that pretend to wit and humour, did but make a <hi>Jeſt</hi> of it, having long ſince learn'd to turn all things, though never ſo ſerious and ſacred, into <hi>Drol and Ridicule;</hi> and on the other ſide, the Conſpirators with <hi>Impudence, lies, noiſe, number, and the powerful Intereſt they had,</hi> did not doubt but to over-bear and <hi>cruſh</hi> his teſtimony; and upon this Confidence no doubt it was, and conſideration that at worſt he being but a ſingle Evidence, they could not by our Law be Convicted of Treaſon

               <p>Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> as is before related, took Dr. <hi>Oat's</hi> Depoſitions, which was no more than every Gentleman in the Commiſſion of the Peace, was bound to do; yet for this neceſſary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his duty, the Conſpirators were ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, that they reſolved to cut him off; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as may reaſonably be ſuppoſed) to deter all other Magiſtrates from inter-medling with any
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52053:68"/>
affairs relating to the Plot: How many there were in all, that Conſpired his death, is not yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered; for it appears, they accounted the Murthering of him ſo neceſſary, that they had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed <hi>ſeveral Parties</hi> to do it, which knew nothing of each others deſigns. But thoſe who are known to have been in it, were theſe, Father <hi>Girald</hi> and Father <hi>Felly,</hi> two <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prieſts, <hi>Robert Green,</hi> Cuſhion-man to the Queens Chappel; <hi>Laurence Hill,</hi> Doctor <hi>Godden's</hi> Man (which Doctor is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of the ſaid Chappel) <hi>Henry Berry,</hi> who was Porter of <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Miles Prance,</hi> a Goldſmith in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> who workt to the Queen: Theſe were actually preſent at the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and beſides, they knew there were two more that were Privy to it, &amp; ſhould have been there, but were not, <hi>viz.</hi> one Father <hi>Lewſon,</hi> a Prieſt, and one <hi>Phillip Vernatti,</hi> who belonged to the Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> (who ſince fled.)

               </p>
               <p>Of that Company that effected it, 'tis believed that <hi>Vernatti,</hi> and the Prieſts firſt undertook it, and drew in <hi>Green, Hill,</hi> and <hi>Berry</hi> firſt; and afterwards engaged Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> which they did at the <hi>Plough-</hi>Alehouſe by the <hi>Water-gate,</hi> by <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi> on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> after they came from Chappel; tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that Sir <hi>Edmundbury was a better Perſecutor of Catholicks, and a particular Enemy to her Majeſties Servants</hi> (whereof Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> counted himſelf one, as aforeſaid) and <hi>that he had very lately Examined people againſt them, and got Depoſitions to fix baſe Crimes and Scandals on their Religion; and that

Catholicks would be ruined, unleſs he were taken off; and therefore it was neceſſary for the Glory of God, and good of the Church, that it ſhould be done;</hi> and that beſides, they ſhould have a good <hi>Reward</hi> from the Lord <hi>Bellaſis;</hi> and when Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> ſcrupled it, the two Prieſts, <hi>Girald</hi>

quarrel; and juſt as Sir <hi>Edmundbury</hi> was paſſing by the Water-gate, <hi>Hill</hi> (who was acquainted with Sir <hi>Edmundbury,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edmundbury</hi> with him, as having dealt with him formerly) ſteps out in a great deal of haſt, and entreated him for <hi>Gods ſake to come in, for there were two men a quarrelling, and he was afraid there would be Bloodſhed;</hi> whereas his preſence, being a Magiſtrate, would preſently <hi>quiet them:</hi> He refuſed at firſt; but the other was ſo importunate, that at laſt he conſented, and <hi>Hill</hi> entred the Gate firſt; after him, Sir <hi>Edmund-bury;</hi> and juſt behind him followed <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Green:</hi> As ſoon as they were in, <hi>Prance</hi> went up to the Water-gate, to watch that no body ſhould come in that way; and <hi>Berry</hi> was to ſecure the Stairs and paſſage by the Chappel; but firſt he and <hi>Kelly,</hi> the pretended Quarrellers, ſtood about the end of the Rail by the Queens Stables; and as Sir <hi>Edmundbury</hi> went down towards them, <hi>Green</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly threw a twiſted Handkerchief about his neck, and forthwith all four of them pull'd him down and Throttled him, ſo as he could make no noiſe; then they threw him behind the Rail, and gave him many violent punches on the Breaſt with their Knees; and <hi>Green</hi> wrung his neck almoſt round, with all his force: <hi>Prance</hi> and <hi>Berry</hi> being come to them, when he was quite dead, they all help'd to carry the Body into Dr. <hi>Goddins</hi> Lodgings, where the ſaid <hi>Hill</hi> liv'd, who went before and opened the door: When they were in, they carried him up five or ſix ſteps, into a little Room on the right hand, and there left him that night, and <hi>Sunday</hi> all day and night.</p>
               <p>

On <hi>Munday</hi> night, <hi>Hill</hi> and ſome others of them removed him into a Room in the upper Court; and <hi>Prance</hi> having a mind to ſee where they had laid him, they all went with a dark Lanthorn thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and lookt on the body; at which time Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſaw Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> and knew him again, long afterwards, as in due place ſhall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> night they carried him to another Room in the ſaid long Entry, over againſt Dr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dins</hi> Lodgings: And on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> night, being removing it from thence to the Room where it was at firſt; <hi>Prance</hi> happening to come upon them at that inſtant, they all run away and left the Body in the Entry, till he call'd to them; and then they came back and laid it, as at firſt, in the little Room.</p>
               <p>Then that they might Murther his Reputation, as they had his Perſon; the two <hi>wicked Pcieſts, Girald</hi> and <hi>Kelly,</hi> adviſed to carry him out into the Fields, and leave him run through with his own Sword, in ſome obſcure place, that he might be ſuppoſed <hi>to have Murther'd himſelf,</hi> and therefore his Money, Rings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were all to be left with him. This being agreed, they reſolv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to carry him out at Night; and in order thereunto, <hi>Hill</hi> procured a Sedan, into which, about 12. a Clock, they put him; <hi>Prance</hi> and <hi>Girald</hi> carried him out at the great Gate, <hi>Berry</hi> the Porter opening the door, who to avoid the Soldiers taking any notice, had invited them into his Houſe with Drink and Tobacco: Thus ſometimes <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Prance,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Kelly</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> carried him up towards <hi>So-ho</hi> Fields, hard by the <hi>Grecians</hi> Church, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52053:70"/>
there <hi>Hill</hi> attended with an Horſe, and they ſet the body up before him, and clapt the Sedan into an Houſe that was Building there, but unfiniſh'd, till they came back; and then <hi>Girald</hi> the Prieſt ſaid, <hi>I wiſh we had an hundred ſuch Rogues as ſecure as we have this:</hi> Then <hi>Prance,</hi> becauſe he was a Houſe-keeper returned home, and the other four went away with him, one leading the Horſe, <hi>Hill</hi> riding and holding the Body, and the other two walking by.</p>
               <p>They carried him into an obſcure place, about two miles out of Town, towards <hi>Hampſtead,</hi> near a place call'd <hi>Prim-roſe Hill,</hi> and there in a Ditch they left his Body, <hi>Girald</hi> having run Sir <hi>Edmonds</hi> own Sword through him, and left it in, but the Scabbard and his Gloves they laid on the Bank, at a ſmall diſtance.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Sir <hi>Edmund-burys</hi> Servants firſt, and then his Friends, and at laſt the whole Town were not a little concern'd for his abſcence; and there was once a <hi>Proclamation</hi> ordered to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, but Countermanded by reaſon of falſe Information given by ſome Papiſts, that he was living and well; and there were ſeveral perſons that went up and down to Coffee.

to work upon the heart of Mr. <hi>William Bedloe,</hi> to come in and make a further diſcovery.

Poiſoned, or otherwiſe Kill'd him then: Next day they told him it was to be done that night, and that there was to be 4000 <hi>l.

He alſo gave an account that Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey</hi> was Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> by the Contrivance of the Jeſuits, but the particulars he could not fully ſet forth.</p>

            <p>THE late Diſcovery had ſo <hi>unexpectedly fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> the deſigns of the Papiſts, that being therewith <hi>enraged,</hi> they could hardly contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within any bound of patience or moderation, but the Traiterous <hi>Poiſon</hi> which had long <hi>rankled</hi> in their <hi>hearts,</hi> began now to <hi>bliſter</hi> out at their <hi>tongues;</hi> and ſince they were prevented from <hi>Acting,</hi> they deſcended with a kind of Female ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, to vent their Reſentments in talking and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering lewd Expreſſions and <hi>Menaces.</hi> Of this kind of Traitors was <hi>William Staley,</hi> a <hi>Goldſmith</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> a Strict and Zealous Papiſt, bred beyond the Seas at one of the Engliſh <hi>Seminaries,</hi> intended for a Prieſt; in order to which, he took the degrees of a Deacon, as is related by thoſe that well knew him, but afterwards altered his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and began to ſtudy Phyſick, in which Art he took his <hi>Degree</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> but coming home, and his other Brother being unhappily <hi>Kill'd</hi> by an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, he ſtaid at home as an Aſſiſtant to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Shop, who had a great Trade, being much Entruſted with the Caſh of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Nobility and Gentry, who upon this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of the Plot, <hi>calling in</hi> their money on a ſudden, and he (as 'tis ſaid) not being able readily
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52053:74"/>
to make up his <hi>Accounts</hi> to his Father, and finding their <hi>Trade</hi> hereby like to be ruined, grew ſo far diſturb'd, that on the 14th. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> in the Forenoon, being in the Company of one <hi>Fromante,</hi> a Foreigner, at a Cooks Shop in <hi>Kings-Street,</hi> by <hi>Long-Acre,</hi> diſcourſing together about the Plot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Fromante</hi> ſaid that the King of <hi>England</hi> was a great <hi>Tormenter of the People of God</hi> (meaning the Papiſts) To which the ſaid <hi>Staley</hi> Anſwered, <hi>The King of</hi> England, <hi>the King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (repeating the words twice as in a great fury) <hi>is a grand Heretick, and the greateſt Rogue (Bouger</hi> the word was in <hi>French)</hi> in the world: <hi>There's the heart</hi> (ſtriking his hand on his Breaſt) <hi>and here's the hand that will Kill him, my ſelf:</hi> And then he ſaid further, <hi>The King and Parliament think all is over, but the Rogues are deceived or miſtaken.</hi> When he ſpoke theſe words, he was in a Room with the door open, and juſt over againſt him in another Room on the ſame Floor, were three <hi>Scotch Gentlemen,</hi> of whom two underſtood <hi>French,</hi> who not only plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard, but as plainly ſaw him ſpeak them; and being mightily concern'd to hear ſuch deſperate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, when he was going, enquired who he was, having never ſeen him before, and ſet one to watch him to his Fathers, where next day they apprehended him. And becauſe there were a ſort of men that endeavoured to cry down the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very as <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Witneſſes, <hi>William Corſtairs</hi> and <hi>Alexander Sutherland,</hi> did both poſitively Swear the words before-cited, for they both underſtood <hi>French</hi> very well, having been Officers abroad, and juſt then returned into <hi>England:</hi> And the <hi>third Witneſs,</hi> though he did not underſtand <hi>French,</hi> Swore he heard the Priſoner ſpeak ſomething with great earneſtneſs, and that Capt. <hi>Corſtairs</hi> at that inſtant told him it was in Engliſh, <hi>That he would Kill the King;</hi> and was ſo fill'd with Indignation, that he ſaid he would not endure to hear him uſe ſuch Language, and therefore would have drawn his Sword and run upon him preſently, but that

Mr. <hi>Sutherland</hi> prevented him. They alſo proved that they writ down the words in <hi>French,</hi> as they were ſpoken and now ſworn to, before they came out of the ſaid Cooks. The Priſoner own'd that he was at that time with <hi>Fromante</hi> at that Cooks, but <hi>denied</hi> that he ſpoke the words, and ſaid they only ſpoke of the <hi>French</hi> King, and that the words Sworn by the Witneſs in <hi>French,</hi> muſt ſignifie, <hi>I will Kill my ſelf,</hi> rather than <hi>I will Kill him my ſelf.</hi> But as to this the Court obſerv'd, Firſt, that the Witneſſes Swore directly that it was the King of <hi>England</hi> he ſpoke of, and nam'd him twice; nor did he ſure count the <hi>French</hi> King an Heretick: And as for the Second, that evaſion could not be allow'd; for what ſenſe would it be to ſay, the King of <hi>England</hi> is a great Heretick, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Villain in the World, and therefore here's the hand, and here's the heart, <hi>I will Kill my ſelf.</hi> The Priſoner had little more to ſay for himſelf, beſides general Proteſtations of his Loyal Intentions.

            <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was the firſt Witneſs produced; to whom the Lord Chief Juſtice gave this grave Caution. That he <note place="margin">

carried it from St. <hi>Omers</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> in which there were thanks returned for the Ten thouſand pounds by him remitted into <hi>England,</hi> for the Propagation of the Catholick Religion; and promiſing that it ſhould be Imployed for no other purpoſe, but that for which it was ſent, which was to cut off the King of <hi>England,</hi> as appear'd by the Letter of <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> to which this was an Anſwer, and which Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſaw and read.</p>

            <p n="3">3. That in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 78.

            <p n="5">5. That in <hi>July</hi> 78. Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was privy to the Inſtructions brought by <hi>Aſhby,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Rector of St. <hi>Omers,</hi> from Father <note place="margin">pag. 25.</note>

            <p n="6">6. That in <hi>May</hi> New Stile, <hi>April</hi> Old Stile, 78, he ſaw Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> Patent or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to be Secretary of State, from <note place="margin">pag. 27.</note>

ſaw Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> open it, and heard him ſay, it was a good exchange [meaning, to come from being the Dutcheſſes Secretary, to be Secretary of State.]</p>
            <p>This was the ſubſtance of Dr. <hi>Oates's</hi> Teſtimony; but by our merciful Engliſh Laws, no man can be Condemned by a ſingle Evidence: But here was ſufficient proof, for in the next place Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> Witneſſed</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>This was the <hi>Oral</hi> Teſtimony; in confirmation whereof, in the next place, were produced ſeveral of Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> Papers, taken at his Houſe by Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> the Meſſenger, by vertue of a Warrant

The Meſſenger Swore he ſeiz'd them there, and <hi>Seal'd</hi> them up, and brought them to the Clerks of the Council, who Swore theſe were the ſame Papers, and they were (all that were made uſe of) proved to be his <hi>own Hand-writing</hi> by Mr. <hi>Boatman</hi> his Servant, and Mr. <hi>Cattaway,</hi> a Sub-ſecretary, that uſed to write many things for him, and were both well acquainted with his hand, and alſo by <hi>his own Confeſſion;</hi> ſo that it was impoſſible there could be any firmer proof: And if there had been <hi>no other Evidence</hi> in the Cauſe, his own Papers were as good as an hundred Witneſſes to <hi>Condemn</hi> him: Where alſo note by the way, that one of theſe Servants acknowledged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Oath, that a Packet of Letters from beyond the Seas, was directed to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> two or three days after he was made Priſoner; and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter kept a large Book of Entries for his Letters and News, which he ſaw on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 28th of <hi>Septemb.</hi> but not ſince nor knew what was become of it; by which it appears, both that he ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Correſpondence beyond the Seas, even to the time of his Commitment; and that he had made away with moſt of his dangerous Papers; however through <hi>haſt</hi> or inadvertency, he had left theſe behind, which probably being old, and long ſince laid by, he might forget.</p>

            <p>An Anſwer to this Letter from <hi>Le Cheſe</hi> was read next, dated the 23. of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1675. wherein
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52053:81"/>
he promiſes Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> to aſſiſt in ſeconding his good intentions. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then was read a Declaration, which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> looking, it ſeems, upon himſelf already as eſtabliſh'd in his Office of <hi>Secretariſhip,</hi> had drawn up in the Name of the King; for as he would have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Diſſolv'd, ſo this was to ſatisfie the People, and give <hi>Reaſons</hi> for its Diſſolution, promiſing to call another; charging all perſons to forbear talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Irreverently</hi> of the proceedings of his Majeſty there, and offering 20 <hi>l.</hi> to the diſcoverer of any Seditious Talker againſt it, unto a principal <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> whereof he counted himſelf <hi>one</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>There was likewiſe produced and read a Letter, written in the Name and Stile of the Duke of <hi>Y.</hi> to Monſieur <hi>Le Cheſe;</hi> declaring that the <hi>Intereſt of the French King, and thoſe of his Royal H. were ſo clearly linkt together, that thoſe that oppoſed the one, ſhould be lookt upon as Enemies to the other: That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions had been made to the French King, that had regard to the Catholick Religion, and to the uſe of his Purſe, and refers a further Account to be had from</hi> Throckmorton <hi>and</hi> Coleman, <hi>who, he ſays, are firm to his Intereſt, and may be treated with, without any apprehenſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true upon a Committee of Lords going to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and Examining Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> touching this Letter, he confeſſed, <hi>That it was prepared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Order or Privity of the</hi> Duke; <hi>and that when he was ſo bold as to ſhew it to him, the</hi> Duke <hi>was very angry and rejected it.</hi> But it ſeems his diſpleaſure did not long continue, for <hi>Coleman</hi> remained ſtill a Favourite; and certainly, had he not made ſome extraordinary Apology for ſuch an <hi>Inſolence;</hi> as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52053:82"/>
Counterfeiting a Letter in his Maſters Name, he muſt have loſt his Royal Highneſſes favour for ever.</p>
            <p>But that which gave the moſt <hi>clear Light</hi> to his deſigns, was a Letter to <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> without date; but appearing to be written ſoon after his long Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the 29th. of <hi>Septemb.</hi> wherein after his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the approaching Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and care taken for a Cipher, and ſecret wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting beſides with <hi>juice of Lemon,</hi> becauſe <hi>their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence would be of things not fit to be truſted, even to a Cipher alone:</hi> He hath theſe words, <hi>We have here a mighty work upon our hands, no leſs than the <hi>Converſion</hi> of three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 69.</note> 
               <hi>and by that perhaps the utter ſubduing a <hi>Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Hereſie,</hi> which has domineer'd a long time over great part of this Northern World: There were never ſuch hopes of ſucceſs ſince the death of our Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>as now in our days; when God has given us a Prince, who is become (may I ſay a Miracle) Zealous of being the Author and Inſtrument of ſo Glorious a work. But the oppoſition we are ſure to meet with, is alſo like to be great, ſo that it imports us to get all the aid and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we can, <hi>For the Herbeſt is great, and the Labourers but few:</hi> That which we relie upon moſt, next to God Almighty's Providence, and the favour of my Maſter the</hi> Duke, <hi>is the mighty mind of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, whoſe generous ſoul inclines him to great undertakings; ſo as I hope you will pardon me, if I be very troubleſome to you upon this occaſion, from whom I expect the greateſt help we can hope for. I muſt confeſs I think his Chriſtian Majeſties Temporal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is ſo much attracted to that of his</hi> R. H. <hi>(which can never be conſiderable, but upon the growth and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Catholick Religion) That his Miniſters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52053:82"/>
give him better Advice, even in a politick ſenſe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from the conſiderations of the next world, than that of our Bleſſed Lord, <hi>To ſeek firſt the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righteouſneſs thereof, that all other things may be added unto him.</hi> Yet I know his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty has more powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſuggeſted to him by his own Devotion, and your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verences Zeal for Gods Glory, to engage him to afford us the beſt help he can in our preſent Circumſtances,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Scarce could any words more ſignificantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the whole Intrigue of the Plot: For</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is the immediate <hi>End</hi> they aim at, <hi>The Converſion of theſe three Kingdoms;</hi> that is, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Religion Eſtabliſh'd, and introducing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is their main and <hi>ultimate ſcope;</hi> that by thus reducing theſe Nations, they may root out <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> throughout the world, <hi>and by that perhaps the utter Subduing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their <hi>Malice</hi> is ſhown, by calling the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, <hi>A Peſtilent Hereſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The favourable <hi>Conjuncture</hi> for them, <hi>Never ſuch hopes of ſucceſs ſince Queen</hi> Maries <hi>days;</hi> whom for her good Bloody Services for the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, he cannot mention without an endearing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating title, Our Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>reaſon</hi> for ſuch their confident hopes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have Seduced his <hi>R. H.</hi> and made him <hi>Zealous</hi> for doing their drudgery.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That they expect great <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to meet it, ſo that of neceſſity here muſt War, Blood-ſhed, and Deſolation enſue, before they could accompliſh this their mighty work.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>means</hi> whereby they hope to over-bear
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52053:83"/>
this oppoſition, and that is by the aid and power of the French King, <hi>whom next to God</hi> (who might as well have been left out) <hi>and the Duke, they rely on,</hi> and expect the greateſt help they can hope for from; and this to be obtained by the Intereſt of <hi>Le Cheſe</hi> his Confeſſor, inſpiring him with the glory and piety of the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>There were alſo read divers <hi>other Letters,</hi> written by the Priſoner; and one eſpecially of <hi>Aug.</hi> 21. 1674. to the Popes <hi>Internuncio</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where in ſo many words, he owns his deſign to be <hi>the utter Ruin of the Proteſtant party</hi> in general: But theſe were never thought fit to <hi>paſs the Preſs;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the others which are publiſhed, are ſufficient alone to ſatisfie any rational man; nay, I durſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſay a <hi>Papiſt</hi> himſelf, not only that <hi>Coleman</hi> was Guilty of the Treaſon in the Indictment, for endeavouring to Subvert the Government and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd Religion of <hi>England,</hi> but alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of the <hi>truth of the Plot in general;</hi> and that what Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> teſtifies, is real; for had he ſeigned or gueſs'd at things, how was it poſſible, that he ſhould tell the Council before hand; that if Mr. <hi>Colemans Papers were ſearch'd, there would be found that in them which would coſt him his Neck;</hi> as Sir <hi>Robert Southwell</hi> poſitively Swears he did, [p. 36. <hi>of the Tryal.]</hi> And indeed it was <hi>digitus dei,</hi> a moſt ſignal Providence, that theſe <hi>few</hi> Papers were left behind to be produced. If we conſider what grounds and opportunities Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> had to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcond all his Papers (as tis plain he did the moſt of them, none of his Letters of this Subject ſince 1675 being to be found.) For being a man of that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> and Intelligence as he was, and being expreſly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52053:83"/>
Charged by Name in Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Informations, which were delivered to the King, and tranſmitted to the Treaſurers peruſal, and had lain in his hands almoſt 50 <hi>days</hi> before this ſeizure of <hi>Colemans</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as aforeſaid; and ſince it appears, <hi>Bedingfield,</hi> his <hi>R. H s.</hi> Confeſſor, had notice of the Diſcovery of the Plot, almoſt as ſoon as ever it was made to his Majeſty. We cannot, after all this, reaſonably imagine Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> could ſo long be Ignorant of it; at leaſt, he muſt needs have ſome <hi>Inkling</hi> of the buſineſs on the <hi>Saturday-night,</hi> when almoſt all the Town knew of it, which was time enough for him to have remov'd <hi>all,</hi> as well as <hi>ſome</hi> of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Papers, had not Providence Infatuated him, that his own <hi>Hand-writing,</hi> and which he could not, nor did deny to be ſo, might be brought in <hi>Evidence</hi> againſt him, and undeniably juſtifie both <hi>his Treaſons</hi> and the <hi>Witneſſes Integrity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The defence he made for himſelf, conſiſted in theſe Particulars,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> who now pretended ſuch <hi>Acquaintance</hi> with him, declared before the King and Council, That he <hi>never ſaw</hi> him before, or did not know him.</p>
            <p>To this the Dr. Anſwered; That it being by <hi>Candle-light,</hi> and his ſight weak, and <hi>Coleman</hi> alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Habit and Wig, he did indeed at firſt ſay, That he would not Swear that was the Man, or that he had ever ſeen him before; but as ſoon as he heard him ſpeak, he knew him well, and could then have Sworn it, had he been demanded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That had the things Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> now alledged, been true, he would have Charged the ſame before the Council: But then he charged him <hi>only</hi> with a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52053:84"/>
Letter which he <hi>thought</hi> was his hand; and ſuch ſlender matters, that the Council was ready to let him go <hi>at large;</hi> and therefore all the reſt muſt be Invented ſince.</p>
            <p>To this the Dr. replied, That he was then ſo <hi>weak</hi> and weary, that he cannot tell particularly all he then ſaid, and poſſibly in that condition might <hi>forget</hi> ſomething; beſides, his deſign then, was to lay <hi>no more</hi> to his Charge than might ſerve for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; for Priſoners may ſupplant Evidence when they know it; and when he ſaw Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was ſecured, he had no need to give a further Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for he never apprehended the Council in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to let him go at large; if he had, he ſhould certainly have charged him home: And ſo in truth it appears he did, as weak as he was; for in full Anſwer to this Objection, Sir <hi>Robert Southwell</hi> Swears, <hi>that Dr.</hi> Oates <hi>did then</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 38.</note> 
               <hi>declare, that</hi> Coleman <hi>paid</hi> Wakeman 5000 <hi>l. of money, which he was to have for Poiſoning the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> charg'd him with conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Wakemans</hi> Poiſoning the King; and that it was conſulted by him in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, about the 21th. day, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged that he was then in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> and one of his Men and he, was all <hi>Auguſt</hi> there, (as he thought) but was not ſure of it; and after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, he talkt of <hi>a Book</hi> that would ſhew he was out of Town from the 15th. to the 31. of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> But as this was no Evidence in it ſelf, and offered too late, ſo it did not contradict Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> for he was not <hi>poſitive</hi> to the day, but only to the moneth, and it might as well be before the 15th. day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:52053:84"/>
And this was all he had to object againſt Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Teſtimony. Againſt Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, but that he <hi>never ſaw</hi> him in his life: To which Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> replied; <hi>Yes, you ſaw me in the Stone-Gallery in</hi> Somerſet-Houſe, <note place="margin">pag. 40.</note> 
               <hi>when you came from a Conſult, where were great Perſons, whom I am not to name here, that would make the very bottom of your Plot tremble; then you ſaw me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>as to his Papers;</hi> he would excuſe himſelf by alleadging there was <hi>no Treaſon</hi> in them, though very extravagant Expreſſions; and that his deſign thereby was ſo far from Killing the King, that it was only to make the <hi>King and Duke as great as</hi> could be. But to Anſwer to this; It was obſerved, that it is apparent he was Guilty of Contriving and Conſpiring the Deſtruction of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> and how could this be done <hi>without</hi> the Death of the King? He that will Subvert the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and would bring in Popery; that is, a Forraign Authority, does an act in Derogation of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and in Diminution of the Kings Title and Soveraign Power, and endeavours to bring a Forraign Dominion both over our <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> and <hi>Eſtates,</hi> which in it ſelf, is no leſs than <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly; He pleaded the Act of <hi>General Pardon,</hi> but in vain, becauſe his Papers were written ſince the laſt Act of that kind paſs'd.</p>
            <p>Then the Jury going together, after ſome time, returned, and brought him in <hi>Guilty:</hi> The next day he was again brought to the Bar, and there received Sentence; the Lord chief Juſtice adviſing him to Confeſs the whole Truth, and not to be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52053:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deluded with the ſond hopes of having his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence reſpited; to which purpoſe, amongſt others, he uſed this Expreſſion, <hi>Truſt not to it Mr.</hi> Coleman, <hi>you may be flattered to ſtop</hi>

               <hi>your mouth, till they have ſtopt your breath; and I doubt you will find that to be the event.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However he did not think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t to take this advice, but remain'd in an <hi>obſtinate ſullen</hi> manner till <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 3d. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> and then was drawn on a Sledge to <hi>Tyburn.</hi> where he declared that <hi>he had been a</hi> Roman Catholick <hi>for many years, and thank'd God he died in that Religion,</hi> which he did not think at all prejudicial to the King and Government: And being askt if he knew any thing of the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey,</hi> declared <hi>that he did not,</hi> for that he was a Priſoner at that time: Then after ſome private Prayers, he was Hang'd and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, but his Quarters granted to his Friends to be Buried. It was the opinion of moſt that beheld him as he was drawn along, or whilſt he was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or <hi>praying</hi> at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> that he was <hi>ſomewhat</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd in his mind, or under ſome expectations of a Reprieve: and it was confidently reported, that he ſhould ſay that day, with great Paſſion, <hi>There is no Faith in Man.</hi> But as to this laſt, Enquiry has been made, and no Credible perſons have yet appeared to teſtifie that they heard the words ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; ſo that it muſt be left only as a probable rumbur.</p>

            <p n="4">4. That in purſuance of this reſolve and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to Murther the King, he did ſeveral times ſee <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52053:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Pickering</hi> had a fair opportunity to have ſhot the King, but the Flint of his Piſtol happen'd to be looſe, and he durſt not venture to give fire; and becauſe by their negligence this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity was miſs'd, <hi>Pickering</hi> underwent <note place="margin">pag. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Penance,</hi> and had 20 or 30 ſtrokes of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> was chidden for his careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as <hi>Whitebread</hi> had written in his Letters, which the Witneſs had read, and well knew his hand.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That <hi>Grove</hi> did go about with one <hi>Smith</hi> to gather <hi>Peter-pence,</hi> which was either to carry on the deſign, or to ſend them to <hi>Rome:</hi> That he ſaw the Book wherein it was entred, and heard the ſaid <hi>Grove</hi> ſay he had been gathering it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Witneſs was Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> who Swears</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he was imployed for the ſpace of near five years as a Meſſenger, <note place="margin">p. 37, 38.</note> by theſe Conſpirators, for the carrying their Letters to their Confederates beyond the Seas, and bringing others back, all or the moſt relating to this <hi>Plot,</hi> for he Swears he had a way to <hi>open</hi> and read them, whereby he fully informed himſelf of matters: And for the nature of the <hi>Plot,</hi> he Swears he heard ſome of the Conſpirators ſay, That they would not leave any <hi>Member of an</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>that ſhould ſurvive to tell hereafter, that there ever was any ſuch Religion there as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant:</hi> And to confirm his Intimacy with them, he Swears the manner of his coming firſt to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by them: By means of the <hi>Lady Abbeſs</hi> of the Engliſh Nunnery, at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> who having kept him ſix weeks in her Convent, recommended him to Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> as a proper Inſtrument,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52053:88"/>
who afterwards ſent him to <hi>Harcourt</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; and then he brings his Brother <hi>James Bedloe,</hi> who knew nothing of the Plot, but Swears he hath heard the Priſoners often named, as being of his Brothers Acquaintance; and that he hath on his Brothers behalf, received ſeveral ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from Prieſts and Jeſuits, ſometimes 50 or 60 <hi>l.</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a time; from all which it appears that he muſt be very well <hi>acquainted</hi> amongſt them, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the deſign, having been imployed under them ſo long in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> Swears, That about the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 78. (the very day, he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, he cannot Swear to) at Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courts</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 41.</note> Chamber (one of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) he met <hi>Ireland, Pickering,</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, with ſome others, where he heard them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that the 4 Iriſh Ruſſians miſſing of Killing of the King at <hi>Windſor,</hi> therefore <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> ſhould <hi>go on</hi> in their deſign; and that one <hi>Conyers</hi> (a Benedictine Monk) was to be joyned with them, and that they ſhould endeavour to <hi>Aſſaſſinate his Majeſty</hi> in his Morning walk at <hi>New Market;</hi> and they had taken it ſo ſtrongly upon them, that they were eager upon it, and Mr. <hi>Grove</hi> more forward than the reſt, inſomuch that he ſaid, Since it could not be done Clandeſtinely, it ſhould be attempted <hi>Openly,</hi> and that thoſe that ſhould fall therein, had the <hi>Glory to die in a good Cauſe;</hi> but if it ſhould be diſcovered, the diſcovery could never reach to that height, but <hi>their Party</hi> would be ſtrong enough to accompliſh the work.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:52053:89"/>
3. He Swears that <hi>Harcourt</hi> told him, <hi>Grove</hi> was to have 1500 <hi>l.</hi> and <hi>Pickering</hi> as many <hi>Maſſes</hi> as at 12 <hi>d.</hi> a piece came to the like ſum.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That at the ſame time, when the diſcourſe was at <hi>Harcourts</hi> Chamber about Killing the King at <hi>New-Market,</hi> there was likewiſe a diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them of a deſign to Kill ſeveral <hi>Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> and the particular parts aſſigned to every one; <hi>Knight</hi> was to Kill the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury; Prichard</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buckingham; Oneile,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Oſſory; Obrian,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And here it is to be noted, That though Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> do not ſpeak to one and the ſame Conſultation, nor to one and the ſame time, yet they are in Law <hi>two Witneſſes to one and the ſame Crime;</hi> for thus ſeveral Witneſſes to ſeveral <hi>Overt Acts,</hi> are ſo many Witneſſes to the <hi>Treaſon;</hi> and the ſeveral Overt Acts which declare the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are but as ſo many Evidences of the Treaſon; and this hath often heretofore, as in the caſe of Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> and elſe where, as well as now, been declared to be Law; and there ſeems good reaſon that it ſhould be ſo, for otherwiſe ſcarce ever <hi>any Treaſon</hi> could be proved; for men that run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their lives in ſuch Conſultations, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer <hi>two</hi> perſons to hear them, or meet twice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but ſo diſpoſe them, that they may meet <hi>ſeverally</hi> at ſeveral times, and in different places, as Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> did.</p>
            <p>To Corroborate Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Teſtimony, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Conſult of the 24th. of <hi>April,</hi> there was a <hi>Letter</hi> produced and read, taken in <hi>Harcourts</hi> Chamber when they Search'd for him, dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 23. 77. written by one <hi>Peters,</hi> a Jeſuit, now in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52053:89"/>
               <hi>Newgate,</hi> on the ſcore of the Plot, to one <hi>Tonſtall,</hi> of the ſame Society, to ſummon him to meet at the general Conſult to be held at <hi>London, April</hi> the 24th. [the ſame day Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſet forth] wherein there is ſpecial Caution given in theſe words; <hi>Every one is alſo to be minded, not to haſten to</hi> London <hi>long before the time appointed, nor to appear much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Town till the meeting be over, leſt occaſion ſhould be given to <hi>ſuſpect the Deſign;</hi> finally, Secreſie, as to the time and place is much recommended to all thoſe that receive Summons, as it will appear of its own nature neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> had given in his Teſtimony of the Conſult, on <hi>April</hi> the 24th. <hi>long before</hi> this Letter was found, ſo that he was right in that: And by the words, <hi>Suſpect the Deſign,</hi> and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual <hi>Caution and Secreſie</hi> preſcribed as neceſſary there, is a ſtrong preſumption that the deſign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, was indeed no other than what he hath ſet forth.</p>
            <p>The Priſoners Defence for themſelves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all this, was</p>
            <p n="1">1. A naked peremptory <hi>denial</hi> of the whole, but that without Witneſſes or good Circumſtances to prove it, ſignifies very little, being the common Allegation of every Malefactor, much more to be expected from <hi>theſe men,</hi> who having the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to venture on ſuch Devilliſh Crimes; and who by <hi>their Religion</hi> could have, or grant a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the breaking of an <hi>Oath,</hi> were not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52053:90"/>
like to Boggle at telling a <hi>Lie</hi> to ſave their Lives, and to keep off ſo great a Scandal from their Party.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They would ſeem not to know Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> or to have had ſcarce any acquaintance with him.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, he Swears to ſeveral Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which they were forc'd to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge;</hi> As, that <hi>Grove</hi> in <hi>December</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 31.</note> laſt, lent him 8 <hi>s.</hi> to hire a Coach to <hi>Dover,</hi> being then to go for St. <hi>Omers;</hi> that <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> was his <hi>Confeſſor;</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Grove</hi> drank twice in his Company at the Red poſts in <hi>Wild-Street,</hi> and once more, by a good token, when he owned <hi>that he Fired Southwark,</hi> aſſiſted by three <hi>Iriſh</hi> men; and that they had a Thouſand pounds given them for it, whereof he had 400 <hi>l.</hi> and the other 200 <hi>l.</hi> a piece.</p>
            <p>And here as a Digreſſion, not altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, I cannot but inform the Reader, that when Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> gave in his Informations to Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey,</hi> when he read them, and came to this paſſage concerning <hi>Grove</hi> Firing of <hi>Southwark,</hi> being Article the 49th. The ſaid Sir <hi>Edmund-bury</hi> having, it ſeems, ſome knowledge of the ſaid <hi>Grove,</hi> ſaid, That he had been informed that the ſaid <hi>Grove wrought ſo hard</hi> at the ſaid <hi>Southwark-Fire,</hi> and ſo over-heated himſelf, that it was thought it would have coſt him his life, or words to that effect; which hard working, the ſaid Sir <hi>Edmund-bury</hi> did before judge to have been in helping to <hi>quench</hi> the ſaid Fire; but, as appears, was indeed in promoting and carrying on the ſame; which Circumſtance unknown before to Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> doth
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52053:90"/>
exactly correſpond with, and confirm his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in that point.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Ireland</hi> endeavoured to oppoſe Mr. <hi>Bedloes</hi> Evidence, who Swore that he was at the Conſult at <hi>Harcourts</hi> Chamber in <hi>Auguſt:</hi> Now he brings two or three to prove that he was not in <hi>London</hi> all the moneth of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and two of them (but they are his Mother and his Siſter) ſay he went out of Town the 3d. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and returned not till a Fortnight before <hi>Michaelmas:.</hi> And a Coach-man ſpeaks of being with him from the 5th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the 16th. and afterwards at <hi>Weſteheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But againſt theſe Peoples <hi>ſayings,</hi> whereof two were ſo related, there was not only Mr. <hi>Bedloes</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive <hi>Oath,</hi> but likewiſe Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s, though he knew nothing of the particular Conſult at <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courts</hi> Chamber mentioned by Mr <hi>Bedloe;</hi> yet he Swears directly that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was in <hi>London</hi> the beginning of <hi>Septemb.</hi> by a remarkable Token; that on the firſt or ſecond of that moneth <hi>he had 20 s. of him:</hi> And furthermore, <hi>Sarah Pain,</hi> formerly <hi>Grove</hi>'s Servant, and <note place="margin">pag. 57.</note> who knew <hi>Ireland</hi> very well, of which knowledge ſhe gives the reaſon, becauſe he came often to <hi>Grove</hi>'s Houſe, and was the man that ſtill <hi>broke open</hi> the Pacquets of Letters that her Maſter <hi>Grove</hi> carried about afterwards, and <hi>Sealed</hi> all the Pacquets that went beyond the Seas; and ſhe Swears poſitively, and by moſt certain Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that ſhe ſaw Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> at a Scriveners door in <hi>Fetter-Lane,</hi> where he Lodg'd about the 12th. or 13th. of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> ſo that here were three

               <hi>clear Teſtimonies</hi> upon Oath, to diſprove this Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Irelands,</hi> which yet he inſiſted on at his <hi>Death</hi> with Solemn Proteſtations: Whereas ſince it has pleaſed God further to manifeſt the <hi>falſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> objected, that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was all the moneth of <hi>May</hi> at Saint <hi>Omers,</hi> when he Swears he was here at the Conſult; and to prove that he was ſo there then, offered to bring <hi>a Certificate</hi> from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> under the Seal of the Colledge; for it ſeems <hi>the Youths</hi> either were not then come over, or had not ſufficiently <hi>Conn'd</hi> their Leſſon.</p>
            <p>But to this it was Anſwered, that ſuch a Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate was not by the Law of <hi>England</hi> any <hi>Evidence,</hi> in any caſe whatſoever, much leſs to be allowed to them in this caſe; for what Certificate could they not get from the Colledge at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> if it might ſerve their purpoſes?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, They eſſai'd to blaſt Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Credit with an Imputation of <hi>Perjury;</hi> becauſe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged that there was once an <hi>Indictment</hi> againſt him for that Crime; but upon Examination, this appeared to be extreamly frivolous: For</p>
            <p n="1">1. The pretended Perjury was only thus, That Mr. <hi>Oates Swearing the Peace</hi> againſt a certain man, did at the taking of his Oath, ſay, that there were ſome Witneſſes that would evidence ſuch a point of Fact, which when they were produced, would not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52053:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
teſtifie ſo much: Now ſuppoſe this were true, (though it were never proved) yet how could this be <hi>corrupt</hi> or <hi>wilful</hi> Perjury?</p>
            <p n="2">2. There was no Record produced, only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Copy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It appeared, if every any ſuch Indictment was Exhibited, <hi>it could not be made good,</hi> for there was never any <hi>Conviction</hi> or Proſecution there-upon; and if barely to <hi>Accuſe,</hi> would make a man Guilty; who could be <hi>Innocent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Sir <hi>Denny Aſhburnham,</hi> who was called by the Priſoners to Diſcredit Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> was able to ſay nothing againſt him, but this, <hi>That he had known Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>in his Youth, and that then he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </hi> [Theſe are his very words, <hi>p.</hi> 66.] But then the very ſame Gentleman declares,] <hi>That as it is Corroborated with other Circumſtances, it hath</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>ibidem) convinced me, ſo that I am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the truth of the thing; and I do think truly, that nothing can be ſaid againſt Mr.</hi> Oates, <hi>to take off his Credibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being all they had to offer in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the full ſubſtance whereof we have impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially repeated, with the Anſwers thereunto.

When they have Licences to Lye, and Indulgences for Falſhoods; nay, when they can make him a Saint that dies in one, and then pray to him; as the Carpenter firſt makes an Image, and after Worſhips it, and can then think to bring in that</hi> Wooden <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of theirs amongſt us in this Nation: What ſhall I think of them?

            </p>
            <p>After a ſhort Receſs, the Jury brought them in all three Guilty; and in the Afternoon, Sir <hi>George Jeffries,</hi> Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> pronounced Sentence of Death upon them.</p>

got his Soul out of that Snare; and therefore he did then conceive, being ſwayed by ſuch powerful Inducements, That he might <hi>Lawfully</hi> ſay, he <note place="margin">Note, ☞</note> was Innocent, and ſo they were all; which in Popiſh conſtruction, is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they <hi>Killed</hi> Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey;</hi> for that, according to their Divinity, and what the ſaid Prieſts had Solemnly declared, was no <hi>Sin</hi> or Crime, and conſequently they might All, in ſuch their Catholick ſenſe, ſtill be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: Yet this he muſt acknowledge, he ſomewhat doubted, becauſe he had never been at Confeſſion, and received <hi>Abſolution,</hi> ſince the Fact Committed, which all the reſt (as ſome of themſelves had declared) had done, and ſo might more peremptorily perſiſt (as they did) in averring themſelves to be Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and he does ingeniouſly declare, That had he received Abſolution, 'tis his fear he he ſhould never, or not without extream diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty have been brought to any acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

If it were true that

               <p>This Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> having been concern'd with the Engliſh Forces in <hi>France,</hi> and there having the Honour to be acquainted with his Grace, the Illuſtrious <hi>Duke of Monmouth,</hi> was employ'd as <hi>Agent</hi> for the concerns of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Militia at the <hi>French</hi> Court, where he became acquainted with the Lady <hi>Ann Gourdon</hi> (Siſter to the Marqueſs of <hi>Huntly</hi> in <hi>Scotland)</hi> living in a Popiſh Convent in <hi>Paris,</hi> who being a Lady very Zealous for Popery, of excellent Accompliſhments, and great Correſpondence, did in the moneth of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1673. acquaint him,</p>

make the Duke of <hi>York</hi> King; and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would be made away, and ſhortly would not be in a caſe to hurt any body.</p>
               <p>After this he was entertain'd to Introduce <hi>Peter Talbot,</hi> Popiſh Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> to the Marſhal <hi>Bellefond</hi> and the <hi>French King,</hi> into whoſe preſence he was admitted, and allow'd half an hours Conference, preſenting that King with a Letter, and other Papers.</p>
               <p>That the ſaid <hi>Talbot</hi> then told Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> that the buſineſs he had to negotiate with that King, mightily concern'd the welfare of all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in <hi>England,</hi> but thoſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, being to propoſe ways to the <hi>French King</hi> to relieve them of their preſent Perſecutions, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake their Protection; ſome of which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients he declared, were to Arm ſome of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and ſecure a Sea-port Town in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the <hi>French;</hi> for which Negotiation, he ſaid he had good Warrant and Commiſſion from ſome of the greateſt perſons in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>A Deſign of the Papiſts to ſuborn Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to oppoſe and vilifie the Evidence of Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Papiſts finding all their Plot was like to be unravel'd, unleſs ſome ſpeedy Courſe were taken to overthrow the Evidence, reſolv'd to ſpare no Charge for ſo neceſſary a work; and to this purpoſe, one <hi>James Nettervile</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſh, Priſoner in the <hi>Marſhalſcy,</hi> Tutor'd by <hi>Dominick Kelly,</hi> (one of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52053:99"/>
the Prieſts that Murther'd Sir <hi>Edmundbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> being for ſome time his Fellow-priſoner) and holding ſome Correſpondence with the Lords in the Tower, attempted to corrupt and ſuborn two Gentlemen for great Sums of money, to Swear what ſhould be dictated and preſcribed unto them, to oppoſe the Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and to ſcandalize them with odious Crimes, and charge the Plot on diſſenting Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as wholy contrived and pretended by them, to cut off the Papiſts, that they might the more eaſily accompliſh ſome ill intentions they had againſt the King, and Government.</p>
            <p>But the Perſons they happened to tamper with, were of greater worth and integrity, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in, or conceal ſo baſe a Buſineſs. The one of them was Captain <hi>Bury,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Son of Sir <hi>William Bury</hi> of <hi>Grantham</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire.</hi> The other, Mr. <hi>William Brooks,</hi> one of the Aldermen of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who being in <hi>London</hi> for the proſecution of their private concerns, they were oft times with this <hi>Nettervile,</hi> who had been formerly a Clerk in the Court of <hi>Claims</hi> at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and did now pretend he could be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to them, and knowing that their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance here had been very chargeable, was ſo far infatuated, as to think them profligate enough to entertain ſuch a wicked propoſal for money, and ſo broke the matter to them ſeverally, the one not knowing of the others being concern'd, till after they had both diſcovered it.</p>
            <p>For about the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi>

               <hi>Nettervile</hi> having ſent for Captain <hi>Bury</hi> to the <hi>Marſhalſey,</hi> told him in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52053:100"/>
private after ſome preparatory diſcourſes, That there was a <hi>Deſign on foot, to amuſe thoſe that had Impeached the Lords, and thoſe concern'd about the Plot, and to turn the Game an other way,</hi> as he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it; and that the ſaid Captain might do himſelf a <hi>kindneſs</hi> if he pleaſed, and that if he would prove ſome certain things againſt Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe,</hi> and that they held ſuch and ſuch Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, and particularly with Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> &amp;c. he ſhould have 4 or 500 <hi>l.</hi> The Captain ſeem'd to adhere to his diſcourſe, and learn'd of him, that one <hi>Ruſſel</hi> a rank Papiſt, and an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man, who Married Madam <hi>Rowſe,</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi>'s Gentlewoman, was appointed to manage the affair, and pay the money; and after two or three meetings, it was concluded, That the money ſhould be put into a third perſons hand, and that a paper ſhould be drawn up, and delivered to him, containing the particulars, that he ſhould ſwear. And promiſed him no ſmall Intereſt amongſt the Papiſts, for this good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, beſides the money. For, ſays <hi>Nettervile</hi> to to him, <hi>If we can but turn off this Plot, there is no danger of effecting our Buſineſs.</hi> For, ſaid he, moſt impudently, <hi>The King will beleive nothing of it.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibidem <hi>P.</hi> 4.</note> But in the mean time, Captain <hi>Bury</hi> firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted Colonel <hi>Blood,</hi> and afterwards the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State, from time to time, of theſe proceedings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nettervile</hi> alſo told the Captain, They had got one in that Priſon, (which was one <hi>Brewer,</hi> a deſperate indigent Papiſt) that would ſwear, that the very morning the Proclamation came out
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52053:100"/>
concerning Sr. <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> came to his Chamber and askt him, <hi>If he had ever ſeen Sr.</hi> Edmundbury Godfrey, for ſaid he, <hi>If I knew what a like man he was, I could eaſily get 500 l. and however, I am reſolved to hazard my Neck but I will have it;</hi> As alſo that he would have had this <hi>Brewer</hi> gone with him to <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> to view the Rooms, that he might make his Story probable, With much more falſe ſtuff, to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The manner of Alderman <hi>Brooks</hi> being dealt with, was more remarkable, for going to ſee this <hi>Nettervile</hi> about <hi>23th. Decem.</hi> at the Marſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys, he deſired him to carry a Note for a Fellow-Priſoner of his, to one <hi>Peirce Butler,</hi> that lived in <hi>Jermainſtreet;</hi> this Priſoner was <hi>Kelly</hi> the Prieſt, who had been taken up in <hi>Surry,</hi> only as a Recuſant, they then knowing nothing more of him, who was ſo ſtrangely infatuated, though under ſuch deſperate Circumſtances, as guilty of Sr. <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s Murther, yet to ſend it unſeal'd; however the Alderman for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent did not read it, but carrying it to the place, found <hi>Butler</hi> gone out of Town upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation againſt Papiſts, and about two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, having occaſion for waſt Paper, happened to read it, and found it to this effect,</p>
            <p>That being Committed thither, by the name of <hi>Daniel Edmonds,</hi> as a Recuſant, he deſired him to come to him, and in ſo doing, he would, oblige him Friend, <hi>Subſcribed, Dominick Kelly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:52053:101"/>
Soon after this, the Alderman happening on a Paper at a Coffee-houſe, wherein it was ſaid, that Mr. <hi>France</hi> had named one <hi>Kelly</hi> a Preiſt, for one of the Murtherers of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> he ſuſpected this might be the man, whereupon he went over to <hi>Nettervile,</hi> and by the by, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after him, who told him, he was a Prieſt, but had got Bail, whom he hired for 10 <hi>s.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peice, and was got out, and then the ſaid <hi>Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervile</hi> told the Alderman, that if he would but aſſiſt to <hi>villifie the Evidence</hi> of <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> he ſhould have <hi>money enough,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But afterwards Alderman <hi>Brooks</hi> meeting Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Bury,</hi> they diſcovered to each other in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſome of theſe tranſactious, and then the Alderman went likewiſe to the Secretary, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Bury</hi> ſtill holding on his Correſpondence with <hi>Nettervile,</hi> endeavouring to have the money, paid in, to ſee the <hi>Depoſitions</hi> he muſt ſwear, ſeize <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But all this was prevented by an <hi>unhappy Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> for Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> being to meet with Mr. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Glover,</hi> (the Keeper and Clerk of the Marſhalſey,) to conſider ſome way for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering thoſe that had been Bail for <hi>Kelly,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pned to give ſome hints of the Captain's Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> coming to have ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof, and knowing nothing of what progreſs had been made towards diſcovery, did with Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> go to <hi>Nettervile,</hi> and with ſome threatnings, mixt with a promiſe of pardon, made him <hi>confeſs</hi> the diſcourſes he had had with Captain <hi>Bury,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth imagining the ſaid Captain had ſent them.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52053:101"/>
Thus by an <hi>untimely proceſs</hi> the proceedings were ſpoil'd, which otherwiſe in ſhort time might have produced a more notable diſcovery; and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> having notice, abſconded himſelf.</p>
            <p>Conformable to this wicked deſign of charging this horrid Plot upon the <note place="margin">Ibidem <hi>P.</hi> 16.</note> Proteſtants, about the ſame time there were ſeveral Popiſh Emiſſaries imployed, to go to the Houſes of ſome <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> well known in the City of <hi>London,</hi> to pray their charitable <hi>Contributions towards the maintenance of Mr.</hi> Oats, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Bedloe, upon this ſpecious but moſt falſe ſuggeſtion, That his Majeſtics <hi>Allowance</hi> was not ſufficient for their Encouragement. But the <hi>Parties</hi> to whom they thus Addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (ſuppoſing their Intentions were to abuſe their King and Countrey, and get money for themſelves, or ſome <hi>worſe Deſign;)</hi> rejected them, and <hi>checkt</hi> them for their Inſolence. And happy it was, that they did ſo, for other wiſe who knows what advantage they might have made thereof, in order to the promoting their wicked Enterprize. Which as Originally it was to lay the Odium of their Treaſon on the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> if they could have effected it; ſo ever ſince the diſcovery, they have endeavoured by all Arts to play the ſame <hi>Game,</hi> and <hi>would</hi> have been <hi>glad</hi> of ſuch a pretence as this, to render it more probable.</p>

it was to be done, which he promiſed to do, but <hi>wilfully faild</hi> them, becauſe he would not have his hands in Blood. He all this while not knowing upon whom their deſign was.</p>

            <p n="11">11.

Teſtimony, for a man that will ſwear any thing, would ſtick at nothing.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It was proved, That <hi>Berry</hi> the Porter, on his Examination before the Lords of the Committee, did ſay, <hi>He had Order from the Queen,</hi> or in the name of the Queen, That he ſhould ſuffer no ſtrangers, nor any perſons of Quality to come into <hi>Somerſet-houſe</hi> on the <hi>12th. 13th.</hi> and <hi>14th.</hi> days of <hi>October,</hi> that is, the day Sir <hi>Edmund.</hi> was Murthered, and the two days following, and particularly, that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> did come in that time, and he did <hi>refuſe him,</hi> and ſent him back again.</p>
            <p>Now as to the defences they offered for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They all denied the Fact very ſtoutly, but that is of no value againſt plain Evidence, and doe; but aggravate their Crime.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hill</hi> would have invalidated Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>'s Teſtimony, becauſe he had once denied it, and ſaid, They were innocent. But that the Court vindicated for the Reaſons before reci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3.

               </gap>l, ſay, They ſaw a Sedan come in, ſo far they agree with the King's Evidence; but then they confidently aver, That they <hi>ſaw none go out all night.</hi> But what was this to the matter of Fact, and to the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed, ſworn in all Circumſtances ſo punctually? The Sentinel might be from his Poſt, and Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> who beſt knew the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, tells us, that <hi>Berry</hi> had inveigled the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in, to drink, and ſo he might not ſee the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan go out; and then the Sentinel knowing he had committed a dangerous fault by ſo doing, might be ſo wiſe, though not very honeſt, to conceal it, and ſay there was no Sedan went out.</p>
            <p>This was all the defence they could make, which in every part appeared ſo <hi>weak,</hi> that as well the Jury, as all other impartial Auditors, were fully ſatisfied, to bring them in guilty of the Murther. On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> they were brought again to the Bar, in order to receive their Sentence, which after a grave ſpeech was pronounced, by Mr. Juſtice <hi>Wild,</hi> to whom it apperrained, as being ſecond Judg in the Court.</p>

That there was ſome ſuch Artifice uſed to ſeal up their Lips, is plain, by this notable Circumſtance. When <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> were hang'd, and dead, Captain <hi>Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> Keeper of <hi>Newgate,</hi> and many others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſaw the Executioner (amongſt other things) take a Paper out of <hi>Hill</hi>'s Pocket, purporting to be the form of ſpeech that he ſhould uſe to the People at the Gallows; which being very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably Penn'd, I ſhall here inſert the ſame <hi>verbatim,</hi> as follows,</p>

               <hi>I now come to the Fatal Place, where I muſt end my Life, and I hope, with that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that may become my Innocence: I muſt now appear before the great Judge, who knows all things, and judges rightly; and I hope it will be happy for me a Sinner, that I am thus wrongfully put to death.

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:52053:113"/>
2. That the cheif Perſons he Solicited for, were the Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Titchborn,</hi> in whoſe name he promiſed great Rewards, both in money and <hi>Eſtate,</hi> for ſhortning the Evidence, and bringing them off from the charge of High Treaſon; and particularly that he made him <hi>eaſie</hi> towards <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwick,</hi> when they were firſt Arraigned, which was to be an <hi>Aſſurance</hi> that he would accompliſh what he promiſed, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample what kindneſs might be done, wherein the Witneſs was willing to comply, to carry on the Intreigue with the Lords, till it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be diſcovered, he eſteeming that of greater <hi>Conſequence,</hi> then two old Prieſts, whom he might charge further another time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He did not know but <hi>Reading</hi> had laid a Trap for him, and therefore diſcovered theſe Conferences to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kirkby,</hi> and others; and Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> being to give him a meeting at his Lodgings on the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> he had planted one Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> a Gentleman of good Quality behind the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and making an hollow place in the Bed, laid his man there, cover'd over ſmooth with a Rugg, as if it had been new made, that they might over-hear what paſſed, and not be deſcry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There he agreed to bring the Final Anſwer of the Lords, and told him, That he had Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to draw blank Deedes, both for Sums, and Eſtates, which they would ſettle on him; and that the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was Felling of Timber to ſell, to raiſe money for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:52053:114"/>
4. That the <hi>Monday</hi> following, the Witneſs and the Priſoner drew up a Paper of what the Witneſs had to charge the aforeſaid Lords with, which was carried to the Lords, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd by <hi>Reading</hi> in his own hand writing, but minc'd ſo, as not to ſignifie any thing material againſt them. This paper Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> own'd, and it was read in Court.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> ſets forth the Conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> and Mr. <hi>Reading,</hi> which he over-heard, and that Mr. <note place="margin">Ibidem <hi>P.</hi> 28.</note> 
               <hi>Reading</hi> ſaid, The Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> would ſettle an Eſtate in <hi>Gloceſterſhire</hi> on Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe,</hi> and Sign and Seal a Deed thereof within ten days after he ſhould be diſcharged, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other diſcourſes plainly proving the matter of the Indictment, too long here to be recited. And the ſame was ſworn by <hi>Henry Wiggins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedloes</hi> man.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſwore poſitively, That Mr. <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> had given him ſeveral Sums of money, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting in all to <hi>56l.</hi> or upwards, and all to diſpoſe him to this matter.</p>
            <p>To all this Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> had very little to ſay in his own defence, that was pertinent or mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, but only endeavoured with a multitude of <hi>fine words</hi> to cloud the matter, and aſperſe the Evidence, yet in the proceſs of his diſcourſe he did in effect <hi>own the</hi> whole matter of Fact, he ſtood charged with, but would have had it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiv'd that Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> firſt propoſed it to him, and that all that he did; was not in the leaſt to ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, leſſen or ſtifle any thing of Truth, which Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> had to ſay; but only to prevent him
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52053:114"/>
from the guilt of Perjury and Innocent Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which, being ſufficiently diſproved by the Evidence, and moſt <hi>improbable</hi> in it ſelf, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry going together, ſoon returned, and brought Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> in guilty of the <hi>Miſdemeanour</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſtood Indicted.</p>
            <p>And then the Lord Cheif Juſtice <hi>North</hi> after a grave Speech reſpecting the heinouſneſs of the Crime, and the Quality of the Perſon, as being of the long Robe, whoſe <hi>knowledg</hi> ſhould keep them from ſo <hi>fooliſh,</hi> and their <hi>Integrity</hi> from ſo <hi>wicked</hi> an Attempt, Pronounced the Judgment of the Court, <hi>viz.

Accordingly he did at the ſame time <hi>publickly ſtand in the Pillory,</hi> and the People generally appear'd ſo Enraged againſt his Crimes, that if an extraordinary Guard had not been provided to ſecure him, 'tis thought, ſome Fatal Miſcheif might have been done to his Perſon, by the Fury of the incenſed Rabble.</p>

            <p>WE have told you before in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Chapter, That one part of this Damnable Popiſh Plot conſiſted in Firing, and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Narrative (ſold by Mr. <hi>Boulter,</hi> and other Bookſellers in <hi>Cornhil)</hi> hath acquainted the World how far he was concern'd therein, as a Member of their <hi>Committee</hi> appointed for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that Villany, how he was engaged by the <hi>Benedictine Monks</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Year 1676. to that purpoſe, and afterwards joined with one Father <hi>Gifford</hi> and others, to Fire <hi>Weſtminſter, Limehouſe,</hi> and other places; and he there <hi>names</hi> ſeveral particular Streets, and the <hi>very Houſes</hi> where he hired Cellars and laid in Wood, Coals, and other combuſtible Matter, to effect this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, as on the backſide of the <hi>Palſegraves-Head</hi> Tavern, without <hi>Temple-Bar, Brewers Yard</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> a Cellar at Mr. <hi>Withers</hi>'s at the <hi>Plough</hi> in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52053:115"/>
               <hi>Seething-Lane,</hi> another in <hi>White-Friars,</hi> others in <hi>Red-Croſs-Street, White-Croſs-Street, Biſhopſgate-Street, Queen-hive,</hi> &amp;c. And in his Epiſtle he names <hi>Twelve ſeveral diſtinct ways they have to cauſe and promote Fires,</hi> one of which is by <hi>Bribing Servants</hi> to fire the Houſes of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Of this kind we had about this time a notorious Inſtance, and wherein the very ſame Father <hi>Gifford</hi> was concern'd. For the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Plot hitherto had only enrag'd, not <hi>daunted</hi> the Conſpirators, and therefore they ſtill reſolv'd to go on with their Work, and amongſt others, they had drawn in one <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Oxley,</hi> a Servant Maid to one Mr. <hi>Bird,</hi> (an eminent Attorney in <hi>Fetter-Lane)</hi> who having dwelt there about 6 weeks, took the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1679. when all the Family was in Bed, to fire a large Preſs in her Maſter'<hi>s</hi> Cloſet, wherein were kept <hi>Papers and Writings,</hi> and when ſhe thought it was not to be Quencht, wak'd her Maſter and Miſtreſs with out-cries, that the Houſe was on Fire, and ran down to let in the Watch, who had took notice of it, and by the great Mercy of God, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy help, the Fire was put out, and the Houſe preſerv'd, though the Gentleman ſuffered conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable damage by it. Now as there was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability how this Fire ſhould come by any Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſo it was obſerv'd, that this <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had pack't up her Cloaths, and ſeveral other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuſpicion, whereupon ſhe was taxt with it, and at laſt <hi>confeſſed</hi> it, declaring on her Examination, That about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> 1678. ſhe became acquainted with one <hi>Nicholas Stubbs</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:52053:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Papiſt (formerly Butler to a Popiſh Lady) who had uſed mnay perſuaſions to turn her to his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and after her ſhewing a liking to it, and that he ſuppoſed ſhe had embraced that perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in his diſcourſe to her at ſeveral times told her, That ſhe ſhould <hi>ſet all the Proteſtants deſtroy'd that were in</hi> England, <hi>before the Eighth and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of</hi> June <hi>next,</hi> and that all that would turn to the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion ſhould live far better than now they did, that as for Hereticks, it were a <hi>Meritorius Act to kill them.</hi> And that all ſuch as were Papiſts ſhould have <hi>marks upon their Hats,</hi> whereby to diſtinguiſh them from Proteſtants, that they might not be deſtroy'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. That the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was the braveſt Prince living, and was gone out of the Kingdom, leſt the Heretiks ſhould cut off his head, and he would not return, till they were <hi>deſtroy'd;</hi> that not one of the Lords in the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> would <hi>Suffer,</hi> for they would come off well enough, being to be Tryed by the Lords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> She likewiſe did avouch, That ſhe telling the ſaid <hi>Stubbs,</hi> that ſhe was hired to live with Mr. <hi>Bird</hi> aforeſaid, and naming to him the place, he uſed perſuaſions to her at ſeveral times <hi>to ſet Fire</hi> on her ſaid Maſter'<hi>s</hi> Houſe, telling her, That if ſhe would do it, he would give her 5 <hi>l;</hi> and gave her once <hi>half-a-Crown</hi> in earneſt of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſaid, That he would have other Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in <hi>Holborn</hi> Fired at the ſame time by others. That on the <hi>Sunday</hi> before this Fire happen'd, ſhe was with the ſaid <hi>Stubbs,</hi> and did then promiſe that ſhe would certainly fire her Maſter'<hi>s</hi> Houſe on <hi>Thurſday</hi> or <hi>Friday</hi> Night following, and that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52053:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
accordingly ſhe did on <hi>Thurſday</hi> Night take a Candle, and ſet fire to her Maſter'<hi>s</hi> papers in his Study, which were in a kind of Preſs, and then being on a light Fire, ſhe ſhut the door, and went up ſtairs into her own Chamber at the top of the Houſe, where ſhe packt up her own things, and undreſs'd her ſelf, leſt her Maſter ſhould ſuſpect her, and there ſtay'd till a great Knocking was at the door, and the Watchmen crying out, <hi>Fire;</hi> whereupon ſhe went and let them in, but ſhe declared, That ſhe did not do this out of any <hi>Spleen</hi> or <hi>Malice</hi> towards her Maſter, nor with any attempt to <hi>Rob</hi> him, but meerly to carry on the Deſign which <hi>Stubbs</hi> had propoſed to her, out of hopes of the Reward he had promis'd.</p>
            <p>Hereupon a Warrant was iſſued forth to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>Nicholas Stubbs,</hi> who was ſhortly after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and though at firſt he <hi>out-brazen'd</hi> the Truth with the uſual Popiſh Impudence, yet when he came to be confronted with the Wench, who offered ſo many Circumſtances to convince him, he could no longer ſtand it out, but did confeſs and own, That he had uſed ſuch diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as ſhe had ſet forth in her Examination, and that he did perſuade her to fire her Maſter'<hi>s</hi> Houſe, and was to give her 5 <hi>Guinnies</hi> for doing it, beſides <hi>half-a-Crown</hi> in hand.</p>
            <p>He did likewiſe declare upon Oath, That Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gifford</hi> his Confeſſor, had put him upon this Buſineſs, and told him it was <hi>no Sin to fire all the Houſes of Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Huguenots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Derby Molrayne</hi> aliàs <hi>Flower,</hi> a Barber in <hi>Jermanſtreet;</hi> and one <hi>Roger Clinton</hi> that lodged
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52053:117"/>
at the Coach and Horſes in the ſame Street, both <hi>Iriſh men,</hi> were Engaged in the ſame Deſign; that Father <hi>Gifford</hi> promiſed this Examinate <hi>One Hundred Pounds</hi> for to carry on the Work, and told him, He was to have the money from the Church. That the ſaid <hi>Gifford, Clinton, Flower,</hi> and He, did uſe to meet in St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s <hi>Feilds</hi> in the dark of the Evening, and there to diſcourſe of theſe matters, and that the ſeveral Informations that he had given to the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth Oxley,</hi> he had from the ſaid Father <hi>Gifford.</hi> He further ſaid, That the ſaid <hi>Flower</hi> and <hi>Clinton</hi> told him the ſaid <hi>Stubbs,</hi> That they would carry on the ſaid Fire, and that they had <hi>Fireballs</hi> for that purpoſe, and that they would fire other Houſes in <hi>Holborn</hi> at the ſame time. He confeſſed he was at the Fire in the <hi>Temple,</hi> but was not Engaged to do any thing in it.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Gifford</hi> told him that there were <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Roman Catholicks</hi> enow in <hi>London,</hi> to make a very good <hi>Army,</hi> and that the <hi>French</hi> King was coming with 60 <hi>Thouſand</hi> men, under a pretence of a Progreſs to ſhew the <hi>Dauphin</hi> his Dominions, but it was to plant them along the Coaſts at <hi>Diep, Bulloign, Calais,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to be preſently ready to be Landed in <hi>England</hi> when there was an <hi>opportunity,</hi> which he doubted not but might be by the middle of <hi>June,</hi> for by that time all the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> here would be ready, who were all to <hi>riſe,</hi> and with the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>French</hi> Forces to <hi>cut off,</hi> and utterly deſtroy the Hereticks, that then the Papiſts were to be diſtinguiſh't by <hi>marks in their Hats,</hi> and that the ſaid Father <hi>Gifford</hi> doubted
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52053:117"/>
not but he ſhould be an <hi>Abbot</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> when the work was over, for the good Service he had done; who frequently told this Examinate, and the ſaid <hi>Flower</hi> and <hi>Clinton,</hi> That <hi>it was no more Sin to Kill an Heretick, than to knock a Dog o'th head,</hi> and that they did God good Service in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what miſcheif they could by <hi>Firing</hi> their Houſes. That it was <hi>well,</hi> Sir <hi>Edmundbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> was Murther'd, for he was their <hi>deviliſh Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> That <hi>Coleman</hi> was a Saint in Heaven, for what he had done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Examinate was fearful he ſhould be <hi>Murther'd</hi> for this Confeſſion, the ſaid Father <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> having ſworn him to Secrecy, and told him he ſhould be damn'd if he made any diſcovery, and ſhould be <hi>ſure to be Kill'd,</hi> but gave him leave to take the Oaths of <hi>Supremacy and Allegiance,</hi> becauſe he was an Houſe-keeper, and it was neceſſary that he ſhould ſtay in Town to help to promote the work of <hi>Burning,</hi> therefore the taking of ſuch Oaths to him ſhould be no ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the <hi>15th.</hi> That worthy Patriot Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Player,</hi> giving the Houſe of Commons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation concerning <hi>this matter</hi> of <hi>Oxley</hi> and <hi>Stubbs,</hi> the Examinations were tranſmitted to the Lords, and the Lords ſent them to the <hi>ſecret Committee</hi> to make a further inſpection and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs therein, but they had their hands ſo full of Buſineſs, that it was thought fit to appoint a <hi>Special Committee</hi> for this very purpoſe, before whom the Parties were again Examined, and gave them ſuch <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> that the Houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Suitors to his Majeſty, that they might <hi>both have his gracious Pardon,</hi> which was granted,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52053:118"/>
and a Proclamation (but not till the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>May)</hi> ſet forth—Reciting—<hi>That whereas due Information hath been given, that</hi> Morrice Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <hi>a Popiſh Prieſt,</hi> Roger Clinton, Derby Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine <hi>alias</hi> Flower, <hi>and ſeveral other Perſons of the</hi> Romiſh Religion, <hi>have (out of their deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and barbarous Malice) conſpired and agreed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to ſet on Fire the City of</hi> London, <hi>the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs thereof, and the places thereunto Adjacent, and have in proſecution of ſuch their deviliſh and wicked Deſign, procured divers Manſion Houſes within the ſaid City, Suburbs, and parts adjacent, at ſundry times, and in divers places to be ſet on Fire and Burnt. The King's moſt Excellent Majeſty (at the humble deſire of the</hi> Commons <hi>in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Aſſembled) doth Command the ſaid</hi> Gifford, Clinton, <hi>and</hi> Flower, <hi>(who are fled from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice) to render themſelves by the</hi> 10th. <hi>of</hi> May <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and is pleaſed to promiſe 50 l.

            </p>
            <p>As this ingenious Confeſſion of <hi>Oxley</hi> and <hi>Stubbs</hi> was a grand Confirmation, and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof of the reſtleſs Malice of theſe bloody Prieſts, ſo 'tis a notable Corroboration of the Truth and <hi>ſincerity</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bedloes</hi> Evidence; for how was it poſſible, if what he ſays were not certain Truth, but only contrived Stories, as Papiſts calumniat, How is it probable, I ſay, That <hi>Stubbs</hi> ſhould happen ſo exactly to accuſe the <hi>very ſame man</hi> which Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> had done,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:52053:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the Inſtigator to theſe barbarous Attempts of <hi>Firing;</hi> for at that time Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> though he had given in ſuch his Informations to the <hi>Committee of Secrecy,</hi> yet had not publiſhed the ſame abroad, ſo that <hi>Stubbs</hi> could not then have any notice thereof.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> happen'd an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Change</hi> at Court, no leſs unexpected, than grateful to the people, who by ſuch alteration of <hi>Miniſters</hi> did hope to find conſiderable improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the management of the publick Affairs; for his Majeſty having cauſed his <hi>Privy Council</hi> to be extraordinarily ſummon'd, was pleas'd by the Lord Chancellor to <hi>diſſolve them;</hi> and to declare his Pleaſure, <hi>That for the future, their conſtant Number ſhould be limited to that of Thirty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Fifteen to be of his chief</hi> Officers, <hi>who ſhall be Privy Councellors by their Places, Ten others of the</hi> Nobility, <hi>and Five</hi> Commons <hi>of the Realm, whoſe known Abilities, Intereſt, and Eſteem, in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall render them without all ſuſpicion of either miſtaking or betraying the true Intereſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

The <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> His Majeſty made a Speech to both Houſes of Parliament, wherein he recommended three things to them, The proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Plot,</hi> The disbanding of the <hi>Army,</hi> and the providing a <hi>Fleet,</hi> which was followed by a larger ſignification of his Majeſties mind, by the Lord Chancellor,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That His Majeſty had conſidered with himſelf, That 'tis not enough that his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Religion and Liberty be ſecure, during his own Reign, but thinks he ows it to his People to do all that in him lies, that theſe Bleſſings may be tranſmitted to Poſterity. And to the end that it may never be in the power of any Papiſt, if the Crown deſcend upon him, to make any change in Church or State, his Majeſty would conſent to limit ſuch Succeſſor, in theſe points. 1. That no ſuch Popiſh Succeſſor ſhall preſent to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Benefices. 2. That during the Reign of ſuch Popiſh Succeſſor, no Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, or Judges, Lord Leiutenant, or Deputy Leiutenant, or Officer of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, ſhall be put in, or removed but by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament. 3.

time, or the laſt Parliament Re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems all theſe Proviſions were not thought a ſufficient <hi>Fence</hi> for ſuch dear and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things as <hi>Religion and Liberty,</hi> and that in the progreſs of their Debates upon this moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Subject, they could not reſolve upon any certain Expedient of ſafety, leſs than the Excluſion of his Royal Higneſs.</p>
            <p>For on <hi>Sunday April</hi> the <hi>27th.</hi> 1679.

            <p>And on <hi>Sunday May</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> (the <hi>better Day the better Deed</hi> we uſe to ſay, but whether it will hold here, will be the Queſtion,) they Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That a <hi>Bill</hi> ſhould be brought in to <hi>diſable the Duke of</hi> York <hi>to Inherit the Imperial Crown</hi> of this Realm; which was brought in accordingly, and <hi>twice</hi> read in the Houſe; the preamble there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being to this effect,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That foraſmuch as theſe Kingdoms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>by the wonderful Providence of God many Years ſince, have been delivered from the Slavery and Superſtition of</hi> Popery, <hi>which had deſpoiled the King of his Sovereign Power, for that it did and doth advance</hi>

the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to a Power over So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princes, and makes him Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the Univerſe, and doth with-draw the Subjects from their Allegiance by pretended Abſolutions from all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Daths and Obligations to their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sovereign, and by many Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Immoralities, hath quite ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the Ends of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But notwithſtanding, That <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> hath been long ſince Condemned by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, for the deteſtable Doctrine, and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Attempts of its Adherents, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lives of their lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, Kings and Queens of theſe Realms. Yet the Emiſſaries, Prieſts, and Agents, for the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting into this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in great numbers, contrary to the known Laws thereof, have for ſeveral Years laſt paſt, as well by their own Deviliſh Acts and Policies, as by Counſel and Aſſiſtance of Foreign Princes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, known Enemies to theſe Nations, contrived and carried on a moſt Horrid and Execrable Conſpiracy, To deſtroy and Murther the Perſon of his Sacred Majeſty, and to Subvert the ancient Government of theſe Realms, and to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52053:121"/>
Extirpate the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and Maſſacre the true Profeſſors thereof.

for their Superſtition and Idolatry, and to deliver up, and reſtore to them the Lands and Poſſeſſions now Veſted in his Majeſty and his Subjects, by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, and alſo to Found and Erect new Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and Convents, and remove and deprive all Proteſtant Biſhops and other Eccleſiaſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from their Livings, Benefices, and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by this means to deſtroy his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Perſon, extirpate the Proteſtant Religion, overthrow the Rights, Liberties, and Properties of all his Majeſties good Subjects, Subvert the lawful Government of this Kingdom, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the ſame to the Tyranny of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And the ſaid Conſpirators and their Complices, and Confederates, Traiterouſly had and held ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Meetings, Aſſemblies, and Conſultations, wherein 'twas contrived and deſigned amongſt them, what means ſhould be uſed, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Inſtruments which ſhould be imployed to Murther his Majeſty, and did then and there reſolve to effect it by Poiſoning, Shooting, Stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, or ſome ſuch like ways or means.</p>
               <p>And to that part of the Impeachment, named, The better to compaſs their Traiterous Deſigns, have conſulted to raiſe Money, Men, Horſes, Arms, and Ammunition.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Lord ſaving to himſelf (and which he humbly prays, may be reſerved to him) the liberty of Anſwering over, and denying all and ſingular the ſaid Crimes and Offences charged on him, <hi>Saith,</hi> And humbly offereth to this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſe, that the charge of thoſe Crimes and Offences ſo impoſed on him by the ſaid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52053:129"/>
are ſo general and uncertain, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly give any direct Anſwer thereto, or make any juſt or lawful defence upon his Tryal, for that the ſaid Charge had no manner of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in point of time, it being laid only for many Years now laſt paſt, which may be for 5, 10, 20, 30, or more Years, whereby though the ſaid Lord knoweth himſelf to be altogether innocent of any ſuch horrid and deteſtable Crimes, as by the ſaid Impeachment are object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him.</p>
               <p>Yet 'tis impoſſible for him on any Tryal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to be prepared with his juſt and lawful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by Witneſſes, to prove himſelf abſent, or in any other place, at the time of ſuch Meetings or Conſultations to, or for any of the wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes in the ſaid Impeachment mentioned, as on his Tryal may be ſuddenly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt him, when he cannot by any care or foreſight whatever, have ſuch Witneſſes ready, as would ſpeak thereunto, if they were certainly charged for any Traiterous Deſign, Act, or Crime, at any time certainly alleadged in the ſaid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment.</p>
               <p>Nor is the ſaid Charge in the ſaid Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more certain, as to the place of any ſuch Traiterous Meeting or Conſultation laid down in the ſaid Impeachment, it being only alledged to be at divers places in this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and elſewhere, which for the Cauſe aforeſaid, is ſo utterly uncertain, that it deprives the ſaid Lord of his defence on his Tryal. Likewiſe the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the number of Meetings or Conſultations to the wicked purpoſes in the Impeachment, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52053:130"/>
the not ſhewing how many times the Lords met and conſulted, and with whom in particular, doth likewiſe deprive him of all poſſibility of making his defence, in producing Witneſſes; for the ſaid Lord being wholy innocent, cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or imagin what Meeting or Conſultation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to raiſe Money, or Men, for carrying on of a Traiterous Deſign, or to any other wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or purpoſe in the ſaid Impeachment menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, ſhall or may be objected againſt him on his Tryal, and 'tis as impoſſible for him to bring Witneſſes to prove all the Meetings he hath had with others in his life time, as 'tis for him to foreſee, on this general Charge, what Meetings or Conſultations may on his Tryal be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him as Traiterous Conſultations.</p>
               <p>And whereas 'tis in the ſaid Impeachment charged on the ſaid Lord, That he hath uttered Treaſon by malicious and adviſed ſpeaking, and otherwiſe declaring the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Lord ſaith, That never any Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Thoughts entered into his Heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot poſſibly know what words or writings he ever ſpoke, uttered, reveal'd, or declared, which are now charged on him as Treaſon; their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no words or writings at all ſpecified in the Impeachment, whereby the ſaid Lord might know how to prepare his defence againſt them. So as this Honourable Court may or might judg, whether the ſame words or writings are in truth Treaſonable or not.</p>
               <p>ALL WHICH incertainties, and eminent and apparent Dangers of the ſaid Lord, being there-upon ſurprized in a Cauſe of this Conſequence,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52053:130"/>
wherein his Life and Honour (more dear to him than his Life) and all elſe that is dear to him in this World, are immediately concerned being ſeriouſly weighed and conſidered by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, he humbly prayeth, (as by his Councel he is adviſed,) that your Lordſhips will not put him to Anſwer the ſaid Impeachment herein above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, till the ſame be reduced to ſuch compleat certainty, that the ſaid Lord may know how to Anſwer thereunto, and may thereby be enabled to make his juſt defence accordingly.</p>
               <p>ALL WHICH notwithſtanding, he humbly ſubmitteth to whatſoever your Lordſhips in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhall order and think fit, and as to all other Treaſons, Crimes, and Offences, contained, mentioned, or ſpecified in the ſaid Impeachment, the ſaid Lord proteſting his Innocency, In the great Wiſdom and Sentence of this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Court, ſhall always Acquieſce.</p>
               <p>So the Reſt, <hi>Mutatis Mutandis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe Pleas being Judg'd unſatisfactory and illegal, they were afterwards forc'd to plead the general Iſſue.</p>
               <p>And now there were daily expectations of their being brought to Tryal, and Scaffolds erected in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> for that purpoſe, but in the mean time, the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> late Lord Treaſurer, whom the Commons had likewiſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd for Treaſon, and who had for ſome time abſconded himſelf, did on the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exſpectedly ſurrender himſelf, and inſiſted on his

                  <hi>Pardon,</hi> which the Commons Voted <hi>Illegal,</hi> and thereupon prayed <hi>Judgment</hi> againſt him on the Impeachment. About this matter, and alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Queſtion, whether the <hi>Biſhops had a right to ſit upon the Lords, when they ſhould be brought to Tryal,</hi> ſome miſunderſtandings happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Houſes, for removing of which, and ſettling a good Correſpondence, the Houſe of Commons uſed ſeveral Endeavours, as by the following Paper may appear.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:52053:131"/>
               <head>THE <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Narrative</hi> OF Proceedings, BETWIXT THE <hi>Two Houſes:</hi> WHICH Were delivered by the Houſe of COMMONS TO THE LORDS: At the Conference touching the Lords in the Tower, On <hi>Munday 26th.</hi> of May, 1679.</head>
               <p>THE Commons have always deſired, that a good Correſpondence may be preſerved between the two Houſes.</p>
               <p>There is now depending between your Lordſhips and the Commons a matter of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt weight: In the Tranſactions of which, your Lordſhips ſeem to apprehend ſome difficulty in the matters propoſed by the Commons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:52053:132"/>
To clear this, the Commons have deſired this Conference; and by it they hope to manifeſt to your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lordſhips, that the Propoſitions of the Houſe, made by their Committee, in relation to the Tryal of the Lords in the Tower, have been only ſuch as are well warranted by the Laws of the Parliament, and Conſtitutions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and in no ſort intrench upon the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature of the Peers; but are moſt neceſſary to be inſiſted upon, that the Antient Rights of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature in Parliament may be maintained.</p>
               <p>The Commons readily acknowledg, that the Crimes charged upon the Earl of <hi>Powis,</hi> Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Stafford,</hi> Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> are of deep Guilt, and call for ſpeedy Juſtice: But withall, they hold, That any change in Judicature in Parliament, made without conſent in full Parliament, to be of pernicious Conſequence, both to his Majeſty, and his Subjects; and conceive themſelves obliged to tranſmit to their Poſterity, all the Rights which of this kind they have received from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, by putting your Lordſhips in mind of the progreſs that hath already been between the two Houſes, in relation to the Propoſitions made by the Commons, and the Reaſonableneſs of the Propoſitions themſelves: They doubt not but to make it appear, that their aim has been no other, than to avoid ſuch Conſequences, and preſerve that Right; and that there is no delay of Juſtice on their part. And to that end, do offer to your Lordſhips the enſuing Reaſons and Narrative:</p>
               <p>That the Commons in bringing the Earl
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52053:132"/>
of <hi>Danby</hi> to Juſtice, and in diſcovery of that Execrable and Traiterous Conſpiracy, (of which the Five Popiſh Lords now ſtand Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and for which ſome of their wicked Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices have already undergone the Sentence of the Law, as Traytors, and Murtherers,) have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under many great Difficulties, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to your Lordſhips.</p>
               <p>Nor is it leſs known to your Lordſhips, That upon the Impeachment of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons againſt the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> for High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and other High Crimes, Miſdemenours, and Offences, even the Common Juſtice of Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring him from Parliament, and forthwith Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to ſafe Cuſtody, was then required by the Commons, and denied by the Houſe of Peers, though he then Sate in their Houſe: Of which your Lordſhips have been ſo ſenſible, that at a free Conference the Tenth of <hi>April</hi> laſt, your Lordſhips declared, That it was the Right of the Commons, and well Warranted by Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of former Ages, That upon an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Commons, a Peer ſo Impeached, ought of Right to be Ordered to with-draw, and then to be committed. And had not that Juſtice been denied to the Commons, great part of this Seſſion of Parliament, which hath been ſpent in framing and adjuſting a Bill, for cauſing the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to appear, and Anſwer that Juſtice, from which he was fled; had been ſaved, and had been imployed for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Majeſties Perſon, and the ſecurity of the Nation, and in Proſecution of the other Five Lords. Neither had he had the Opportunity for
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52053:133"/>
procuring for himſelf that illegal Pardon, which bears date the Firſt of <hi>March</hi> laſt paſt, and which he hath now pleaded in Bar of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment. Nor of waſting ſo great a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Treaſure of the Kingdom, as he hath done, ſince the Commons exhibited their Articles of Impeachment againſt him.</p>
               <p>After which time thus loſt, by reaſon of the denyal of that Juſtice which of Right belonged to the Commons upon their Impeachment, the ſaid Bill being ready for the Royal Aſſent, the ſaid Earl then rendred himſelf; and by your Lordſhips Order of the Sixteenth of <hi>April</hi> laſt, was Committed to the Tower. After which, he pleads the ſaid Pardon; and being preſt, did at length declare, He would relie upon, and abide by that Plea, which Pardon pleaded, being ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and void, and ſo ought not to Bar or Preclude the Commons from having Juſtice upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment. They did thereupon with their Speaker on the Fifth of <hi>May</hi> inſtant, in the name of themſelves, and all the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Demand Judgment againſt the ſaid Earl, upon their Impeachment: Not doubting, but that your Lordſhips did intend in all your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings upon the Impeachment, to follow the uſual Courſe and Method of Parliament.</p>
               <p>But the Commons were not a little ſurprized by the Meſſage from your Lordſhips, delivered them on the Seventh of <hi>May;</hi> thereby acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, That as well the Lords Spiritual as Temporal, had Ordered, that the Tenth of <hi>May</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:52053:133"/>
inſtant, ſhould be the day for hearing the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> to make good his Plea of Pardon. And that on the Thirteenth of <hi>May,</hi> the other Five Lords Impeached, ſhould be brought to their Tryal: And that your Lordſhips had Addreſſed to his Majeſty, for naming a <hi>Lord High Steward,</hi> as well in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> as the other Five Lords.</p>
               <p>Upon conſideration of this Meſſage, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons found, that the admitting the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to exerciſe Juriſdiction in theſe Caſes, was an alteration of the Judicature in Parliament; and which extended as well to the Proceeding againſt the other Five Lords, as the Earl of <hi>Danby.</hi> And if a <hi>Lord High-Steward</hi> ſhould be neceſſary upon Tryal on Impeachments of the Commons, the Power of Judicature in Parliament upon Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments, might be Defeated, by ſuſpending or denying a Commiſſion to conſtitute a <hi>Lord High-Steward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the ſaid days of Tryal, appointed by your Lordſhips, were ſo near to the time of your ſaid Meſſage, that theſe Matters, and the Method of Proceeding upon the Tryal, could not be Adjuſted by Conference betwixt the two Houſes, before the Day ſo nominated. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Commons could not then Proceed to Tryal, unleſs the Zeal which they have for ſpeedy Judgment againſt the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> (that ſo they might proceed to Tryal of the other Five Lords) ſhould induce them at this Juncture, both to admit the inlargement of your Lordſhips Juriſdiction, and to ſit down under
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52053:134"/>
theſe or any hardſhips, though with the hazard of all the Commons Power of Impeaching for time to come) rather than the Tryal of the ſaid Five Lords ſhould be deferred for ſome ſhort time, whilſt theſe Matters might be agreed on and ſettled.</p>
               <p>For Reconciling Differences in theſe great and weighty Matters, and for ſaving that time, which would neceſſarily have been ſpent in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and Conferences betwixt the two Houſes, and ſo expediting the Tryal, without giving up the Power of Impeachment, or rendring them ineffectual.</p>
               <p>The Commons thought fit to propoſe to your Lordſhips, that a Committee of both Houſes might be appointed for this purpoſe. At which Committee (when agreed to, by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips) it was firſt propoſed, That the time of Tryal of the Lords in the Tower ſhould be put off till the other Matters were Adjuſted, and it was then agreed, That the Propoſitions as to the time of the Tryal, ſhould be the laſt thing conſidered. And the effect of this Agreement ſtands reported upon your Lordſhips Books.</p>
               <p>After which, The Commons communicated to your Lordſhips, by your Committee, a Vote of theirs, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Committee of the Commons ſhould inſiſt upon their former Vote of their Houſe, That the Lords Spiritual ought not to have any Vote in any Proceedings againſt the Lords in the Tower, and that when that
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52053:134"/>
Matter ſhould be ſettled, and the Method of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings Adjuſted, the Commons would then be ready to proceed upon the Tryal of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> againſt whom they had before Demanded Judgment, and afterwards to the Tryal of the other Five Lords in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Which Vote extended as well to the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> as the other Five Lords; but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons as yet received nothing from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips towards an Anſwer of that Vote, ſave that your Lordſhips have acquainted them, that the Biſhops have asked leave of the Houſe of Peers, that they might withdraw themſelves from the Tryal of the ſaid Five Lords, with liberty of entring their uſual proteſtation.</p>
               <p>And though the Commons Committee have almoſt daily Declared to your Lordſhips Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, that that was a neceſſary point of Right to be ſettled before the Tryal, and offered to debate the ſame, your Committee always anſwered, That they had not any Power from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, either to conſer upon, or to give any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer concerning that Matter.</p>
               <p>And yet your Lordſhips, without having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Commons any ſatisfactory Anſwer to the ſaid Vote, or permitting any Conference or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate thereupon, and contrary to the ſaid Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Twenty Second of <hi>May,</hi> ſend a Meſſage to the Commons, Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, That the Lords Spiritual as well as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, had Ordered that the Twenty Seventh of this inſtant <hi>May,</hi> be appointed for the Tryal of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52053:135"/>
the Five Lords. So that the Commons cannot but apprehend, that your Lordſhips have not only departed from what was agreed on, and in effect laid aſide that Committee which was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for preſerving a good underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Houſes, and better diſpatch of the weighty Affairs now depending in Parliament: But muſt alſo needs conclude from the Meſſage, and the Votes of your Lordſhips on the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>May,</hi> That the Lords Spiritual have a Right to ſtay and ſit in Court, till the Court proceeds to the Vote of Guilty or not Guilty. And from the Biſhops asking leave (as appears by your Lordſhips Books two days after your ſaid Vote) that they might with-draw themſelves from the Tryal of the ſaid Lords, with liberty of entring their uſual Proteſtation, and by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting ſtill to go on, and give their Votes, Proceedings upon the Impeachment, that their deſire of leave to with-draw at the ſaid Tryal, is only an Evaſive Anſwer to the before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Vote of the Commons, and chiefly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an Argument for a Right of Judicature in Proceedings upon Impeachments, and as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to judg upon the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Plea of Pardon, and upon theſe and other like Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, although no ſuch Power was ever claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Predeceſſors, but is utterly denyed by the Commons, and the Commons are the rather to beleive it ſo intended, becauſe the very asking leave to withdraw ſeems to imploy a Right to be be there, and that they cannot be abſent without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:52053:135"/>
And becauſe by this way, they would have it in their Power, whether or no for the future, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Caſe, or any other, they will ever ask leave to be abſent; and the Temporal Lords a like Power of denying leave, if that ſhould once be admitted neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The Commons therefore are obliged not to proceed to the Tryal of the Lords on the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Seventh of this inſtant <hi>May,</hi> but to Adhere to their aforeſaid Vote: And for ſo doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what hath been now and formerly by them ſaid to your Lordſhips, do offer you theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons following.</p>
               <list>
                  <head>Reaſons. </head>
                  <item>I. Becauſe your Lordſhips have received the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Plea of Pardon, with a very long and uſual Proteſtation; wherein he hath Aſperſed his Majeſty by falſe Suggeſtions, as if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty had Commanded or Countenanced the Crimes he ſtands charged with, and particularly ſuppreſſing and diſcouraging the Diſcovery of the Plot, and endeavouring to Introduce an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Tyrannical way of Government: Which remains as a Scandal upon Record againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, tending to render his Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment odious to his People; againſt which, it
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52053:136"/>
ought to be the firſt and principal care of both Houſes to Vindicate his Majeſty, by doing Juſtice upon the ſaid Earl.</item>
                  <item>II. The Setting up a Pardon to be a Bar of an Impeachment, defeats the whole uſe and effect of Impeachments; and ſhould this point be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or ſtand doubted, it would totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the exhibiting any for the future: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the cheif Inſtitution for the Preſervation of the Government, (and conſequently the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf) would be deſtroyed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Caſe of the ſaid Earl (which in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence concerns all Impeachments whatſoever) ought to be determined before that of the ſaid Five Lords, which is but their particular Caſe.</item>
                  <item>III. And without reſorting to many Authorities of greater Antiquity: The Commons deſire your Lordſhips to take notice, (with the ſame regard they do) of the Declaration which that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prince, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, made in this behalf, in his Anſwer to the Nineteen Propoſitions of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Wherein, Stating the ſeveral parts of this regulated Monarchy, he ſays; <hi>The King, the Houſe of Lords, and the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, have each particular Privileges:</hi> And among thoſe which belong to the King, he reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Power of Pardoning. After the enumerate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52053:136"/>
of which, and other his Prerogatives, His ſaid Majeſty adds thus: Again, <q>That the Prince may not make uſe of this high and perpetual Power, to the hurt of thoſe for whoſe good he hath it, and make uſe of the name of publick neceſſity, for the gain of his private Favourites and Followers, to the detriment of his People; The Houſe of Commons, (an excellent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of Liberty, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> is ſolely intruſted with the firſt Propoſitions concerning the Levies of Money, and the Impeaching of thoſe, who, for their own ends, though countenanced by any ſurreptitiouſly-gotten Command of the King, have violated that Law, which he is bound (when he knows it) to protect, and to the protection of which, they were bound to adviſe him, at leaſt not to ſerve him in the contrary. And the Lords being Truſted with a Judicatory Power, are an excellent Screen and Bank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prince and People, to aſſiſt each againſt any encroachments of the other, and by juſt Judgments to preſerve that Law, which ought to be the Rule of every one of the three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore the Power legally placed in both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is more then ſufficient to prevent and reſtrain the power of Tyranny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. Until the Commons of <hi>England</hi> have Right done them againſt this Plea of Pardon, they may juſtly apprehend, that the whole Juſtice of the Kingdom, in the Caſe of the Five Lords,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52053:137"/>

               <p>The Proceedings againſt <hi>Whitebread,</hi> and the other Four Jeſuits.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ON <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1679, was the grand Tryal of Five notorious Jeſuits, <hi>viz. Thomas White</hi> aliàs <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread,</hi> Provincial, or cheif of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits in <hi>England,</hi> a comely antient man, of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grave deportment, both at his Tryal and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; <hi>William Harcourt</hi> pretended Rector of <hi>London,</hi> who 'tis thought, after the firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Plot had been beyond the Seas, and had the confidence to return hither again, where being apprehended in his Lodging near long Acre, he was by the Lords and Commons Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Newgate</hi> on the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Fenwick</hi> Procurator of the Jeſuits in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Gavan</hi> aliàs <hi>Gawen,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Turner,</hi> Committed firſt to the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> and thence brought to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was at the ſame time Arraigned one <hi>James Corker</hi> a Benedictine Monk, but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending he had not his Witneſſes ready, was put off, and happy it was for him, who ſince was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted with <hi>Wakeman;</hi> whereas if he had then been tryed, 'tis moſt probable, it would have prov'd as Fatal to him as the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:52053:139"/>
               <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwick</hi> pleaded that they were <hi>tryed before</hi> for the ſame Fact, but the Court anſwer'd, That though they were indeed once Arraign'd, yet the Jury was diſcharg'd of them, and they not then in any Jeopardy of their Lives, and therefore muſt plead to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</p>
            <p>Then the Priſoner made a general Challenge, That none ſhould be of their Jury, that were of any of the former Juries concerning the Plot; Thoſe now ſworn were</p>

            <p>The Proofs were long, and conſiſting in divers particulars. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> Swears, That the Conſult of the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> was by the Order of <hi>Whitebread</hi> the Priſoner at the <note place="margin">See the Tryal of <hi>Whitebread,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>P.</hi> 12.</note> Bar as Provincial, and that then the ſaid <hi>Whitebread,</hi> and <hi>Fenwick,</hi> and <hi>Harcourt,</hi> and <hi>Turner,</hi> did all in his preſence Sign the Reſolve for the King's death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>Whitebread</hi> after his return back again to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> did ſay, That he hoped to ſee the King's Head laid faſt enough, only he had not the manners to give him the Title of King, but ſhew'd his ſpight by calling his Majeſty opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly—<hi>[Theſe are thoſe that ſpeak evil of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:52053:139"/>
3. That in <hi>July, Aſhby,</hi> alias <hi>Timbleby,</hi> brought over Inſtructions from <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> to offer Sir <hi>George Wakeman 10000 l.</hi> to poyſon the King; and alſo a Commiſſion to Sir <hi>John Gage</hi> to be an Officer in the Army which they deſign'd to raiſe; which the Witneſs himſelf delivered to him the ſaid Sir <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That <hi>Turner</hi> was at the Conſult; and at <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber he ſaw him ſigne the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve for the King's Death.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That as for <hi>Gavan,</hi> alias <hi>Gawen,</hi> though he could not poſitively ſay he ſaw him at the Conſult, yet he ſaw his hand ſubſcribed to it; and makes it out how he knows it to be his hand. And that he in <hi>July</hi> 78. gave <note place="margin">P. 15.</note> them in <hi>London</hi> an account how proſperous their affairs were in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> and <hi>Shropſhire;</hi> that the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was very diligent, and that there was two or three Thouſand Pound ready there, to carry on the Deſigne: And that ſome time in <hi>July</hi> homet the ſaid <hi>Gawen</hi> at <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Chamber, where in his preſence he gave Father <hi>Ireland</hi> the ſame account, as before he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>The next Witneſs was Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave Evidence before at any of their Tryals, who had no knowledge of either Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> or Mr. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> when he firſt came in and ſo could not conſpire with them to charge the very ſame perſons as they had done. He ſwears.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Againſt <hi>Whitebread,</hi> That he <hi>ſaw</hi> a Letter under his hand (and tells you how he knew it
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52053:140"/>
to be his,) to Father <hi>Ewers</hi> a Jeſuit, and the ſaid Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Confeſſor, in which he ordered him to be ſure to chuſe men that were <hi>hardy and truſty,</hi> no matter whether they were Gentlemen, <hi>p.</hi> 22. and <hi>p.</hi> 29. he ſwears it again, and what they were to do; that the words under his hand were in expreſs terms,—<hi>For Killing the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Againſt <hi>Gawen</hi> he ſwears directly, that <hi>he entertain'd</hi> him the ſaid Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to be of the Conſpiracy to <hi>Murther the King,</hi> as one of thoſe reſolute Fellows preſcribed by <hi>Whitebread;</hi> and that they had ſeveral Conſultations in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, at ſeveral places which he names, for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the King, and bringing in Popery; as at <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> and at <hi>Tixal,</hi> in <hi>Sept.</hi> 1678. And that he heard them diſcourſe at one of theſe Conſults, that it was the opinion of the Monks at <hi>Paris,</hi> who were concern'd in the Conſpiracy, and were to aſſiſt, That aſſoon as the Deed was done, that is, the Killing of the King, they ſhould <hi>lay it on the Presbyterians,</hi> thereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the other Proteſtants to cut their <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> Throats, and then they might the more eaſily cut theirs. And <hi>p.</hi> 26. That he hath intercepted and read (for all their Letters in thoſe Parts came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Cover) above 100 Letters to the ſame purpoſe, all tending to the Introducing of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and Killing the King; which being without any Names, only directed to Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and to be delivered by marks known to Father <hi>Ewers,</hi> if they had been intercepted by the way, only <hi>Dugdale</hi> could have been called in queſtion for it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:52053:140"/>
3. That himſelf was ſo zealous in the Cauſe; that he had given them 400 <hi>l.</hi> for carrying on this Deſign, which <hi>Gavan</hi> had made him believe was not only lawful, but meritorious; and that he was to be ſent up to <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Harcourt,</hi> there to be inſtructed for Killing the <note place="margin">P. 23.</note> King.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the ſame <hi>Harcourt,</hi> whoſe hand the Witneſs well knows, did write word of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundbury Godfrey</hi>'s being Murthered, that very Night it was done, to Father <hi>Ewers;</hi> ſo that they knew of it in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> ſeveral days before any (except thoſe privy to the Murder) at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> knew, what was become of him. And to confirm his Teſtimony herein, he produceth Mr. <hi>Chetwin,</hi> a Perſon of Quality, who ſwears, That he did hear it then reported as from <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale;</hi> and that he was not in Town when the Murderers of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> were Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or elſe he would then have witneſſed the ſame.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Againſt <hi>Turner</hi> he poſitively ſwears, That he ſaw him with others at <hi>Ewers</hi>'s Chamber, where they conſulted together to carry on this Deſign; and that he agreed to the Plot, that is, bringing in of Popery by Killing the King.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> gave Evidence,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Againſt <hi>Harcourt,</hi> That ſuch a day, when he paid him for an Image of the <note place="margin">P. 30.</note> Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to ſend into <hi>Maryland,</hi> he told the Witneſs that there was a Deſign of Killing the King.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againſt <hi>Fenwick,</hi> That he told him in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52053:141"/>
               <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Chamber, <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, that there ſhould be 50000 Men <note place="margin">P. 31.</note> in Arms in a readineſs to ſettle their Religion, and that they ſhould be commanded by the Lords <hi>Beliaſts, Powis,</hi> and <hi>Arundel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> was ſworn, who firſt gives a ſatisfactory account why he did not before give in his Evidence againſt <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwick,</hi> becauſe he was then finding out the Bribery and Subornation of <hi>Reading,</hi> in behalf of the Lords in the Tower; but now he poſitively ſwears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he hath ſeen both <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwick</hi> at ſeveral Conſults about this Plot, and that he heard <hi>Whitebread</hi> at <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber tell <hi>Coleman</hi> the manner of the ſending the four Ruſſians to <hi>Windſor</hi> to kill the King.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he ſaw <hi>Harcourt</hi> take out of a Cabinet about 80 or 100 <hi>l.</hi> and give it to a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, to be carried to the ſaid <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 32.</note> with a Guiney to drink Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s health.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Whitebread</hi> told him, That <hi>Pickering</hi> was to have a great number of <hi>Maſſes,</hi> and <hi>Grove 1500 l.</hi> for killing the King. <note place="margin">P. 33.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That <hi>Harcourt</hi> employed him ſeveral times to carry their Conſults beyond the Seas, and that he received in <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s preſence Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s <hi>thanks</hi> for his Fidelity; and <note place="margin">P. 35.</note> that <hi>Harcourt</hi> recommended him to the Lord <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel,</hi> who promiſed him <hi>great favour</hi> when the times were turned: Alſo that he ſaw <hi>Harcourt</hi> give <hi>Wakeman</hi> a Bill to receive 2000 <hi>l.</hi> in part of a greater ſum; and heard Sir <hi>George</hi> ſay, 15000 <hi>l.</hi> was <hi>a ſmall Reward</hi> for the ſettling Religion,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52053:141"/>
and preſerving three Kingdomes from Ruine.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, there is the poſitive Teſtimony of <hi>three,</hi> viz. Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe,</hi> againſt <hi>Whitebread:</hi> Of <hi>three</hi> quite blank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Fenwick;</hi> viz. <hi>Oates, Bedloe,</hi> and <hi>Prance.</hi> And againſt <hi>Harcourt, four</hi> very fully; <hi>Oates, Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, Bedloe</hi> and <hi>Prance.</hi> Againſt <hi>Gavan</hi> there is poſitively <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s and <hi>Oates</hi>'s; and the ſame directly againſt <hi>Turner.</hi> Whereby the matter of Fact is plainly proved, and the Evidence full and legal againſt them all.</p>
            <p>There was alſo the before-mentioned Letter read, found amongſt <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Papers, which did much <hi>fortifie</hi> the Evidence as to the certainty and nature of the Conſult of the 24th of <hi>April.</hi> It was written from one <hi>Petre</hi> a Jeſuit, to another of their Society, to let him know there was to be a Conſult on the ſaid 24th of <hi>April,</hi> in which were theſe words: <hi>Every one is minded alſo not to haſten to</hi> London <hi>long before the time appointed, nor to appear much about the Town till the meeting be over, leſt occaſion ſhould be given to ſuſpect the Deſign.</hi> Finally, <hi>Secrecy as to the Time and Place, is much recommended to all thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Summons, as it will appear of its own nature neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as to what the Priſoners had to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all this, it was well obſerved by the Lord Chief-Juſtice, <hi>p.</hi> 89. That they <hi>defend their Lives as they do their Religion with weak Arguments, and fallacious Reaſons.</hi> For to omit their Aſperſions, which they did not ſo much as offer to prove upon the Witneſſes, and therefore ſignified little,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52053:142"/>
the main part of their Defence conſiſted in <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Lads</hi> of their own tutoring, brought from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> on purpoſe to prove Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> to have been all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 1678. and till the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that he could not be at the Conſult at <hi>London 24 April,</hi> nor truly know any of the particulars which he ſwears to, depending there-upon: and indeed they all ſaid, and offer'd to ſwear it very confidently, that they ſaw him every day, Converſed and Dined with him; and that he was never out of the Colledge, except two Days and one Night he was abſent at <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and two or three days that he was in the Infirmary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſtill to make good Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Teſtimony, 'tis obſervable, that theſe Witneſſes were at great variance amongſt themſelves; ſome of them ſaid, That Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> left their Colledge ſome time in <hi>June,</hi> ſome ſay the tenth, ſome the latter end. But <hi>p.</hi> 53. one of them miſtakes his Moneth, and avers he <hi>is ſure</hi> it was in <hi>July</hi> that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> went away; and being told that he differed from all the reſt, he cryed, <hi>He was ſure he was there till after the Conſult at</hi> London; which gave a great light to what point of time theſe Novices were inſtructed to ſpeak to, and cauſed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to laugh to ſee the Youngman out in his part.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> brought no leſs than <hi>ſeven ſubſtantial Witneſſes, who ſwear</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 79.</note> his being in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> 1678. the time that they aver him to have conſtantly been at St. <hi>Omers.</hi> 1. A <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſwears he ſaw him,

(which is confirmed by a Gentlewoman to whom he then told it) that he had the day before ſeen <hi>Titus Oates</hi> in St. <hi>Martins-lane,</hi> diſguiſed in a Serge Coat, and gray Hat. Mrs. <hi>Mayo, (p.</hi> 81.) ſwears more punctually as to point of time; That about a week before <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> which was in <hi>May,</hi> ſhe ſaw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> twice in Sir <hi>Richard Barkers</hi> Court-yard in <hi>London,</hi> and that one of Sir <hi>Richards</hi> men told her it was Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and that he was either turned <hi>Quaker</hi> or <hi>Jeſuite;</hi> but ſhe replyed he was no <hi>Quaker,</hi> becauſe he then wore a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwig;</hi> and ſwears this Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> in Court was the ſame man which then ſhe ſaw there. And then one <hi>Page</hi> ſwears, that he ſaw this Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in a gray or light-coloured Campaign Coat, and diſcourſed with him at Sir <hi>Rich. Barkers,</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 78. and tells a circumſtance to prove his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it was in <hi>May.</hi> Sir <hi>Richards</hi> Coachman ſwears, that he was well acquainted with Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and that he was at their Houſe in <hi>Barbican</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>May</hi> 78. with his Hair cut cloſe to his Ears, in gray cloaths, and inquired for Doctor <hi>Tongue.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi> himſelf ſwears that he being then in the Country, when he came home his Servants told him that <hi>Titus Oates</hi> had been there in ſuch a <hi>ſtrange Habit,</hi> and they thought he was turned either <hi>Quaker</hi> or <hi>Papiſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> School-maſter at <hi>Iſlington, (p.</hi> 84.) ſwears, That in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> 78. Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> dined with him at his Houſe at <hi>Iſlington;</hi> and as he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, it was the firſt Munday in <hi>May;</hi> and that he knew him well, for he had been his <hi>Scholar</hi> at Merchant-Tailors School, when the Witneſs was Uſher there; and that he ſtayed with him three
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52053:143"/>
or four hours after Dinner, diſcourſing of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. Laſtly, one Mr. <hi>Clay,</hi> who own'd himſelf a Roman-Catholick, (and is ſuppoſed to be a Prieſt; nay, affirmed ſince by <hi>Blunden</hi>'s Letter to be ſo, and of the Dominican Order) ſwears, <hi>(p.</hi> 84, and 85.) That he met Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>May,</hi> 78. at Mr. <hi>Howards,</hi> at <hi>Arundel-</hi>Houſe; and that <hi>this</hi> was the ſame man he ſaw there. So that they are not all Proteſtants that he brings to annul their Evidence, but one of their own Religion too, that durſt ſpeak truth. And now <hi>let all the world iudge,</hi> whether the Jury had any reaſon to think Doctor <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence was any way weakened by all that thoſe <hi>Novices</hi> had averr'd, knowing that though they might have Diſpenſations for telling of Lies, to ſerve a turn, yet the Proteſtant Religion doth in no caſe allow it, much leſs of Swearing falſely. And that theſe young men ſpoke onely as they were directed, is more than probable, from the nature of the thing, their own circumſtances, and the manner of their Behaviour. And it is credibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that as for <hi>one of them,</hi> Palmer <hi>by name, (p.</hi> 51.) who ſays poſitively that he ſaw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> at St. <hi>Omers</hi> the firſt of <hi>May</hi> New Stile, and the ſecond, and the fifth, and the eleventh days, and gives particular circumſtances for each; yet 'tis ſince ſaid to be diſcover'd, and offer'd to be ſworn by two worthy Gentlemen, that the ſaid <hi>Palmer</hi> was at the ſame time at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens company, the ſaid firſt week in <hi>May,</hi> when he tells all theſe, <hi>ſtories</hi> as of his own knowledge at St. <hi>Omers.</hi> And by this we may judge what regard to give to their Witneſſes, to prove that
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52053:143"/>
Sir. <hi>John Warner</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Preſton</hi> did not come over with Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> or that Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> was in <hi>April, June,</hi> and <hi>July;</hi> for indeed theſe laſt ſpeak ſo <hi>timerouſly,</hi> and give ſuch weak reaſons, that though what they ſay ſhould be true, yet Mr. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> might ſtep up to <hi>London</hi> and ſign this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult in few days, without their knowledge.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, p. 69. <hi>Whitebread</hi> inſiſted, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had <hi>ſworn falſely</hi> that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was in <hi>London</hi> the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and beginning of <hi>September,</hi> whereas he could prove the contrary. But it had been better for his <hi>Party</hi> if he had let it alone for though he did produce ſome. Popiſh witneſſes to ſay ſomething to that purpoſe, yet the ſame was not only diſproved then by the Oaths of Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Pain,</hi> formerly <hi>Groves</hi>'s Servanr, but alſo occaſioned the happy Diſcovery after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by Mr. <hi>Robert Jeniſon,</hi> of which we ſhall give an account in another Chapter.</p>
            <p>This was the <hi>whole effect</hi> of their Defence, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome vain flouriſhes of <hi>Gavan</hi>'s Rhetorick, his offering to maintain his Innocence by the old obſolete Tryal of <hi>Ordeal,</hi> (or walking bare-foot on Red-hot Plow-ſhares, p. 68.) and his ſtarting a point of Law, p. 87. That Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears to a <hi>Treaſon</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to one in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> therefore there were not two Witneſſes to one Fact: which the Court over-ruled, ſhewing that the Treaſon in both places was the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> killing the King, raiſing an Army, ſubverting the Government, and bringing in of Popery, though the <hi>Overt</hi> acts demonſtrating the ſame be ſeveral, or in different Counties.</p>

Then the Lord Chief-Juſtice ſumm'd up the Evidence, and took particular notice of the proof made that <hi>Harcourt</hi> was privy to the <hi>Murder</hi> of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey;</hi> which he declared he could never be more or better ſatisfied in, than by what he heard that day; and thereupon ſpeaking to the Priſoners, he ſaid, <note place="margin">P. 93.</note>  
               <q>—This will ſtick I aſſure you, Sirs! upon all your Party—We have therein a Teſtimony, that for promoting your Cauſe, you would not ſtick at the Proteſtants blood; you began with Sir <hi>Edmundbury,</hi> but who knows where you would have made an end? It was this one man you killed in his perſon, but in Effigie the whole Nation. It was in one mans Blood your hands were embrewed, but your Souls were dipt in the Blood of us all; this was an hanſel one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of what was to follow; And ſo long as we are convine'd you killed him, we cannot but believe you would alſo kill the King; we cannot but believe you would make all of us away, that ſtand in the way of your Religion; a Religion, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what it is you would bring in upon us, by a Converſion of us with Blood, and by a Baptiſm with Fire; God keep our Land from the one, and our City from the other.</q>

            <p>The Jury after about a quarter of an hours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration returned into Court, and brought in all the Five Priſoners Guilty of High-Treaſon; who the next day with Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> received Sentence, and on the twentieth of <hi>June</hi> following, were drawn to <hi>Tyburn, Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Harcourt</hi> in one Sled, <hi>Gavan</hi> and <hi>Turner</hi> in another, and <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> by himſelf in a third.

made every one a particular Speech, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be not onely <hi>premeditated,</hi> but the ſubſtance and matter thereof to have been <hi>preſcribed,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>agreed on</hi> before amongſt them; the big pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of Innocence and expreſſions being ſo near alike.

                     <hi>IN Anſwer to your requeſt in two Letters of yours to your Brother, theſe are to aſſure you, that the Gentleman you mentioned,</hi> viz. White, alias White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread <hi>(more than twenty years ago) came to</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, <hi>under pretence of a Jew converted by ſome eminent Divine of the</hi> Presbyterian <hi>way in</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. <hi>But in</hi> Oxford <hi>he pretended a farther light, by joyning with, and hearing at the ſeveral Churches and Sermons of Doctor</hi> Thomas Goodwin, <hi>Doctor</hi> Owen, <hi>and ſome others of the Independent or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational way. But not ſtedfaſt there long, (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Apoſtles rule to try all things) he fell to the Anabaptiſts, and then to the Quakers; amongſt whom he challenges Doctor</hi> Owen, <hi>and ſeveral others for their Principles, in a Letter written in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Languages, ſo learnedly, that it was thought
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:52053:145"/>
worthy of conſideration of the Learned Convocation there; by whom he was cenſured as a Jeſuite, or ſome other Popiſh Seminariſt, and thereupon Impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Caſtle-Priſon there, where he pretended a Diſtraction, and perſonated the Mad-man ſo exactly, that in few days ſome friends of his procured his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. I ſaw him ſeveral times running up and down the ſtreets, with his Hat under his arm full of ſtones, throwing at every ſmall Bird he ſaw. But e're long I met him at a Papiſt-houſe, where I heard him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe very gravely, learnedly, and diſcreetly; where I got not only acquaintance with him, but familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, inſomuch, that ſeveral times in change of Habit he came to viſit me, and ſeveral other young Scholars in</hi> Magdalen <hi>Colledge. But at length being again ſuſpected, and like to be apprehended, he got private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away for</hi> London. <hi>I brought him five miles of his way, and ſo left him to his deſigns.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In ſix Months after, buſineſs called me to</hi> London, <hi>where after a day or two I heard a Report of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preacher amongſt the Quakers near</hi> Charing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs, <hi>and the ſame day met the ſame Gentleman (then ſo much famed) going to</hi> ſpeak, <hi>in an old-faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pinked Fuſtian Jerkin, and clouted ſhooes, and Breeches faced with Leather, and a Carters Whip in his hand, altogether diſguiſed from my knowledge of him; but he knew me, and ſpake with me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed our acquaintance. At preſent he went about his intended work, and the next day came to my Quarters, in the neat Habit of a</hi> London-<hi>Miniſter, and carried me to his Lodgings within the Precincts of the</hi> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-Temple, <hi>where I had a good entertainment, and a view of ſeveral ſtrange Habits, in which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed himſelf to the ſeveral ſorts of people he inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:52053:146"/>
himſelf into. I ſaw alſo his Orders from the</hi> Roman <hi>Court, and an Inſtrument wherein he was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, and ordered to receive of certain Merchants an Hundred pounds</hi> per Annum, <hi>beſides an yearly Penſion of Eighty pound</hi> per Annum <hi>from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I am ſure he pretended he was born at</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg, <hi>his Fathers Name</hi> John White; <hi>and in his Writing, he himſelf was ſtiled</hi> Johannes de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, <hi>by the Court of</hi> Rome. <hi>He was both Jeſuit, and Prieſt in Orders. I went with him by water, and viſited ſome Ships; and in one Houſe in</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark <hi>he Celebrated the Maſs in the Popiſh Mode to more than forty. The ſame day we viſited ſeveral</hi> Presbyterians <hi>and others; and I continued in his company by the ſpace of a Month, when he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and by a ſpecial Order from the then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, Impriſoned in the</hi> Tower <hi>of</hi> London; <hi>where I endeavoured, but was not admitted to viſit him. Two years after I underſtood by a friend of mine and his, that he was freed from his durance within the ſpace of ſix Months. And within theſe four or five years (as far as my friend and I could judge) tampering much with Independents in and about</hi> London, <hi>was ſeen ſeveral times by a friend of mine at Doctor</hi> Mantons <hi>private Lectures, in or near the Lord</hi> Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons <hi>Houſe, ſtill known by the name of</hi> John White. <hi>He ſpake as good Engliſh as any Native, and knew all Cities, Towns, Villages, Hamlets, (in a manner) in all or moſt part of</hi> England.</p>

As for the Proofs againſt this Priſoner, they were as home and poſitive as againſt the reſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> declares how he came acquainted with him, by bringing him <note place="margin">See the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>P.</hi> 9.</note> Letters from his Sons from a Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>Spain;</hi> and then ſwears, That <hi>Langhorn</hi> did hold Correſpondence with <hi>Le Cheſe</hi> and others, and that the Witneſſes carried ſeveral Letters to perſons beyond the Seas; in one of which he ſaw under his own hand, words to this purpoſe, <hi>That now they had a fair opportunity to begin, or give the blow;</hi> with other expreſſions plain enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Plot: and theſe he ſaw ſigned <hi>Richard Langhorn,</hi> and that the Priſoner himſelf delivered them to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he had order from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial to give Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> an Account <note place="margin">P. 10.</note> of the Reſolve of the Jeſuits Conſult for Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King, and that he did acquaint him therewith; and that the ſaid <hi>Langhorn</hi> thereupon lift up his Hands and Eyes, and prayed to God to give it a good ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he ſaw at his Chamber cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Commiſſions, which they call Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; <note place="margin">P. 11.</note> and that on his deſire he permitted the Witneſs to peruſe ſeveral of them; and that there as one Commiſſion to the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardour,</hi> and another to the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> for the one to be Lord Chancellour; and the other Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England;</hi> and one to Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> himſelf, to be Advocate of the Army; and that they were ſigned <hi>Johannes Paulus d'Oliva,</hi> by Vertue of a Brief from the Pope: and Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> alſo told him, that he had ſent one of theſe
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52053:148"/>
Commiſſions by his Son, to be delivered to the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardours</hi> Son.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> being employed as Solicitor for ſeveral of the Fathers of <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> the Society, did prevail with the Benedictine Monks to raiſe ſix thouſand pounds for carrying on the Cauſe; and did ſay in the hearing of the witneſs, That he would do his utmoſt for procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſaid Money.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> was diſguſted that Sir <hi>G. Wakeman</hi> was not content with ten thouſand pound to poiſon the King, and call'd him <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-ſpirited, narrow-ſoul'd Phyſician:</hi> for being a publick concern, and to carry on the Cauſe, it was no matter if he did it for nothing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. An Inſtrument was produced in Court, ſigned by <hi>Paulus d'Oliva,</hi> found in Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> Chamber, long after Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had given in his Teſtimony. Now Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned Commiſſions were ſigned by the ſame hand, and had the ſame mark; but they were all conveyed away; and this being onely concerning an Eccleſiaſtick buſineſs, wherein they thought there was no danger, was left. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this much confirmed Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence, by ſhewing that Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> did uſe to receive Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents from, and had Commerce with the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Jeſuits at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place comes Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and he ſwears that he went with Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 19.</note> to Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> Chamber, and there Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> gave him his Letters to <hi>le Cheſe,</hi> and the Popes Nuncio and others, open, to read and Regiſter in

a Book by him kept for that purpoſe; and that he ſaw him read theſe Letters, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe deſigns in hand; and that he Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred them in a Book in his Cloſet, whilſt he and Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> walkt in the outer room; and that afterwards <hi>Coleman</hi> ſealed up theſe Letters, and delivered them to the Witneſs, who carried them to <hi>le Cheſe;</hi> and that ſome of the expreſſions in thoſe Letters were, That all things were now in readineſs, and they onely wanted Money: That the Catholicks were now in ſafety; that Places and Offices had been diſpoſed to them, and that all the Garriſons either were, or ſuddenly would be in their hands; and that now they had a fair opportunity, having <hi>a King ſo eaſie to believe what was dictated to him by their Party;</hi> and that if they miſſed this advantage, they might deſpair of ever introducing Popery into <hi>England.</hi> Theſe were the very Expreſſions of ſome of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he brought other Letters from <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> to <hi>Langhorn</hi> to be Regiſtred, and <hi>Langhorn</hi> writ back, that he had received and would Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter them; of which Letters one was from the Rector of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Colledge at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> which ſpecified, That the Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> and the reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, ſhould be in readineſs, for that they had ſent ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> caſhier'd Souldiers, with many other Lay-Brothers, under the notion of Pilgrims for St. <hi>Jago,</hi> who were to take ſhipping at the <hi>Groin,</hi> and to land at <hi>Milford-</hi>Haven in <hi>Wales,</hi> and there to meet and joyn with the Lord <hi>Powis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The onely defence Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> could maket was like that of the reſt of his Party, by ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyals,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52053:149"/>
and endeavouring to invalidate the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Witneſſes, by intrapping or confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in point of time or place.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He would make Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> an <hi>Approver,</hi> as having been pardoned for the <note place="margin">P. 27.</note> ſame Crime; and alleadged, that the Witneſſes had received <hi>Rewards</hi> and gratifications for ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt them. But to this the Court anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That it could not be ſuppoſed the King would Bribe his Witneſſes; and unleſs he could prove any reward to be given by Contract, or <hi>ſubornation,</hi> it was no Objection, for that allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuſtenance was uſually given of old to Approvers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He muſtered up again their <hi>baffled</hi> Evidence from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> of whom one <note place="margin">P. 33.</note> being askt how he came to take notice of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> being at St. <hi>Omers</hi> all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> and not in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> as well, plainly anſwered, (being not well inſtructed, or more ſimple than the reſt)—It was—<hi>Becauſe the Queſtion he came for did not fall upon that time:</hi> Which gives more light to the ſuſpicion that they came with their Leſſons in their Mouths, to ſave theſe mens lives, and their Churches ſinking Credit; not to ſpeak truth, but only right or wrong confront the Kings Evidence: but in vain, for Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſufficiently aſſerted his Teſtimony by ſeven Witneſſes, who now again proved, as they had done the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, his being in <hi>London</hi> at the time controverted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> produced the Woman at the <hi>White-horſe</hi> Tavern, where <note place="margin">P. 46.</note> Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had ſaid the Conſult was held; and ſhe boldly averred, that there was never a room in
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52053:149"/>
her Houſe would hold above a dozen people, and therefore there could not meet 50, or 18 or 20 perſons at a time. This was an Objection Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> could not fore-ſee, not thinking any body would have had the confidence to alleadge it, and ſo was not provided with any Witneſſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it: but as Providence ordered it, no leſs than three ſeveral ſtrangers ſtood up in Court, that knew the Houſe well, and being ſworn, Atteſted, The firſt, that he had known ſixteen to dine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in one Room of that Houſe; the ſecond, that he knew two Rooms, one backwards and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forward, where Thirty might Dine at a time; and the third, that at a Wedding he knew of above Twenty that Dined together in one Room next the ſtreet. Nay farther, there was a Gentleman of good Quality in Court, who declared there have been fifty in a Room there; ſo that this Evidence, by ſuch a peremptory falſhood, did but add to the ſuſpicion already too apparent on the reſt of his Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>The matter being thus plain, the Jury did not find any difficulty that might require a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Conſultation, and therefore returning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort retirement, into Court, pronounced the priſoner Guilty; and then <hi>Whitebread,</hi> and the other Four Convicted the day before, being brought to him to the Bar, Mr. Recorder pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to paſs Sentence of Death upon them all Six.

               <p>The Occaſion and manner of Mr. <hi>Robert Jenniſon</hi>'s firſt Diſcovery; and the Apprehenſion of one <hi>Caryl,</hi> alias <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> and his Letter beyond the Seas concerning the Execution of <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE have before related how Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that he was in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> when Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and one <hi>Sarah Pain</hi> atteſt upon their Oaths that they ſaw him in <hi>London.</hi> And this he not onely alleadged at his Tryal, and brought Witneſſes to prove it, but made <hi>ſolemn Aſſeverations at his death.</hi> That he never was in <hi>London</hi> from the 5th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the 14th of <hi>September.</hi> And knowing that ſuch a failure in circumſtance of time and place, if they could get it believ'd, would much depretiate the Evidence, they not content with what had paſs'd, <hi>revive</hi> it again at <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s Tryal, as you have heard, offering freſh people to confirm it: And though the contrary was ſufficiently atteſted by three Witneſſes on Oath, enough to convince an impartial Jury, or any body elſe that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the nature of a Papiſts Religion, and how far he may lawfully, nay is bound to <hi>ſtretch</hi> his private Conſcience, when it may be for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Emolument of their Church; yet it pleaſed
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52053:151"/>
               <hi>Providence,</hi> as well for the Vindication and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Illuſtration of <hi>Truth,</hi> as to ſhame theſe falſe Diſſemblers, and expoſe their fallacious dealings, ſoon after to make a further <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> and detect their Lyes in this behalf, by one that had been no ſmall Zealot of their Party.</p>
            <p>For preſently after that Tryal, <hi>Charles Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> upon ſome diſcourſe concerning the ſame, was accidentally inform'd, That one Mr. <hi>Robert Jenniſon</hi> of <hi>Grays-Inne,</hi> a perſon of good Quality, and formerly a ſtrict <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, That he was with the ſaid <hi>Ireland</hi> about the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Covent-garden:</hi> whereupon Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> reſolv'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire further after it, being thereunto encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> to whom he had communicated what he had heard. Then <hi>tracing</hi> the buſineſs, he went to <hi>Robert Bowes</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who own'd, that Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> had ſignified ſo much to him formerly in a Letter from <hi>Reading,</hi> dated the 19th of <hi>December.</hi> Hereupon ſeveral of theſe Gentlemen repaired to Mr. <hi>Jenniſon,</hi> who after ſome unwilling Evaſions, ingenuouſly owned the ſame, and teſtified it upon Oath before <hi>Edmund Warcup</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Middleſex, viz.</hi> That coming up from <hi>Windſor</hi> on the 19th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he went to viſit the ſaid <hi>William Ireland</hi> (with whom for ſome time he had been well acquainted, as being <hi>Related</hi> unto him) and found him at his Lodging in <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet,</hi> who told him he was then newly arrived by Poſt from <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire;</hi> and in diſcourſe enquired how his Majeſty and the Court were diverted: To which
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52053:151"/>
Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> replied, That he heard his Majeſty took much <hi>delight in Hawking and Fiſhing,</hi> but chiefly in the latter; which his Majeſty follow'd early in the mornings, accompanied onely with two or three Lords: Whereupon <hi>Ireland</hi> replied, <hi>He wondred his Majeſty ſhould be ſo thin guarded; he were eaſily taken off or removed;</hi> or words to that effect. At which Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> ſaying <hi>God forbid, Ireland</hi> began to qualifie it, ſaying, <hi>I do not ſay it is lawful;</hi> and ſome ſuch Expreſſions, which made him take little notice of it at that time; but afterwards hearing of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and that the King was to have been <hi>kill'd</hi> at <hi>Windſor,</hi> he began to reflect upon the former words more ſeriouſly, and related them to his Father, and one Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> his Fathers Confeſſor, being then at <hi>Wallworth</hi> his Fathers Manſion-houſe, in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Durham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, and ſome other Depoſitions confirming the ſame, with the true Copy of the ſaid Letter, have ſince been publiſhed in print, and Mr. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon</hi> publickly atteſted the ſame at <hi>Wakeman</hi>'s Tryal; the horror and deteſtation of this helliſh Plot carried on by the Romaniſts, having induced him to quit their communion.</p>
            <p>Three days after the Execution of <hi>Whitebread</hi> and the other four Jeſuits, <hi>viz. 23 June,</hi> was Apprehended by <hi>Captain Rich,</hi> one of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Juſtices of Peace for <hi>Surry,</hi> one <hi>Caryl, alias Blunden,</hi> ſuppoſed to be a Popiſh Prieſt, at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth-Marſh,</hi> at the Houſe of one Mr. <hi>Woodinbrook</hi> formerly an Haberdaſher of Small Wares in the Burrough of <hi>Southwark;</hi> in whoſe Chamber was found the <hi>following Letter,</hi> prepared to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

                     <hi>ON the Thirteenth of</hi> June, <hi>being Friday, Mr.</hi> White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, <hi>Mr.</hi> Harcourt, <hi>Mr.</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Fenwick <hi>and</hi> Gaven <hi>of the Society, and Mr.</hi> Corker, <hi>were brought to the Bar in the</hi> Old-Baily: <hi>Mr.</hi> Corker <hi>moved the Court for a longer time, being onely warned the night before, whereas the other Priſoners had eight days warning to prepare themſelves; whereupon he was re-manded to priſon till the next day: Then was the Indictment read againſt the Five above-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Jeſuits, for conſpiring the Kings Death, ſubverſion of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and, Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>ſwore, that on the Twenty fourth of</hi> April, <hi>there was a Conſult held in</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52053:152"/>
                     <hi>where the Kings Death was Conſpired; and that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried this Reſolve from one to the other, for their ſubſcribing; and ſwore particular Circumſtances againſt each. To Corroborate this Teſtimony, other Witneſſes,</hi> Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe, Prance, Dugdale, <hi>and</hi> Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, <hi>came in with</hi> 
                     <note n="1" place="margin">A pretty way of expreſſing plain poſitive Evidence of ſeveral Overt Acts of Treaſon.</note> 
                     <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the matter ſworn by</hi> Oates. <hi>Then did the Priſoners (after a moſt ſolemn and</hi> 
                     <note n="2" place="margin">It might be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, but could not be counted Religious by any but you, whoſe Religion conſiſts in Lies and Blaſphemous Hypocriſie.</note> 
                     <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Proteſtation of their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and ignorance of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt His Majeſty) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that their Witneſſes might be heard, which could demonſtrate that Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>was actually at St.</hi> Omers <hi>in all</hi> April <hi>and</hi> May, <hi>and moſt of</hi> June, <hi>when he ſwears he was in</hi> London <hi>at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. To prove this, about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Witneſſes were produced, who did ſhew evidently, by ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſages, how</hi> Oates <hi>was at St.</hi> Omers <hi>all the whole time. But the Judge</hi> Scroggs <hi>asked each Witneſs as he did appear, of what Religion he was of; and upon anſwer that he was a Catholick, the whole Court gave a ſhout of laughter. Then the Judge would ſay to them,</hi> 
                     <note n="3" place="margin">All abſolutely falſe, though it might have been the moſt proper way of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining ſuch bold young Villains; for 'twas apparent they did not ſpeak their knowledge, but their Maſters dictates.</note> 
                     <hi>Well, what have you
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52053:153"/>
then been taught to ſay? and by many ſcoffing Queſtions (which moved the Court to frequent laughter) he did endeavour to take off the Credibility of their Witneſſes. Then the Butler, Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and Gardiner of St.</hi> Omers <hi>offered to ſwear that they ſaw Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>all that time at St.</hi> Omers, <hi>when he ſwore he was in</hi> London. <hi>After this, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners at the Bar produced Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Witneſſes more, that proved</hi> Oates <note n="4" place="margin">Another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Lie; and ſure the Jeſuits themſelves and the <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> Vouchers, if they have any ſhame left, will now bluſh at the ſtory.</note> 
                     <hi>forſworn in Mr.</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands <hi>Tryal, becauſe he was in</hi> Shropſhire, <hi>when he atteſted he was in</hi> London. <hi>Then did</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>one of the Priſoners, with a great deal of clearneſs and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and with a cheerful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, draw up their juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhewing the force of their Evidences, and how fully their Witneſſes had proved Mr.</hi> Oates <note n="5" place="margin">Not the leaſt pretence for this old baffled Scandal.</note> 
                     <hi>perjured: then he did lay open the improbabilities of ſuch a Plot, and how unlikely that Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>ſhould be entruſted in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering Commiſſions to Perſons of Honour and Eſtates, whom he never (as he acknowledges) had ſeen before or ſince. This was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by</hi> Mr. Gaven, <note n="6" place="margin">O brave Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor! ſure this Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of ſuch brave ſervice don the Church, will haſten <hi>Gavens</hi> Canonization, at leaſt one ſcore or two of years.</note> 
                     <hi>with a Countenance wholly unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52053:153"/>
and in a voice very audible, and largely and pertinently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. The Judge was incenſed at this Speech, in which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten interrupted him: but</hi> Gaven <hi>ſtill urged, My Lord,</hi> I plead now for my Life, and for that which is dearer to me than life, <note n="7" place="margin">Ay, and Soul to boot.</note> the honour of my Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>and therefore I beſeech you have a little patience with me! After this Plea of Mr.</hi> Gaven'<hi>s, the Judge made his Harangue to the Jury, telling them, that what the Priſoners had brought, was onely the bare aſſertions of Boys, who were taught it as a point of their Religion, to lye for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Religion; whereas Mr.</hi> Oates, Bedloe, <hi>and others, were upon their Oaths; and if Oaths were not to be taken, no Courts could ſubſiſt.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Then Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>brought forth four</hi>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:52053:155"/>
my Lord</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>was with</hi> Turner <hi>and</hi> Gaven, <hi>promiſing them the Kings Pardon, if they would acknowledge the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. Mr.</hi> Gaven <hi>anſwered, He would not murther his Soul, to ſave his Body; for he muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what he knew not, and what he did believe was not. On Friday the</hi> 20th <hi>of</hi> June, <hi>Mr.</hi> Whitebread <hi>on one Sled with Mr.</hi> Harcourt, <hi>Mr.</hi> Turner <hi>and Mr.</hi> Gaven <hi>upon another Sled, and Mr.</hi> Fenwick <hi>in a Sled by himſelf, were drawn from</hi> Newgate <hi>to</hi> Tyburn. <hi>Mr.</hi> Langhorne <hi>is for a time reprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and promiſed Pardon, if he will (as 'tis reported) diſcover the Eſtates of the Jeſuits: he was their Lawyer. 'Tis certain my Lord</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>has been often with him. In the way they comported themſelves ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and chearfully; Mr.</hi> Gaven <hi>had ſmug'd himſelf up as if he had been going to a Wedding. When they arrived at</hi> Tyburn, <hi>they each made a Speech: 1. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering their ignorance of any Plot againſt his Majeſty. 2. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning their Accuſers. 3. And heartily praying for them. Mr.</hi> Gaven <hi>in his Speech made an

                     <note n="16" place="margin">Perhaps that whisking Lye, That never any Jeſuites have allow'd of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killing.</note>

            <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jenniſon,</hi> were examined to prove the <hi>Plot in general,</hi> which they did in ſuch variety of inſtances and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as ſatisfied all <hi>unbiaſſed men:</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Mr. <hi>Jeniſnn,</hi> Depoſed, That diſcourſing with Father <hi>Ireland</hi> (lately Executed) at his Chamber in <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet</hi> in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> 1678. the ſaid <hi>Ireland</hi> did ſay, There was <hi>onely one in the way</hi> that ſtopped the gap, and hindred the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion from flouriſhing in <hi>England</hi> again; and then ſaid—It was an eaſile matter to <hi>Poiſon the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Wakeman</hi> in particular, Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> 78. ſending a Letter to <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Aſhby</hi> the Jeſuite, of Inſtructions how he ſhould order himſelf before he went to, and at the <hi>Bath,</hi> whither he was going, did afterwards in the ſame Letter write, <hi>That the Queen would aſſiſt him to poiſon the King.</hi> And knows it to be his hand by this means, becauſe within a day or two after, Sir <hi>George</hi> being at <hi>Aſhby</hi>'s Lodging, he
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:52053:158"/>
ſaw Sir <hi>George</hi> ſit in a writing poſture, and then lay by his pen, riſe up; and going away, left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him a written Paper, purporting to be an Apothecaries Bill, the Ink whereof was not dry; and no body by but a Gentleman that was lame of both hands, and ſo could not write it: and the hand or Character of this paper ſo left then by <hi>Sir George,</hi> was the ſame with that of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned Letter to <hi>Aſhby,</hi> wherein were the <hi>Treaſonable</hi> words aforeſaid.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">

5. That he hath heard that afterwards 5000 <hi>l.</hi> more was offered and accepted; and ſwears po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, that himſelf hath ſeen in the Jeſuits Entry-book, an Entry thereof in theſe <hi>words;</hi> or to this purpoſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Memorand. Such a day of</hi> Auguſt, 15000 <hi>l. was propoſed to Sir</hi> George Wakeman, <hi>which he accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And this was <hi>Harcourts</hi> hand. And that then under it was a Receipt to this effect: <hi>Received</hi> 5000 <hi>l. in part of this 15000 l. of Father</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, <hi>by order of</hi> Edw. Coleman.</p>

               <hi>George Wakeman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which laſt words were the ſame hand and Character with that Letter <note place="margin">P. 29.</note> to <hi>Aſhby,</hi> and Bill to the Apothecary, which the Witneſs had ſeen before.</p>
            <p>Then, as to him, Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſwears,</p>
            <p>That about the beginning of <hi>Aug.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 46.</note> 78. being at <hi>Harcourts</hi> Chamber, Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> came in diſcontented, and askt why he was <hi>drilled on in a concern of that importance, and ſighted;</hi> and ſaid he knew not whether he ſhould <hi>go on or no:</hi> but <hi>Harcourt</hi> ask'd him what he would have, they were <hi>ready for him;</hi> and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tcht a Bill and gave him, which he ſaid he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that day by the Queens Order; and that it was on ſuch a <hi>Goldſmith</hi> for 2000 <hi>l.</hi> and then ſaid, Sir <hi>George,—'Tis well ſome body gives me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; I have more encouragement from my good Lady and Miſtreſs, than from any of you:</hi> Nay, replyed <hi>Harcourt</hi> to Sir <hi>George,</hi> for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that you ſhall not want, for the <hi>reſt</hi> ſhall be paid in due time; but, Sir <hi>George,</hi> continued
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52053:159"/>
he, this muſt be well followed, and cloſely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe ſo much depends upon it: For <hi>if we ſhould miſs to kill him at</hi> Windſor, <hi>or you miſs in your way, we will do it at</hi> New-market.—Which words Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> twice repeated; and thereupon, Sir <hi>George</hi> ſaid privately to his fellow-Priſoners, <hi>There is my buſineſs done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſum of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s defence was thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to Doctor <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence concerning the Letter to <hi>Aſhby,</hi> he brought an Apothecary that produced a piece of a Letter of directions to <hi>Aſhby,</hi> ſent from Sir <hi>George,</hi> and ſaid he had <hi>read</hi> it all, and that there was no mention in it of King or Queen.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe this were true, and not coyn'd to ſerve a turn, Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore this was none of that Letter he ſpoke of, for it was neither the ſame hand, nor the name ſubſcribed, nor the ſame Contents with the other, nor writ at or about the ſame time, for that was writ to <hi>Aſhby</hi> ten days before he went out of Town; &amp; Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſaw it before he went, and ſwears poſitively <hi>(p.</hi> 26.) that he ſaw <hi>Wakeman</hi> with <hi>Aſhby</hi> two or three days after that; whereas this Letter the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary ſpeaks of, was, as Sir <hi>George</hi> ſays, writ by his man late in the night, &amp; <hi>Aſhby</hi> went away next morning. And whereas <hi>Wakeman (p.</hi> 51.) deſires the Jury to take notice, how improbable it was he ſhould write <hi>two</hi> Letters about the ſame thing; it is falſe that it was about the <hi>ſame thing:</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Treaſon which poſſibly might be the main buſineſs, as to the Phyſical directions that Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> mentions, was, how he ſhould <hi>drink
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52053:159"/>
Milk</hi> in Town, and onely general inſtructions by the by touching the <hi>Bath:</hi> but when he was juſt a going, then he might cauſe more particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to be writ by his man: Or, which is moſt probable, knowing what ſtuff he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termint with his former directions, unfit to be ſhewed to any Apothecary, he therefore was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged on that very ſcore, to repeat his directions of the number of ſtrokes at the Pump, what Pills he ſhould take, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that in all this, there is nothing worth the Juries <hi>taking notice of,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obſerve that it was nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sir <hi>George</hi>'s next Exception to Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Teſtimony, is, That before the Houſe of Lords he ſhould ſay, that he thought that before-mentioned Letter to be of <hi>Wakemans</hi> writing, <hi>onely</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſubſcribed <hi>George Wakeman.</hi> But this the Knight was not able to prove; and Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> gives another account of his words there to the beſt of his remembrance, and refers to the Record, So that this <hi>ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>il</hi> too ſignifies nothing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But then was ſtarted an Objection, which though very <hi>little</hi> in it ſelf, yet was made very <hi>much</hi> of by good management and that was; That Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> did not charge Sir <hi>George</hi> ſo fully before the King and Council, but rather denyed that he knew any thing againſt him, but what he had ſeen in <hi>other peoples Letters:</hi> And to this purpoſe Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> did ſay, <hi>(p.</hi> 55.) (but not upon Oath, being produced by the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) That Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> did their ſay, he had ſeen a Letter from <hi>Whitebread</hi> to <hi>Fenwick,</hi> that Sir <hi>George</hi> was to poiſon the King, and to have
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52053:160"/>
15000 <hi>l.</hi> for it, whereof 5000 <hi>l.</hi> had been paid by <hi>Coleman:</hi> and Sir <hi>Philip</hi> farther added, That Sir <hi>George</hi> did then <hi>carry himſelf, as if he were not concerned at the Accuſation;</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> being called in again, and askt whether he knew any more againſt him, did lift up his hands, and ſaid, <hi>No, God forbid that I ſhould ſay any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sir</hi> George Wakeman, <hi>for I know nothing more againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> did now upon his Oath deny that he to his remembrance ſpake any ſuch words, but believed Sir <hi>Philip</hi> was miſtaken.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he was then ſo weak and weary, with watching and hurrying up and down, that he was not in a condition to make Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Doleman</hi> upon Oath ſaith of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s behaviour then before the <note place="margin">P. 59.</note> Council, that in his opinion, and in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others, he did not deny the Crime ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>as one that was Innocent</hi> would have done; which is ſomewhat contrary to Sir <hi>Philips</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſame Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> confirms Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Apology, and ſwears, he ſeem'd at that time to be in ſuch great <hi>weakneſs and diſorder,</hi> that he believes he was ſcarce able to give a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> through <hi>weakneſs,</hi> forgetfulneſs, or ſome other <hi>good reaſon,</hi> did not at that time charge Sir <hi>George</hi> ſo <hi>home,</hi> it being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough then to give a <hi>general Charge,</hi> does it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that he was now tyed up in his Evidence,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:52053:160"/>
and may not afterwards charge him farther? Was not <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwicks</hi> Jury with-drawn one time, becauſe one of the Witneſſes did not ſwear home, and yet afterwards that Witneſs admitted to <hi>enlarge,</hi> and thereupon the Priſoners Convicted and Executed? Beſides, in Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Depoſitions at that time exhibited to the King in writing, Article the 37. it is more than probably intimated, that Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> could Charge Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> further, but pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, for ſome reaſons, perhaps that he might not all at once ſtir too <hi>many and mighty Enemies,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to do it.—For ſpeaking there of the 15000 <hi>l.</hi> propoſed to Sir <hi>George,</hi> he adds,—<hi>But whether Sir</hi> George <hi>hath been treated with about that concern, the Deponent cannot inform here in this Article.</hi>—And ſo much touching his Evidence againſt <hi>Wakeman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt Mr. <hi>Bedloes</hi> Teſtimony, Sir <hi>George</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected onely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it was not likely he ſhould let <note place="margin">P. 40.</note> him be privy to ſo ſo great a ſecret, being but a ſtranger.</p>
            <p>To which Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> anſwers, That <hi>Harcourt</hi> had told Sir <hi>George</hi> who he was, and that after he knew he was his <hi>Confident,</hi> and engaged in their grand deſign, he might well be free before him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſolemnly ſwears, he never ſaw Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> before in his life. <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But this Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> does alſo <hi>confute,</hi> making it out by Circumſtances, that he had taken <hi>Phyſick</hi> of him at the <hi>Bath</hi> three years ago; and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance <hi>Wakeman</hi> could not deny, onely calls
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:52053:161"/>
him Rogue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus, as to any thing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, ſtood Sir <hi>George Wakemans</hi> Caſe.</p>
            <p>Then as for <hi>Corker</hi> and <hi>Marſhal,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears poſitively, that they <note place="margin">P. 31.</note> 
               <hi>both knew of the deſign of killing the King,</hi> for that they did both of them in his hearing expreſs their diſlike (not of the Treaſon, but) of one of the perſons choſen to do it, ſaying that <hi>Pickering</hi> was no fit perſon for that ſervice, becauſe being commonly attendant on the <hi>Altar,</hi> he might thereby miſs of an opportunity; and therefore they declared their opinion, that a meer Lay-man would be more proper. He farther ſaith, <hi>(p.</hi> 35.) That <hi>Marſhal</hi> went half with <hi>Conyers,</hi> who laid a <hi>wager.</hi> That the King ſhould eat no more <hi>Chriſtmas-pies;</hi> and that both of them were privy and conſenting to the Conſult of the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines,</hi> for raiſing 6000 <hi>l.</hi> for carrying on the deſign, <hi>Marſhal</hi> being actually preſent at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, at the Benedictine Convent in the <hi>Sauoy;</hi> either the day before or after the Feaſt of the Aſſumption, which is the fifteenth of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and <hi>Corker,</hi> though he were not there, but gone as he ſaid to <hi>Lamſpring</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> yet he ſent a Letter dated the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to ſignifie his conſent; which was neceſſary, becauſe he was their Preſident; and this Letter Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> by compariſon of hands, prov'd to be his Writing; and farther, that he had a Patent from the See of <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>Biſhop of London,</hi> which Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> ſaw in his hands, and was told by him, <hi>(p.</hi> 34.) That he hoped it would not be long ere he exerciſed his Epiſcopal Function. And
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:52053:161"/>
laſtly, That <hi>Marſhal</hi> was preſent at another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, 21 of <hi>Aug.</hi> where he agreed to the ſending of Commiſſions into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to raiſe Forces there, and to the poyſoning of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> as to theſe two, ſwears, <note place="margin">P. 38.</note> That though he never heard any thing from <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> that did poſitively relate to the <hi>Murder</hi> of the King, yet he hath heard him talk much of the <hi>Deſign,</hi> and carrying it on, <hi>about raiſing an Army,</hi> what Intereſt he had in the people, what Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they had received from beyond the ſeas, and how forward they were in their proceedings here. And as to <hi>Marſhal,</hi> that he uſed to carry Letters to and fro concerning the Plot, amongſt the Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and that he knew what was the effect of ſuch Letters, and the Anſwers, being one of the <hi>Club</hi> and Conſult that ſaw all; and particularly, that whereas Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> carried a Letter from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monks to <hi>le Cheſe</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein they acquainted him that all things were in readineſs within a year or two, to put the deſign in practice, and ſubvert the oppreſſion and Tyranny which the Catholicks were under in <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> when he brought back an Anſwer thereunto, Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> carried a Copy of it to Sir <hi>Francis Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As for the Defence made by theſe two, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal,</hi> with a long ſtarcht Oration, would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to perſwade the people there was <hi>no Plot,</hi> and that <hi>Whitebread</hi> and the reſt dyed Innocent, and all becauſe they did not <hi>confeſs</hi> it at their death.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:52053:162"/>
2. <hi>Corker</hi> denyed his being at <hi>Lamſpring;</hi> but that was nothing to the purpoſe, for Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore onely that he ſaid he would go thither, and that it was uſual with them to give out they go to one place, and go clear another way; and the Letter he mentioned was not dated from any place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He alleadged that he was not Preſident of the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> ſo that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was miſtaken therein, and conſequently his conſent not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Conſult for raiſing the 6000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove this, though <hi>p.</hi> 65. he ſaith he could bring no body, yet at laſt, a good while after, he called three women that all ſaid, that not he, but one Mr. <hi>Stapleton</hi> was Preſident of the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to this it is to be noted, That Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> being taken very ill, was gone out of the <hi>Court,</hi> and did not hear this Objection; and though he was <hi>called for</hi> by Mr. Recorder, yet when he came, by I know not whoſe <hi>negligence,</hi> he was not acquainted with it, nor Examined about it, who otherwiſe might probably have cleared the point. But however, 'tis not at all impoſſible, that the Priſoners might find three Women in this Town, kind enough to tell ſo ſmall a Lye for them; which, conſidering they were under ſuch Circumſtances, might by their <hi>Votaries</hi> be counted not onely venial, but exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meritorious.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They both urged, that when <hi>Pickering</hi> was taken at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> they were there in <hi>Bed,</hi> and yet Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> and his Company did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, but rather ſaid they had nothing to do with them; and to prove this, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:52053:162"/>
a woman that was the Monks Houſe-keeper, or Bed-maker, <hi>Nell Rigby,</hi> who you might be ſure would ſpeak a good word for her Maſters.</p>
            <p>But Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> at that time came purpoſely for <hi>Pickering;</hi> and 'tis poſſible in the <hi>night</hi> and hurry, and ſuch diſguiſes as they might have, might not know them; but indeed we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude he did not <hi>ſee them:</hi> for the Priſoners offer no proof of that, no, not <hi>Nelly Rigby</hi> her ſelf, who onely ſays ſhe <hi>nam'd</hi> them all to them when they askt who elſe was in the houſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This <hi>Nell Rigby</hi> ſtarts another Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and ſays, That in the Summer 78, ſhe ſaw him <hi>come a begging</hi> to Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> for Charity, and that <hi>Pickering</hi> bid her ſhut the door, and never <hi>let that man come in again.</hi> Whence <hi>Marſhal</hi> obſerves, how unlikely it was they ſhould ſuffer him to be in ſuch <hi>want,</hi> and uſe him in that manner, in the very heat of the Plot, when they moſt employed him, and when he could gain ſuch advantages by diſcovering them, if indeed there had been any ſuch Conſpiracy as he pretends.</p>
            <p>But as to this, we are not obliged to take all that <hi>Nell Rigby</hi> the Monks Bed-maker (to ſay no worſe) tells us for an <hi>Oracle,</hi> and prefer it to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive proof upon Oath: for undoubtedly this begging ſtory was a meer <hi>flam;</hi> for if true, why was it not offered before? why was it not ſet up at <hi>Pickerings</hi> Tryal? whom it as much concerned, or more than theſe; and who could never have been ſo careleſs, as to omit ſo material an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if he had known any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>Beſides, 'tis plain, Mrs. <hi>Nelly</hi> is a common Vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and ſays ſhe knows nor cares what, if ſhe
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:52053:163"/>
think it will make for her beloved Maſters; for ſhe poſitively avers; <hi>(p.</hi> 73.) That <hi>Mr.</hi> Bedloe <hi>was with Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>at the taking of</hi> Pickering, which was on <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> Eve, upon the very firſt publick notice of the Plot; whereas that muſt needs be a <hi>notorious Lie,</hi> for all the world knows that <hi>Bedloe</hi> was then wholly amongſt the Jeſuits, and did not come in till many weeks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And had this been <hi>well enough obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> this ſcandalous Objection would have left no impreſſions.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Marſhal</hi> made a great ſtir about <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s <hi>not knowing him,</hi> but was confuted, though not at all <hi>aſhamed</hi> in his Lies, by Sir <hi>Wil. Waller</hi> upon Oath, and afterwards with an impudence that none but a <hi>Monk</hi> could own, ſaid—That he would <hi>be content to be hanged, if Mr.</hi> Bedloe <hi>could prove, That he,</hi> (viz. Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> himſelf) <hi>was ever in the</hi> Savoy <hi>in his life.</hi> And though it hapned <hi>Bedloe</hi> had none ready by him to prove <hi>that,</hi> for who ſhould dream of ſuch a queſtion being askt? yet by a ſufficient circumſtance, he proved not onely that he had been in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> but alſo that he was well acquainted with their Convent and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs there, in that he gave Sir <hi>Will. Waller</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions where to ſearch in the moſt material places, deſcribing them; and in particular, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to look under ſuch a Bench in <note place="margin">P. 45.</note> 
               <hi>Irelands</hi> Apartment, where he ſhould find the Gun that was to kill the King; which was there found accordingly: all which was confirmed by the ſaid Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> now preſent in Court.</p>
            <p>Theſe were all their Objections that ſeem'd to have any colour of weight or argument in
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:52053:163"/>
them; the reſt of their tedious talk being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but either railing at the Witneſſes, certain flaſhes of Rhetorick, and ſome long ſet-ſpeeches, <hi>ad faciendum Populum,</hi> to amuſe the People; or elſe down-right Impertinence, as <hi>Marſhal</hi>'s tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling that he had Witneſſes here, to prove that he had Witneſſes in the Country but ſixty miles off, that could ſay ſomething for him, when he had had a months notice to get them ready for this time of tryal.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Rumley,</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> teſtified that he was privy to the Conſult of the Monks wherein the 6000 <hi>l.</hi> was agreed on, and he judg'd did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it: for he did pray God it might have good ſucceſs, and that the Catholick Cauſe might once again flouriſh in <hi>England.</hi> But he being but a ſingle Evidence, and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> not being able to ſpeak any thing material as to that Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he came off on courſe.</p>
            <p>Thus, after a tedious, full, and moſt favourable hearing of all that the Priſoners or their Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes had to offer, the Lord Chief Juſtice Sir <hi>William Scroggs</hi> came to ſum up the Evidence to the Jury; which he performed in a long Speech; <hi>(See the Tryal,</hi> p. 77. <hi>to which we refer the Reader)</hi> ſome material heads whereof, as his Lordſhip was then pleas'd to obſerve them, were as follows.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That as to <hi>Rumley,</hi> there was but <hi>one Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which not being ſufficient Evidence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law to condemn him, therefore they ought to acquit him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That as to Sir <hi>George Wakeman, Corker,</hi> and <hi>Marſhal,</hi> there had two ſorts of Evidence been
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52053:164"/>
given; General and Particular: the General, by Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jenniſon.</hi> 'Tis true, neither of them ſo much as name any of the Priſoners, but they prove the Plot, That there was a Conſpiracy to bring in Popery by killing the King. This his Lordſhip obſerv'd was a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial Evidence againſt the Priſoners, and might anſwer their Objection, when they ſaid the Jury were not to credit poſitive Oaths with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out probable Circumſtances, or ſomething elſe to guide them by. And eſpecially his Lordſhip noted to the Jury Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi>'s Teſtimony concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> and how clear it was made appear that the ſaid <hi>Ireland</hi> died with a Lye in his mouth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then as to the particular Evidence, firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Wakeman,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had ſworn he ſaw a Letter to <hi>Aſhby,</hi> ſubſcribed <hi>George Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> in which were the Treaſonable words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, but ſaith, he had never ſeen his hand before, but afterwards ſaw him writing, (as he thinks writing) and looking on that Paper when he was gone, while it was wet, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to the Witneſſes thinking was the ſame with the Letter. Now his Lordſhip obſerved, that ſuppoſing this to be true, 'tis ſomething hard for one having never been acquainted with a mans hand before, by ſeeing it afterwards thus to recollect backwards, and know that what he ſaw before was the ſame hand-writing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That in <hi>Harcourts</hi> Chamber he ſaw a Book kept by the Jeſuits, wherein was written, <hi>This day</hi> (ſpecifying a certain day) agreed with Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> for 15000 <hi>l.</hi> to which he
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:52053:164"/>
conſented; and under it a Receipt for 5000 <hi>l.</hi> part of 15000 <hi>l.</hi> by order of Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>George Wakeman;</hi> which Receipt Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> by compariſon of hands, believes to be the ſame hand which he had ſo ſeen twice before; and that he did not charge Sir <hi>George</hi> with any poſitive thing farther, to the beſt of his Lordſhips memory.</p>
            <p>Here Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer</hi> interpoſed, ſaying, <hi>Yes, my Lord, he ſays he ſaw his Commiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon his Lordſhip proceeded, That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he does ſay, he ſaw a Commiſſion in his hands to be Phyſician-General to the Popiſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that he denyed ten thouſand, and would have fifteen thouſand pounds; the truth his Lordſhip would leave with the Jury: and then expreſſing a juſt tenderneſs of ſhedding In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Blood, and that probabilities of things were truely to be weighed, proceeded to Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe's,</hi> Teſtimony, which having ſhortly repeated, he declared, that if the Jury believed what was ſworn by him, then there were two Witneſſes againſt <hi>Wakeman;</hi> but his Lordſhip would leave it with them, hoping his Brothers, if they remembred any thing farther, would obſerve it to them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to <hi>Corker,</hi> his Lordſhip obſerved, That <hi>Oates</hi> ſays he ſaw a Letter under his hand, (that is, his Name, as his Lordſhip ſuppoſes, was to it) wherein he conſented to raiſe 6000 <hi>l.</hi> for carrying on the Plot; but his Lordſhip does not find that he proves he knew <hi>Corkers</hi> hand. And whereas <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears <hi>Corker</hi> was Preſident of the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines,</hi> and therefore his conſent neceſſary, his Lordſhip takes notice, That <hi>Corker</hi> contradicts
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:52053:165"/>
him therein by two or three Witneſſes, that he was not Preſident, but one <hi>Stapleton.</hi> And for <hi>Oates</hi> ſaying that <hi>Corker</hi> excepted againſt <hi>Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> killing the King, and that they had better have choſen another; He did not prove that he was at the Conſultation, but onely that he knew of it, and proves no fact but theſe words: and for what <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſays, it is leſs than what <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That againſt <hi>Marſhal</hi> there was rather leſs than againſt <hi>Corker;</hi> That <hi>Oates</hi> onely ſays that he conſented to raiſe the 6000 <hi>l.</hi> and excepted (as <hi>Corker</hi> did) againſt <hi>Pickerings</hi> being employed to kill the King: and <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſays, That he knew he carried Letters concerning the Plot, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Conſults, where they were read and anſwered.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Then as to the Priſoners defence, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſumm'd it up particularly; as, why <hi>Oates</hi> did not take them before? why he did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe <hi>Wakeman</hi> further at the Councel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> adding, That if it were poſſible, they had almoſt undone themſelves in their Defences, by inſiſting upon trivial things: but his Lordſhip declared he would diſcharge his Conſcience to the Jury, telling them plainly, That it lay upon the Oaths of thoſe two men, (meaning Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe.)</hi> And ſo having deſcanted once more upon Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s weakneſs before the Council, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that what had been proved of that nature by Sir <hi>Tho. Doleman,</hi> was to his Lordſhip no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and alſo that it was well obſerved, that <hi>Oates</hi> was a begging at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and how ſtrange it was they ſhould uſe him ſo, when he
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:52053:165"/>
knew of ſo great a deſign on foot; his Lordſhip concluded.</p>
            <p>Upon which Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſaid,—<hi>My Lord! my Evidence is not right ſummed up;</hi> but it appears by the Printed Tryal, that there was no farther no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken thereof, than by this Anſwer from his Lordſhip,—<hi>I know not by what Authority this man ſpeaks.</hi>—And immediately the Jury withdrew; who after about an hour's in Conſultation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into Court, deſiring to know if they might not find the Priſoners guilty of Miſpriſion of Treaſon; and being told by Mr. Recorder, (the Judges being gone off) That they muſt either Convict them of High-Treaſon, or acquit them, they immediately gave in their Verdict <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> of all the Four Priſoners.

            </argument>
            <p>AS this unexpected <hi>Acquittal</hi> of Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> and the reſt tryed with him, ſeemed ſome <hi>diſcouragement</hi> to the Kings Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; ſo Proteſtants in general were much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed thereat, and not a few odd <hi>rumours</hi> and ſurmiſes ſpread abroad on that occaſion: ſome thought it ſtrange, that the <hi>veracity</hi> of Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſhould be more queſtioned, or their Teſtimony leſs <hi>regarded, now,</hi> than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore at the <hi>many</hi> precedent Tryals, ſince no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, or other <hi>ſufficient</hi> matter, was thought to have been aſſigned that might ſo <hi>invalidate</hi> their Credit. Others fancyed it an <hi>Exceſs</hi> of good-nature, that when Sir <hi>George</hi> could not but give himſelf up as <hi>a loſt man,</hi> in his own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from the ſtrength of the <hi>proofs</hi> againſt him, that yet he ſhould meet with ſo favourable a <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</hi> And moſt people lookt upon it as a <hi>riddle,</hi> That <hi>Coleman</hi> ſhould be Hanged for the <hi>payment</hi> of 5000 <hi>l.</hi> upon the account of Treaſon, and Sir <hi>George</hi> be acquitted for <hi>receiving</hi> of him the ſame 5000 <hi>l.</hi> for the ſame <hi>Treaſon.</hi> Such were the popular diſcourſes at that time; for the <hi>reaſon</hi> or juſtice whereof, we ſhall not engage, but leave them <hi>floating</hi> on the ſurface of <hi>opinion,</hi> till Time

with his diſcriminating <hi>wings</hi> ſhall either diſperſe them into oblivion, or hatch them into a better <hi>ſhape</hi> of Truth, than yet they have been made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in.</p>
            <p>This is certain, That the Papiſts took from hence occaſion to <hi>inſult,</hi> to ſcatter many inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Pamphlets</hi> up and down, to perſwade the world that there was no <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> to ſcandalize the <hi>Evidence,</hi> and magnifie the <hi>Innocence</hi> of <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi> and his Companions; intending it ſhould ſeem to over-bear ſo many of His Majeſties <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,</hi> the ſolemn <hi>Votes</hi> of two Parliaments, the Judgments of all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Oaths</hi> of ſo many Juries of moſt ſubſtantial Gentlemen and Citizens, with a few flaſhes of Rhetorick, and the onely <hi>Logick</hi> of <hi>noiſe</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence.</hi> But in this Career of their <hi>Jollity,</hi> and Revival of their hopes, it pleaſed Providence <hi>again</hi> to quail and <hi>daſh</hi> their confidence, by the new and more full diſcovery made by Mr. <hi>Robert Jenniſon,</hi> before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman, as he had been bred up a Papiſt, and zealous in that perſwaſion, ſo he had always approved himſelf of a devout temper, and regular <hi>Converſation;</hi> and was not onely deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended of an antient worthy Family, but within the proſpect of a fair <hi>Eſtate;</hi> ſo that he could not be imagined to have any temptations of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, envy,</hi> or <hi>intereſt,</hi> to prompt him to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, as will more evidently appear by his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>Conduct</hi> in this affair towards his <hi>Elder Brother,</hi> but onely out of pure unbiaſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> he came in a Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Truth;</hi> being firſt <hi>ſcandalized</hi> at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:52053:167"/>
confidence of his Couſen <hi>Ireland,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting not onely at his Tryal, but alſo at his <hi>death,</hi> on that which this Gentleman knew to be abſolutely <hi>falſe.</hi> Yet on the inducements ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Narrative, as the reſpect to his <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> (an own Brother and Kinſman being concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and regard to the <hi>credit</hi> of the Religion he had been Educated in, and was not yet weaned from, and ſome particular reflections on his own <hi>ſafety,</hi> he at firſt proceeded no farther, (either in his <hi>Depoſitions,</hi> or Oath <hi>vivâ voce</hi> at <hi>Wakemans</hi> Tryal, againſt whom he then was perſwaded there would be other ſufficient Evidence) than to diſprove ſuch the ſaid <hi>Irelands</hi> falſe Allegations of his not <hi>being in Town;</hi> yet afterwards the ſtings of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> ſtill pricking him to a farther manifeſtation of Truth, on the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1679. before <hi>Edmond Warcupp</hi> Eſquire, one of His Majeſties Juſtices of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and (to his <hi>immortal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)</hi> a very vigilant and <hi>active Magiſtrate,</hi> in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and deteſting this horrid Popiſh Plot, he made Affidavit of ſome other particulars: As, that <hi>Ireland,</hi> in <hi>June</hi> 1678. did ſay in his preſence, <hi>That it was an eaſie matter to poyſon the King, and that Sir</hi> George Wakeman <hi>might opportunely do it, being the Queens Doctor:</hi> and that on the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, the ſaid <hi>Ireland</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to forgive him twenty pound which he had borrowed of him, (of the St. <hi>Omerians</hi> money) if he would <hi>be aſſiſting to the taking off the King:</hi> which he abſolutely refuſing to be concerned in, <hi>Ireland,</hi> inquired if he did know any <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that were Papiſts, and <hi>ſtout</hi> and <hi>couragious</hi> for that purpoſe: whereupon, he named Mr. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallyn,</hi>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:52053:167"/>
Mr. <hi>Tho. Brahall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Karney,</hi> three <hi>Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſt, all of <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> or <hi>harbouring thereabouts,</hi> (who for ſome time before this Diſcovery, for want of knowledge of their true Names, had been Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached by others of the Kings <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> by the general term of the <hi>Four Iriſh Ruſſians</hi> hired to Aſſaſſinate his Sacred Majeſty at <hi>Windſor,)</hi> and in a ſubſequent Affidavit of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. he ſets forth, <hi>That</hi> Ireland <hi>deſired him to go down with theſe Four perſons to</hi> Windſor, <hi>to be aſſiſting in the Murder,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Ireland</hi> approving of them as fit perſons for ſuch an Exploit, being before acquainted with two of them: And that his Brother <hi>Tho.

            <p>This Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> likewiſe in ſuch his <hi>Narrative</hi> (well worthy of peruſal) ſets forth the paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Letters from his Brother and other Relations, whereby they endeavoured to deter or <hi>inveigle</hi> him from declaring the Truth in theſe matters; for the better underſtanding whereof, the Reader is to be informed, that <hi>Thomas Jenniſon</hi> his elder Brother was a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and upon Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, at the firſt Diſcovery, ſecured in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi> But ſo far was this his <hi>generous</hi> Brother from having any by-ends of advantage, as to the Inheritance of his Fathers Eſtate, which is conſiderable, and to which he was next Heir af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Brother, who had ſo incapacitated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, That he would not deliver in ſuch his <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> till he had obtained a promiſe from the Lords of his Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy-Council,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:52053:168"/>
of a <hi>Pardon</hi> to be extended to his ſaid Brother, (though continuing obſtinate) thereby ſetting him again <hi>Rectus in Curia,</hi> As alſo for his other Relations. By which he hath for ever ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced and <hi>ſtopt the mouths</hi> of Popiſh ſlanderers, who would calumniate him, as deſigning to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat his Brother of the Inheritance, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his own Intereſt. Though true it is, by the Providence of God his ſaid Brother is ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed of a natural death in Priſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Right juſtly devolved to him.</p>
            <p>This Diſcovery of young Mr. <hi>Jenniſon,</hi> had not onely a bleſſed effect on his aged Father, who thereby, and by ſeveral other previous diſcourſes he had heard, was convinced of the Traiterous <hi>Popiſh Deſign,</hi> and conſequently induced to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſuch a <hi>bloody</hi> vile Religion; but alſo influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced one Mr. <hi>John Smith,</hi> heretofore a <hi>Secular Prieſt</hi> retaining to that Family; if rather we ought not to ſay, that by ſome relation he had heard from the ſaid young Mr. <hi>Jenniſon,</hi> of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that had paſſed between <hi>Ireland</hi> and him, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> were not firſt <hi>alarm'd,</hi> and grown apprehenſive of the Helliſh Plot; and thereupon, as a local <hi>Subject,</hi> was not a little inſtrumental to incline him the ſaid young Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> to a candid delaration of the truth of what he knew thereof. For the ſaid Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> hath ſince pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed an <hi>excellent Treatiſe,</hi> (dedicated to the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty) giving an account of the <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> of the Popiſh Principles with the <hi>Peace</hi> of all States, eſpecially their deſtructive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Kingdomes, the <hi>incouragements</hi> of this Popiſh Deſign at this time againſt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:52053:168"/>
the <hi>progreſs</hi> they had made in it, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their endeavouring the <hi>death</hi> of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and a vindication of the <hi>juſtice</hi> on thoſe Traitors already Executed.</p>
            <p>Particularly, by an Affidavit taken the eighth of <hi>September,</hi> 1679. before the pre-named Juſtice <hi>Warcup,</hi> he corroborates the Teſtimony of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Jenniſon junior,</hi> as to his ſeeing <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>London</hi> at the time before-mentioned; for that ſoon after, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> he going into the North, young Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> did relate the ſame, and acquainted them therewith at his Fathers houſe; and likewiſe of ſo much of the ſaid <hi>Irelands</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes to him, touching taking off the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as gave them cauſe to believe, that there was a <hi>Jeſuitical Plot,</hi> the apprehenſion whereof, put Loyal old Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> at that time into a great paſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He likewiſe in his Narrative, <hi>p.</hi> 23. ſets forth, That he being not long ſince at <hi>Rome,</hi> heard the Jeſuits affirm, That the Pope had power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Kings; and that it was lawful, nay <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to kill any Prince or perſon Excommunicated, and declared an Heretick;</hi> and that he, (being then to return to <hi>England) ought not to pay Obedience to any Heretical or Excommunicated Prince;</hi> and that Father <hi>Anderton,</hi> Father <hi>Campian,</hi> and Father <hi>Green,</hi> did then and there (as likewiſe Abbot <hi>Montague</hi> at <hi>Paris) aſſure</hi> him there would ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly be great <hi>alterations in Church and State</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and that there was but <hi>one man</hi> in the way (meaning the King) who might ſoon be removed; and that they were aſſured from the moſt <hi>eminent perſons</hi> of this Nation, That their
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:52053:169"/>
Religion ſhould be Eſtabliſht again here, <hi>in as great glory as at any time heretofore;</hi> and whoever oppoſed it, ſhould be <hi>removed.</hi> And that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly they bottomed their hopes on the Duke of <hi>York's being a Papiſt;</hi> who they declared was brought over by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and that they had the greateſt <hi>influence</hi> over him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>p.</hi> 30. as a pregnant Circumſtantial Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Plot, he ſets forth an univerſal <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Money</hi> made to his knowledge, though he diſcouraged it, amongſt the Papiſts, under pretence of repairing <hi>Doway</hi> Colledge, but ſo general, and in ſuch large <hi>ſums,</hi> (as twenty pound, and ten pound a man) that it was apparent to be for the carrying on ſome greater <hi>deſign, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, as Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> in his Narrative hath anſwered all Objections, as why he did not come in ſooner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo it thereby appears, that he hath reſerved ſome farther particularities to be yet diſcovered in time convenient. In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, upon ſuch his information, his Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to iſſue forth his Royal Proclamation, commanding the before-named <hi>Four Iriſh Gentlemen</hi> (or rather <hi>Ruſſians)</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves, and propoſing <hi>rewards</hi> to any that ſhall ſeize them or any of them; but they are fled, or abſcond; a ſhrewd Argument of their guilt, and the truth of his information; ſo that at the time of writing hereof, there was none of them come in or apprehended.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>THat it was part of the <hi>Original</hi> Popiſh Plot, when they had <hi>Murder'd</hi> the King, to caſt the <hi>odium</hi> thereof on the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> thereby at once to have <hi>ſhifted off</hi> the ſcandal of the horrid Treaſon from their own Party, and heated the <hi>Epiſcopiſts</hi> with a colourable pretence to have fallen upon, and with their help to have deſtroyed all that they ſhould think fit to call <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> (under which ignominious Titles the ſoundeſt Proteſtants and moſt <hi>regular Sons</hi> of the Eſtabliſht Church ſhould at laſt have ſuffer'd) is apparent from what we have recited of <hi>Doctor Oates's Depoſitions</hi> and Maſter <hi>Dugdale's Teſtimony.</hi> Which is no more than what their Predeceſſors inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: For even their <hi>Gunpowder-Plot,</hi> if it had ſucceeded, was to have been charged on the then <hi>Puritans,</hi> as the famous <hi>Thuanus</hi> in his Hiſtory teſtifies. Now in order to plaining the way for this <hi>ſuggeſtion,</hi> in the preſent Caſe, it muſt be
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:52053:170"/>
noted, that ſome time before the firſt <hi>Diſcovery</hi> of the Plot (which was about <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1678, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) the Conſpirators had fixt <hi>a groundleſs</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation on one Mr. <hi>Claypool,</hi> who though a Gentleman of a moſt innocent <hi>peaceable</hi> Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and far enough from intermeddliug with Intrigues of State, having for many years wound himſelf up in a private <hi>Receſs,</hi> devoted to Books and Study, yet he having formerly been Married to a Daughter of the <hi>quondam</hi> Protector <hi>Cromwel,</hi> they fancied from the prejudice of that <hi>Alliance,</hi> he might be a perſon fit for them to deſigne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make him a property for Suſpicions. Having therefore Charg'd him with <hi>high Crimes</hi> in general againſt the Government, they cauſed him to be clapt up in the <hi>Tower;</hi> And had not the Hand of Heaven ſoon after confounded their <hi>meaſures,</hi> would no doubt have proſecuted him by <hi>ſuborn'd</hi> Witneſſes: But being ſo happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, after a long <hi>Durance,</hi> and no particular Crime chargeable, he obtained his Liberty.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time alſo they endeavoured to <hi>Trepan</hi> an eminent worthy Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> under pretence of doing a kindneſs for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Gentleman, <hi>viz.</hi> To convey certain <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> to be left with him, to a place beyond the Seas; but he diſcreetly, miſtruſting the Project, <hi>open'd</hi> one of them in preſence of ſubſtantial Witneſſes; and finding therein Expreſſions of a <hi>dangerous</hi> nature, communicated the ſame to a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and thereby fruſtrated their deviliſh Deſigne. Nor is it to be forgot, that near the ſame time there were certain riotous perſons, who with <hi>Horſe and Arms</hi> were ſaid to come out
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:52053:170"/>
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (repreſented for <hi>Presbyterians</hi> flying from the Juſtice of that Kingdome) committing ſome Violences in the Marches of <hi>England,</hi> of whom <hi>a dreadful Account</hi> was publiſhed in the <hi>Gazette;</hi> but no more Tydings heard either of the <hi>Men,</hi> or the <hi>matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were ſome of their ſpecious <hi>Preparatives,</hi> that whenever they ſhould ſtrike the <hi>Accurſed Blow,</hi> their Clamours againſt the Fanaticks might appear <hi>credible.</hi> And though their <hi>Plot</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was ſoon after ſo Miraculouſly diſcovered, and the <hi>reality</hi> thereof confirm'd, as well by <hi>their Murther</hi> of Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey,</hi> as by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>freſh Evidence</hi> that came in; yet they reſolved ſtill to puſh on the ſame Contrivance. Nor had they indeed any way to <hi>amuſe</hi> the People, ſtartle Authority, and divert juſt Proſecution againſt themſelves, other than by ſtarting a freſh <hi>ſcent,</hi> and raiſing imaginary Jealouſies.</p>
            <p>But ſuch was the <hi>peaceable</hi> Loyal temper of people in general in <hi>England,</hi> that they could not yet hope to <hi>brand</hi> them with any ſuch Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Towards the <hi>North</hi> therefore they muſt plant their Engines, <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt be made the <hi>Scene</hi> to begin the Tragedy. And this too Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Oates</hi> (if you remember) had before ſet forth, and told us, what and how many <hi>Jeſuitical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi> (thoſe common <hi>Boutefeus</hi> and Nurſers of Rebellion) had thither been delegated and fet on work.</p>
            <p>Under what <hi>Circumſtances</hi> that Kingdome had lain for ſome years, is too well known to need here a Repetition: that <hi>Oppreſſion may make wiſe men mad,</hi> is atteſted by the wiſeſt of Princes; yet
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:52053:171"/>
far be it from us to patronize or <hi>palliate</hi> Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion on any pretext.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Overt act</hi> was the Murther of Doctor <hi>Sharp</hi> Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in his Coach on the Road, <hi>May</hi> 3. 1679. by about a dozen Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinates, attended with ſuch extraordinary horrid and <hi>barbarous</hi> Circumſtances, that ſeem'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate ſomething of a further <hi>Improvement,</hi> as well as preſent <hi>Malice;</hi> or as if there had been a Deſign to <hi>eclipſe</hi> the Villany of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation on Sir <hi>Edmondb. Godfrey,</hi> by this more <hi>inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane one</hi> committed by ſuppoſed <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> 'Tis certain the blame was laid upon the <hi>Whiggs</hi> or <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> there, for which there wanted not ſpecious Reaſons: But Relations no leſs <hi>credible</hi> have given an Account, that the principal <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer</hi> acted merely on private <hi>Revenge</hi> for perſonal Injuries; and 'tis not impoſſible, that a perſon of ſuch bad Principles might be egg'd on to ſo villanous a <hi>Barbarity</hi> by inſinuating Jeſuits, who like their Father the <hi>Devil</hi> take the advantage of mens <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and by Temptations improve their Animoſities to the perpetration of the blackeſt Crimes.</p>
            <p>The next News was of an <hi>Inſurrection</hi> in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland, May</hi> 29, 1679. attended with a <hi>Declaration</hi> and other Inſolencies of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, equally <hi>extravagant</hi> and deteſtable.

However, ſince his Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> behaved himſelf with ſo much <hi>Zeal, Conduct,</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> in that Action, 'tis hard to meaſure the Confidence of the <hi>Popiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators,</hi> that they ſhould hope, ſo ſoon after, to ſet him up for a <hi>General</hi> of Rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> over a like pretended Faction, as he had but now <hi>routed</hi> and <hi>diſſipated</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and whereof ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>inferiour</hi> promoters, and active inſtruments therein, have ſince ſuffered Death, <hi>Baniſhment,</hi> and

other puniſhments, according to the Laws of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And now Affairs <hi>ſleeping</hi> as it were for a while, the <hi>old Enemy</hi> takes advantage of that opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, induſtriouſly to <hi>ſow his Tares,</hi> by ſpreading ſwarms of virulent Libels, (of which we ſhall give you a more particular account in the next Chapter, againſt the Proteſtant <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and the Reputation of the <hi>Kings Evidence;</hi> who had they not been wonderfully ſupported by the hand of God, the prayers of good men, and their own natural <hi>courage,</hi> muſt certainly have <hi>ſunk,</hi> and been over-whelmed with the various diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and mountains of <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>ſlanders</hi> daily caſt upon them. But at laſt, the Conſpirators finding that all the <hi>Intereſt</hi> they had made for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying <hi>Elections</hi> for their Tooth of Members to ſerve in the new Parliament ſummoned to ſit the ſeventeenth of <hi>October,</hi> could not prevail, but that generally throughout the Nation, men of approved <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and <hi>weal of the Publick,</hi> had (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anding all their ſtickling, and the vain efforts of a multitude of <hi>Laodicean Chemarims)</hi> been choſen for that weighty <hi>Truſt;</hi> and particularly reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ſhamefully they had been baffled in the <hi>Choice</hi> for the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London, Octob.</hi> the 7th, they were now for <hi>ſtifling</hi> that Child, which before they would have miſ-begot; and improved all their endeavours, by a certain <hi>White-Powder,</hi> that makes no noiſe, (probably ſome new <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention) to <hi>blow up</hi> the approaching Parliament, which yet 'tis hoped, by the bleſſing of God and His Majeſties Favour, will continue ſitting ſo long,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:52053:172"/>
as may enable it, to Countermine all their Plots, and bring the Traytors, as well Cedars as Shrubs, to condign puniſhment, ſo as to ſecure His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Life from their villanous attempts for the future, and ſettle the Proteſtant Religion and Property on a firm and durable Baſis.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>viz.</hi> on the ſecond of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> (the Anniverſary Faſt for the never-to-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forgotten <hi>Burning</hi> of <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Popiſh Treachery)</hi> and (as 'tis ſaid) about Two of the clock in the morning, his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York</hi> arrived here from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and forthwith went to the King, who then, to the great grief and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of all his good Subjects, was very <hi>Ill</hi> at <hi>Windſor.</hi> The Dukes coming, (as was then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Authority in the <hi>Gazet)</hi> was contrary to <hi>expectation,</hi> and therefore he acquainted His Majeſty, <hi>That hearing of His Majeſties Indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he thought he could do no leſs than to come to wait on him, and ſee how he did; adding, That he was ready as ſoon as His Majeſty pleaſed, to depart for</hi> Flanders, <hi>or any other part of the world that His Majeſty ſhould appoint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the Popiſh Conſpirators, thoſe <hi>Rooks</hi> in policy, reſolving to put the <hi>great Game</hi> upon us, began notably to <hi>ſhuffle the Cards;</hi> a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was publiſhed, ſignifying, That the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> which was to Convene on the ſeventeenth of <hi>October,</hi> ſhould thence be <hi>Prorogued</hi> till the thirtieth of the ſame Month. Out-cries and Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums from Pulpit, and Preſs, and Coffee-houſes, were every where heard againſt the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> &amp;c the dangers the Government was in from a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical Faction; the grounds and broachers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we ſhall ſoon acquaint you with: though 'tis

poſſible ſome innocent zealous Proteſtants might be inveigled in ſo far, as to believe the thing <hi>real,</hi> and might, far from any ill deſign, join in, and promote the common clamour.</p>
            <p>And now, to the great <hi>ſurprize</hi> and <hi>grief</hi> of the people, his Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Kings <hi>disfavour,</hi> and was commanded to withdraw himſelf out of His Majeſties Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the occaſion whereof was variouſly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: nor dare we preſume to pry into the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of State ſo far, as to conjecture the reaſons; though ſome ſubſequent Diſcoveries of Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at that inſtant on the wheel, perſwaded ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, That the cloud which Eclipſed this beloved Prince, and averted for the preſent the kind Rays of His moſt gracious Majeſty from him, proceeded originally from putrid Exhalations, and the venemous breath of Calumny whiſpered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by his Enemies, thereby to remove him; hoping that by ſhaking his Intereſt thus in the Royal favour, they might the better <hi>utterly ruine</hi> him, by getting credit to thoſe <hi>falſe</hi> and horrid ſuggeſtions which they were ſhortly after to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance againſt him, as <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of a Proteſtant Rebellion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However, his Grace moſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently departed, and about the twenty fourth of <hi>September</hi> went over into <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after returned to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and obtained leave to go from thence and reſide in <hi>Scotland:</hi> in order to which, he arrived here again, on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the twelfth of <hi>October,</hi> (a day the laſt year notorious, whence ſome ſuperſtitious people would needs make a noiſe of it; though far be it from
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:52053:173"/>
any man of ſenſe, to countenance any ſuch ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, as well as bold and unbecoming obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.) On the twenty firſt of <hi>October,</hi> his Royal Highneſs was invited to Dine at the Annual Feaſt of the Artillery-Company at <hi>Merchant-Tailors</hi> Hall; moſt of the Stewards being perſons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or great at Court. His Highneſs came at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with his Guards, and there did appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hundred Artillery-men, (the number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Society being ſaid to be in all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween five and ſix hundred) beſides ſuch as on this occaſion came in with Tickets bought at under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, or given <hi>gratis;</hi> the Right Honourable the then Lord Mayor was there likewiſe preſent.</p>
            <p>Some days before this, the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was removed from his place of Preſident of the Councel; and on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the ſeventeenth of <hi>October,</hi> a competent number of the Members of Parliament being met, they were by a Commiſſion Prorogued, (not to the thirtieth of the ſame Month, according to the before-mentioned Proclamation, but) to the twenty ſixth day of <hi>January</hi> next.</p>
            <p>The Conſpirators had now many Irons in the fire; they were come to the fifth Act; and as their Scenes were varions, ſo they required Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition too. And indeed, they made more <hi>haſt than good ſpeed;</hi> for juſt when they were ready to diſcharge all their devices in order upon us, they one after another untimely took fire, and went off like ſo many Squibs and Crackers (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God) without doing any Execution, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept detecting more evidently their villanous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties and Treaſons, and warning us the better

againſt them for the future.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They had for ſome time carryed on an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue to corrupt Mr. <hi>Stephen Dugdale,</hi> (one of the Kings material Witneſſes) that he might for large Sums of Money, which they offered him, retract and diſown the Teſtimony he had already given, and deſiſt from appearing againſt any of them for the future. One Mrs. <hi>Price,</hi> with whom Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> had been long acquainted, and one Mr. <hi>Tasbrough,</hi> were the Inſtruments employed to work him about; who ſeemed to hearken to their Overtures, that he might fadom the bottom of their drift; which was, That the ſaid Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> ſhould ſign and ſeal ſuch a Paper of Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they had dictated or drawn, being (as it hath been publiſhed) of the tenour or purport fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Being touched with a true remorſe of Conſcience, and an hearty ſorrow for the great evil I have done, in appearing as a Witneſs againſt the Catholicks, and there ſpeaking that which in my own Conſcience I know to be far from the Truth; I think my ſelf bound in duty to God, to Men, and for the ſafety of my own Soul, to make true acknowledgment how I was drawn into theſe wicked actions: but being well ſatisfied, that I ſhall create my ſelf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny powerful Enemies upon that account, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired my ſelf to a place of ſafety, where I will with my own hand diſcover the great wrong that has been done the Catholicks, and I hope it may gain belief. I do likewiſe proteſt before Almighty God, that I have no motive to induce me to this Confeſſion, but a true Repentance for the miſchiefs that I have done, and do hope that God Almighty will forgive me.</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:52053:174"/>
But for all this Proteſtation, they were to give him a great ſum of money in hand, and ſo he was to go beyond the Seas till the noiſe was over, and then they promiſed him he ſhould have his Pardon, further reward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when he queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned how he ſhould be ſure of the Money upon Sealing, they propoſed an Ambaſſador for Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But that being not approved of, but he ſtill delaying them with ſtudied Exceptions and Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they began to ſuſpect that he never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to cloſe with them, but rather, as Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> had ſerved <hi>Reading,</hi> diſcover them. Hereupon, they make a complaint firſt againſt Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and what wrongs Catholicks ſuffered by the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſuch Witneſſes as for a ſum of Money would deny all that they had ſworn, and run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. But Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> to prevent this ſnare, had all along communicated the paſſages that had been between them, to ſeveral worthy perſons, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and others whom he could confide in, who atteſted the ſame, and that he proceeded therein not without their directions, to diſcover the foul practices and deſigns of theſe Popiſh Tamperers: So that on a fair hearing before the Council, he was not onely acquitted with credit, but the ſaid <hi>Price</hi> and <hi>Tasborough</hi> ſent to Goal, whom he did endeavour to bring to Tryal the laſt <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> Term, for the ſaid grand miſdemeanour, (if it be no worſe) but could not effect the ſame, ſo that at laſt they were Bail'd out; but will, 'tis hoped, the next Term be brought to Juſtice.</p>
            <p>This Diſcovery, though not a little ſcandalous to the Popiſh Faction, was immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with another much more conſiderable. Such
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:52053:175"/>
a long Web of Treaſon, Murder, Perjury, and Cruelty towards many thouſands of innocent Proteſtants, as ſcarce any Hiſtory can parallel, for it exceeded both the <hi>Pariſian</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacres; for in thoſe, men might make ſome kind of defence, at leaſt were onely killed, and left to the pity of poſterity; but this Plot was to blaſt the Fame, taint the Blood, and render the Innocent for ever odious, by a charge of black Treaſons, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Rebellion, which they never ſo much as dreamed of, to be carried on by falſe accuſations and ſuborn'd Witneſſes; no cruelty being ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, as that which is acted under pretence of Juſtice, and accompanyed with the abuſed Formalities of the Law.</p>
            <p>The firſt accident that brought this Helliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to light, was one Mr. <hi>Tho. Dangerfields</hi> being diſcovered to have planted ſeveral forged Treaſonable Letters, with Catalogues of Names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Lodgings of Colonel <hi>Roderigo Manſel,</hi> in <hi>Ax-yard Weſtminſter;</hi> concerning which, and the preparatory circumſtances of the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, there being two large and <hi>ſatisfactory Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives</hi> already publiſhed, the one by the ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, the other written by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> himſelf; we ſhall onely extract from thence ſome of the moſt material paſſages, ſuch as will be neceſſary for compleating this our Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hiſtory, and giving the Reader a general Scheme of the horrid Contrivance, referring the more curious to thoſe Relations at large.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſum of the Intrigue was, That ſeeing their former Popiſh Plot againſt His Majeſties Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Government, and the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:52053:175"/>
was notoriouſly detected, and all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to baffle or ſtifle the Kings Evidence fruſtrated, they reſolved upon coyning a new pretended Plot, which ſhould be charged on the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> by name, but in truth involve the moſt zealous and active Proteſtant Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> throughout the Nation; which being fortified with bold Perjuries, and ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, might gain credit; and thereby they being deſtroyed, as a ſacrifice to Juſtice, it might ſeem probable that the <hi>laſt years Plot</hi> was onely their malicious contrivance againſt the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who would then appear the Kings <hi>beſt Subjects;</hi> and having ſo cruſht their Enemies, might with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and almoſt without oppoſition, proceed in their former Plot to ſubvert the Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See Col. <hi>Manſ.</hi> Narrative, <hi>fol.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Amongſt other Inſtruments for this purpoſe, they made choice of this Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> as one profeſſing the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, and whoſe extravagant courſes, and deſperate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (being a Priſoner in <hi>Newgate)</hi> had rendered him fit to ſerve them therein.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

But being clapt up immediately after for Debt, removed him into the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and there for a conſiderable time allowed him Twenty ſhillings a week.

There he was employed to Trepan one <hi>Stroud,</hi> and get ſomething out of him againſt Mr. <hi>Bedloe.</hi> And to that purpoſe, was to drink him hard, and allowed by two Prieſts to be <hi>drunk</hi> on the ſame day he had received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ſince it was for the good of the Cauſe.

And now Mrs. <hi>Celier</hi> ſends for the time of his <hi>Nativity,</hi> which he ſent her.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Having compounded his <hi>Debts,</hi> (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to near ſeven hundred pound) Mrs. <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> furniſht him with money to <hi>diſcharge</hi> them; ſo he left the Kings Bench, is brought acquainted with the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> who promiſes to make him a <hi>Fortune,</hi> and takes a Lodging for him in <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> employs him to get <hi>Prieſts</hi> out of Priſon, ſends him to the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> who likes him well, <hi>&amp;c. fol.</hi> 7, 8.</p>

He is ſent with a Pacquet to one Mrs. <hi>Jean,</hi> at <hi>Peterley</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> whom he finds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and from him brings up Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> being the ground-work of the New-Plot; <hi>That Pamphlets muſt be writ, and perſons employed at Coffee-houſes to rail againſt the Presbyterians,</hi> &amp;c. p. 10.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He is employed to <hi>Tutor</hi> the <hi>St. Omer-youths</hi> under the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> who was their grand Inſtructor. He takes Notes at the Five Jeſuits Tryals, carries them to the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> who encourage him to write Pamphlets, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to reward him; and thenceforth he was allowed three pound a week, beſides Diet, <hi>fol.</hi> 12.</p>

Another time he Tranſcribed twenty ſeven ſuch Letters, and ſent them to the <hi>Tower.</hi> And one Mr. <hi>Holder,</hi> his R. H.

            <p n="15">15.

In the Papers foiſted into Col. <hi>Manſels</hi> Chamber, there were likewiſe long Liſts of Names that were to be rendred obnoxious, to this preſent Plot; but no particular Copy or Account can thereof be given; the Original Papers being ſo lodged, that the ſame are not eaſily procurable, till Authority ſhall think fit to divulge them.—See Col. <hi>Manſels Nar. fol.</hi> 104.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> by this laſt Diſcovery at Mrs. <hi>Celiers,</hi> finding himſelf trapt, had not the confidence to ſtand out longer, but on the laſt of <hi>October</hi> made application to the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> Lord Mayor; before whom, and other perſons of Quality, he made a candid Confeſſion on Oath, tranſmitted the next day to His Majeſty and the Councel.

The Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> twice in <hi>Michaelmaſs-</hi>Term brought his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> to be Bayled in the Kings Bench; but was told by the Judges of that Court, that though formerly when there was but <hi>one witneſs</hi> againſt him, they had afforded it him, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made ſuch ill uſe of his <hi>Liberty,</hi> and being now charged directly by <hi>two</hi> Witneſſes for <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> they could not allow it; and ſo was re-manded to the <hi>Tower.</hi>

            <p>By this whole contrivance, it moſt evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that though the Popiſh out-cries and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours ran onely upon the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks,</hi> yet their aim was to ruine all that were true Proteſtants, or honeſt Aſſertors of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Property of the Subject.

               <p n="1">1. About <hi>April, 1679.

                  <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> that he heard between Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> contriving how to deſtroy the Earl of <hi>Danby;</hi> that Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſhould ſay, he had <hi>invented a way,</hi> viz.

Their <hi>Tackling</hi> being thus prepared, the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> depended ſo much on the ſucceſs, that (if we may believe the Oaths of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators) it was chiefly on <hi>that Confidence,</hi> that he ſurrendred himſelf to the Uſher of <hi>the bla-Rod,</hi> after he had for a conſiderable time abſcon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded: And the very ſame day, <hi>Knox</hi> made <hi>Osborne</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> ſwear <hi>again</hi> to ſtand to what he had taught them.

                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:52053:182"/>
and at laſt he procured <hi>Lane</hi>'s Liberty, and <hi>Nevil</hi> and his Friend, <hi>Knox</hi>'s.

                  <hi>Some neceſſary</hi> Reflections <hi>on ſeveral late Popiſh Libels; as the</hi> Addreſs to both Houſes of Parliament. The Cloak in its Colours. The new Plot of the Papiſts to transform Traitors into Martyrs. The Compendium of the Plot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>WE conceive we cannot ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this <hi>undertaking</hi> of giving a <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory account</hi> of this <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> branched out into ſo many <hi>various ſorts</hi> of villanies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking ſome particular notice of ſeveral of their moſt <hi>effronted Pamphlets,</hi> wherewith they endeavour'd to <hi>poyſon</hi> the minds, and <hi>dazle</hi> the eyes, and <hi>divide</hi> the affections of his Majeſties good Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
            <p>This you have heard was one of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <hi>projects,</hi> contrived by the Tower-cabal, and Conſults of their Prieſts; which moſt induſtriouſly they purſued. We ſhall not waſte time in a tedious confutation of <hi>all the lies</hi> and ſlanders therein contain'd, for that moſt of them have already particular Anſwers; but ſhall offer ſome brief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques, which may ſufficiently <hi>antidote</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt their infection.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider <hi>the Authors.</hi> They are written ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>deſperate Bigots,</hi> deeply and principally concern'd in the Plot, or elſe by <hi>debauch'd</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary villains, kept in <hi>penſion</hi> by the great ones,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:52053:184"/>
for that purpoſe. Thus Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> proves <hi>the Compendium</hi> to be the work of the <hi>venomous Pen</hi> of the Lord <hi>C.</hi> The <hi>New-plot,</hi> to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Dormer</hi> a ſuppoſed Prieſt; <hi>ſeveral others</hi> by <hi>Nevil,</hi> who haunting the <hi>Play-houſes</hi> too much, and thereby neglecting to ſcribble ſo faſt as they would have him when he was at liberty, ſome of their Lordſhips adviſed that he ſhould be <hi>clapt up again,</hi> and thereby be made more indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious in doing their <hi>drudgery.</hi> Now what <hi>credit</hi> is there to be given to what ſuch people ſhall write? Can it be imagined that they will make <hi>any conſcience</hi> of venting the moſt impudent <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Scandals,</hi> who have already plung'd themſelves into the moſt deteſtable <hi>Treaſons;</hi> and whoſe <hi>writings</hi> are no more but their own <hi>Neck-verſes,</hi> having no way to ſave their heads, but by that ingenuity of their <hi>fingers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The main <hi>ſcope</hi> of all theſe Libels, is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the world, that there neither is, nor was any ſuch thing as <hi>a Popiſh Plot.</hi> Now 'tis left to all conſiderate men, in forraign parts, <hi>which</hi> they will chuſe to believe, the <hi>King,</hi> and the two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and all the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Land, who upon notorious evidence of matter of fact, have ſolemnly declared that there is ſuch a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Helliſh Popiſh Plot, both againſt his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Life</hi> and Government, as well as againſt the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> or <hi>theſe wretched Traitors,</hi> who by fantaſtick flouriſhes, impudent denials, ſhameful <hi>falſhoods</hi> and ſurmiſes, would ſuggeſt there is none.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Mediums</hi> they proceed upon, which are loading the <hi>Kings Evidence</hi> with opprobrious
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:52053:184"/>
language and calumnies, (and in this <hi>Billingsgate-</hi>rhetorick, the Author of the <hi>Compendium</hi> hath not his <hi>Peer)</hi> yet have they not at any time been able to prove <hi>any</hi> of the Crimes with which they charge them; but on the contrary, their ſlanders have moſt fully and <hi>ſatisfactorily</hi> been refuted by the ſeveral anſwers and <hi>proofs</hi> that have been made in juſtification of the Witneſſes integrity and innocency.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>ſly manner</hi> and <hi>ſubtle titles</hi> whereby they publiſh theſe miſchievous Libels, to inſinuate as if they were written by <hi>loyal Proteſtants.</hi> In many of them pretending a great veneration for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> railing at <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and ſuggeſting fears and jealouſies of ill deſigns hatcht by them againſt the Government; on purpoſe to amuſe people, and cauſe rancour and diviſions amongſt Proteſtants. But bleſſed be God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath now laid that part of their villanous malice ſo <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>naked</hi> to the eyes of all the world, that we hope no well-meaning men will hereafter be inveigled with ſuch pretences.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To take off all <hi>credit</hi> or reſpect for theſe odious Pamphlets, 'tis enough to conſider the apparent <hi>notorious Lies</hi> they are ſtuft with; as for example, their <hi>Addreſs to the Parliament</hi> bluſhes not moſt ſcandalouſly to affirm, <hi>that his Majeſty does not believe there is any ſuch Plot, and does but laugh at it.</hi> Now what good ſubject can with <hi>any patience</hi> read ſuch an horrid <hi>affront and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> caſt upon his <hi>Soveraign,</hi> who by ſo many rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated Royal <hi>Proclamations, Declarations,</hi> &amp;c. has declared the contrary, and expreſs'd his <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> to prevent and puniſh the ſame?
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:52053:185"/>
So the <hi>Compendium</hi> (as if the Author had been <hi>infatuated,</hi> to ſhew us in the <hi>Porch</hi> what we muſt expect in the reſt of the <hi>edifice)</hi> begins in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt line with a moſt <hi>notorious Lie,</hi> aſſerting that <hi>Coleman was tryed at the Old-Bailey,</hi> whereas all the world knows he received his Tryal at the <hi>Kings-bench-bar</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall.</hi> What ſhall we ſay of his impudence, <hi>p.</hi> 69. where he avers, that the worthy Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey,</hi> whom they ſo barbarouſly butcher'd, was <hi>an extraordinary and particular friend to the Papiſts?</hi> Or of that other, <hi>p. 85. That there are not fifty thouſand men, women, and children, of the Roman Catholick Religion in</hi> England? Is not that a moſt pleaſant <hi>Certificate</hi> from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> at the tail of his Libel, that <hi>vouches</hi> for thoſe peſts of all ſociety, the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> That they have given <hi>a rare example of obedience in general, to all civil Magiſtrates and Governours; a thing which makes their whole Society highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and eſteemed by moſt of the Chriſtian Princes of the world?</hi> What will not they <hi>certifie,</hi> after ſuch an extravagant falſhood? Or what may not thoſe believe, who can ſuffer themſelves to be <hi>gull'd</hi> with ſuch groſs Lies and Impoſtures?</p>
            <p>But what need we rake further into this <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſhore</hi> of Popiſh <hi>filth</hi> and <hi>venom?</hi> The whole Nation, we truſt, is by this time throughly <hi>awake,</hi> and have their eyes ſo well <hi>open'd,</hi> as not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be cheated of their <hi>Religion,</hi> their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> by the wheadles of a little <hi>Popiſh Rhetorick.</hi> The <hi>Serpents</hi> now may <hi>hiſs,</hi> but have loſt their <hi>ſtings;</hi> ſo that they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger any, but ſuch as are <hi>willing</hi> to be deceived, and court their own ruine; and therefore we
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:52053:185"/>
ſhall put a period to this Chapter, onely remarq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that many or moſt of theſe Traiterous and <hi>Seditious Pamphlets</hi> were either Printed for, or ſold and <hi>diſpers'd</hi> by one <hi>Turner</hi> a Popiſh Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller in <hi>Holborn,</hi> as appears as well by Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfields</hi> Narrative, as by matters of fact, great numbers of ſuch traſh having been <hi>ſeized</hi> there; for which he hath more than once been in <hi>Jail,</hi> but ſtill findes friends to get him out; and we know not how it happens, whether by any bodies <hi>connivance,</hi> or his own peculiar <hi>good luck,</hi> but ſo it is, that we cannot underſtand that there is that <hi>effectual proſecution</hi> as might be expected, for ſuch <hi>inſolent</hi> offences.</p>

               <p>The Concluſion, in an Addreſs reſulting from the premiſes, to both <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> reſpectively.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THus have we, with what convenient <hi>Brevity</hi> we could, given you a true, and (we hope) ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory <hi>Account</hi> of the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Progreſs</hi> of this <hi>Helliſh Plot;</hi> its horrid Nature, miraculous Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and what <hi>Proceedings</hi> have hitherto been made for the Puniſhment of ſome of the Conſpirators, to preſerve our Government and Religion from their miſchievous Fury. As for whatever <hi>falſe Reports</hi> and calumniating Stories this <hi>ungodly Brood</hi> may either whiſper at home, or <hi>proclaim</hi> abroad beyond the Seas, of their being <hi>cruelly</hi> or <hi>unjuſtly</hi> perſecuted; all ſober unbyuſs'd men muſt on the contrary admire the <hi>Clemency</hi> of our King, and the <hi>Moderation</hi> of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that have ſo generouſly <hi>bridled</hi> their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that notwithſtanding ſo many barbarous <hi>Provocations,</hi> there yet hath not been heard of <hi>one Roman Catholick</hi> that hath <hi>received prejudice in his Perſon or Eſtate in a tumultuous manner;</hi> but the whole Proſecution carried on with the moſt <hi>equal Hearing,</hi> and <hi>full Proofs,</hi> according to Law and Juſtice; or if any <hi>partiality</hi> hath been ſhewn, it hath been in favour of the <hi>Criminals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall now draw to <hi>Concluſion,</hi> with a ſhort <hi>Addreſs</hi> to ſeveral ſorts of people, in ſome uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:52053:186"/>
Conſiderations, naturally reſulting from the Premiſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt we Appeal to <hi>all Chriſtians in General,</hi> whether they be not obliged, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation of our holy Profeſſion, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt this Romiſh faction, and their <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,</hi> or rather <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> and abominable ſcandalous <hi>Principles</hi> and Practices? When this Blood-thirſty Tribe goes about with <hi>force</hi> and <hi>fraud,</hi> with falſe and <hi>blaſphemous</hi> Doctrines, and <hi>Traiterous</hi> attempts, to ſubvert all true <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and ſacrifice the peace of <hi>humane Society</hi> to their own pride and covetouſneſs, can it be leſs than the <hi>duty</hi> of all National Churches and Univerſities publickly by <hi>ſolemn Decrees</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, if not by <hi>Excommunication,</hi> to condemn, renounce and deteſt them; and of all private Chriſtians, by abſtaining from their <hi>Communion,</hi> and coming out of that <hi>Babylon,</hi> to take care that they be not partakers of her ſins, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive of her deſerved <hi>Plagues?—Quid fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Cyprian) in pectore Chriſtiano Luporum feritas, &amp; Canum rabies? &amp; venenum Serpentum, &amp; cruenta ſaevitia Beſtiarum? Gratulandum eſt tum tales deEccleſia ſeparantur, ne Columbas ne oves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti ſaeva ſua &amp; venenata contagione praedentur. What hath the fierceneſs of Wolves, the rage of Dogs, the venom of Dragons, and the bloody cruelty of wild beaſts to do in a Chriſtian Breaſt? There's joy and gladneſs amongſt all good men, when ſuch are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Church, leſt the gentle and innocent Doves and Sheep of Chriſt be made a prey to their cruel jaws, and infected with their poyſonous contagion.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:52053:187"/>
2. To thoſe who <hi>are not of that Communion,</hi> but have hitherto eſcaped thoſe deluſions: How highly will it concern them, that they ſuffer not themſelves to be therewith intangled! for better had it been for them never to have known the way of Righteouſneſs, than afterwards to <hi>apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize</hi> therefrom, and defile themſelves with ſuch groſs idolatries and impieties. And therefore it behoves them, that they be careful not to hold the <hi>truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> but walk worthy of their vocation, even worthy of God, who hath called them out of <hi>darkneſs,</hi> into his marvellous Light: for <hi>Atrocius ſub ſancti nominis profeſſione peccatur:</hi> 'Tis a ſad agravation of <hi>ſin,</hi> when 'tis committed againſt plentiful meaſures of <hi>Grace,</hi> and under the profeſſion of ſo Holy a Name: let us therefore beware, above all things, that whilſt we <hi>ſeparate</hi> from the <hi>ſcandals</hi> of others, we do not our ſelves adminiſter <hi>occaſion of ſcandal</hi> to others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To all who are <hi>in Authority,</hi> whether in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> that they be vigilant, both by their <hi>example</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> to diſcourage and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all manner of <hi>vice and debauchery,</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and promote all kind of Virtue, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>ſolid piety</hi> and devotion in Religion. The lamentable increaſe of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>prophaneſs</hi> which of late years, more than ever, hath like a deluge overwhelm'd ſo many thouſands, eſpecially of the <hi>young Gentry</hi> in theſe Kingdomes, muſt be lookt upon as one of the <hi>preparatives</hi> to this Plot, and a fore-runner of <hi>Popery:</hi> for as Vice and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery,</hi> nay even <hi>coldneſs</hi> and indifferency in matters of Religon, in any man, makes him the more obnoxious to the <hi>Deluſions</hi> of the Papiſts,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:52053:187"/>
whoſe <hi>Mock-religion</hi> is accommodated to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual deſires and <hi>Luſts</hi> of mankind. So they well knowing this by experience, do endeavour <hi>firſt</hi> the debauching of the Nation, that the people being thereby the more <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to receive their impreſſions, they may by that means the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily compaſs their deſign; as Phyſitians, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not immediately maſter the preſent diſtemper of their Patient, are forc'd many times to divert it by art into ſome other <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> which they hope more eaſily to cure; ſink people into <hi>voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and then tell them of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> Pardons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby they may <hi>both</hi> keep their <hi>Dalilahs,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their ſins, and yet gain Heaven; and the news ſhall be exceeding <hi>welcome</hi> to their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nature. And then the down-right <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> he is at leaſt taken off from being an <hi>Enemy,</hi> if he be not a <hi>Friend;</hi> for why ſhould he trouble himſelf to preſerve any Religion, that <hi>laughs</hi> at all? But the ſtrict adherence to the <hi>Goſpel-precepts</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as it is a means naturally efficacious to obviate and obſtruct the endeavours of the Papiſts, ſo 'tis of all others moſt likely to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, by the bleſſing of God, which we may groundedly hope will attend it: nor need <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> to fear that their people will prove <hi>leſs obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> and ruleable, by their being more devoted to Religion; but may well hope the contrary, provided they will require nothing of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Religion; which certainly they need not, the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the <hi>bleſſed Jeſus</hi> containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inconſiſtent with any ſolid principle of <hi>Policy;</hi> the <hi>beſt Chriſtian</hi> is always the <hi>beſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> and for that very reaſon, the <hi>Papiſt</hi> is the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:52053:188"/>
               <hi>worſt.</hi> And ſince a main part of theſe Romiſh Traitors <hi>hopes</hi> is built on the <hi>diviſion</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, how much does it concern all the <hi>reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Princes and States</hi> to fortifie their Intereſt by moſt ſtrict <hi>Alliances,</hi> and a Cordial eſpouſing of the common Cauſe, wherein all their ſafeties and very ſubſiſtance is ſo nearly concern'd; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in their reſpective Dominions, if they will regard either the Adviſo's of Chriſtanity, or true <hi>Reaſon of State,</hi> thoſe that are of Authority in the Church, may finde cauſe to be very <hi>cautious</hi> of adminiſtring unneceſſary occaſions of <hi>Separation,</hi> to the weakneſs of their brethren; which may be, and frequently is done by theſe two means eſpecially.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By too ſtrict an impoſition of things in their own Nature <hi>indifferent.</hi> For though theſe things be left to the prudent ordering of each particular <hi>National Church,</hi> yet when through the weakneſs of many, they are become matter of Offence and <hi>Scandal,</hi> and ſo occaſions of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it ſeems that they then ceaſe to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and it would be no leſs contrary to <hi>Prudence</hi> than to Charity, to impoſe, or longer ſtrictly to require them; And repugnant to the Apoſtolical Doctrine, <hi>Rom. 8. 8. &amp; 9. But meat</hi> (and ſo of indifferent Ceremonies) <hi>commendeth us not to God: for neither if we eat, are we the better, neither if we eat not, are we the worſe.</hi> Whoſe practice was ſuitable, <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. 19. &amp;c. <hi>Though I be free from all men, yet have I made my ſelf ſervant unto all, that I might gain the more: to the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak; I am made all things to all men,</hi> (that is, I yeild to them in all Iawful and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:52053:188"/>
indifferent things) <hi>that by all means I might ſave ſome.</hi> Therefore in ſo dangerous a circumſtance as we are under, when it gives ſo great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to ſuch an Adverſary, who ſo ſtudiouſly and induſtriouſly endeavours our <hi>diviſions,</hi> as a <hi>peeviſh</hi> and obſtinate Supercilious or Phariſaical <hi>Separation</hi> for trifles is no way warrantable, ſo neither can it be approved as conſiſtent with Chriſtian <hi>Prudence,</hi> and that care of the <hi>Flock</hi> which all faithful <hi>Over-ſeers</hi> and Paſtors ought to have, not to allow at leaſt ſuch liberty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention in ſuch things, as is neceſſary to the preſervation of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>Scandalous coldneſs</hi> in Religion, and worldly-mindedneſs, eſpecially in the Clergy. There is ſcarce any more general or <hi>powerful</hi> (though not always juſt) occaſion of Separation and <hi>Faction</hi> than <hi>this,</hi> eſpecially with devout peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and beſt inclin'd: for men ſeldome judge by any other rule in this caſe, than that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,—<hi>By their fruits ye ſhall know them,</hi> Mat. 9. 16. and are therefore moſt apt to judge of the truth of a Miniſters Doctrine, by the virtue or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of his actions. There is a certain authority of <hi>Reputation</hi> or Reverence, which ought always to accompany <hi>authority of Juriſdiction,</hi> and is in truth the more <hi>charming</hi> and powerful of the two, to retain people in a ſweet, voluntary, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more <hi>durable</hi> and perfect obedience. And <hi>this</hi> being loſt, the <hi>other,</hi> which alone holds them onely in a kind of violent and <hi>forced,</hi> not natural and genuine obedience, is very difficult to be managed, liable to be caſt off, and ſeldome of long duration. Now the <hi>former,</hi> which is the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:52053:189"/>
proper authority of the Church and <hi>Clergy,</hi> (for what is <hi>Coercive,</hi> more than bare Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is in truth a branch of <hi>Civil authority)</hi> can never be acquired or retained by onely abſtaining from thoſe we call <hi>Scandalous ſins,</hi> but by the conſtant, ſincere, and vigorous exerciſe of thoſe great Evangelical Virtues,—<hi>Humility, Meekneſs, Heavenly-mindedneſs, Contempt of the World, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in Religion, ardent Love of God, and Zealous</hi> endeavours for the ſalvation of <hi>Souls;</hi> for without theſe, the obſervance of the rules onely of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>moral</hi> vertues, may well be counted <hi>Heathen Civility,</hi> rather than <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and attributed as much to humane prudence as to Religion. To ſee men <hi>fiery zealous</hi> for the accidents and formalities of Religion, and <hi>cold</hi> in the practice of theſe great eſſentials and ſubſtantial parts, the very <hi>buſineſs of Chriſtianity;</hi> to hear them make <hi>lofty Harangues,</hi> and cry up <hi>Morality,</hi> as if there were nothing more in Religion than that, and yet in the Practice even of that to come <hi>ſhort</hi> of the very <hi>Heathen Moraliſts,</hi> To ſee men prophanely turn the ſacred Profeſſion into a kind of <hi>Trade,</hi> to deſign it, and apply themſelves to it, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than others do to common <hi>Secular</hi> Imploys, as a means onely to get a <hi>Lively-hood,</hi> Honour and Preferment in the world; and when they have (perhaps by <hi>indirect</hi> means too) heaped <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> upon <hi>Living,</hi> and one Preferment on another, they accordingly uſe, indeed <hi>abuſe</hi> the <hi>Charity of our Anceſtors,</hi> and the Revenues of the Church, in ſuch indulgence to Pride, Oſtentation, volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous or delicious Living, as would not be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in any <hi>religious Laiety;</hi> without any regard
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:52053:189"/>
to works of <hi>Charity,</hi> and the promotion of <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> as all good Chriſtians according to their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and thoſe under <hi>their Character</hi> more eſpecially are obliged unto. Theſe things (if any ſuch things are, or ſhould happen to be in practiſe) would more effectually weaken the proper authority, and impair the reverence that ſhould attend the Clergy, much more dangerouſly than any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical <hi>Canons</hi> or Civil Laws can eſtabliſh it. The truth whereof is apparent from the <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of thoſe, who take a contrary courſe, for thanks be to God we are not without ſome, (I hope <hi>many)</hi> who by their good Imployment not onely of their Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Revenues,</hi> but alſo of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Fortunes, their virtuous <hi>pious Lives,</hi> Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical <hi>Gravity,</hi> and fervent ſound profitable Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prevail with many that were turning aſide into <hi>corners,</hi> to become their auditors, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true <hi>Manna</hi> conſtantly at home, leave off the unneceſſary deſires of ſtragling for it abroad: and were there but ſome effectual courſe taken, for more ſuch <hi>Lights</hi> to be ſet up in the more conſpicuous <hi>Candleſticks</hi> of the Church, we ſhould probably find it the beſt expedient, both to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the <hi>Ignes fatui</hi> of Fanaticiſm, and keep out the Roman <hi>Foggs</hi> from over-whelming us.</p>

Religion, and with it of our <hi>Lives, Liberties,</hi> Fortunes, and all that is dear unto us, as theſe Sons of <hi>Perdition</hi> are to deſtroy them.

            <p n="4">4. There are a ſort of lukewarm <hi>Laodiceans</hi>

amongſt us, indifferent Proteſtants, of <hi>Gallio</hi>'s temper, <hi>who cared for none of theſe things,</hi> that regard not though the <hi>Ship</hi> they ſail in periſh, provided they may but ſave their <hi>private Fortunes,</hi> and eſcape in <hi>the Long-boat</hi> of an early compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; who would not only quit the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> for the <hi>Maſs-</hi>book, but exchange their <hi>Bible</hi> for the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> if required by the frowns of Power.

And why may we not be ſaved in that Church as well as our Forefathers? And what need all this buſsle then to oppoſe them? Why ſhould we venture our Lives or Eſtates and incur the Diſpleaſure of a Popiſh Succeſſor, if ſo (which God avert) it ſhould happen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To theſe people it were vain to urge any Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations from Divinity; for indeed they are a ſort of quiet Atheiſts, and profeſs Religion, this or that, any, or none, according as 'tis the Mode or Cuſtome of the Countrey or Times they live in; yet even theſe, as politick as they would be counted, will finde themſelves exceedingly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in their meaſures, if Popery prevail. For though it pretend to be a Religion, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Salvation of Souls, yet indeed, as 'tis now managed, 'tis nothing but a Plot upon the Purſe, and Trick to cheat its Votaries, and enſlave people to the Pride and Avarice of the Clergy; wherein theſe crouching Sons of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> theſe

truckling Renegado's muſt bear as heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens as any. And therefore we ſhall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to them one Story, which perhaps they will like the better, becauſe we have it from <hi>Platina,</hi> a Popiſh Authour, who tells us, That when the Citizens of <hi>Papia</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> were at Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, by reaſon of the implacable Faction and Feud between the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and the <hi>Gibellines,</hi> two powerful and numerous Families or Tribes always at mortal Enmity with each other, the <hi>Gibellines</hi> procured a Favourer of theirs, called <hi>Facinus Cajus,</hi> to aſſiſt them; Covenanting that he ſhould have the Goods of the <hi>Guelphs</hi> for his labour: But he being once come into the City, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, ſpared the Goods of neither of them. Whereupon the <hi>Guelphs</hi> complain'd, ſaying, That their Goods alſo were ſpoiled. But all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs they could get, was this ſmart anſwer from him, <hi>That true it was they themſelves were</hi> Gibel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, <hi>but their Goods were</hi> Guelphs. <hi>Mutato nomine, de te.</hi> Give us leave, in like manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand to tell all ſuch pretended Proteſtants, as ſhall by active <hi>ſtickling,</hi> or paſſive <hi>Cowardice</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the betraying of their Religion and Country, and joyn though with never ſo great hypocriſie, with the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> hoping thereby to ſave their own ſtakes, and that all the Fury ſhall fall upon others, this will be their very caſe. They <hi>themſelves</hi> may perhaps be <hi>good Catholicks,</hi> but their <hi>eſtates</hi> ſhall certainly be <hi>Hereticks</hi> ſtill, and liable to make good the old Arrears now behinde-hand for above One Hundred years to Holy Church.</p>

               <p>In page the 30. he recites the <hi>methods</hi> to be uſed for reſtoring Popery in <hi>England,</hi> from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Contzen's</hi> printed directions for that purpoſe in his <hi>Politicks, l. 2. p.</hi> 16, 17; and 18. in theſe words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That things be carried on by <hi>ſlow,</hi> but ſure Proceedings, as a Muſician tunes his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by degrees: loſe no opportunity; but yet do not precipitate the work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let no Prince that is willing, <hi>deſpair;</hi> for it is an eaſie thing to change Religion. For when the common people are a while taken with <hi>Novelties</hi> and diverſities of Religion, they will ſit down and be aweary, and give up to their Rulers wills.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Doctors and leading Paſtors muſt be put out: if it may be, all at once: <hi>[ſure he means ſome Bartholomew-buſineſs]</hi> but if this cannot be,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:52053:195"/>
let it be by ſome and ſome. When the <hi>Leaders</hi> are down, all will ſubmit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The purpoſe of changing Religion, and extirpating <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> muſt be concealed: not but that ſome of the <hi>wiſer</hi> ſort <hi>[Coleman and a few more]</hi> may know, but the people muſt not, leſt it ſhould move them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some muſt be ſuborn'd to beg importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Prince for <hi>liberty</hi> to exerciſe their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that with many and gentle words, that ſo the people may think the Prince is <hi>not enclined</hi> to novelty, but onely to lenity, and to a tenderneſs for <hi>tender conſciences,</hi> and that he doth it not as from himſelf. For the vulgar uſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Prince that cannot deny the Subjects their deſires, though they are ſuch as were fit to be denied.</p>
               <p n="6">6. One or two Churches onely muſt be deſired at firſt, <hi>[for the exerciſe of Popery, he means]</hi> as being ſo ſmall a matter, that the people will not much regard.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When the zeal of Profeſſors begins to riſe againſt the <hi>Change,</hi> they are to be pacified by admitting both <hi>Parties</hi> to a <hi>Conference</hi> before the Governours.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Let there be a Decree for <hi>Pacification,</hi> that one Party do not rail at the other, nor calumniate them. And ſo the <hi>Doctrines</hi> that are to be <hi>brought in,</hi> will have great <hi>advantage,</hi> when they are <hi>covered,</hi> and may not be <hi>contradicted,</hi> or ſo much as named: And ſo the Rulers will be thought to be onely lovers of <hi>Peace,</hi> and not to intend <hi>a change</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Next that, let there be ſome <hi>publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Let all this be done but on pretence that the ſeveral Parties may be <hi>joyned</hi> lovingly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Peace:</hi> And when the <hi>Miniſters</hi> refuſe this, let them be accuſed of <hi>Unpeaceableneſs,</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience</hi> againſt the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and not for their Religion.</p>
               <p>When it comes to the <hi>putting out of</hi> ſome Miniſters, and the People begin to <hi>Petition</hi> for them, let the matter be carried <hi>ſilently;</hi> and in the mean time, let the People be told, that it is becauſe thoſe Miniſters are <hi>heady, obſtinate</hi> men; that the people may be perſwaded that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are <hi>faulty,</hi> and have <hi>deſerved</hi> it, and may be put only to deſire Liberty for the <hi>more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> men.</p>
               <p n="11">11. When thus the People are <hi>deluded,</hi> and there is no danger of a <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> then turn the Miniſters out of the <hi>Churches,</hi> and put in thoſe that you would ſet up in their ſtead.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Then change the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> and tell all the <hi>Fellows</hi> and <hi>Scholars,</hi> that they ſhall hold their Places if they <hi>will turn,</hi> elſe not: many will change Religion with the <hi>Rulers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, he inſtanceth in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where a Prince pretended that all the Profeſſors and Miniſters places were void at the Death of his Predeceſſor, and he had the diſpoſal of them by Law. And the Change was there made (as he ſaith) by ſlow <hi>degrees:</hi> one or two Opinions of Religion quarrel'd at firſt; and ſo the people will think it but a ſmall matter to yeild in one or two Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and be eaſily brought to obey. At laſt, let
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:52053:196"/>
them fall to writing againſt each other; but be ſure let thoſe that have the Court-favour be cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up as Victors, and that the others are ignorant, and ſhamefully baffled.</p>
               <p n="13">13. To put out of <hi>Honours, Dignities,</hi> and <hi>publick Offices,</hi> all thoſe that are moſt <hi>adverſe to Popery:</hi> it is juſt that thoſe that hinder the <hi>ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the Common-wealth, ſhould be deprived of the <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> of the Common-wealth. If men are depoſed for heynous Crimes, why not for Blaſphemy and <hi>contempt of Truth? [you muſt believe the Jeſuite that this is the Proteſtant caſe.]</hi> If thoſe of a <hi>contrary Religion</hi> be left in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Power, they will be able to <hi>croſs the Prince</hi> in many things, and encourage the people of their <hi>own</hi> Religion.</p>

                  <p>The Papiſts, though ſo often baſtled, reſolve ſtill to play a new Game; and therefore on the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>January, John Gadbury,</hi> Priſoner for the Popiſh High-Treaſon, as we have before related, ſent to acquaint the Lords (appointed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for Examination) that he had ſomething to communicate to them: whereupon he was immediately ſent for; but (being perhaps not ſufficiently <hi>tutor'd)</hi> he then excuſed himſelf that he did not expect to be ſo <hi>ſuddenly</hi> called, and therefore deſired further <hi>time;</hi> whereupon he was ordered to put what he had to ſay into <hi>writing.</hi> And on the 9th of <hi>January</hi> being again examined before His Majeſty, did declare, <hi>That about</hi> September <hi>laſt, Sir</hi> Robert Peyton <hi>deſiring to be reconciled to the Intereſts of his Majeſty and the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:52053:201"/>
Duke of</hi> York, Gadbury <hi>acquainted Mrs.</hi> Celier <hi>the Midwife therewith, between whom and Sir</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert <hi>there grew an intimate Correſpondence; and that Sir</hi> R. Peyton <hi>did then ſay, he ſhould hereby loſe a conſiderable Intereſt, which could put him in the Head of 20000 men in two days time, and that could raiſe 60000 men in little more than a Week: And that theſe people, in caſe the King had died the laſt Summer at</hi> Windſor, <hi>would have ſeized</hi> the Tower, Dover-Caſtle, <hi>&amp;c. ſecured the Mayor of</hi> London, <hi>and oppoſed all that ſhould have proclaimed the Duke of</hi> York.—Mrs. <hi>Celier</hi> (though both pretended to be kept <hi>cloſe</hi> Priſoners, he in the <hi>Gatehouſe,</hi> and ſhe in <hi>Newgate,</hi> yet being now brought up) confirmed in ſubſtance <hi>the ſame Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> only adding, that they were to <hi>murder</hi> the Lord Mayor, deſtroy all Epiſcopiſts, ſet up <hi>a Commonwealth;</hi> and to that purpoſe allowed Penſions to ſeveral old Officers of the late Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Army. All theſe things and words Sir <hi>R. Peyton</hi> abſolutely denied; yet was by Warrant from the Council committed to the Tower for High-Treaſon, for Conſpiring to raiſe Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, a <hi>cloſe</hi> Priſoner; (though the Five Popiſh Lords, directly charged upon Oath, and Impeach'd by Parliament for a Deſigne to Murder the King and Subvert the Government, were admitted mutual Converſe, and free acceſs of Viſitants, yet) no body without ſpecial War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant being admitted to viſit him.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, both <hi>Gadbury</hi> &amp; <hi>Celier</hi> were fluſht with hopes of procuring their reſpective Pardons; but that being ſtopt upon divers weighty Conſiderations by a moſt judicious and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:52053:202"/>
Honorable Peer, <hi>Gadbury</hi> began to relent, and on the 14th diſcovered the whole contrivance of this <hi>Sham-Plot;</hi> that he knew no harm by Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> but was drawn in by Mrs. <hi>Celier,</hi> &amp;c. to teſtifie ſuch things againſt him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereupon there was an Order that <hi>Celier</hi> ſhould be kept cloſe Priſoner, and 'tis ſuppoſed <hi>Gadbury</hi> will at laſt make a full honeſt Diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>On Saturday the 17th of <hi>January,</hi> at the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> were Arraigned eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as Popiſh Prieſts, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>Of whom the firſt, that is, Mr. <hi>Kemiſh,</hi> being very antient and ſickly, was upon his humble requeſt after Arraignment, referred to another time for Tryal, when he might be better able to make his defence.</p>
                  <p>The other ſeven being ſeverally tryed, the chief Witneſſes that gave Evidence againſt them, were Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dangerfield.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The particulars of their reſpective Charge and Defence, are too tedious here to be ſet forth: the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:52053:202"/>
ſum was, that they were ſeverally proved by the Witneſſes (ſome ſpeaking as to ſome of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, others to others) to have ſaid <hi>Maſs,</hi> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated and adminiſtred the Euchariſt, and frequently performed ſuch Functions as no Lay-man in their Church is allowed to meddle with. Particularly, it was proved by Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield,</hi> that <hi>Anderſon,</hi> alias <hi>Mounſon,</hi> having <hi>ſcowr'd his Kettle,</hi> that is, took his Confeſſion, and given him Abſolution, and ordered him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament, which he did accordingly, did yet the ſame day perſwade him to endeavour to get ſome ſecrets out of <hi>Stroud,</hi> then a Priſoner with them in the <hi>Kings-bench,</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and to do it by drinking hard with <hi>Stroud:</hi> and the Witneſs ſeeming to be a little ſcrupulous of being drunk the ſame day he had Received, this holy Father ſaid he might venture without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; it was no harm if he were drunk, ſince he did it for the good of the Cauſe. The Defences made by them, were either ſilly, or elſe rather <hi>ſubtle</hi> than ſolid, alleadging that there was no way to convict them of being Prieſts, unleſs the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſaw them actually take Orders. Which if true, the Statute would be vain, and its whole force eluded. None of them had either ſo much zeal, as now to <hi>own himſelf a Prieſt</hi> (though one of them had confeſt it before to the Court, which he now denied) but rather all ſeeming to deny it, lying at catch with the Witneſſes words, and urging them to name the very days they heard them ſay Maſs, that they might by their Gang, prepared to affirm any thing, contradict them: Which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd evidently, in that <hi>Marſhal</hi> was not aſhamed
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:52053:203"/>
openly to declare, That let Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> name any <hi>time or place whatſoever, he would bring Witneſſes to diſprove him.</hi> This <hi>Marſhal</hi> was their great Orator, who made long Speeches, but to very little purpoſe; there being nothing of weight or matter in what he urged. <hi>Starkey</hi> was an Old man, that ſaid he had been <hi>a Major</hi> in the late King's Army; and 'twas proved that he had boaſted, that he had ſaid Maſs twenty and twenty times in that Army; and of late the Witneſſes had divers times and at ſeveral places heard him <hi>ſay Maſs,</hi> &amp;c. After a full and fair Tryal, the Jury brought in Six <hi>Guilty;</hi> who thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Sentence of Death. But <hi>Lumſdel,</hi> being a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> was left upon a ſpecial Verdict, it being doubted whether he were within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the 27 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. on which they were Indicted: So that he muſt lye, till the <hi>Judges</hi> have determined that Point.</p>
