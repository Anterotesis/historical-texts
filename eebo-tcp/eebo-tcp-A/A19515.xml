            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is profitable, and considering the
times we now liue in, very necessarie,
that the liues &amp; deaths of Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
seruants, (such as was this worthy
Person) be registred, and commended
to Posteritie (as well for examples to
the liuing, that they may know how to walke in a good
Conscience before God, as to preserue the fame of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
after their death, from the reprochful detractions
of the wicked. And this last, charitie towards our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
departed, requires of vs then especially, when the
wrong done vnto their memories, tends to the discredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the seruice, wherein they were by God imployed
in the time of their life. For though it be true, that lyes
and calumnies can neuer long preuaile, and that Truth,
by some rightly called the Daughter of Time, will at last
breake forth, as the light, and shine as the noone day, to
the iustifying of them that haue feared the Lord, and
beene carefull to approue their courses vnto him: yet in
the meane while, preiudices may possesse the minds of
many not euill affected: and while they lacke better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
by mis-reports they may be made to thinke
and speake of persons and matters otherwise then they
should. Neither can we be excused, if wee shall keepe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb facs="tcp:9490:3"/>
and forbeare to giue witnesse vnto the Truth,
when peruerse men take such libertie, as we see, to vent
lies both by speech and writing, onely to confirme others
in wicked and rebelli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>us courses. This respect, albeit
there had been no other, is a sufficient reason for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of this Discourse; written by that faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of God, of himselfe, some two yeeres before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting,
and since found amongst his papers: for as
in his life there wanted not enemies to charge him with
many false imputations, whereof himselfe did often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine;
so yet after his death, when humanitie it selfe
might teach them not to disquiet the ashes of the dead,
they forbeare not to lay vpon him and the manner of his
death, false and foule aspersions, albeit no man, while he
liued, did walk in all his wayes with a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tter conscience;
nor any of the Saints of God did euer conclude his dayes
more peaceably, and with better Resolution.</p>
            <p>Concerning his life, which was not idle or fruitlesse,
as his writings already come forth, and others that
shortly will see the light, may sufficiently witnesse; wee
remit you to this Discourse penned by himselfe, as it
seemes, when he found his sicknes beginning, which put
an end to his dayes: And for his death, whereof there
were many witnesses, the forme and manner thereof we
haue annexed, to stop the mouthes of vngodly men, and
giue all that feare the Lord, an example of dying, and
occasion of thankefulnes to Almighty God, who vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
so mercifully to rid his seruant of the miseries of
this life, and receiue him to his ioy, and that place of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie,
where we are perswaded now he rests.</p>

            <head>This Discourse was penned by himselfe
on <date>the first of Ianuary. 1616.</date>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y life hath not beene such, that I
am ashamed to liue longer, if my
gracious God haue any further
seruice to employ mee withall in
his Church: Neither am I so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to liue; but yet I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and heartily content to remoue out of this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that I may be with my Lord, freed from these
restlesse tentations, which on euery side haue sore
pressed, but, through his grace, neuer oppressed me.</p>
            <p>In my younger yeeres I was trained vp with the
wrestlings of God; from my youth I haue borne
his yoke, exercised with his terrours; yet, so that
many a time his sweet consolations haue refreshed
<pb facs="tcp:9490:4"/>
my soule. In my old days men haue risen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, but without a cause: betwixt these two
my dayes are spent: my Witnesse is in heauen, Hee
knoweth that in euery state of life, my heart was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
toward the Lord; it was my ioy to serue him,
and my griefe when I sinned against him.</p>
            <p>Being of the age of eight yeere old, about Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
I was carried by my father from <hi>Edenborough</hi>
to Dunbar Schoole, I could not write, nor read any
Latine then. I tarried there till my twelft yeere; euen
then did the Lord beginne to acquaint my heart
to seek him: we went two &amp; two to the Church; he
put then this prayer in my heart euery day in the
way, Lord, bow mine care, that I may heare thy
Word. In the Schoole many a time haue I turned
on my face, seeking from God knowledge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
In the space of foure yeeres and lesse,
I learned the whole course of Grammar, wherein
God made me to prosper, not inferiour to others in
the company with me.</p>
            <p>From thence I was called by my Parents to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denborugh,</hi>
and in the entry of my 13. yeere, sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to <hi>S. Andrewes,</hi> and passed in course of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
there in the 16. yeere: there made I not such
progresse in knowledge, as I had done before in my
other Studies, either mine age not being capable of
it, or my wise and mercifull Father not thinking it
expedient for me; yet euen there was the seede of
grace still working in me, inclining me to a carefull
hearing and penning of Sermons, and Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
lessons, as I could haue occasion to heare them.
<pb facs="tcp:9490:4"/>
And heere Satan working in corrupt nature, sought
many a time to trap mee in his snares, intending in
my young yeeres to giue mee that wound, that
night haue beene a marke of shame to me in my
old age, when the Lord should call mee to doe his
Worke: but as on the one part I felt my weakenesse
compared with the strength of corrupt nature; so
though then I could not discerne it, afterward I had
proofe it was the Lords preuenting mercy, that kept
me from being an offence vnto his Church. It is
his mercy that he pardoned the vanities and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of my youth, and his mercy also that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
me in all my life, from any that could make
me a shame to his Saints, or a scorne and reproach
to his enemies.</p>
            <p>Hauing passed my course in <hi>S. Andrewes</hi> at the
age of sixteene yeeres, I returned to my Parents in
Edenborough, I was pressed by them to enter into
sundry sorts of life I liked not; for my heart still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to the study of holy Scriptures: wherevpon I
resolued to goe into <hi>England,</hi> where I euidently
perceiued the Lord going before mee, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for me at <hi>Hoddesdon,</hi> within eighteene mile of
London, my meane portion which I had being all
spent (I speake it to his glory that cared for me:)
in that same place, that same day was I desired by
our kind countriman Master <hi>Guthrie,</hi> to helpe him
in the teaching of a Schoole; with whom I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
some three quarters of a yeere, but after did
the Lord lead me further: for hauing occasion to
goe to London, without my knowledge, or any
<pb facs="tcp:9490:5"/>
suite of mine, I was called to the seruice of a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Diuine Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> vnto the which with
good will of Mr. <hi>Guthrie</hi> I entred, and there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
about a yeere and a halfe, dayly exercised vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him in the studie of Theologie. To him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God, and some other learned Diuines of that
City, do I acknowledge my selfe bound for these
beginnings of knowledge I then receiued.</p>
            <p>In the nineteenth yeere of my life, I returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> where hauing the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
occasion to bee with my elder Brother, then
one of the Ministers of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> I still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the same study, and at length was required to
giue a proofe of my gift priuately, which I did in
the new Church in presence of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert Pont,</hi>
and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert Rollock,</hi> with sundry others of the
Ministery: then after that, I was required to teach
publikely in the new Church on a Sabbath in the
afternoone. And the next weeke I was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a Fast, on a Thursday in the afternoone. Thus did
the Lord traine me vp, and these were the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of my Ministery, which I recount to the praise
of his grace, who counted me faithfull, and put me
in his seruice.</p>
            <p>A little after that, in the beginning of my
twentieth yeere, there ensued a generall Assembly
of the Church at <hi>Edenborough</hi> &amp; by their authority
wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> I sent out and appointed Pastor of <hi>Bothkenner</hi>
in Stirling Shire, for that Church had beene deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
euer since the reformation, and the people had
<pb facs="tcp:9490:5"/>
giuen in their supplication to the Assembly for a
Pastor. This calling of God and his Church I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
and went vnto them, where I found the
desolation so great, that except the walls, which
were ruinous also, neither dore, nor window, nor
seat, nor Pulpit, nor any part of a roofe was there
at all; yet pleased it God to giue such a blessing to
the Ministry of his Word, that their hearts thereby
were stirred vp cheerefully to build the Lords
House, which most willingly they fully resolued
within halfe a yeere, not content to build their own
part of the House, but the Quire also, which of due
should haue beene done by the Parson: there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
heere no letters of homing nor other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsitories:
neither content to haue built it onely,
they adorned it within and without it, not inferiour
to any other Church of such quality round about
it. This was my first externall seale, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of my calling to the Ministery.</p>
            <p>In this seruice I remained seuen or eight yeeres,
subiect to great bodily infirmities, by reason of
the weakenesse of the Soyle in Winter, and the
vnwholesome waters thereof. And heere did the
Lord first begin to acquaint me with his terrours,
and the inward exercises of sundry sorts of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
so that betweene these two, my life was almost
wasted with heauinesse; yet I blesse the Lord for it,
it was vnto me like the wildernesse of <hi>Midian</hi> to
<hi>Moses,</hi> a Schoole of tentation, whereby I learned
dayly more and more to know Christ Iesus, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
some store of knowledge thereby, inward
<pb facs="tcp:9490:6"/>
exercises, and outward studies, which the Lord
afterward called me to giue out in more publik pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in his Church, for the necessity of increasing,
disease forcing me to bethinke of a transportation,
the purpose of my mind was to another Church
vnplanted in the South, some 8. mile from <hi>Edenbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi>
but the Lord still continued his calling, and
drew mee another way Northward: for at the
same time, there interuented a generall Assembly
of the Church at <hi>Perth:</hi> there was I nominated,
and with consent of the Assembly and people was
I written for to that Ministery, as the letters of
both, sent to me out of <hi>Perth,</hi> with my deare Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Patrick Simson,</hi> yet extant do beare. Thus
did the Lord cleare my way before me, and leade
me there, where I thought neuer to haue gone; yet
two or three dayes before, did the Lord giue me
some signification of it, but I vnderstood it not, till
the euent did teach me: for in my thoughts in the
night, there seemed a man to lead me by the hand
to a little pleasant City, in a plaine valley on a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
side, hauing some bankes lying at the shoare
thereof (as indeede it had the first time, that after
this I was brought to it, such a sight got I of it, in
that vision, as afterward I saw with my eyes) hee
led me a long time vp and downe the streetes of
that Towne from one to another, at length carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me ouer the water to an hill, and led me vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, by many turnings and windings from one
earth to another, very neere vnto the top thereof.
Then did I awake, my face looking to the South-west.
<pb facs="tcp:9490:6"/>
This made such an impression in my minde
as after that I could neuer get forgotten. Let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
heere impute to me, the superstition either of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
or Anabaptists. I know, there is no reuelation
now of doctrine, or new article of faith, to be sought
out in dreames. The Lord hath spoken once for all
now vnto vs by his Sonne in the Word; but that
the liuing Lord who sleepes not, can giue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
to the soules of his seruants, when their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are sleeping, no man acquainted with his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
I trust will deny it.</p>
            <p>After this, three or foure dayes, as I said, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Patrick Simson</hi> from the generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at <hi>Perth,</hi> to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and deliuered me Letters
from the Assembly and the towne, containing my
calling to that Ministerie. The towne shortly after
sent their Commissioners, to transport my selfe and
my Family. There I continued doing the worke
of God, for the full space of nineteene yeeres. How
I did carry my selfe in my open conuersation, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
amongst them not as one separate from
them, but mixed my selfe in all their fellowships, as
a comfort to the best, and a wound to the worst
inclined sort, this Age will not want louing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to record it. My diligence in like manner in
the Ministerie, not onely on the ordinarie dayes,
but on others, which I voluntarily chose thrice
a weeke in the euening: to wit, Wednesday, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and Saturday, for a preparation to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
(for these dayes they had no preaching in the
morning;) It would haue done a Christian heart
<pb facs="tcp:9490:7"/>
good, to haue seene those glorious and ioyfull As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
to haue heard the zealous cryings to
God among that people with sighings &amp; teares,
melting hearts and mourning eyes. I speake the
truth in modestie, and not all the truth. It is not
vaine-glorying, I abhorre that; not I, but his grace
in me. Why shall it offend any man, that I eate
the fruit of my labour, and that my conscience
this day enioyes the comfort of my former pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes,
and fidelitie? My witnesse is in he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>uen, that
the loue of Iesus and his People, made continuall
preaching my pleasure, and I had no such ioy, as
in doing his worke. Some witnesses also I want
not to remaine: For albeit my charge was to teach
fiue times in the weeke, yet this was more, that I
penned thereafter, whatsoeuer I preached, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
some are already extant, others, by Gods
grace, if the Lord spare my dayes, shall come in
their time. And in outward things, what care I
had to see the House of God there honoured, the
welfare of that people euery way, there are monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
standing to witnes for me, when I am dead.</p>
            <p>All this time, except some little intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and breathing times, did the LORD still
exercise mee with inward tentations. O what
a vicissitude of estates! O what a varietie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates!
It were tedious here to set them downe
all, as they were done and fought: but this
I must say, the end of all and euery one of
them were vnspeakeable ioy. And once for all, in
greatest extremitie of horrour, and anguish of
<pb facs="tcp:9490:7"/>
Spirit, when I had vtterly giuen ouer, and looked
for nothing but confusion, suddenly did there
shine (in the very twinckling of an eye) the bright
and lightsome countenance of God proclaiming
peace, and confirming peace with inuincible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
O what a change was there in a moment?
The silly soule that was euen now at the brinke of
the pit, looking for nothing, but to be swallowed
vp, was instantly raised vp to Heauen, to haue
ioyfull fellowship with God in Christ Iesus; and
from this day forth my soule was neuer troubled
with such extremitie of terrours. This confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was giuen me on a Saturday in the morning;
there found I the power of Religion, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of the Word: there was I touched with
such liuely sense of a diuinitie, and power of the
Godhead, in mercy reconciled with man, &amp; with
me in Christ, as I trust, my soule shall neuer forget:
Glory, glory, glory be to the ioyfull Deliuerer of
my soule out of all aduersities for euer.</p>
            <p>In the middest of these wrestlings with God, all
this time wanted I not combates with wicked
men, like those Beasts at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> with whom Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> did fight. All the time of my residens yeere
continued this battell; as one left off, another still
renewing the battell: but the greatnes of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
conflicts made me regard lightly all their
outward contradictions, and I esteemed them but
like the bitings of a Flea. I resolued with my selfe,
It was no maruell to see Satan stirre vp his
wicked instruments to disquies mee, since I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<pb facs="tcp:9490:8"/>
my selfe a disquieter of him, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
yea my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fort was, that I had neuer a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
with any of them but for their sinnes:
God knowes I loued their persons and estates;
therefore did the Lord assist me, the power of his
Word hammering downe their pride, they were
al of them by course brought to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their sinnes.</p>
            <p>But at length, as God turned the heart of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
and his people from the Israelites, when the
time came that hee would haue them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
out of Egypt: so by little and little did the
zeale and loue of the most of this people, at least,
in my sense, fall away; so that at last, my battell was
not with such as were like the Publicans and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
(for these now were turned my fauourers and
comforters,) but with such as seemed before Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticiars,
I meane, vnrebukeable men for outward
offences: These men found I stuffed with such
pride, selfe-conceit, disdaine, and intolerable
contempt, as carried them further fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> their dutie,
then any of the former: yea, such as aboue others
should haue beene my comforters, were my cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers:
That I had cause to say with <hi>Micah,</hi> The best
of them are Bryers. But I trust it repents them
ere now: And therefore pray I God not to lay
it to their charge. I will haue none of my words
extended to that handfull there, which truely
scare the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now about this time God had opened to me
a doore, and called mee to the charge of the
<pb facs="tcp:9490:8"/>
Churches in <hi>Galloway,</hi> in the South-west part of
this Kingdom: for being named with others, by the
generall Assembly of such as they thought meet
to be preferred to the Episcopall dignitie (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I euer acknowledged my selfe not worthy) and
recommended by the Fathers of our Church; it
was his Maiesties pleasure to present mee to that
Benefice, due to the office wherevnto the Church
had called me. God knowes, this was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my knowledge, or seeking, directly or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For I could haue been contented all my dayes
with a priuate life, resolued to giue honour and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
in God to such as were called to these
places; after that once it was established by order
in our Church, and I had considered the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes,
antiquitie, and necessitie of it among vs.</p>
            <p>Here was I neither guiltie of Ambition, not of
any precipitate embracing of it; for betweene the
date of his Ma: presentation, and my acceptation,
there interuened eighteene weekes.</p>
            <p>Yet as the Calling to this Worke was greater,
then any other whereto I had been led before, so
greatest opposition was there made vnto mee by
men, whose lying Libels, and carnall contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
forced me to spend more time vnprofitably,
then I had done before since my entry to the
Ministerie. The Lord forgiue them, and me also
where, in the maner of my answering, I haue been
sharper then became Christian meeknes. For as
to the matter it selfe vnfainedly I followed my
light, I esteeme it a lawfull, ancient, and necessarie
<pb facs="tcp:9490:9"/>
gouernment; I see not, nor haue not read of any
Church that wanted it before our time: Onely
the abuses of it by pride, tyranny and idlenes, haue
brought it in misliking. From these euils I pray
the Lord preserue his seruants, that now are, or
hereafter shall be called to those places; but there
is no reason why a thing good in it selfe, should
be condemned or reiected, for the euill of abuse:
for so no good thing at all should bee retained in
the Church. And in this Calling how I haue
walked, and what my care was to aduance the
Gospell there, I trust I shall not, nor yet doe want
witnesses.</p>
            <p>In this estate doe I now liue; my soule alway
in mine hand, ready to bee offered to my God;
where, or what kinde of death, God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for me, I know not: but sure I am, there can be
no euill death to him that liueth in Christ, nor
sodaine death to a Christian Pilgrime, who, as <hi>Iob</hi>
sayes, euery day waites for his change, yea, many
a day haue I sought it with teares, not out of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
distrust, or perturbation, but being weary of
sin, &amp; fearfull to fall into it. Concerning those who
haue beene my enemies without cause, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me with many wrongfull imputations, from
which my conscience cleares me, excusing me of
these things, loue of gaine, and glory, or such like
whereof they accused me: The Lord lay it not to
their charge. I go to my Father, &amp; wish his blessing
to them, to rectifie their iudgements, &amp; moderate
their affections with true pietie from faith &amp; loue.</p>

               <p>This faithfull Seruant of God, who from the
time of his entrie into the Ministerie had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
shewed himselfe diligent and painefull in
his Calling; notwithstanding that his Sicknes
grew dayly vpon him, was no way deficient in his
duties of ordinarie preaching, taking great paines
also to perfit his Worke vpon the Reuelation,
which he had begunne, and desired greatly to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
it before his dying. Besides which studies, the
griefe he conceiued for the backwardnes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
spirits, in giuing obedience to the Articles
concluded in the late Assembly, and ratified by
authoritie, to the great disturbance of the Peace
of the Church, which hee laboured carefully in
all his life to procure, did hasten him not a little
to his end. So as in the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi>
1619. his infirmitie increasing, hee was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to keepe at home, and not to goe any more
abroad: yet as his weaknesse did permit, hee
gaue himselfe to reuise his writings, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of his worldly affaires, that hee might
bee ready for his passage, which euery day hee
expected. And some ten dayes before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
hauing his minde freed of all earthly
businesse, to those that visited him, hee manifested
a great contentment hee had in his approching
death. The Wednesday before, which was the
tenth of <hi>February,</hi> The Bishops &amp; some other Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
beeing assembled at <hi>Edenborough</hi> for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="tcp:9490:10"/>
affaires of the Church, tooke occasion to
meete at his house because of his Sicknesse,
which hee tooke most kindly, and continued
with them that whole afternoone, giuing very
wholesome aduice in matters propounded, and
shewing himselfe as pleasant and iocund in spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
as euer before. Howbeit, euen then hee
signified to them that his death was drawing
neere, and declared his minde somewhat dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posedly,
concerning his Successor. The dayes
following, hee kept with all that came to visit
him in most holy and Diuine conferences, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a great willingnes of exchanging this life,
with that better. And vpon Munday which was
the fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> at one of the clocke in
the afternoone, feeling his strength and spirits
to decay, after hee had conceiued a most hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
prayer, in the company of those that were
by him, he desired to be laid in bed, (for the
dayes before he arose alwayes, and either wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
or sate in his Chamber:) which being done,
after he had againe commended himselfe most
deuoutly vnto Almightie God, he tooke some
quiet rest: after which he spake not many words,
but those that hee vttered shew his memory and
other senses to haue beene perfect, his tongue
onely failing him; and in this sort about seuen of
the clocke at night, he rendred his soule to God in
a most quiet and peaceable manner. His body
the seuenteenth of <hi>February</hi> was interred, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Churches in <hi>Europe.</hi> In <hi>France</hi> there most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Preachers giue the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>munion on that day, as
did also the ancient Primitiue Churches through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world, as testifieth S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his <hi>Epist.</hi>
118. 119. So did our own old Scottish Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
for 800. yeeres after Christ, before euer it was
polluted with Papistry, as I haue prooued in my
forenamed Conference; whoso likes to read it. But
(say they) wee haue no commandement in the
Word to doe it. For answer, Let them distinguish
betwixt that which is substantiall or reall, in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that which is circumstantiall or rituall. A
point substantiall, must haue an expresse warrant in
the Word commanding it: For that which is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiall
it is sufficient, if it bee not against the
Word, it being left to be ordained by Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
authoritie. As for example to preach in season
and out of season, is a substantiall point: For it, we
haue an expresse command in the Word: what
day of the weeke ordinary preaching should bee
beside the Sabbath, that is circumstantiall, and left
to the determination of the Church, who by the
same authoritie, that they may ordaine preaching
such a day of the weeke, may also ordain preaching
<pb facs="tcp:9490:14"/>
such a day of the moneth in a yeere. Againe, hee
that sinnes openly, shall be openly rebuked. This is
substantiall in Religion, and wee haue an expresse
command for it. But to set him on a Pillar three
dayes, or more, or fewer, is circumstantiall: such as
our Church, without doing wrong against the
Word of God, hath determined, I acknowledge
it to be a good order. And will any of these men
condemne it, because it is not an expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in the Word? <hi>Marriage is honorable among all
men;</hi> for man and woman to ioyne without Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
is Fornication: this is substantiall, and hath the
warrant of the Word: But that first they must bee
three dayes publikely proclaimed, that is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall,
done by the Church for good order,
which I acknowledge sufficient, because it is not
against the Word.</p>
               <p>Euill day, say they, was cast out of our Church:
For answere, what they call euill day, I know not:
but a day reputed for the day of Christs Natiuitie,
&amp; obserued for remembrance therof, that I know.
I find no Ecclesiasticall Law in all the books of our
Assembly standing to the contrary<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> But if it haue
been cast out, yet a thing not against the Word of
God, vpon good considerations may be brought
in againe, albeit it had been cast out. Instances of
this I might bring from the Church of <hi>Geneua.</hi>
One I bring from our owne; since Baptisme, not
vpon a preaching day was cast out by act and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and yet is now receiued againe: Why may
not preaching of Christs Natiuitie, Passion, Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb facs="tcp:9490:14"/>
Ascension, and sending of the holy Ghost
on such dayes be receiued againe, albeit it had bin
cast out? We were well, say they, before: what
needs this nouation? For answer, Conformity with
the ancient and recent reformed Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
it, except we will be singular. Beside this, the
question heere is betwixt a Prince and his People,
They will be nourished in their humors, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that a Christian Prince is also to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
who findes himselfe bound in conscience
to see duties in Religion performed: what is euill in
their eyes, seemeth good in his. And heere the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
falling betwixt their will &amp; his, about a matter
not against the Word of God, let any indifferent
man giue sentence who should be followed.</p>

Priuate I call it, in respect of the publike as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,

in respect of many Christians partaking it. Where
a man hath beene a reuerent hearer of the Word
in the publike Assembly, and a reuerent &amp; carefull
receiuer of the Sacrament there, if God suspend
him by sicknes from doing of that dutie, may wee
not sit beside him, and comfort him by the Word?
may we not pray together for him, and for our
selues, euen in a priuate Family? And why also may
we not giue to him, and take to our selues the
Seales of the Couenant of mercy? The particular

               <head>OF KNEELING AT THE
COMMVNION.</head>
               <p>THe hardest point of all, is Kneeling at the holy
Communion, which is the more misliked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was, and yet is abused by Papists, to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie:
that vile errour of transubstantiation, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of Bread, my soule abhorreth it. But it is
hard to condemne a thing lawfull in it selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath been abused: For what is so good, that
<pb facs="tcp:9490:15"/>
hath not or may not be abused? Shal not S. <hi>Paul</hi> bow
his knees to the Father of the whole Family in
Heauen and in Earth, God the Creator; because
Idolaters bow their knees to the Creature? he was
not so scrupulous. If I should condemne Sitting at
the Table, should doe wrong to my Mother the
Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> If I should condemne Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
I should doe wrong to that Sister Church of
<hi>France,</hi> which hath stood for the Truth to the
bloud. If I should condemne Kneeling, I should
do wrong to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> glorious with
many Crownes of Martyrdome, and many other
Churches also. I like well that modest iudgement
of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> who thinkes any of these, Sitting,
Standing or Kneeling, lawfull. Our Church hath
determined, that Kneeling seemes the most reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
forme, for receiuing so great a benefit: and the
rude gesture of many of our People, in many parts
of the Land, requires that they should be led to a
greater reuerence of that holy Mysterie, &amp; taught
that by humble Kneeling, wee shall at length bee
brought to a ioyful Sitting with Him for euer. But
here it will be obiected to mee<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that our Lord and
his Disciples sate at the Table. I answere; The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist
saith, that as He sate at the Table, he took
Bread, and gaue thankes. This seemeth to note the
time of the Institution; to wit, after hee had done
with the naturall and Paschall Supper, not the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture:
For why? S. <hi>Paul</hi> prescribing all that is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
in the Sacrament, makes no mention neither of
Sitting, Standing, nor Kneeling: Yet he sayes, <hi>What
<pb facs="tcp:9490:16"/>
I haue receiued of the Lord, that I deliuer to you.</hi> If
he receiued it, and deliuered it not, hee was not
faithfull. Which I abhorre to thinke. If he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
it not, then sure he receiued it not. This is
the soundest &amp; most safe course: It keepeth all the
reformed Churches free from doing against the
Word of God. For wee must thinke, that S. <hi>Paul</hi>
knew certainly the mind of Christ: such as are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious,</hi>
let them ponder this well, the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
I am not able to satisfie. If the expediency bee
set aside, and the question be only of the lawfulnes,
my Argument sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ds yet vnanswered. Whatsoeuer
spirituall benefit I may lawfully seeke on my knees
with Supplication, that same I may receiue lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon my knees with thanksgiuing. But I may
lawfully with supplication seeke saluation by Iesus
on my knees: Therefore I may lawfully receiue it
on my knees. They answere nothing, who say, I
may not kneele to an Idoll: For to Christ I kneele,
praising him when I receiue the holy Symbols, &amp;
exhibiting instruments of his Body &amp; Bloud: and
it is madnes either to make them Idols, as Papists
doe, or call them Idols, as Male contents doe.</p>
               <p>Great murmuring is now against Pastors, vvho
ply not their tongues to pleasure the humours of
people. God hath opened their mouthes to preach
his Gospel; woe will bee to them that open their
mouth to prattle against Pastors. Hee that rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
euill for good, euill shall neuer depart from
his house, saith <hi>Salomon, My sonne, feare God and the
King, and meddle not with the seditious:</hi> It is <hi>Salomons</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9490:16"/>
also. Let seditious Prattlers, or Libellers, whom
though I know, I spare to name, pause vpon this.
When vnthankfull <hi>Israel</hi> murmured against <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi> they both ran to the dore of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
and the Lord failed them neuer. Hee came
downe in the Cloud, to protect &amp; comfort them.
Let al the seruants of the Lord doe so, when an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
people renders them euill for good; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that which the Lord said to <hi>Ieremy</hi> 15.
19, 20. <hi>Let them returne to thee, returne not thou to

               <p>I haue opened my minde according to my light.
To the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that aske, Where was this light before? my
answere is, Remember what is said of our blessed
Lord, the Latchet of whose Shoo I am not worthy
to loose. <hi>He increased in wisedome, Luc.</hi> 2. 52. Shall
it then be an imputation to his silly, weake, vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

Such as are contentious, I leaue tumbling
in the tumultuous thoughts of their perturbed
minds, raging like the waues of the Sea, forming
and casting out their own dirt and shame. For me,
