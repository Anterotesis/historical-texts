            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Cheating Gallant: OR, COUNT <hi>BRION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ever did Men more affect an appearance of Honeſty than in our days, yet never was Age more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Cheats; they grow in all Countreys, each Sex and Condition produces new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and thoſe who Converſe in the World, quickly find, there are not ſubtler Knaves, or greater Maſters of Craft than ſome who are taken for the Simpleſt of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102171:8"/>
The Gallant I write of, was a <hi>Hero</hi> of this Make: The beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Pedegree, (being ſomewhat obſcure) is, That he was of the Race of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> and knew no Father, but a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Curat, whoſe Nephew he paſt for, though ſtrongly ſuſpected to be his Son; being ſo very like him, it gave cauſe to believe, that when he was Begot, the Curat had more than a finger in the Pye.</p>
            <p>The Curat in his younger days, had been taken for a Gameſter; having a Complexion and Mein, that diſcovered an inclination in him to labour no leſs for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, than the Salvation of his Flock: However, the great care he took of his Nephew, and the kindneſs he had for him, made Men (who judge according to Appearances) eaſily believe, The Curat had no ſmall intereſt in him.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102171:8"/>
And the rather, for that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the Revenue of the fat Benefice he had, was beſtow'd yearly on the Education of his Nephew <hi>John Le Brun,</hi> for ſo was his Name: And, as to his Qualities, he was handſom and witty; but from a Child, a little given to Couſening and Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>The good Inclinations of Youth muſt be Cultivated with continual Care to bring them to perfection; the ill, grow up of themſelves. Thus the hopeful Nephew did conſtantly exerciſe the patience of his good Uncle, by doing every day one ſhrewd turn or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and playing a thouſand wild pranks, attended with as many Complaints from the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; ſo that the Curat deſpaired at laſt of ever bringing him to Good. But <hi>John</hi> (at length) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102171:9"/>
about three and twenty years old, and moved by the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of his good Uncle, or growing more ſober with Age, was ſo far Reformed, as to give ſome hopes of Amendment. There was no more talk of his Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, no Complaints for his Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; not but that he continued as very a Rogue as before, but that he was grown up to the Wit of covering his Knavery, and concealing his Extravagances.</p>
            <p>The good Curat thought it the work of Heaven, and gave God thanks for the bleſſed Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>John,</hi> who knew himſelf a handſome Lad, was willing to try his Fortune in Gallantry: The Village he was born in, could not furniſh him with a Beauty ſuitable to his own; which, he thought, might expect a civil Reſpect from a Lady of greater Merit, than a

Countrey Girle could pretend to: And to compaſs his Deſign, he reſolved the Scene of his firſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, ſhould be a Caſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Lord of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: There he ſoon met with a Chamber-maid, who might ſerve very well for his firſt Eſſay in Gallantry; being a very pretty Wench, and of a very good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. He had no ſooner diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his paſſion to her, but he promiſed himſelf Succeſs. The plain Countrey Lovers, uſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very little Formality in their Amours; 'tis but telling one another they are in Love, and the buſineſs is done. But our Gallant had read Romances; and ſtrictly obſerving the Punctilios of Gallantry, made his Declaration in due time and place, and was kindly received by his excellent Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:102171:10"/>
               <hi>Diana,</hi> the Nymph I am ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of, was more honeſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, than thoſe of her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ordinarily are: Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maides in the Country, having not the Advantages incident to thoſe of the Town; who, in a ſhort time, become ſuch Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in the Myſteries of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that they quickly Commence Miſtreſſes of the Art. <hi>John Le Brun</hi> had the Dexterity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her, That his Paſſion was arrived to that height, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but her pitty cou'd ſecure him from preſent Death. The good-Natur'd Girle, who would have been troubled in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to ſee a young Man (who lov'd her ſo tenderly) dye for want of her help, eaſily reſolved to give him Eaſe. This Scene of Love was to be acted in a Garden; where, under pretence of eating
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102171:10"/>
Cherries, <hi>Diana</hi> took <hi>John</hi> with her to ſhake the Tree. <hi>I know very well</hi> (ſaid ſhe, with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Modeſty) <hi>that what I do here is contrary to my Duty, and a blemiſh to my Honour: But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of loſing you, or my ſelf, I find the Conſideration of my Life a great deal too light to be ballanced with yours: But I hope I ſhall have to do with a Man of Honour, and Honeſty, who will take care of my Reputation, and not abuſe me for that which Love forces me to in kindneſs to him.</hi> The Gallant, you may imagine, fail'd not on this occaſion to make uſe of the deepeſt Oaths, and the higheſt Proteſtations of Love and Fidelity, to ſtrengthen the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and ſettle the mind of ſo kind a Miſtreſs.</p>

Among all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, <hi>Diana</hi> made choyoe of the Lady of the Place, to be her on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Confident: But, though ſhe had ſingled her out from a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of others, ſhe daily Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſt with, ſhe did not think fit to truſt her with the Adventure of the Cherry-Tree; being ſo Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantique, that ſhe judged it not proper to be Communicated to any; but eſpecially, to her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</p>
            <p>The Lady was Handſome, and very Inclinable: and to cover

her Sins, had taken a Husband advanced in Years; who, warn'd by ſome Viſions concerning his Honour, had taken a Reſolution to quit the Town, and retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country; in hopes, by the benefit of that Aire, to be cured of the Head-ach, that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him in the Town.

This Lady being a very expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd Lover, was the firſt that diſcovered the Amour of the Chamber-Maid, and the Curat's Nephew, and was ſo far from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it, as ſome proud ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Miſtreſs would have done, that ſhe favour'd their Intrigues, by taking frequent Walks into the Garden, and the Fields; and making <hi>Diana</hi> partaker of that pleaſure, gave her the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of meeting <hi>John Le-Brun</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day, and took ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar delight to ſee theſe Country-Lovers Court and make Love; but made as if ſhe knew nothing of the buſineſs, nor took the leaſt notice of it to <hi>Diana.</hi> But the good natur'd Maid, thinking her ſelf obliged by theſe favours from her Miſtreſs, (to let her know ſomething) ſhe took the occaſion as they were ſitting under a Tree,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102171:14"/>
diſcourſing of Love, to diſcover to her a Secret of mighty impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (wherein ſhe pray'd her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) that the Curat's Nephew had a great paſſion for her, and that ſhe found her ſelf pretty well inclined, but apprehended ſome Conſequences which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext her mind, that ſhe knew not what to reſolve on. Her Miſtreſs ſmiling, and with an aire of kindneſs, laying her Arm over her Neck, deſired her to tell her truly if ſhe were gone no further. <hi>Diana</hi> bluſht, not knowing what Anſwer to make.</p>
            <p>The Miſtreſs taking advantage of the Confuſion of the Lover, told her ſhe had too good an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>John Le-Brun,</hi> to believe he had ſo long left her in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to doubt in this point; and that if ſhe would confeſs the truth, ſhe muſt acknowledge, ſhe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102171:15"/>
asked Counſel too late about that particular, that ſhe need not hide it from her, being already aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured ſhe Lov'd him, and willing to ſerve her in any thing for her advantage. So much Compleaſance, and ſo extraordinary Kindneſs from a Miſtreſs, in whoſe power it was to do very much for her, did ſo charm <hi>Diana,</hi> that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged her at the ſame time to ſpeak a little more freely of the affair: So that the Lady, who was very dextrous at pumping out Secrets, made her confeſs that what at firſt ſhe had term'd a bare inclination, was in truth a ſettled Paſſion. That if <hi>John</hi> Lov'd <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhe Lov'd him no leſs; and deſcending by degrees to matters of fact, they diſcours'd of ſome favours ſhe had not had the power to deny him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102171:15"/>
The pretty Maid (in the end) ingeniouſly confeſt they were come to ſome cloſe Familiarities of Love, but ſhe would take care he ſhould find it a hard matter to proceed any further, unleſs he would Marry her.</p>
            <p>The Miſtreſs, who had never deſcended to thoſe fondneſſes of Love, but where ſhe deſign'd to grant her Lover all he could wiſh, knew well enough what to think of the buſineſs, yet was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at that time to preſs that point any further, but had the Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to know the beginning and progreſs of the Amour, and fully informed her ſelf of the ſmalleſt trifles and fooleries which gave her a very pleaſant divertiſement, till at laſt ſhe perfectly learnt the whole ſtate of the affair, their Rendezvouz and places of Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to the very Concluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:102171:16"/>
The eaſie <hi>Diana</hi> knew not what a perſon ſhe had to deal with, and to whom ſhe had imparted her Secret. There is nothing whereof a Woman ought to be more diſtruſtful, than of another Woman, eſpecially in matters of Love; there being nothing in the World whereof a Woman is more jealous, than of the good Fortune of another. This was not the firſt time, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs became Rival to her Maid. The Lady was not only of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuſceptible Nature, but had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready caſt her Eyes on the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <hi>John Le Brun;</hi> who, for Handſomneſs and Wit, was (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Contradiction) the Flower of the Village. But the many Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſhe was to take, the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard ſhe was to run in truſting a Raw young Fellow, a meer No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in Love; and the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102171:16"/>
Watch of her Husband kept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her Actions, ſo ſtartled her Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that till then, they had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated (if not ſmother'd) the Tranſports of her Amorous Soul. But the Inclination this Gallant had entertain'd for a Chamber-Maid, had highly fomented in the Heart of the Miſtreſs thoſe Seeds of Rebellion, and Revolt from her Duty, long ſince im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted there. And the Story ſhe had newly heard of the ſtate of their Amour, made her abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolve to make uſe of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, for ſharing with her Maid in the Pleaſure ſhe had to ſee <hi>John Le Brun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may eaſily believe, the Lady deſign'd not to engage in the Conqueſt of her Chamber-Maids Gallant; but was very willing <hi>Diana</hi> ſhould have the Honour of it, allowing her Miſtreſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102171:17"/>
a ſhare in the uſe of it, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Nature, and no more: And Nature is commonly content with the Uſe, not troubling her ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Property.</p>
            <p>We have all our Infirmities; and thoſe of this Temper are the more pardonable, in that it is almoſt impoſſible to maſter them: and this paſſionate Lady was not diſpoſed to offer any Violence to her Inclinations. She thought of her Pleaſure, and the Joy that attends it, not troubling her ſelf with ſcruples and doubts; and had formed in her Mind a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Deſignes to obtain her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
            <p>John <hi>was lookt upon in the Caſtle, as</hi> Diana<hi>'s Servant; which gave the Lady a fair occaſion to laugh, to ſpeak, to walk with him when ſhe pleaſed, without any ſuſpition, if</hi> Diana <hi>were in</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:102171:17"/>
               <hi>Company. But the old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whether ſearing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of theſe two Lovers would ſet his Wife alonging, or that he was jealous of all the World, as of her, began to diſlike the great Familiarity and Freedom</hi> John <hi>uſed in his Houſe. He went to the Curate, and told him,</hi> It was pitty a young Man as his Nephew, who had ſo good Parts to make him uſeful in the Church, ſhould loſe his time as he did: And that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lookt upon as worthy to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in his Benefice, and be one day the Paſtor of his Flock, ſhould think of nothing but making of Love: That this proceeding did not edifye at all: That he muſt begin betimes to implant in him a Contempt of the World, and an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for Retyredneſs. In a word, that Prayer and Study ought to be the principal Buſineſs of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102171:18"/>
of ſo honeſt a Gentleman as he was: That he told him this as a Friend, and hoped his Advice would be well taken.</p>
            <p>This Sermon being ended, the Curate gave his Worſhip hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thanks for the Favour he did him, and his Nephew; and when time ſerved, both ſhould acknowledge it: But he knew well enough where his Worſhip was pinched. He had not kept his Jealouſie ſo cloſe, but the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate knew the Diſeaſe he was troubled with; and might very well judge, That his Nephew (Young and Handſom as he' was) could not ſpend his time ſo conſtantly in the Caſtle, without giveing him ſome Umbrage. However, he forgot not to give his Nephew a Lecture when he came home at Night; and to forbid him (on pain of his Diſpleaſure) to go any more to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102171:18"/>
the Caſtle, for Reaſons not to be made known at preſent; but received from ſo good a hand, there was no cauſe to ſear he that gave them could be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. <hi>John</hi> knew not what this meant; but meeting <hi>Diana</hi> on the Morrow (having watched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an Hour for an opportunity to ſpeak to him) ſhe told him the News, that clear'd all doubts: acquainting him, That her Maſter had charged her Miſtreſs, and her, to ſee him no more, nor take him along with them to walk; his Uncle having made it is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſearing his Nephews han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering after Women, might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him in his Vocation; and as for him, he was reſolv'd it ſhould not be ſaid, he was ſpoyl'd in his Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Le Brun</hi> was not a little aſtoniſht ſo ſee himſelf deprived
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102171:19"/>
in a moment, not only of the ſight and Converſation of his Miſtreſs, but of the lovely Company of his Lady; who had already diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome good Inclinations, which (cultivated with Care) promiſed him more Good than could be expected from the Love of a Chamber-maid. The Vanity of his Nature, and the good Opinion he had of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, made him apt to flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on any occaſion: and, as to this Lady, he had certainly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough for it: For, the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe expreſt for his Perſon, accompanyed with that obliging Behaviour ſhe ſeaſoned it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, gave him ground enough to hope for ſome Favour. But then, when he thought himſelf the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of Men, or (at leaſt) in a fair way to be ſo; he received the ſad News, which blaſted his Pretenſions, and made all his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102171:19"/>
Hopes vaniſh. You might have expected to find him Irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſwallowed up by Deſpair; and he had certainly been ſo; had not the ſimple <hi>Diana</hi> bid him not trouble himſelf for the matter; and told him, Her Miſtreſs, and ſhe, had thought of a way to ſee him; if not by Day as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſhould be at Night: That ſhe had for that purpoſe, been that Morning betimes with one of her Friends, a Lock-Smith, and carried him in Wax, the print of the two Keyes, to the Back-gate of the Caſtle; and that, before Night, ſhe would give him an account of them, if he would but take the pains to be at that Place about Nine in the Evening. The Spirits of our afflicted Gallant were not a little raiſed by the hopes ſhe gave him; and you may believe, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102171:20"/>
faithfully not to fail the Agſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>The poor Girle was in earneſt, and thought her ſelf extreamly obliged to her Miſtreſs; who all this while, laboured nothing more than to do her the worſt Office one Woman can do another in Love; which is, to rob her of her Lover. But it was her Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to ſee, that the Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her Miſtreſs expreſt for <hi>Johns</hi> miſfortune was too great, to be free from Suſpition. She had not made ſuch haſt to find the means to let him into her Houſe by Night, but that ſhe was Particularly and Perſonally concern'd. And it was apparent enough, that, running an equal Riſque in all Dangers with <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhe did in Juſtice expect to ſhare in her Pleaſures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102171:20"/>
The Lock-Smith made ready the Keys the ſame day; and was payd ſo nobly, as to oblige him to keep their Counſel. <hi>John</hi> was at the place of Rendezvouz at the Hour <hi>Diana</hi> had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, who was as punctual as he; and told him, All was well, and that ſhe juſt came from trying the Keyes; and that, at Eleven a Clock, when the Old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was a bed: He had no more to do, but come to the Back-gate, which ſhe would then open for him.</p>
            <p>This Gate opened to a back Stair to the Ladies Apartment, where the Gallant might attend without any danger: At Eleven a Clock he ſtood Centinel, as appointed, and was introduced. <hi>John,</hi> who perhaps was a little cloy'd with the eaſie Poſſeſſion of <hi>Diana,</hi> when he found her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102171:21"/>
lookt ſo kindly upon him; yet, raviſhed with the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, found the Fire within him kindled ſo ſtrongly at his being ſo near her in the Dark, with her Slippers under her Arms; that he could not ſtay till he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber, to let her know how much he loved her; but put off his Shoes, to find ſome other Warmth for his Feet.</p>
            <p>The Lady, who expected them, growing impatient at their ſtay, would needs go ſee what ſtopt their coming: She went to the Stair-head, without Shooes or Light; and hearing nothing of them, had a mind to go down to the Gate. The two Lovers were careful not to make a Noiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not well aſſured it was ſhe, or elſe to conceal from her the Trade they then drove. They ſcarce breathed; ſo that, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102171:21"/>
whom the ſpirit of Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty puſht on to her Ruin, in going down Stairs, unfortunately made a falſe Step, and tumbled over them down ſeveral Steps. And how little ſoever ſhe was beholding to Love for the Accident, ſhe was certainly much obliged to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, in that ſhe eſcaped ſo well from ſo dangerous a Fall. You may imagine, what a peck of Troubles <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> were now in: The Noyſe her Miſtreſs made in her Fall, was enough to raiſe all the Houſe, but that it was in a Lodging, a part from thoſe of the Servants: much more might it have awaked the good Man, where the greateſt Danger lay,  but he had the good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſleep very ſoundly; and, by good Luck, heard nothing at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102171:22"/>
The firſt thing <hi>John</hi> did, was to get to the Gate for fear of misfortune; and, almoſt at the bottom of the Stairs, he found the Unfortunate Lady; which, had he had a Candle, would doubtleſs have been a very rare ſight. <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> came to help her up the Staires, which ſhe had ſo nimbly gone down. She had happily ſaved her Face, which gave her ſome Comfort: but for the reſt, there was not a part of her Body but was ſenſible of her Fall.</p>
            <p>The Gallant, judging they had buſineſs enough for that Night, to apply Remedies for the Brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, without further uſe of him; with-drew ſoftly, and went his way Home: He had Newes at his Riſing, that the Lady was better; and that ſhe was not ſo ill, but ſhe deſired to ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that Night. He came the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102171:22"/>
ſame Hour to the Gate; which being opened, he reſolved not to loſe time with <hi>Diana</hi> on theſe unfortunate Staires, for fear of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ill Accident, but went ſtrait, where the Lady expected him: She had told her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band a fair ſtory of her Miſ-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; and made that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it, that ſhe obtain'd leave to lye alone for three or four Nights, in a Chamber near his. The good Man could not have imagin'd, that his Wife, in the Condition ſhe was in, could think of Love: But this Paſſion takes away the ſenſe of any other Affliction.</p>
            <p>John Le Brun <hi>was Conducted to the Chamber, where he found the fair Lady dreſſed in her Bed, like a Goddeſs: Some of the Servants were yet up; and</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na <hi>was ordered to hold them in talk, till they went to their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:102171:23"/>
               <hi>for fear they ſhould come and hearken. Unleſs you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Miſtreſs found out this ſleeveleſs Errand for</hi> Diana, <hi>that ſhe the while might have the Liberty, to ſpeak a Word in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate to the Curate's Nephew.</hi> Well, John, <hi>(ſaid ſhe, with a Smile, as ſoon as the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid was gone)</hi> you ſee what we do for you; We expoſe our ſelves to be talked of: We give our ſelves trouble for you: We almoſt kill our ſelves for you, and you (perhaps) haeve not the leaſt Senſe of it.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102171:23"/>
Morning, as ſoon as 'twas day, I burn'd with Impatience to hear Newes of you. Say what you pleaſe <hi>(Replyed ſhe)</hi> I will not believe you; you are a Diſſembler, and this is not the firſt day I knew you ſuch: But let that paſs. Do you know <hi>(ſaid ſhe, letting fall her Voyce, as if ſhe would have told him a Secret)</hi> that I have had a great Quarrel for the Love of you. For the Love of me, Madam, <hi>(ſaid he, much amazed at her Diſcourſe!)</hi> Yes <hi>(Replyed ſhe)</hi> for the Love of you: My Husband hath been told, that you were in Love with me; And further, that you were not hated. I, <hi>(ſaid</hi> John, <hi>with very great Humility)</hi> I Madam; ſhould I, the Nephew of your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, lift up my Eyes, and fix them on the Wife of his Lord? Ah Madam, if there were cauſe, I could eaſily juſtifie my ſelf: I know too
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102171:24"/>
well the Reſpect I owe you, Madam.—Reſpect <hi>(Replyed ſhe)</hi> is nothing in this Caſe; Poor Shepheards have been in Love with Queens, and Queens with Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards. You are Young, Handſom, and Witty; 'tis too well known. I am not ſatisfied with a Husband I was forted to Marry againſt my will: And the conſtant Reſort you have for ſome time had to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, was more than enough to raiſe a Jealouſie in the Parties concerned, you came upon deſign. But, Madam, <hi>(Reply'd the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, charm'd with this obliging Newes)</hi> 'tis very well known, I came for Love of <hi>Diana.</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> Alas poor innocent Soul! 'Tis eaſie to judge, a Youth ſuch as you, if at Liberty to make his Court where he pleas'd, would ſooner addreſs himſelf to me, than to her. I thank Heaven <hi>(added
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102171:24"/>
ſhe, bluſhing a little)</hi> you ſee, I want not what may render me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable; and what is ſuch a Girle good for, but to ſerve for a Colour when I am in place?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> had by this time an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger deſire to draw ſome advantage from this pleaſant Diſcourſe: Till now he ſtood in the Chamber, like a dutiful Vaſſal, in Preſence of his Lords Wife, his Hat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Arme, and at three or four Paces diſtance from the Bed: But the kind Lady was pleaſed to make him draw nearer, and ſit upon the Bed, that (as ſhe ſaid) ſhe might not be obliged to ſpeak ſo loud, for fear of awaking the good Man. The Door was ſhut, and no cauſe of Fear on his ſide; but rather on <hi>Diana</hi>'s, who might chance to be frighted at ſo much Familiarity between <hi>John,</hi> and her Miſtreſs; who, notwithſtanding,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102171:25"/>
never troubled her ſelf for it, knowing <hi>Diana</hi> could not return very quickly.</p>
            <p>John <hi>having taken his place at the Beds-Feet, after twice or thrice bidding, and abſolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands reiterated for doing ſo:</hi> And who, think you <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> hath done you this ill Office with my Husband? Alas Madam <hi>(an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he)</hi> how ſhould I know? There is no want of wicked Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World, and I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the Village, that envy my Happineſs. It would ſurprize you <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> to be told it is my Chamber-maid. Who <hi>Diana (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered</hi> John, <hi>aſtoniſht to hear it)?</hi> Ah Madam, it cannot be; I know her too well, to believe her capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch Treachery. Make not ſo much haſt <hi>(Replyed the Lady)</hi> to take her part: You have not, perhaps, more reaſon to defend her
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102171:25"/>
than I. Conſider if ever I had cauſe to ſuſpect her: She was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes my Confident; I truſted her with all my Secrets: And though I knew you frequented my Houſe for Love of her, I could not but let her underſtand, I loved your Wit, and took pleaſure in your Converſation. I did more; and, perhaps, was guilty of too much Imprudence, when I bid her aſſure you from me, that I had Kindneſs for you, and that you might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon me as your Friend: That I deſired very much to do for you, and advance you: That you could not want the thing I would not furniſh you with for asking: And that I would have you ſpeak to me freely. 'Had ſhe been your Friend, ſhe would not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from you the kind and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous thoughts I had for you: But I ſee well enough, 'twas her
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102171:26"/>
Jealouſie hindred her, and made her Reveal the Secret to ſome one of the Houſe; who, without doubt, hath told it my Husband. <hi>The Gallant, who clearly ſaw what this Diſcourſe tended to, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> I aſſure you Madam, ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did me the favour to acquaint me with theſe obliging Evidences of your Goodneſs; otherwiſe, I had not been now to thank you for them: and now, me-thinks, I begin to believe what you ſay. <hi>The Lady, Raviſh'd with Joy that</hi> John <hi>was of her mind, puſht on her Amorous Deſign; and made him abſolutely believe</hi> Diana <hi>guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of what ſhe was accuſed; and that the beſt way to revenge her, was, to make a Fool of her.</hi> I know <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> you love me: [John <hi>durſt not ſay other-wiſe]</hi> and, though you never told me ſo, I have perceived it by your Eyes:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102171:26"/>
But to make our beſt of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Diana</hi> muſt not know any thing I have told you; but uſe her as formerly, and you ſhall find you cannot be unhappy: To prove what I ſay, <hi>(added ſhe, ſhewing him a Purſe taken from under her Pillow)</hi> here are fifty Piſtols for you: Aſſure your ſelf, while you love me, and are diſcreet, you ſhall want for nothing. <hi>What Heart of the Temper of</hi> John<hi>'s, could have reſiſted ſuch a Favour? Never did a Miſtreſs in</hi> Romance <hi>acquit her ſelf better: Ladyes that dare not rely on their Charms of Beauty for Conqueſt, if they make uſe of this courſe, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want Lovers. The Gallant was ſo tranſported with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent received, that (forgetting the Reſpect due to the Lady) he embraced her Knees a thouſand times through the Bed-Cloaths.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102171:27"/>
She, out of Modeſty, would have put him off; but it was, that he might apply himſelf elſe-where. The Gallant, though naturally bold, durſt not at firſt venture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny farther: Yet he had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſteal a Kiſs, which he took, finding her ſo nigh him, that ſhe ſeem'd to offer it him.</hi> 'Tis enough <hi>(ſaid ſhe, with a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Voyce);</hi> However, do not think, though I give you the Liberty to ſee mee by Night, to be alone with me in my Chamber, and to ſit on my Bed without Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Danger, that I will grant you any more. John Le Brun <hi>was too Intelligent, not to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Meaning of theſe Words; But</hi> Diana <hi>coming in, interrupted the courſe of this ſweet Converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There paſt nothing more at that time worthy Relation: <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:102171:27"/>
retiring preſently after, ſo incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt poor <hi>Diana,</hi> he had not the Patience to Careſs her in the leaſt, taking leave at the Gate, whither ſhe accompanyed him to lock it. But how could he longer Love a Chamber-maid, which had given him at moſt, but ſome Knots of Ribband, and two or three Cravats, or ſome other Triſles of inconſiderable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; when he had ſound a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, who, for her firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, honoured him with a Purſe of fifty Piſtols.</p>
            <p>He had never been ſo Rich in his Life; nor could he take any reſt that Night, for thinking with what grace of Addreſs ſhe had made him that Preſent, and how he ſhould lay it out: All theſe Fancies vaniſh'd at the Approach of Day; and he was no ſooner up, but he wiſht with Impatience,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102171:28"/>
that Night were come. His Thoughts were wholly taken up with the Charms of the Lady: He could not ſufficiently admire, with what addreſs ſhe had made him underſtand ſhe loved him, and deſired that he ſhould love her again: But that which Charm'd him moſt, was her Grace in performing a Generous Action. He was ready to dye with longing to ſee her again, as if all his Viſits were to be paid with ready Money. He knew very well to make uſe of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, which, at this Day, is the beſt Science in the World, and the true uſe of Things. Night came at laſt, but it was long to Eleven a Clock; and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of this kind, Moments are tedious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diana,</hi> who knew not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he had entertained her ſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102171:28"/>
coldly the Night before, waited with as much Impatience as he, to ſee him again: But he was ſo cruel, that he made no more account of her this, than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Night; nor would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to ſtay a moment to hear her; and when ſhe reproacht him for it, he anſwer'd her with Slights. The Poor Girle was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at the Change, and could not imagine any thing leſs than ſuch a Perfidiouſneſs, eſpecially in her Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> entred the Ladyes Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whom he found on a Bed of State, finer than ever he had ſeen her. Poor <hi>Diana</hi> was ſent again to amuſe the People of the Houſe, though there was not the leaſt need of it: But the truth is, they had no need of her there, and were willing to amuſe her. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till then did ſhe know what
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102171:29"/>
Jealouſie was, having loved in peace, and in a full Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; in Confidence, her Gallant had loved her as faitfully: The Indifference of a Lover, is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Mark of Perfidiouſneſs. The Diſtaſte we have of one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is commonly the Effect of Pleaſure taken in another. Love is an incurable Diſeaſe; and he that hath been once in Love, will ever be ſo with one thing or other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The dejected <hi>Diana</hi> went mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with her ſelf, what cauſe ſhe had given her Lover to uſe her thus: But the more ſhe thought on what was paſt, the more ſhe found he had nothing to reproach her with, but too much Love; and that the Change ſhe obſerved in him, muſt be a pure Effect of his Inconſtancy, which inclined him another way.</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:102171:29"/>
               <hi>This put her upon examining who ſhould be her Rival:</hi> Is it <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> the Stewards Daughter? <hi>No.</hi> Is it the Scrivenars Daughter? <hi>No.</hi> Is it ſuch a ones Neece? or ſuch a ones Siſter? <hi>No, no. [Thus ſhe ran over all the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Girles in the Village, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding any juſt Ground of Suſpition.]</hi> Did he Love any of thoſe I am thinking of? Or had be ſome new Inclination, where I cannot imagin; What had he to do here? And yet, What cauſe can he have to uſe me, as he does theſe two dayes past? 'Tis but three dayes ſince he ſwore to me, it were Death to him, to let him go to Bed without a ſight of me; And this Evening he runs away from me; he will not ſpeak to me; he will not ſo much as hear me: Whence comes this cruel proceeding? If he loves me no longer, why comes
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102171:30"/>
he ſo punctually to the Gate? He waited there before the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and as ſoon as he ſaw me, he thought no more of me. O Heavens, me-thinks I ſee the beginning of all this diſorder: He is in Love with my Lady. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, ſhe hath of late more Care than ever of her Perſon, and Dreſs; eſpecially at Night, when he is to come; ſo much Dreſſing, ſo much Curling, ſo much Patching, ſo much Powder, ſo many Scents, are not for nothing. I am ſent hither; What to do? Heavens! How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent am I? My Love of him, and Confidence in her, have blinded me quite.</p>
            <p>Theſe were ſtinging Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a Girle in Love, to fancy her ſelf not only betray'd, but made a Fool. She needed no more to make her leave the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Employment they had given
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102171:30"/>
her; and to go ſoftly, to ſpy through the Key-hole, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of thoſe ſhe ſuſpected: She ſees her perfidious Lover, and her honeſt Miſtreſs ſo cloſely joyned, ſhe had reaſon to think them both of a piece: What a ſight was this for the poor <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na!</hi> She wiſh'd her ſelf blind, and was ready to dy for Grief; and in this diſtreſs, fetched two or three deep Sighs, which thoſe within might eaſily have heard, but that they were buſie about ſome-what elſe. This turn'd <hi>Diana</hi>'s Grief into Deſpair; and now, nothing but Revenge can give her Satisfaction; which ſhe might ſoon obtain, by giving the old Gentleman notice of what was a doing, and inviting him to ſee the Comedy in Action: This ſhe reſolved upon; but had ſcarce given too Knocks at his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-door,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102171:31"/>
but ſhe relented into a tenderneſs, that moderated her Fury: [An Irreſolution to which Perſons in Love are uſually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, amidſt their higheſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports.] She conſidered her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould be utterly undone, if the Old Gentleman found him with his Wife; and that it would be a means to loſe him for her ſelf, as well as for her Miſtreſs: This Conſideration prevailed over her Reſentment: She pittyed him, and thought it ſufficient to go, and make them aſhamed, by reproaching them to their Faces, for their Infamous Treachery.</p>
            <p>The good Man, who had half heard the laſt Knock, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether he had heard, or only dreamt of a Noiſe; to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, goes to the Door; and hearing ſome Body go back very
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102171:31"/>
ſoftly, thought there were Thieves in the Houſe. He runs to his Sword, which had not been drawen ſince the Warrs of <hi>Paris,</hi> where he had ſerved in Perſon: He takes his Captains Pike in his Hand, and puts his Helmet on his Head; which carryed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a ſufficient load of his Wives putting on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diana</hi> in the mean-time, gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on the Wall; and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how to take <hi>John</hi> and her Miſtreſs in the Act, that they might not have any colour of Denyal; met a Man, whom ſhe preſently took for her Perfidious Lover. <hi>Are theſe your tricks Iraytour</hi> (ſaid ſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>Canst thou think ſuch Falſeneſs can eſcape unpuniſhed? If none elſe, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will Revenge me.</hi> The Old Gentleman, in the Emotion he was in, never minding on what
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102171:32"/>
ſide he had heard the Noyſe of the Thieves, Ran in his Shirt without any Light, towards where he heard <hi>Diana</hi>'s Voyce; holding his Pike at full length, and before him; and making a Noyſe with it enough to raiſe the whole Houſe: <hi>Who goes there,</hi> cryed he, as loud as poſſible; which ſo frightned <hi>Diana,</hi> that, quitting him ſhe had laid hold on, she went to hid her ſelf, for fear her Maſters Anger ſhould all light upon her, if found with her Gallant. <hi>Who is there,</hi> ſaid he once more: No Perſon ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. In the mean time he bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dished the Pike the one way, and the other, till at laſt he felt ſome-thing under it: Then did he double his Fury, and with a thundring Voice, <hi>Speak</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>who is there? or you dye. Ah Sir</hi> (anſwered the Wretch that was caught, with a lamentable
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102171:32"/>
Tone) <hi>Pitty your poor Curate, and do not kill him. No Curate,</hi> Replyed the Cholerick old Man, who, in the trouble he was in, underſtood not what was ſaid, nor perceived that it was the Curate that ſpoke; but cryed out, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye like a Robber as thou art: Confeſs quickly, that I may diſpatch thee:</hi> This he ſaid, ſeconding every Word with a Blow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Le Brun,</hi> and the Lady, frightned with this buſtle, thought it high time to look about them: They knew not whether the Noyſe were raiſed about them, or on ſome other occaſion; But the Gallant, for more Surety, held it beſt to ſave himſelf: They put out the Candle; and, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Door ſoftly, he thought to ſlip away through the Croud in the Dark; but (unfortunately)
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102171:33"/>
fell foul on the good Old Man, and laid him along on the ground, Pike, Helmet, and all. Then did he cry out to purpoſe; <hi>Thieves, Thieves; Help, help<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am dead!</hi> All the People of the Houſe (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already heard part of the Noyſe he had made) ran to him thick and three-fold: His Lady too, having had Leaſure enough to alter her Dreſs (making as if ſhe were in mighty haſt in her Night-Gown); no ſooner ſaw the Light, but ſhe came to know what the matter was: Amazed to ſee her Husband guarded round with all his Domeſticks in Arms, from the Kitchin; which made ſuch a Clattering, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not one another. But that which was moſt pleaſant to ſee, was. The Old Man (like a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue) laid flat on the Ground; his Helmet on his Head, his Pike
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102171:33"/>
in his Hand, a Belt over his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two Inches thick, a Rapier at his Side four or five Foot long; and all this in his Shirt only, which was an excellent Equipage, to draw a Pourtrait in ridicule by. None of the Servants, but had a Moneths mind to Laugh; But the Lady Acted her Part beſt: She cry'd, the wept, ſhe afflicted her ſelf for the unhappy Accident beſain her dear Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, not knowing what Viſion had appeared to him. The reſt did their Maſter the beſt Service they could; ſome taking off his Helmet, others his Belt, others his Sword. The good Man took on grievouſly, extreamly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned leſt the Thieves ſhould eſcape; and Commanding his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to purſue them; telling them, there were (at leaſt) half a dozen in the Houſe, and that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102171:34"/>
had ſeen them, though all this while in the Dark. But his Wife having long ſince repreſented him, and made him paſs for a Man much ſubject to Fancies, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garies; his Servants, who knew what he affirmed was impoſſible, could not look at one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Laughing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Juſt thus</hi> (ſaid the Lady) <hi>when I fell the laſt Night, I thought there were Spirits in the Houſe. Death</hi> (anſwered the old Man, in a Rage) <hi>theſe were no Spirits; witneſs my Pike, with which I have killed one, or (at leaſt) miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but little of killing him; for, he called for the Curate to take his Confeſſion.</hi> This Diſcourſe ſet all the Folks a Laughing; which ſo vexed the Old Man, that, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling his Pike again, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be Revenged of them all, as ſo many Thieves within doors,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102171:34"/>
holding Correſpondence with thoſe without, unleſs they would purſue them. To ſatisfie him, they took upon them to make ſearch for them in the Caſtle: But whether it were that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reſerved her own Quarter to be free from ſearch, or imploy'd them at diſtance, no notice was taken of; the back-gate being the Place of Rendezvouz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diana,</hi> at length appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Maſter; and, though much out of Humour, forgot not her Duty in making faſt the Gate: This done, ſhe went up to her Ladies Chamber, where ſhe lay: Here was Acted the Scene that diſcovered the whole Plot. The Lady Laught, and wondered <hi>Diana</hi> was ſo ſad: And both being laid, <hi>What</hi> (ſaid the Lady) <hi>you are troubled I warrant you, that your Lover is gone without ſeeing you?</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:102171:35"/>
Fool, thou ſhalt ſee him to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: Would you have had him ſtay till they had ſearch'd my Chamber? Ah Madam <hi>(anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> Diana) I would to God they had found him here. And why, <hi>(replyed the Lady, much ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the Anſwer)</hi> Why <hi>(ſaid</hi> Diana) You know well enough; and that he came not hither for my ſake. <hi>The ſubtle Lady, fell a Laughing; and Embracing</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, <hi>told her,</hi> She now ſaw ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>John</hi> in good Earneſt, ſince ſhe was jealous of him, and upon her account, whom of all the World, ſhe had leaſt cauſe to fear; but ſhe would pardon her unjuſt Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition. Diana <hi>unwilling to be altogether fool'd, replyed,</hi> That her Suſpitions were too well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: <hi>And ſeeing her Lady con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Laughing at her,</hi> What Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>ſaid ſhe, (with that Ardor
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102171:35"/>
and Vehemence Truth uſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires into thoſe who maintain it)</hi> have not I ſeen you with <hi>John</hi> in ſuch and ſuch Poſtures? Did not you tell him this? did not you tell him that?—<hi>Which the Lady hearing,</hi> How now Inſolence <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> are you a Spy on my Actions? May not I do what I pleaſe in my Chamber for you? Who in the middle of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den—<hi>and pauſing at that Word, ſhe afterwards proceeded,</hi> Witneſs the Cherry-Tree. Diana <hi>grew paler, and more confounded than ever: But knowing they were but equally match'd one to one, ſhe recovered her Courage; and with as much heat as her Lady, gave her ſtory for ſtory; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd her with all the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries of her Life paſt, which ſhe had the goodneſs to relate to her. The Lady, not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102171:36"/>
it, without a tranſport of Rage, beyond what is allow'd to Perſons of Quality of her Sex, was not content to make uſe of her Hands (finding</hi> Diana <hi>as good at that Sport as her ſelf) but ran for a ſtick, which ſhe had in the Chamber.</hi> Diana <hi>perceiving it, thought it time to with-draw into a place of Safety; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other than the Bed, as ſhe was going under it, ſhe ſees a Mans Leg, and then another; and by degrees, the reſt of the Body, dreſt after the old Faſhion: What a fright was ſhe in? Her Miſtreſs running after her, ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on the Feet of the Spirit, and fell to the Ground: Thus was the Anger of theſe Female Combatants appeaſed on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; and they look'd one on the other, to inquire who the Man ſhould be; and how he came
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102171:36"/>
thither: Have you ever ſeen two Enemies joyn Forces at the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a Third, ſtronger than both? Juſt ſo did theſe Rivals agree in a Corner of the Chamber, where they durſt ſcarce breath; taking the ſight of this Object, for an Effect of Divine Juſtice: and believing it could be nothing elſe, but an Evil Spirit, ſent from the other World to put them in mind of their Sins. At laſt, this Spirit ſpoke; and putting off an old Gray Hat he had upon his Head,</hi> Madam <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> you muſt pardon your poor Curate, unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſed to the Hazard both of Life, and Reputation; the Loſs of both could not have been preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if (by good Fortune) he had not found your Chamber-door open; where he came to hide himſelf, when you were gone forth. <hi>The two Females, hearing the Voyce and Name of their good Friend,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102171:37"/>
the Curate, recovered a little Courage, but durſt not yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture going nigh him; becauſe Spirits are apt to Lye: And they had reaſon to fear, this ſame had a mind to abuſe them; it being not propable, that Mr.</hi> Curate <hi>ſhould be in their Chamber that time of Night, and in ſuch an Equipage: But finding him at length a very peaceable Spirit, they ventured to go nigh him, and knew him. It was ſo ſurprizing, and ſo pleaſant a ſight to ſee him in a great Gray Waſtcoat, and a Hat dreſt like a Sow-Gelder, that they could not forbear Laughing.</hi> 'Tis indeed a Laughing Buſineſs, <hi>ſaid he, (ſome-what angry for the ſmall Compaſſion they had for him);</hi> but you have your ſhare as well as I, in the Adventure: 'Tis true, I bear the Blowes; But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you would have me diſcover all,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102171:37"/>
do your Endeavour to help me out from hence, that I may go Home. Mr. <hi>Curate (anſwered the Lady)</hi> what is written is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: You have been Young as we are; and you know, you ſhould do ſo to others, as you would they ſhould do to you. We have every one his part in what hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this Evening. I have too much to my ſhare <hi>(ſaid the Curate),</hi> and I feel it I am ſure. Therefore <hi>(ſaid the Lady)</hi> let us keep one anothers Counſel: <hi>Diana</hi> ſhall go open you the Gate; But let us know firſt what Misfortune brought you hither, where you have ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Buſineſs. 'Tis true, Madam, <hi>(anſwered the Curate)</hi> I might very well have let alone the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs I had here; but the too great Affection I have for that Rogue, my Nephew, hath brought me to the fine Condition you ſee me in:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102171:38"/>
For, three or four Nights laſt paſt, I obſerved he went out of his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at an unſeaſonable Hour, and returned very late: The Care I have alwayes had of his Education, and the Charitable Remonſtrance I late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had from my Lord your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, made me think my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to follow him this Night, to ſee where he went. I ſaw him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Castle, at the Back-Gate; and intended to wait his Return, to ask him, What he had been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? But growing impatient at his ſtay ſo long, I took the Pains to get up hither by the ſame Gate: And now I cannot but think it was by the Inſtigation of the Devil: For, as I came groaping along the Rooms, I met <hi>Diana,</hi> who put me into a bodily Fear, and miſtook me for my Nephew: Preſently after, came in my Lord, your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who frightned me to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102171:38"/>
For, not knowing whether to flye, I threw my ſelf like a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Sott under his Pike, with which he thought to kill me: At last, Madam, to conclude in a word, <hi>(ſaid the Curate, Smiling when he ſaw them Laugh)</hi> I came, I ſaw; but the Miſchief is, I was over-come, and ſoundly beaten.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Curate had a pretty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty at Railing, which gave the Lady occaſion to ſhew him ſome Kindneſs; and pray'd him,</hi> He would not ill uſe his Nephew. As to that, Madam, <hi>(anſwered he)</hi> I know what I have to do: I am willing for your ſake to forget what is past; but muſt intreat you to take order for the future, that no Miſchief come of it. Could my Nephew pay you his Reſpects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Conſequence, and that my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour were not concerned as well Yours, I ſhould give him up to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102171:39"/>
your diſpoſe, to do with him what you pleas'd: But 'tis a wild Youth, who, in the end, will Ruin Ton, and Me; and 'tis (abſolutely) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to let him go and Travel for ſome time, and learn to get his Living in another Country. <hi>The Lady would preſs him no further, hoping the Affection he had for his dear Nephew, would make him alter his Reſolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Curate in the mean time takes his leave; and,</hi> Diana <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving opened the Gate for him, he went Home, where he found the Gallant in a very ſweet Sleep: But his good Uncle having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd him, he was amaz'd to ſee him at that Hour in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and ask'd him,</hi> What he pleas'd to have? I come to tell you <hi>(anſwered the Curate)</hi> That my Lord would fain ſpeak with you. Speak with me <hi>(replyed</hi>

John!) Yes, with you, <hi>(ſaid the Curate)</hi> about ſome Froliques that have been done this Night in the Caſtle, for which a Freind of yours had like to have been well beaten. John <hi>was not a little ſurprized at the Diſcourſe; but however, he ſwore and proteſted,</hi> He knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Matter; That it was three Dayes ſince he had been in the Caſtle; and they did him wrong to charge him with their Diſorders. They have done you wrong indeed <hi>(replyed the Curate)</hi> but it was, in letting you eſcape as they did. Tell me, you Arch-Rogue, Went not you into the Caſtle by the Back-Gate, at Eleven a Clock this Evening? You think no body has ſeen you play your Pranks with the Lady; You came not out of her Chamber at the Noyſe made by the old Lord, whom you thought to have diſpatched:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102171:40"/>
All this, I know to be falſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, get you up, and clear your ſelf before him; 'Tis Hanging matter if you do it not. <hi>The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Nephew was ſufficiently troubled; not able to defend himſelf from Conviction, where the Proofs were ſo clear: He knew the Kindneſs his Uncle had in ſtore for him, throwes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his Feet, confeſſes all, and begs his Pardon.</hi> There is but one Remedy <hi>(ſaid the Curate)</hi> you must put on your Cloaths, and be gone immediately for <hi>Paris,</hi> where they will teach you more Wit; for if you ſtay till Day, it will be too late; there is a Warrant for Apprehending you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John,</hi> who was very willing to be fairly quit of the buſineſs, and go Travel, took this as a Favour, rather than a Baniſhment from his Uncle: He gets up, makes up
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102171:40"/>
his Pack, takes a little Money, and gets into <hi>Paris;</hi> where he ſoon made himſelf known. He reſolved to ſet the beſt Side out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; takes a Boy, changes his Name from <hi>Le Brun</hi> to <hi>Le Bel:</hi> And, having laid out part of the Money he had from the Lady to put himſelf in Equipage, he viſited the great Ones, and went every Day into the beſt Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; And had Wit and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough to bring him off well; being not ſo Raw, as to be taken for a Country Squire.</p>
            <p>He ſoon gain'd conſiderable Acquaintance of the one Sex, and the other: But he was a little Knaviſhly given; and had in his Nature, an Inclination to Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he could never get rid of, which ſpoyl'd all.</p>
            <p>He had many Adventures, both good and bad, <hi>Paris</hi> being a place
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102171:41"/>
proper for that; But the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Lodging, was the worſt of all, and ſent him pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Town. You ſhall hear it in few Words:</p>
            <p>After ſeveral Cheats he had Acted here and there, his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney growing low; and, finding himſelf no longer in a condition to viſit the Ladies, and keep the Company he had done at firſt, he was forced (for maintaining his Gallantry) to ſubmit to make Love to his Landlady: She was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man not Unhandſome, and had pleaſed other Men. He was in her Debt; and in what Reſpect ſoever he conſidered the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, he could not but think it of advantage. Women of her Character, are quickly familiar; their Calling obliges them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Men ſome Liberties, which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102171:41"/>
make them believe, They will deny them nothing.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Le Bel,</hi> who, after the good Fortune he had met with in the Village, thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo Impregnable, but it muſt yield to his Charmes; found ſo much Kindneſs from his Landlady, from the firſt Day he ſpoke to her of Love, that he thought the Buſineſs done; and that ſhe was deeply in Love with him; and that it was not for his purpoſe to be ill-conditioned to her. His Chamber was neer that of his Landlords, and he could hear him go out to Market every Day, as ſoon as 'twas Light, and leave his Wife in Bed, to take her Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reſt: The happy Monſieur <hi>Le Bel</hi> thought it the moſt favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Occaſion in the World: He gets up one Morning, puts on his Night-Gown; and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102171:42"/>
farther Ceremony, goes to his new Miſtreſſes Chamber, and was at her Bed-ſide before ſhe awakt: He ſlips boldly into Bed; what he did there, I know not, it is not written in his Story; but certain it is, he was there above half an Hour with her, and no Noyſe at all; without doubt, ſhe took him for her Husband: But at laſt (having known him I cannot tell how) finding her Miſtake, she cryed out withall her Force. It was in truth a great piece of Folly, and our Gallant paid dearly for it; For, the People of the Houſe running in, armed Cap-a-pe, ſome with Broaches, ſome with Forks, ſome with Knives, and other Arms from the Kitchin-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazin, enough to frighten a more dangerous Pallet, than the ſieur of <hi>John Le Bels;</hi> Scarce gave
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102171:42"/>
him time to take his Breeches, and his Hat, the Blowes flew ſo thick about his Ears: And this was that Jolly Combat, which he publiſhed ſo much for his Honour where-ever he went; and got him the Sir-Name of <hi>Monſieur du Joly Combat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was glad to get to the door without Stockings, or Waſtcoat; but, by Good Luck, he was not far from a Broakers, where, with the little Money remain'd, he bought a few Cloaths, to ſet him out as well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>as an ill Suit could do, for a ſecond Adventure; and, at the ſame time, chang'd Quarters, for fear of new Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paris</hi> is large; and thoſe who would hide themſelves, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily do it: Monſieur <hi>Le Bel</hi> ſtood in need of ſuch a Place; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of his Landlord, but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102171:43"/>
of thoſe Perſons of Quality he had had the Honour to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; being not then in a condition to maintain the Port he had appeared in. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he muſt live; and every Day will not furniſh us with the kind Lady of the Caſtle: But Folks ſometimes meet with croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grain'd Landladies.</p>
            <p>By good Luck, there was hard by his new Lodging, a Bath-keeper, who wanted a Boy: The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment was ſomewhat mean; but thoſe in Neceſſity, ſtand not much upon Terms and Punctilos of Honour. He offers his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and is entertain'd: And changing his Condition, would alſo change his Name, and calls himſelf, <hi>Champagne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now <hi>John Le Brun,</hi> and <hi>John Le Bel,</hi> is become <hi>Champagne,</hi> a Bath-keepers Boy: He was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102171:43"/>
Ingenious, and very fit for that Trade, and might have done very well in it, but that he thought it beneath him: He did but wait the Hour to bid his Maſter adieu; and as ſoon as the good occaſion was offered him of a Gentleman belonging to Court, that came to Bath himſelf at his Maſters; he took the pains to ſeize all his Cloaths, leaving him his Rags in Exchange. You may believe, that, being new rigg'd by this Shift, he made haſt out of his Lodging, and travers'd the Streets a pretty round Pace: He had not then formed any Deſigne. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers of his Order, commit themſelves to Fortune, Eſpouſe all Adventures, and think every Country their own: But meeting, as he paſt along with a Stage-Coach; and ſeeing a handſome Lady in it, he asked the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102171:44"/>
What Place he was bound for? He told him, <hi>For</hi> Amyens. <hi>As Lucky as may be</hi> (anſwered our Gallant) <hi>'twas the very thing I look'd for;</hi> and, without more adoe, ſteps into the Coach. Then did he begin at leaſure, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Prize he had new ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but found it not ſo Rich, as he had promiſed himſelf. The Gentleman whoſe Cloaths he had borrowed, was a Man of Eſtate; but had newly loſt all at Play, to <hi>Champagnes</hi> great Grief; who ſcarce found in his Pockets, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to carry him to <hi>Amyens:</hi> But the worſt Luck now, the better another time. The Lady in the Coach, was none of the leaſt Beauties: There was but they two, and he was in hopes, his good Mein might Charm her to bear the Charge of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102171:44"/>
while they travell'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>He ſet himſelf out, he play'd the Wagg, he talked of Love; and perſwaded the fair Lady (who was an Honeſt <hi>Picard)</hi> ſo far of his particular Merit, that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd what he pleas'd: But, as ill Luck would have it, ſhe was a Perſon more beholding to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than Fortune; and had the ſame Deſigne upon him, he had upon her: So that, having felt one anothers Pulſes, they ſoon perceived, they muſt Club for their Journey: Having found out this Secret, their Love grew cold, and they parted at <hi>Amyens</hi> with a great deal of Indifference on either ſide.</p>
            <p>This Gallant, whom I dare no more call <hi>Champagne,</hi> Habited as he was, failed not to Lodge at the beſt Inn in the Town, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102171:45"/>
to Eat with ſome Officers who were all Perſons of Quality; and among the reſt, the Count <hi>De Brion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dreſs he was in, became him huge well; and no Man but would have taken him for a very honeſt Gentleman: But having neither Baggage, nor Servant, and no more known in the Town, than at his Lodging; the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, who had learnt not to truſt any Paſſenger three dayes after his Arrival, came to bid him Good Morrow, and tell him, He was going to Market. The Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier preſently underſtood what the Complement meant; and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Huff, asked, <hi>How much he wanted for Proviſions for his Houſe? That if fifty Piſtols would do, he ſhould ſpeak the word, and have them within an Hour, down upon the Nayle. In ſhort, That</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:102171:45"/>
               <hi>he ſhould give himſelf no trouble; That he would juſt dreſs himſelf, and pay him what he owed him.</hi> It was alwayes his Maxim, to promiſe luſtily, though he knew not how to perform; eſpecially, at this time, when he could go neither backward nor forward to furniſh himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>De Brion</hi> Lodged in a Chamber hard by him: He was a generous Perſon, and one whom our Gallant had Courted above the reſt, with deſigne to make uſe of him in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. He never ſcrupled to Complement him, and let him know, he was a Gentleman ill uſed by Fortune; and had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to him, as a Perſon to whom he would chooſe to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd rather than any other. Count <hi>Brion</hi> took pitty of him; and having bid him not trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102171:46"/>
for ſuch a Trifle as what he ow'd his Hoſt, offer'd him a Place in his Troop; telling him, <hi>A young Man as he was, ſhould not loſe the Occaſion of this Warr to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance himſelf, but endeavour to make his Fortune: As for him, he would ſerve him with all the Credit he had; and aſſur'd him, he ſhould never want as long as he ſaw him do his Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Champagne</hi> was no great Lover of Warr; He was not born under the Planet of <hi>Mars:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for Honour, or rather, for Neceſſity, he accepted (with much Joy) the place offered him by the Count <hi>De Brion;</hi> and within two Dayes, went along with him towards the place of Rendezvouz, for the Kings's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Champagne,</hi> though Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as the reſt for that great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102171:46"/>
proved unfortunate for Count <hi>Brion,</hi> who was killed that Year. <hi>John Le Brun,</hi> as if he had been unwilling to Serve longer in the Warr, after the Death of his Captain; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aweary of the Service, as too hard for him, thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than how (handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to run away: He was then in very ill Equipage; but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven provided for him.</p>
            <p>One who waited on Count <hi>Brion</hi> in his Chamber, and after his Death, had Liſted himſelf in the Troop; having ſome Cloaths of his Maſters, as he was going out on a Party one Morning, delivered them to Monſieur <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,</hi> to keep for him. Our Cavalier would not let ſlip the Occaſion, but faſtens his Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle behind him; and, in a time, when it Rain'd as if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102171:47"/>
and Earth would come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, falls off from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and gets into <hi>Valenciennes;</hi> where he was very wellcome, as all <hi>French</hi> Deſerters are. From thence, he paſſes to <hi>Gaunt,</hi> where he Sold his Horſe to furniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Money, to carry him to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> He goes into the Boat; And knowing of what Conſequence it was to gain an Eſteem in the Place, by the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit he ſhould appear in at his Arrival, he took out of his Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle one ſo very fit for him, as if it had been made for him; beſides clean Linnen, he found there a Belt, Silk Stockings, and every thing he wanted, ſave only a Hat; his own being not ſuitable to the Habit he wore, It was his good Fortune, to find in the ſame Boat a Merchant, who furniſh'd him with a very fine Hat for ſome
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102171:47"/>
things he gave him in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
            <p>Our Cavalier once more new fitted, entered <hi>Bruſſels</hi> in Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and as fine as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom; And, according to his Cuſtom, took up a Lodging in one of the beſt Inns in the City; having his Port-mantle carryed after him, by a Boy he met ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually in the Street: He made his Entry into his Lodging, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of <hi>A diſcontented Officer of the</hi> French <hi>Army.</hi> He preſently called a-loud for a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Chamber: Then he began to enquire, Whether there were in the Town any <hi>French</hi> Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors to make him Cloaths, and Drapers, and Hoſiers, and Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers? He ſent for ſome of all theſe Trades, and ſet them all to work, as well for himſelf, as his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Valet; giving them order to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102171:48"/>
have all ready in three Dayes; that he would give them Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and pay them with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſt.</p>
            <p>All the Diſcourſe that Day in the Inn, was of the <hi>French</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer: He had already gained the Reputation of a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that was come to ſpend ſome time at <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> Beſides, the Gallant had made it his Buſineſs, to enquire of the Perſons of Quality there; and to inform himſelf of thoſe in particular, who would give a Civil Reception to Perſons of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Birth like himſelf; with ſuch other Particulars, as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known by them who intend to viſit the Great Ones. He had one of the beſt Rooms in the Inn; and the Ordinary he Eat at, was a Patacoon a Meal, which was ſome-what high for an ordinary Officer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:102171:48"/>
But our Gallant made a Buſtle after the rate of a thouſand a year: But the Maid going up at Supper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to make his Bed, had the Curioſity, (or it may be a deſign, to finger ſome Spare Utenfill or other for her uſe) to Ranſack his Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle, which ſhe found open, and to ſee the fine things he had there: But was very much Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, to find it only a poor Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers <hi>Wardrope,</hi> containing onely an old Gray cloſe Coat Lin'd with blew, worn thred-bare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without; a Greaſy pair of Leather Breeches, a pair of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Stockings, all botched up with white Thred; an old Leather belt, and a black Taffity Cravat, with a Ribband of ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Colour, that none knew what to call it then, though it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably been formerly, a ſtraw-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or ſcarlet. The Maid found
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102171:49"/>
none of theſe rich Accoutrements for her turn; but was ſo Officious, to bring her Maſter the Newes of the diſcovery ſhe had made; who preſently went up to take a View of theſe Goods, and eaſily gueſt how matters ſtood with our Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; having before had to do with ſome Officers of the ſame kind; and having dearly bought his experience, he had no mind to be Cheated any more. He Let him ſup quietly; but as he roſe from Table, he took him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and pray'd him Civilly, <hi>To pay him for the two Meals he had eaten there, and to take another Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more Convenient for him; telling him, he had expected that Evening a perſon of quality, who had hired for a year the Chamber he had taken; and that when he came, he could not deny it him; that he was much troubled at it, but knew not how to help it. If
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102171:49"/>
that be all,</hi> (anſwered our Officer, without ſtanding on point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be put out of his Chamber, to accomodate another) <hi>we muſt Comply; have not you other roomes in the Inn? You are honeſt people; And I ſhould be ſorry to Leave you; becauſe I am to ſtay a pretty while in this Town. I am obliged to you for the favour</hi> (replyed the Hoſt) <hi>but let it be, if you pleaſe, at ſome other time when we are not ſo full. What</hi> (ſaid he, ſmiling) <hi>would you have me go ſeek a Lodging at this time of night, when I know not as much as the Streets of the Town? Tis no matter Sir</hi> (anſwered the Hoſt) <hi>my Sheets are too fine, and I am not ſuch an Aſse to let them be Stolen. Your ſheets,</hi> (replyed the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer Knitting his browes,) What's the meaning of that? Whom do you take me to be? I take you, anſwered the Hoſt ſomewhat loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102171:50"/>
to be a diſcontented Officer, who may go to ſeek a Lodging elſewhere, with your beggarly Wallet, and your Port mantle full of Rages. How now inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, replyed the Officer, is this your courſe to Ranſack my Boy's Clothes. The Hoſt was ſo provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at his Calling him inſolent, that he ran for a ſtick; at the ſame time the Officer ran for a Fine Silver Sword, that was upon the Bed, and not only ſtood upon his Guard, but fell upon his Landlord ſo briskly, that he wanted the help of his Servants, who Coming in to his reſcue, the Buſtle increaſed. Never did Monſieur <hi>Le Bel</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo Courageous, as on this occaſion; but the reaſon is, he was newly come from the Army. The Gueſts of the Houſe ran in to ſee what the matter was, but ſound ſuch a Confuſion among the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102171:50"/>
Men and the Maids, (crying out for being hurt, or for fear of being ſo) they knew not what to make of it. In the midſt of this buſtle, our diſcontented Officer, whom Fortune never fail'd at a dead lift, took his opportunity, and got away with his Silver Sword naked; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt nothing in the skirmiſh, but his Hat, without any harm but a few dry blows of no Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. This Jolly Combat was better than his former, having come off here with honour, and a good Sword for a trophy: The fear he was in of being purſu'd, made him take Shelter in a houſe, where he Spyed the door ſtanding half open; where, without more ado he boldly went in, Hoping to find a way to paſs further; or at leaſt, a place of refuge from his Enemy: There he could ſee but one lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Stair-caſe, which he got up
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102171:51"/>
ſoftly; and found in the Chamber, a very handſom Lady, ſitting all alone, and leaning on a Table, with a Book before her. The fair Lady was ſo ſurpriz'd at his unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Arrival, that ſhe fell down half dead at his Feet: <hi>Ah Sir,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>do what you pleaſe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſave my Life.</hi> This Action cauſed no leſs Aſtoniſhment, than Pitty, in our <hi>Hero:</hi> And letting fall his Sword to the ground, like a Perſon diſarm'd, he took up the Lady in his Arms; and Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her with a great deal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, lift her up from the Ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Your Life, Madam,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is too precious, to be in danger with a Man of Honour: Had any one a Deſigne upon it</hi> (added he, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Sword into his Hand) <hi>he ſhould ſoon find, I ſtand here in your Defence. But Madam, to put you out of the pain of gueſſing the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:102171:51"/>
               <hi>of my being here (which I am very ſenſible, cannot but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize you, ſeeing me in your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her at this time of Night, with my Sword in my Hand); give me leave to acquaint you, I am a</hi> French <hi>Officer, of Quality, as you know well enough, that in</hi> France, <hi>they imploy no other but Perſons of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: I was taken Priſoner the laſt Engagement; And, having this Evening found ſome of my Guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, after their Bellies full of Wine I had given them in the Day, I ſeized their Officer's Sword; and, having forced my Way through the midſt of the reſt, I ſaved my ſelf, as you ſee. I have left them my Baggage, my Money, and all that I had; which, though very conſiderable, you may eaſily believe, I value not at all, when compared with my Liberty; which now, Madam, is in your
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102171:52"/>
Hands: It is in your Power to ſave, or to ruin, me: For, in the Effort I made to get out of their Hands, I know well enough, I have wounded two or three; and I fear, I have left one dead on the place.</hi> The Lady being a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and of a Generous Nature, would have been very glad to have done a Gentleman a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on ſuch an occaſion; but ſhe was juſt taking her Leave, and told him, <hi>It was not in her Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do him any Service, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to a Gentleman, her very good Freind; whoſe Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs he might rely upon. Ah Madam,</hi> (anſwered our Officer) <hi>now you are leaving this Countrey, give me leave to bear you Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: It will be the far ſurer Way for me, than to go back again for</hi> France; <hi>and to ſtay here, were to run too great a Hazard of being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:102171:52"/>
               <hi>If your Buſineſs require it</hi> (Replyed the Lady) <hi>I ſhould be very glad of it: For, though I be of this Countrey; yet, perhaps, I may be in a better Condition elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to ſerve you: But</hi> (added ſhe, ſmiling) <hi>you know not whither I am going. Go to what part of the World you pleaſe</hi> (anſwered our Cavalier) <hi>it matters not at all; I ſhall ſend for what is neceſſary to put me into Equipage. You do not know me</hi> (Replyed the Lady); <hi>and, it may concern you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how you engage to Travel with a Lady, who (perhaps) may be imployed in ſome dangerous Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: For, in the Diſorder you ſee me, you may eaſily believe, that this is none of my Houſe. Ah Madam! As for Danger</hi> (Replyed the Officer) <hi>I fear none but from your Eyes; As for any other, I have ſufficiently learnt at the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>

               <hi>not to value my Life; and ſhould eſteem my ſelf Happy, to find an occaſion to loſe it in your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> A Diſcourſe ſo Generous, and obliging for the Lady, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced abundance of Thanks; which the <hi>Hero</hi> anſwered with as many Congees down to the Ground.</p>
            <p>The Lady was Handſom and Witty, and had the Appearance of a Perſon of Quality; well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Great Ones, and bred up amongſt them. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>John Le Bel</hi> our Officer, newly eſcaped out of Priſon, thought her worth the looking after; and lookt upon her alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as his Miſtreſs; or rather, one he reſolved to make a Fool of, by putting a Trick upon her. She was in a looſe, but rich Dreſs; which, with his finding her Door open, made him believe, She ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102171:53"/>
ſome Bodies coming; of which, he made no very good Conſtruction: But having Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented her a freſh, of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity he was under, to uſe the Liberty he had taken; he thought himſelf obliged, to intreat her, to permit him to with-draw into ſome other Room of her Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if his ſtay in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were troubleſome: She told him, <hi>No: That in truth, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a Viſit from a Gentleman, her Friend; to whom ſhe had ſent her Foot-Boy, who careleſly left the Door open; but that ſhe believed, he would not come that Evening, having ſtayed away ſo long: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he might find time enough to go into another Chamber:</hi> And ſo, ſhe pray'd him to take a Seat. <hi>I know not Madam</hi> (ſaid the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, to raiſe a Diſcourſe) <hi>what a Perſon you took me for, when you</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:102171:54"/>
               <hi>beg'd your Life of me on your Knees, as I entered your Chamber; but I will aſſure you, No Action I ever met with, ſurprized me ſo much, I confeſs Sir,</hi> (anſwered ſhe) <hi>you put me into a terrible Fright, with that naked Sword in your Hand: I took you for one I had reaſon to be afraid of; but you ſee, I ſoon altered my Opinion: And to tell you the truth, You look not like an Aſſaſſin. An Aſſaſſin Madam,</hi> (cry'd the Officer!) <hi>What Villain could harbour ſuch Thoughts againſt ſo Beautiful a Perſon?</hi> There-upon, he renew'd his offers of Service, with greater Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than before; telling her, with an Air of Bravery, <hi>That her Enemies muſt be very ſtrong, to do her any Out rage, while he ſhould be ſo near her.</hi> Then preſſing her to tell him the truth of the matter, he received from her the following Anſwer:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:102171:54"/>
Though the Confidence you have in me, in your particular Concerns, had not obliged me to impart Mine to you; yet they have made ſo much Noyſe in the World, I could not think fit to conceal them from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom (beſides the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Quality) I take for a Man of Honour, and Diſcretion. <hi>The Officer having return'd the Complement in a very Reverend Bow, ſhe proceeded to tell him;</hi> I am a Lady of this Town, and of a Family conſiderable enough, both in the Court, and the Camp, to give me the Advantage of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in this Court with ſome Splendor: But the ill Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding between my Husband and Me, hath made me ſo unhappy, that there is no ſtaying for me here. Marriage, which ſerves for a Cloak to many others, hath robb'd me both of Honour and Eſtate. I never
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102171:55"/>
Loved my Husband, which is a great piece of unhappinefs; and he hath Loved me too well, which proves a greater Miſchief than the other. You cannot but be ſenſible, what Swarms there are of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Husbands in out time; and, conſequently, how great the number is of Diſcontented Wives: And, let it not ſurprize you, to let you know, I am one of Them. I have been reputed Handſome, and ſo many have told me ſo; that, though I had not been inclined to believe it; yet the multitude of thoſe who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it, muſt needs have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me to think ſo: But what is Beauty good for but the Pleaſure of being Beloved? I ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count her a Fool, that ſhould tell me, She put it to better uſe: gentle or ſimple, honeſt or kind-hearted, We are willing to pleaſe; And there are wayes to pleaſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102171:55"/>
and Moroſe, as well as the Airy and Free: I have had Tryal of both: But this pleas'd not my Husband. But what came I into the World for? To live as in a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery? He hath done all in his Power to make me leave <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and go live in the Countrey: But miſſing of his Aime, he reduced me out of pure Spight, into ſuch a Condition, that it was not in my Power to entertain a Gallant: But there is a Salve for every Sore: All the Bustle he made, did but increaſe his Diſgrace, and proclaim him to be that, which every Wiſe Man ſhould conceal to his Power. I confeſs, I loſt a little Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among thoſe they call, <hi>The Vertuous Ladies;</hi> but thoſe of the contrary Title are ſo numerous, that for one that Condemns me, there are a hundred to Excuſe me: And perhaps, every Woman, that

hath a Husband like mine, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable for all the little Follies ſhe Commits. This very Day, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man his Friend, ſent me word, He had ordered two Soldiers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (where he hath a conſiderable Command) to come hither, and Murther me: Judge you Sir, if after this News, I had not reaſon to be afraid, when I ſaw you enter my Chamber: Upon this Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from my Friend, I took my Meaſures; and by his Advice, left my own, to retire into this little Houſe for ſome few Dayes, till I can order my Affairs, and take my Leave of this Country. <hi>Juſt as ſhe was ſaying this, ſhe heard a Noyſe at the Gate; which made her believe, the Gentleman was come, as in truth he was: She made the Officer preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw; telling him,</hi> That one pair of Staires higher, he ſhould
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102171:57"/>
find a Chamber open. <hi>He got up thither, and ſaw (though without a Candle) ſeveral Cloaths, and other things, lye on the Table and Stools there, which might ſerve for a reaſonable Prize: But being in hopes of better Fortune in time, this could not tempt him. But he had the Curioſity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf a little, what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe there might paſs between the good People below, who vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited one another at ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Hour. He had no very good Opinion of the Matter; and thought, if he could once diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Secret, it would be enough to render him neceſſary for the Lady: He went down, and ſtood cloſe by the Door, being more than half ſhut; where he heard the Gentleman ſpeak to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;</hi> I have taken the Liberty, Madam, to ſend your Boy to one
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102171:58"/>
of my Friends, to intreat him to lend me a Sword, having newly loſt my own by a very pleaſant Adventure: There came <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to our Inn, a Young <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> who made as if he were a Perſon of Quality, with a Lacquey at his Heels, carrying a huge Port-mantle full of nothing but Rags: Our Hoſt at the firſt ſight; believ'd him what he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be taken for, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him accordingly: But in the Evening (by what Chance I know not) he diſcovered, that this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Man, who pretended himſelf <hi>A Diſcontented Officer of the Army,</hi> was but a <hi>Deſerter;</hi> and civilly pray'd him to go out of his Houſe: The Officer took it as an Affront: This occaſioned high Words between them, and from Words they fed to Blowes: Our Host had a Cudgel in his Hand;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102171:58"/>
and to my ſorrow, the Officer find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Sword in the Room, laid hold upon it: We ran in to ſee what the matter was; and as we were buſie about parting them, the <hi>French</hi> Cavalier went away with my Sword, and I came off with the Loſs: Mine Hoſt having ſeized on his Hat, and his Baggage; though ſo inconſiderable, 'twill ſcarce pay his Score. <hi>The Lady ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at this Story, thinking the</hi> Diſcontented Officer, <hi>very near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to the</hi> Officer <hi>eſcap'd out of Priſon; askt the Gentleman,</hi> What kind of Perſon the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was, and what Habit he had? <hi>which he deſcribed to be ſo like the Man, and Habit, ſhe had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen in her Chamber, that ſhe doubted no longer, but he was the very ſame: But whether out Prudence or Charity, ſhe ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, (being willing to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102171:59"/>
ſave from further trouble a Wretch, who had fled to her for Refuge; and fearing the buſtle the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would make about it, being very paſſionate; and hoping to help him to his Sword again; which, though he ſhould have loſt, was no great matter to him) ſhe did but Laugh heartily at the Story.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Gallant, who had heard all this Diſcourſe, did not think fit to ſlight an Information of ſo much Importance: He preſently gets up Staires again; and in a very ſhort time, makes up his Pack, which he takes under his Arm, and ſtraight-way goes down the Staires; and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to leave any thing behind, that was ſo juſtly his own, he ſlip'd away with his naked Sword in his Hand: But, juſt as he was opening the Street-Door, he
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102171:59"/>
meets the Ladie's Boy with a Sword in his hand; who, you may well think, might be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, to find a Man like our Officer, coming in that Poſture out of his Miſtreſſes Houſe: But our Officers Wit was ſo ready, that he preſently asked the Boy, <hi>If that were not a Sword he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to a Gentleman, who was there above Stayres?</hi> To which the Boy having anſwered, <hi>It was: Friend</hi> (ſayes the Officer) <hi>you have no more to do but deliver it me; the Gentleman hath found his Sword, I have it here in my Hand, and am going for the Scabbard to his Landlord at the Inn:</hi> The Boy was Young, and the Trick ſo neat, it might have catch'd an old One: He gave him the Sword; and, at his new Friends Requeſt, lent him his Hat till his Return from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102171:60"/>
the Inn, whither he was going for the Gentlemans Scabbard.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Le Bel</hi> being thus got out of the Bryers, the Boy gets up Staires; The Gentleman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ask'd him for his Sword: The Boy anſwer'd, <hi>He had given it the Man without a Hat, who had the other Sword in his Hand. What Man,</hi> (Replyed the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?) <hi>The ſame</hi> (ſaid the Boy) <hi>that is gone to the Inn for your Scabbard.</hi> The Gentleman know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of what the Boy meant, thought he was in Drink: But the Lady, who preſently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the Matter, and that the Diſcontented Officer had not been Content with one Sword; fell a Laughing ſo heartily, that the Gentleman, not knowing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was ſome-what diſpleaſed; and pray'd her to tell him, (if ſhe knew) <hi>What was become of his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102171:60"/>
Sword?</hi> The Lady, with much adoe forbearing to Laugh, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>The ſame Rogue that had taken his First, had Cheated him of his Second, Sword. How, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> (Replyed he) <hi>the</hi> French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? <hi>Yes, the very ſame,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>your Diſcontented Officer. But why, Madam, d' you tell me ſo? How ſhould you know it? You do but Raily: Let's hear what manner of Man this Man without a Hat was?</hi> The Boy Deſcribed him ſo much to the Life, it could not be doubted, but he was the Diſcontented Officer: The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man more aſtoniſht than before, turns him to the Lady, and asks her, <hi>How ſhe came to know this very fine Gentleman? Sir</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>Give me time to breath, and I will tell you the Story:</hi> Then did ſhe relate how he came to her Chamber; and the Tale he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102171:61"/>
had told her of his being eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of Priſon, which moved her to pitty him; being not able (on ſo preſſing an Occaſion) to deny Refuge to a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as he ſeemed to be: The Gentleman anſwered, <hi>All this was well; but that ſhe ought to have told him of his being at her Lodging; that it had, at leaſt, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him one of his Swords; and that, having underſtood ſo much of him, ſhe might have concluded him a Rogue, that deſerved not her Favour:</hi> She excuſed her ſelf with the Conſiderations we have mentioned; being a Perſon of ſo tender a Soul, and truly good Natur'd, ſhe could not find in her heart to do the worſt of Men any harm. <hi>Madam</hi> (Replyed the Gentleman) <hi>were it your caſe, would you be ſerved ſo? Sir</hi> (ſayes ſhe) <hi>I fear I have loſt more than</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:102171:61"/>
               <hi>you; and that my Compleaſance hath (by this time) coſt me very dear: For, when you came in, I ſent him up into a Chamber, where all my things lay at Six and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: But the beſt of it is, he had not any Light.</hi> The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fell a Laughing at the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Ingenuity, as if Thieves wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Light to find out their Booty; and told her, <hi>Such Peoples Eyes were in their Hands, and that their Fingers were their Candle.</hi> They asked the Boy, <hi>If the Man he had given the Sword to, carryed any thing with him? Nothing</hi> (ſaid the Boy) <hi>but a Bundle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Arm:</hi> This Alarmed the Lady; and the Gentleman had his turn of Laughing at her. They went up to the Chamber, and found he had carryed away in Cloaths, and other things, to the value of a hundred Piſtols:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102171:62"/>
The Lady was ſome-what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, thinking he could not be gone far for want of a Hat: But the Boy preſently told her, <hi>He had lent him his;</hi> which made them more Sport: So that in truth, they had no more to do, but ſit down by the Loſs; having all had their ſhare (not excepting the Foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>boy) in ſuffering by the Cheats of the pretended Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.</p>
            <p>Some Moneths after, this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (for whom Fortune had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared new Adventures with our <hi>Here)</hi> went for <hi>England;</hi> and ſoon after her Arrival there, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited a Perſon of Quality, with whom ſhe had Contracted a very intimate Acquaintance at <hi>Bruſſels:</hi> She was received with Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the higheſt Joy and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the Lady being extreamly glad, at the Hopes of an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102171:62"/>
to pay her at <hi>London,</hi> the Civilities and Kindneſſes receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They paſt from Complement, to Diſcourſe of their Friends; and from that, to the News at Court. The Stranger having a Deſigne to continue ſome time in <hi>England,</hi> was very deſirous to inform her ſelf particularly, of the ſtate of Affaires, and have ſome Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Country; and was very well ſatisfied, ſhe made her Addreſs to a Lady very knowing in thoſe Points; and one who failed not to give her a Relation, both general and particular, of all the fine Ladies, and their Gallants, in that Court. Her Diſcourſe might have paſt for a Chronicle in Epitome; containing, in ſhort, The Hiſtory of the Gallants of either Sex: As well the Ladies, who (by their good Conduct) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102171:63"/>
their Reputation, as thoſe who had utterly forfeited and loſt it: And of the Gentlemen, as well thoſe who were worthy the paines of being Loved, as thoſe who were look'd upon, as the Scandal of Ladies. She proceeded yet further; and being antient Acquaintance, gave the ſtrange Lady ſome Maximes, and Rules of Conduct in that Court; which with a little Practice, ſhould make her able to give Inſtruction to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this long Diſcourſe, the Stranger, who knew that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, her Acquaintance, being a very beautiful Perſon, had alwayes had her ſhare of the Gallantries in Faſhion where-ever ſhe dwelt; asked her ſimiling,</hi> Whether ſhe continued ſtill, the courſe of her Conqueſts? <hi>She anſwered ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Coyly, That ſhe bore no
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102171:63"/>
                  <hi>part in the Comedies now Acted on the Stage of the World, but was only a Spectator; not that ſhe was become inſenſible, or that thoſe who have been in Love, can ever ceaſe to be ſo: but to ſpeak truth, whether it were the weakneſs of her Fancy, or the goodneſs of her Judgment, ſhe had no Inclination (at leaſt) for thoſe of this Country: That ſhe was for Strangers, and eſpecially the</hi> French, <hi>whom ſhe moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</hi> You are not an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Woman then <hi>(Replyed the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.)</hi> Not by Inclination <hi>(an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe,)</hi> though Born in the middle of <hi>England:</hi> Did you but know <hi>(added ſhe)</hi> the Ayre, and the Grace, the <hi>French</hi> have in Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry: but I need not tell it you, who come from a Court intirely <hi>French.</hi> There is one here whom I ſee ſometimes; He is in no ſmall
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102171:64"/>
Eſteem among the Beauties. That may be the reaſon, Madam, <hi>(an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Stranger)</hi> you are not altogether Impartial, as to thoſe of this Country. You are my Friend <hi>(Replyed ſhe,)</hi> and I confeſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly, I have ſome Eſteem for him; but that's all: He is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Quality; he hath Wit; he is Handſom, and viſits me oftner than others; which is enough to gain an Eſteem from me, who am Naturally no Hater of the <hi>French.</hi> He might have got an Intereſt in a far handſomer Lady; and I know thoſe who Aſpired to the Conquest of his Heart: But his Stars, or perhaps ſome ſmall Merit of mine, hath made him yield to thoſe ſmall Charmes I carry with me. You ſhall ſee him here, it will not be long ere he comes; you ſhall give me your Judgment of him. The <hi>French (anſwered the Stranger)</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:102171:64"/>
have certainly a good Meine, and are Witty; and to ſpeak generally, ſurpaſs all other Nations in Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and are their Maſters therein: But to tell you the truth, We are to take heed of them, eſpecially in a ſtrange Country: You ſhall have a poor Farmer's Son, ſhall give himſelf the Title of Marqueſs of the Place he was Born in: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who never was better quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied than a <hi>Valet De Chambre,</hi> ſhall call himſelf by his Maſters Name; the better to Cheat ſome Shop-keeper or Tradeſman: There is ſuch a Swarm of ſuch Gallants in the World; that I believe in good Earnest, that People of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity muſt for the Future, carry with them Authentick Testimonials; or must be content to lye under Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of not being what they juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretend to. I can tell you a Story, Madam, what a Trick I was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102171:65"/>
ſerved ſome Moneths agoe, for my willingneſs to Pleaſure a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of this Character: Then ſhe gave her an account at large, of all the Particulars concerning the pretended Officer at <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> at which the Lady Laught very heartily, and confeſt it was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Cheat: But, that Right muſt be done to Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and that there is a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between thoſe that are Men of Honour, and thoſe who are not.</hi> The Perſon I ſpeak of (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhe) carries in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the Character of Honesty; and hath in all his Actions, an Ayre Remote, and altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any thing of Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Meanneſs: That he may very well paſs for a Pattern of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and Vertue. He came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Perſon of Quality: In a word, It is the Count <hi>Brion.</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:102171:65"/>
Count <hi>Brion,</hi> Madam, <hi>(Replyed the Stranger?)</hi> If I be not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I have Read in the <hi>Gazett,</hi> He was Dead. Yes, the Elder Brother <hi>(anſwered the Lady)</hi> but this is the Younger, who is come to a great Eſtate by the Death of his Brother. And, to the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Fortune and Birth, hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that of the higheſt Merit: Some matter of Honour, as I underſtand by others: A Duel fought much to his Advantage, hath been the Cauſe of his flying hither for Refuge. He is not altogether unhappy, Madam, <hi>(anſwered the</hi> Flemmiſh <hi>Lady)</hi> ſince Baniſhed his own, he finds in this Country, ſome place in your Eſteem; which cannot but be a very pleaſant Refuge. You are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes obliging, Madam, <hi>(Replyed the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Lady)</hi> I have not Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity enough, to flatter my ſelf with an Opinion, of being able to ſerve
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102171:66"/>
Count <hi>Brion</hi> in his Misfortunes.—<hi>She had hardly done ſpeaking when the Count entred; who, having heard the laſt Words of the Ladies Diſcourſe, anſwered Smiling,</hi> If any thing can leſſen the Misfortune you ſpeak of, it muſt certainly be the Honour of your Eſteem. I cannot call my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, ſince the Day I believed you have any Value for me. Tis true Sir, <hi>(Replyed the Lady)</hi> did your Happineſs depend on that, you ſhould have no great cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it; for, I ſhould be ſure to do you Juſtice: This I averr in Preſence of this Lady; who, though a Stranger, is long ſince acquainted with the Sincerity of my Heart. <hi>The Count, who had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſlight View of the</hi> Flemmiſh <hi>Lady in paſſing by, finding by the Diſcourſe that ſhe was a Stranger, went up to her to Salute
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102171:66"/>
her: But having fixt his Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, he was not a little aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht: He eaſily knew her by her Countenance, and was at a ſtand; and twice or thrice changed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. He knew not what to ſay, and had ſcarce the Confidence to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute her. The Lady as much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized as he, advanced not a ſtep to do him that Honour; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had ſcarce the Patience to endure it. The</hi> Engliſh <hi>Lady, having obſerved all theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Actions, the Trouble of the one, and Coldneſs of the other, knew not what to think of it; and ſeeing there paſſed not a Word between them, ſhe asked, If they knew one another? And, being no leſs aſtoniſht than they, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> Were you not both my Friends, I know not what I ſhould think of this Buſineſs. I confeſs, Madam, <hi>(anſwered Count</hi> Brion, <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring

to Recover himſelf)</hi> this Lady is ſo exactly like a Perſon of Quality, I formerly had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to know, and be extreamly obliged to, that I could not ſee her without Remorſe for my Ingratitude towards her; whereof I own my ſelf Guilty, and ſhould think a thouſand Lives (if I had them) well beſtowed, to Expiate my Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The Fault muſt have been Great <hi>(Replyed the</hi> Engliſh <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)</hi> and I cannot believe you a Man capable of ſuch a Crime. 'Tis great indeed, Madam; And had I not hopes of Pardon from her Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſhould dye for very Grief and Shame. And what ſay you to this, Madam, <hi>(anſwered the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Lady, addreſſing her ſelf to the Stranger?)</hi> Does this Matter concern you? There must be ſome Cauſe for that Diſorder and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I obſerved in your Countenance
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102171:67"/>
on this Occaſion. Madam, <hi>(Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Stranger)</hi> the cauſe of my Surprize is just like that of the Gentlemans; A Perſon very like him, behaved himſelf towards me not ſo well as he ought; and I took him for the Man. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Extraordinary in this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture <hi>(anſwered the Engliſh Lady;)</hi> and you must excuſe me, if I believe neither of you in what you have ſaid: I am very well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, Madam, you came but Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-day to Town, and that the Count was never at <hi>Bruſſels:</hi> So that, I cannot comprehend where you could have ſeen one another, but here. Pray clear this doubt, and tell me freely, What is the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. The Gentleman <hi>(Replyed the Stranger)</hi> can do it far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I. There are ſome things <hi>(ſaid the Count)</hi> not fit to be ſpoken at all times; <hi>And then
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102171:68"/>
riſing up;</hi> I ſhall leave all <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> to the Diſcretion and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of this Lady, and with-draw for the preſent; being not very well: <hi>With that, taking Leave of the Ladies, he went his way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ever Perſon was in Pain, if ever Woman had the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to know any thing, you may believe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady, ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected on the preſent Occaſion: For, having really had, and as frankly own'd, an Eſteem for the Count, ſhe was very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for him upon all Accounts; and, particularly, thoſe where any other of the Sex appeared any way concern'd for him. <hi>Well, Madam,</hi> (ſaid ſhe, to the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) <hi>will not you tell me what the Meaning of this is? Shall I not know the Adventure brought you acquainted with the Count? I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had Reſerve for you; Your
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102171:68"/>
time is come to requite my Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> The Lady refuſed a long time, out of ſcruple to Ruin the Reputation of a Man, who might (perhaps) be a Perſon of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and forced by Neceſſity to do what he had done: But fearing he was nothing leſs; and that her Friend might be abuſed by her good Opinion of the Count, ſhe made her firſt Promiſe not to ſpeak of the buſineſs; and then told her plainly, This was the Officer ſhe had told her of, who had Eſcaped out of Priſon. <hi>Who, Count</hi> Brion, (anſwered the Lady, with a Tone and Action that ſufficiently declared her Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize!) <hi>Is he the Honeſt Man who ſtole your Cloaths, and the two Swords from the Gentleman your Friend? Yes, Madam,</hi> (anſwered ſhe) <hi>the very ſame. It is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> (Replyed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady),
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102171:69"/>
               <hi>nor ſhall you make me believe, though you make ſee it with my Eyes. What you pleaſe</hi> (ſaid the Stranger); <hi>but I aſſure you, I know him on no other Account: And if you will take the Pains to examine and reflect on what he ſaid to me, you may gueſs whether this be true or not. Heavens!</hi> (cry'd ſhe) <hi>is it poſſible, that a Man of his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſhould be reduced to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Acting ſuch a Cheat? He had reaſon to tell me, He had never been at</hi> Bruſſels. <hi>However, he is ſtill a Man of Birth, and of Parts; and I might have ſaid, of Merit too, but for this unhappy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. 'Twas but a Trick of Youth</hi> (ſaid the other) <hi>and ſo may be pardon'd: You know, Men are but Men; and</hi> France <hi>being at Wars with us, he thought (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) Robbing me was but Plundering the Enemy: But now, that he is</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:102171:69"/>
               <hi>in a better Condition than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he may make me amends, and expreſs his Sorrow for the Fact, by making me Reſtitution. Yes, Madam,</hi> (Replyed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) <hi>I will undertake he ſhall do it: For, beſides the Generoſity of his Nature, he is a Perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and will not fail to appear ſo, on ſuch an Occaſion as this: If ſuch a thing ſhould be known of him here, where he has the Eſteem and the Love of ſo many Perſons of Quality, What would become of him? I would not for the World it ſhould come to their Ears: For, as he Viſits me ofner than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I muſt expect to have the greateſt ſhare in his Diſgrace. Let me beg of you, Madam, it may go no further.</hi> The Lady promis'd it; and having other Viſits to make, took her Leave to go to the Lodging of another Lady, of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102171:70"/>
her Acquaintance; Where, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Chamber, ſhe found her at ſome Difference with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon; who, upon her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, quitted the Room.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Fair</hi> Flemming <hi>was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this Viſit, with the ſame Joy and Honours ſhe had found at the firſt: And having paſt the firſt Complements of Civility; and obſerved before, that when ſhe came in, the Lady was in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with her who went forth, ſhe thought her ſelf obliged to make her Excuſe for diſturbing them, and interrupting their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</hi> You may believe, Madam, by our Actions you ſaw, that our Diſcourſe was none of the Pleaſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test; and I verily think, you did both of us a Pleaſure; For, had you not come in, we ſhould have certainly quarrelled: She was a <hi>French</hi> Lady, who came to demand
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102171:70"/>
Money of me, for two pair of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydred Bodyce I had of a French-man, in Payment for Money I won of him at Play, about two Moneths agoe; She tells me, The Bodyce were her<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and that ſhe had only truſted the <hi>French</hi>-man with them, to Sell them for her. I anſwered, I knew nothing of that, and that I had honestly bought them; and that ſhe was to look after payment from her Commiſſioner: <hi>The Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger fell a Laughing at the Title of Commiſſioner; and asked, Who that honeſt Gentleman might be, who pay'd his Debts with other Peoples Goods; and to diſcharge what he ow'd one Lady, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the Bodyce of another?</hi> This <hi>(added ſhe)</hi> is a new piece of Gallantry, not very much in Mode among the Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Yes, <hi>(Replyed the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Lady)</hi> this <hi>French</hi>-man would
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102171:71"/>
paſs here for a Gallant by Profeſſion; and calls himſelf, The Count <hi>De Brion:</hi> But I never look'd upon him, as other than a <hi>Valet De Chambre Traveſty;</hi> having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Wit, nor the Manners, nor the Sentiments, non Carriage, of a Perſon of Quality: Nor do I ſee what Ground there is for that Eſteem ſome Perſons have for him here, unleſs it be, for that he is a Stranger. He hath apeared at Court, under the Auſpice of a <hi>French</hi> Lord; whoſe Favour alone, might gain a Man Credit: And that, I believe, hath Contributed moſt to the Honour a Man ſo little deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, hath received there. But there are many who have changed their Opinion of him; and think with me, that he is not the Man he pretends to be: Beſides, there are a number of People, who knows the Houſe of <hi>Brion;</hi> and aſſure us,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102171:71"/>
there was but one Son of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and that he dyed in the Army. It may be, Madam, <hi>(ſayes the</hi> Flemmiſh <hi>Lady)</hi> the Gentleman you ſpeak of, may be ſome near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Counts. No, no, <hi>(re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the other)</hi> he ſayes, He is the Count <hi>Biron's</hi> own Brother and Heir, and would paſs for ſuch at Court.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I was Yeſterday with a Lady of my Acquaintance; and as we were talking of ſome of his Cheating Tricks, he happened to come in; and told the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, That a Dutcheſs (he named) having ſeen the fair Diamond Pendants at her Ears, had a great Deſire to have ſuch another pair made for her; and knowing he had the Honour to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her, had ſent him on purpoſe to intreat her, to lend her her Pendants for an Hour:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102171:72"/>
The Lady preſently caſt her Eyes upon me, and I Mine on her; both looking on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in ſuch a manner, that each of us underſtood well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, how Suſpicious this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie appeared to the other. My Friend having too much Wit to be catched in ſuch Traps, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed her ſelf with ſaying, She was engaged that Afternoon to make ſome Viſits of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and could not then ſpare her Pendants, being at her Ears; but that on the Morrow, ſhe would return him his Viſit, and afford him a ſight of them: This Day we ſhall know the Truth, it being not probable, that Lady would have ſent ſuch a Perſon as he, on a Meſſage of that Nature. But I entertain vou too long, Madam, with this Subject; yet the Gentleman I
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102171:72"/>
ſpeak of, being one who is very much talk'd of, you may (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) be glad to know him; and the Deſcription I have given you, is much to the Life. </q>
            </p>
            <p> The ſtrange Lady thanked her for the Favour ſhe did her; telling her, She took ſo much Pleaſure to hear her, that it might paſs for a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to have a further Account of what ſhe knew of this Count; which, perhaps, ſhe might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite her for, by finding a time to Entertain her with Relations of a very like Nature. </p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſhall not be long here (Replyed ſhe) but you'l ſee him; and in a few Dayes, you may expect a Viſit from him; being indeed, the moſt Impudent of Men, and one who intrudes into all Places, where Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may be ſeen. He is not Unhandſom; and, could we
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102171:73"/>
judge of Men's Birth by their Shapes, we might believe him well Born: but this is not the firſt time, we have known the Man handſomer than the Maſter: And as for me, I will never be perſwaded he is any other than a Serving-man: All his Actions are mean and baſe; his Words having nothing in them, that carries the leaſt Taſt of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Elevated Wit: And were it not for the Diſcourſes he makes of his Perſon, which he boaſts to the Skyes, on the account both of Gallantry and Bravery (which, I muſt tell you, he maintains but very poorly by his Actions) 'tis the pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Fellow for Converſation, that ever I met with. His beſt Talent is Impudence: He calls himſelf, the Friend or Relation of all the People of Quality in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102171:73"/>
                  <hi>France.</hi> In a word, He made two Gentlemen believe, he was with them at the Academy, though neither of them could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member he had ever ſeen him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But that which will chiefly ſurprize you, is, The Impudence he expreſt about a Letter he found on a Ladies Table, of my Acquaintance (where I was at Play); He took it with him to the Play-Houſe, to ſhew it three or four Gentlemen; who verily believed, the Letter was addreſt to him: And the Perſon who had Written it, being very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for Merit and Birth; the Gentlemen ſeeing he treated the Count <hi>De Brion</hi> ſo obligingly, had a better Opinion of him than formerly: But it happned, that one of theſe Gentlemen go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Play-Houſe, went to the Lady to whom the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102171:74"/>
belong'd, being directed to her; and knowing the Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between her, and the Perſon who writ it, asked her, What Acquaintance the Count <hi>Brion</hi> had with her Illuſtrious Friend?</q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <hi>Not any, I believe,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>and I think ſo the rather, for that he hath lately made uſe of my Intreſt with him, to procure him a Letter from him in his Favour, to a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State, with whom (he ſaid) he had Buſineſs of Importance. I know not what to think of it</hi> (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Gentleman,) <hi>but can aſſure you, I just now ſaw a very obliging Letter he hath written to the Count. A Letter</hi> (anſwered the Lady!) <hi>You ſhall find it was mine he found on the Table, and gives it out for his own.</hi> 
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>It fell out accordingly; for the Letter to her was not to be found; and what ſhe told the Gentleman,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102171:74"/>
put it out of doubt, that it was the ſame Letter. As they were ſpeaking of it, Count <hi>Brion</hi> comes in: The Lady was unwilling they ſhould ſay any thing to him, and to put him into ſuch a Confuſion at her Lodging, as the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Vanity muſt have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly reduced him to; But they brought it inſenſibly into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe by degrees: You might imagine, Madam, the Count would have ſplit on this Rock: I looked for no leſs: But his Impudence brought him off. He maintained ſtoutly, that he had been long acquainted with the Gentleman, and had received ſeveral Letters from him; and told us a hundred Particulars of him: At laſt, he play'd his part ſo well, that if he did not abuſe us all, yet he left the one half of the Company donbtful,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102171:75"/>
whether what he ſaid might not be true. The Lady ſeeing her ſelf engaged, and knowing what he ſaid was abſolutely falſe, preſs'd him more than the reſt; but he had the Dexterity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex her ſo much, that the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeemed to lean to his ſide: Then falling into his Tone of Railery, he told her, She was very much miſtaken, if ſhe thought that Gentleman Writ to none but to her: That ſhe was not the only Perſon received Letters from him; That there were above ten Ladies in <hi>London,</hi> could ſhew Letters from him as full of Gallantry, as any ſhe could produce; And he would engage to let her ſee above a dozen, if ſhe would have Patience to ſtay till the Morrow: So free was he of his Promiſes. The Lady I believe, was ſeriouſly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102171:75"/>
concern'd at his Diſcourſe; and the reſt of the Company knew not what to think of it: She would have Lay'd her Watch worth Threeſcore Pounds Value, againſt Tenn Guinneyes, he would not perform what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook: The Count Honeſtly told her, That in not Laying the Wager, he made her a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of her Watch; and that he would not put her to that Charge to find out the Truth: That ſhe need but to have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience till the next Day, he promiſed upon the Word of a Gentleman, as he was, to let her ſee ſeveral of thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>I know not whether the Lady ſtept well that Night or not; but I have been told, That when ſhe was up, the Count <hi>Brion</hi> made her a Viſit; and turning
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102171:76"/>
all into Railery, complain'd of her for driving on the buſineſs ſo far before ſo good Company; excuſing himſelf, that he was obliged to do as he had done, to ſave his Reputation: That he knew very well, ſhe was the ſole Perſon in <hi>England,</hi> that the Gentleman had an Eſteem for; And that he would give him an Account, of the Perplexity he had put her in on his ſcore; which was no ſmall Signe, ſhe had no little Eſteem for him.</p>
               <p>This Lady, whether ſatisfyed with this Acknowledgment, or ſlighting further Satisfaction, ſaid no more of the Buſineſs. He had the Fortune to meet many Adventures of this ſort; againſt which, his Impudence was proof, and ſaved him out of all: The only one, I obſerved him out of Countenance in, was, That of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102171:76"/>
his Dancing at a Ball; where having come off well enough, he went to make his boaſt to one of the Principal Lords at Court, that he had Danced alone at an Entry at a Ballet, which he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: This Lord being an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Dancer, and a great Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique in that Art, engaged him to let him ſee that Entry. The Count goes to the Muſitians; who, having play'd ſeveral Ayres, hit at laſt upon that which the Count might have wiſh'd had never been found; being the Ayre for the Entry he had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: They preſs'd him to Dance it; The Ladies joyned their Forces with the reſt of the Company, to prevail with him; but all to no purpoſe: And the Anſwer he made them, was, He would not give them Cauſe to Laugh at him; but they took
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102171:77"/>
the Liberty to do it. A whole Day will be too ſhort, to tell you all I know of this Perſon; but he is by this time, pretty well known to moſt, though all are not yet diſabuſed; but his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ſtands good. He came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a very wretched Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but quickly recovered the Equipage of a very great Lord, at the Charges of three or four, whom he got into his Snare: And as for his poor Creditors, he Entertains them with Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome Bills of Exchange (which have been long enough a coming) to have arrived from <hi>Japan;</hi> but you ſhall ſee, at laſt, he'l go fetch them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Ladies having ended their Diſcourſe of Count <hi>Brion,</hi> ſpoke of other things; till at laſt, the Stranger having other Viſits to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102171:77"/>
make, took her Leave; and was ſcarce got down Stairs, but ſhe found the Lady ſhe had made her firſt Viſit to, Diſputing Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hotly with two Chair-men. The ſtrange Lady took the Liberty to ask her, What the matter was? The other made Anſwer, That Count <hi>Brion</hi> having return'd to her Lodging, had Lent her his Chair, and that the Chair-men would make her pay for it; which was no uſual thing: The Count in the mean-time comes in; and enraged at the ſight of the Abuſe offer'd the Lady by the Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he took up his Cane, and gave them three or four Blowes: But he ſoon found as good as he brought; for, the Chair-men thinking the Baſtonado intolerable, return'd him Blowes with Uſury: Two to one was not ſo even a Match for Beating as Carrying.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102171:78"/>
The Ladyes were much troubled, but knew not how to help him: But, by good Fortune, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came by, with another behind him, who parted the Fray: The Man I laſt mentioned, was a <hi>French</hi>-man, who being newly arrived from <hi>Paris;</hi> and having caſt his Eye on Count <hi>Brion,</hi> came up to him to Salute him: </p>
            <q>Ah Monſieur <hi>Champagne</hi> (ſayes he) I am heartily glad to meet you here. Monſieur <hi>Champagne</hi> (replyed the Count?) What d'you mean by that? Whom d'you take me to be? I mean (anſwered the other) that your Name is <hi>Champagne;</hi> and I take you for a Bath-keeper's Boy I knew at <hi>Paris,</hi> and—</q>
            <p> Friend (Replyed the Count, Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him) <q>you miſtake your ſelf, I am Count <hi>Brion.</hi> I do not miſtake my ſelf (ſayes the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102171:78"/>
other), and by this very good Token, That you ſtole away the Cloaths of a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which I was forced to pay for:</q>
            </p>
            <p> He ſpoke this ſo loud, that all who ſtood by, heard him what he ſaid. The Count was glad to take him by the Hand, to draw him aſide; telling him, He was miſtaken: The other as ſtifly maintain'd, He was not; and threatned to have him Arreſted, if he would not pay him for the Cloaths. <q>But I am Count <hi>Brion</hi>
               </q> (anſwered he, much more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with this one <hi>French</hi>-man, than he was with the two Porters. <q>You may be what you pleaſe</q> (ſayes he) <q>when you have pay'd me for my Cloaths; but till then <hi>Champagne, Champagne,</hi> and no Count <hi>Brion.</hi>
               </q> While they were engaged in this Fine Dialogue, the Gentleman who had
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102171:79"/>
parted the Count, and the Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men when they fought, entertain'd himſelf in Diſcourſe with the two Ladies; but ſeeing a new Quarrel like to ariſe, he ſtept aſide, and ask'd them what the matter was? <q>Nothing (ſayes the Count) but an Inſolent Fellow loves to hear himſelf talk, and will needs take me for I know not who: He is certainly Drunk; and were it not for Reſpect to you, I ſhould make him know who I am.</q> The Man was going to Anſwer; and had doubtleſs ſaid worſe than he had hitherto done, but the Gentleman perſwaded him to with-draw; and ſo, did the Count a great Piece of Service. After this the Count ſent in ſearch of the <hi>French</hi>-man, and did all in his Power to perſwade him, He was not <hi>Champagne;</hi> and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted how-ever, to pay for the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102171:79"/>
Cloaths in Queſtion: But all to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This, with many other Reaſons, made him reſolve to leave <hi>London;</hi> having Reigned there too long, to continue any longer. His For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was at the Height, and he apprehended the Danger; that, if he endeavoured to Climb any Higher, he might chance to take the Way to Heaven in a String.</p>
            <p>The Lady of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the Man of <hi>Champagne,</hi> were the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Starres that boded him a Storm of Baſtonades. It is the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Man kind, to prevent ſuch Tempeſts. CHEATS, who have Wit, are very ſenſible how ſubject their Life is to Dangers of that kind. He eaſily ſaw a Cloud of Misfortune gathering over his Head, for his Inſolence and Impudence at <hi>London;</hi> and that it was time to with-draw:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102171:80"/>
Every thing hath its Seaſon; and he, the better to know the proper Hour for packing away, went to a Watch-maker; who, taken with his good Meine, truſted him with two Gold-Watches; with the help of which, he took the Lucky Moment ſo right for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away, that neither Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, nor Draper, nor Taylor; nor Tradeſman whatever, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Creditor (for he had of all ſorts) dreamt of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; only the Chair-men had him in the Wind, being (as the Story goes) told of it by his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy; who then were pay'd more than their due. But to conclude his <hi>Cheats</hi> here, and that he might go out of <hi>England</hi> ſo as he came in, that is, at other Mens Charges; when he came to <hi>Harwich,</hi> he went to a Merchant, and told him, He had a Letter
