            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE most learned, and wisest Philosophers, who were onely led by nature and reason, were of this mind, that Man was not born for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but was framed (by God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) so excellent a Creature as he is, to the end that he might employ those singular Gifts wherewith he is endued, not to his own private benefit, but to the profit of his Country and Others; as saith <hi>PLATO, Non nobis solum nati sumus, ortusque nostri partem Patria vendicat, partem Parentes, partem Amici; quae in terris gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntur, ad usum hominum causa esse generatos, ut ipsi inter se aliis alii prodesse possent.</hi> We are not born for our selves alone, but partly for


<pb facs="tcp:98252:4"/>
our Country, partly for our Parents, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our Friends: Whatever the Earth hath produced, was created for the use of Man, man also was created for man's sake, that they might among themselves profit one by another.</p>
            <p>This good opinion engrafted in those Heathen Philosophers by Nature, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from one to another by instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and so from time to time conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd among themselves by consent; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such as God had plentifully endued with Knowledge and Vnderstanding, to leave some worthy Monuments (which daily are to be seen) to Posterity; as <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> good Rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the hidden secrets of Philosophy; <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the Misteries of Astronomy; <hi>Euclide,</hi> the infallible Principles of Geometry; <hi>Varro,</hi> the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Observations of Husbandry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out of the which great benefit in all Ages hath been reaped, and hath also


<pb facs="tcp:98252:4"/>
from time to time been increased. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they do nearest attain to the rule of uncorrupt nature, and deserve best of a Common-weal, whose Travails and Studies are employ'd on those things that tend to the best end; for by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the end whereunto each thing leadeth, the goodness and excellency of the same is to be known, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: As for example; If Health either maintained or recovered be good, then Physick, whose chief end is to maintain and recover Health, must needs be good also. I have endeavoured (with a great adventure) to set forth this <hi>Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of Physick, for the common good, both of young Physicians, and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and also their sick Patients. I know that many learned Men have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready written large Volumes of this Art, whereupon it may seem perhaps a matter both vain and superfluous to write any more thereof; and some Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians may rashly judge that this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle


<pb facs="tcp:98252:5"/>
tract cannot be comparable to that which is already done by others.</p>
            <p>But though I have but onely hinted at Diseases, because I intended this but for an Enchiridion, or manual; yet there is so much writ as will satisfie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unprejudic'd Artist, that many Physicians both Ancient and Modern, have not attained to the true Knowledge of the Causes, and consequently the Cure of Diseases. I must confess, I owe much of it to those Standard-bearers of Physick, the great <hi>Platerus,</hi> the most famous <hi>Helmont,</hi> and <hi>Franciscus De-le-boe, Sylvius,</hi> &amp;c. out of whose Monuments I have collected the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest things, of the greatest import in the Art of Physick, whith were never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged or known before, of which I have had large experience. Was it wholly mine, it would be of little Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; it is the great Names of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Authours before mention'd, which


<pb facs="tcp:98252:5"/>
will give it Being and Life, and make it remain as an Exemplar of the true Knowledge of this famous Art. I need not tell the World how usefull a Subject of this Nature may prove; especially being Methodical, the better to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by those that are of mean Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, who cannot comprehend what is confusedly set down in large Volumes. It is the Duty of all good Men to praise those Authours, who have left to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as much as was known to them; such is my Judgment of the writings of others, that I think their Labour well bestowed, which have written herein before me; and I shall not find fault with any that shall (with an incessant Labour, and continual Industry) disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and bring to publick light, any thing of this Art, which as yet is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and unknown, but will always esteem them worthy of much Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore I hope that others also will judge the like of me. For it is


<pb facs="tcp:98252:6"/>
unjust and injurious to good Men, and also to the re-publick, presently to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame those wickedly, who do endeavour to discover things that are obscure, and bring them forth to the common use of Mankind. If any are perswaded, that they can excell others in Judgment, and are desirous of Splendour and Glory, let them take pains, to discover things that are as yet obscure in Nature, by which they may wax renowned with the Celebration of their Name. But they who have not sown with much Labour, and expect a great Harvest, for the most part are fed with vain Hope.</p>
            <p>I must expect some Calumnies, and Obtrectations against this, from such malicious prejudiced Men, as envy Glory to all, except themselves; but the best is, it is not my Portion alone; for it was the fate of that worthy Man Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> to meet with Storms of malevolent Censure, about his Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb facs="tcp:98252:6"/>
of the Bloud; and it was always and ever will be the Fate of the first Authours of any invention (though never so good) to meet with Opprobry and Contempt: and therefore I know no reason why I should be exempt from the common destiny; but let those who are severe against this, pardon my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that such their severity proceeds from self Guiltiness, and give me leave to apply that of <hi>Ennodius, That it is the Nature of self Wickedness, to think that of others, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves deserve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the Reader may have a charitable Opinion hereof, I testifie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, the onely Searcher of Hearts, that I have not written any thing here, but what seem'd true to me, and chiefly profitable to the sick; and therefore I doubt not, but this will find acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongst the true Sons of Art, and all others who are Lovers of the Truth.

If any (by reading this little Book) procure to themselves more knowledge than they had, or cause any good to be done to the diseased, it is all that is aimed at by</p>

Nerves, may over moisten, and perhaps so far loosen the Tunicles or Membranes of them, that it may render them unfit to let the Animal spirits pass through them; hence it is that sometimes one particular Member hath been Paralytick by too much Cold and Moisture; and sometimes more parts have more or less lost sense and motion.</p>
               <p>It is the opinion of most eminent Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans both ancient and modern; that the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal spirits being severed from the Bloud in the Brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are from thence carried through all the Nerves to exercise the external senses and Animal motion; which is continual and equal in healthy persons, but changeable and unequal, according to the divers diseases of the Body or Mind.</p>

Children are most subject to these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, because they abound with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of moisture, and flatulent Vapours in the Brain; and because they have <hi>Nervorum poros angustos,</hi> whereby the Brain is easily filled with such vapours; and therefore we see that Children are often troubled with


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98252:22"/>
them, young People more rarely, and old Folks but seldom; and we find that Children better suffer them than either of the other, who frequently die of these fits, especially of the Epilepsie, when in their falling there follows snorting, gnashing of the teeth, a ghastly countenance, much some at the Mouth, <hi>involuntaria seminis effusio,</hi> and great cryings out.</p>

Of all the kind of Convulsions, Tetanos is the most difficult to cure; because it is (as it were) composed of the other two kinds; but if a fever happen in this or any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion, the sick will suddenly recover, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a fever dissolveth it; but if a Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should succeed a fever, it is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, especially from a wound, or procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from venemous matter.</p>

                  </note>When a particular Convulsion is caused from a prick of a Nerve or Tendon; as it may happen sometimes by the unskilfulness, or precipitancy of the Chyrurgeon in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vein, then most speedily pour into the wound or puncture, the Oil of Turpentine, with rectifi'd Spirit of Wine, both actually hot; as that famous Chyrurgeon Mr. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose Parey</hi> adviseth in his ninth Book, Chap. 11. of which I have had large experience with good success.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98252:22"/>The like course may be taken with all other wounds of the nervous parts.</p>
               <p>But if the wound of the Nerve or Tendon yield not to this medicine, the same is to be cut asunder cross-ways, seeing it is safer to lose the action of one part, than that the sick should be exposed to the danger of a deadly Convulsion.</p>
               <p>When the Nerves or Tendons of the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are prickt by sharp splinters of bones, the grievous pains succeeding, soon cause a particular Convulsion of that part, and at length an universal Convulsion will attend the Patient, if there be not speedy help.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if possible, the sharp fragments of the bone must be cut away; or if this have been neglected, or could not be done, and an universal Convulsion be feared, you must hasten to amputation of the member; For, <hi>Necessitas non habet legem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a particular Convulsion be occasion'd by a hot Tumour or any other sharp pain, which hath rais'd an inflammation; let the pain be diminisht as well by internal, as external Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines and Narcoticks, to allay the over en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd motion of the Animal spirits.</p>
               <p>To this end you may give the sick two or three grains of <hi>Laudanum opiat.</hi> at a time, either in a Pill, or dissolve it in a little Wine or other convenient Vehicle.</p>
               <p>And if the ingenious and judicious Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,

               <p>And seeing there is little difference, in the remote causes of them in the Body; these diseases may (for the most part) be cured with the same Remedies.</p>

               <p>To temper and diminish these humours, I commend these medicines.</p>

four spoonfulls of this Infusion, with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Spirit and <hi>Elixir.</hi>

               <p>The peccant humours being temper'd and diminisht, by the frequent use of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said medicines; the inordinate, involuntary and impetuous motion of the Animal spirits, (in Convulsive and Epileptick fits) will be the better reduc'd to a calm and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motion, by the help of volatile and spirituous Sudorificks, mixt with Anodines, and Narcotick medicines us'd in a small quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and at times; which two will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to be given together, because then they will the better circulate to the Animal spirits, and temper and educe the hurtfull flatuous Vapours.</p>
               <p>For which I commend the following form.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Bathing hath been often us'd (with good success) in these diseases.</p>
               <p>A natural sulphureous Bath, such as is in the City of <hi>Bath,</hi> is excellent; but when it is not to be had, an artificial Bath may serve.</p>
               <p>That which is set down in the Cure of the Palsie and Apoplexy, is of excellent Virtue, and very effectual in these distempers.</p>

               <p>When the fit is upon the sick, they do imagine that some Witch or Hag lieth hard on their Breast or Stomach, (from whence it hath also acquired that Name) in which they cannot stir, nor call for help, though they have a great desire, and do strive very much to cry out, but are possessed with a panick fear.</p>

               <p>The external are either an intent looking at any object that turns round, or about, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if very remote; or a frequent turning about of the Body it self.</p>
               <p>The internal cause, is the ascent of flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vapours to the Head, together with the spirituous part of the Bloud, and carried with the Animal spirits, into the passages of the Brain, and <hi>Cerebellum</hi>; by which the motion of wheeling about is communicated to the Animal spirits, and anon carried to the Cristalline humour of the Eyes, by the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick nerves; and so a Giddiness seems to be produc'd.</p>

               <p>The external causes are gross food, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, spirituous wine, or any other inebriating liquour taken in excess; and sometimes by the Air inspir'd, which is defil'd by the Smoak of Coals, or other mineral Fumes, by which the Air may be infested.</p>
               <p>The internal cause, is a Narcotick force mix'd with the Animal spirits, bred by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the Body, by the frequent use of opiats, not well corrected, which not onely dulls the mind, but causeth a sluggishness of the whole Body; for the Animal motion being deprav'd, the external, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal senses, will be thence soon infected, and defil'd.</p>

               <p>The Animal spirits may be freed from the Narcotick force mingled with them, (and likewise slothfulness, and sleepiness may be (by little and little) diminished,) by the frequent use of sharp volatile Salts, and all Medicines endued with an Aromatick biting; such as Pepper, Cloves, Castor, Garlick, Horse-radish, Mustard, Scurvigrass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of which you may make diversity of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, for example.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is a furious alienation of the mind, or a vehement <hi>delirium</hi> without a Fever; in which it differs from the Phrensie.</p>
               <p>I know there are not wanting the works of great Physicians, who have written very learnedly of these diseases; but omitting the opinion of others; I shall in a few words,


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98252:31"/>
relate that which seems true to me, to be the cause of these furious distempers.</p>
               <p>None who are ingenious Searchers of Truth; and have weighed accurately (with an attentive mind) both the fabrick and ways, or Vessels of the containing Body, and the natural motion of the Bloud, and other humours; will deny, that almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable diseases do arise from the vitious effervescency of over fat Choler, the too tart Pancreat juice, and over viscous Phlegm, flowing together in the small guts; for by this vitiated mingling not onely hurtfull humours are produc'd, but often wind, and halituous Vapours, causing much harm to humane Bodies.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I judge, when Phlegm is very viscous, or otherwise vitious,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </note> and the juice of the Pancreas too tart and harsh; sharp halituous Vapours are thence produc'd, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated from the small guts, because of a viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effervescency there rais'd; and thence continually ascending to the Head; and with the spirituous Bloud, circulate into the Ventricles of the Brain, by which the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal spirits are vitiated, and troublesomely mov'd, and hindred of natural rest and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; therefore 'tis no wonder that the Empty mind of the sick is thereby disturb'd, and at length the sick become distracted and mad.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:98252:32"/>But if Choler be predominant, these va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours become very cholerick and acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; which rarifies the Bloud by degrees more and more; so that at length the heat and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fever in the Heart, (and thence through the whole Body) is encreased by Choler successively over-ruling, which causeth the Phrensie.</p>
               <p>No marvel then if heat, pain, and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and pulsation of the Head do chiefly vex the sick in this grievous distemper; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no part of the Body hath so many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and receives so much Bloud as the Head; wherefore the pulsation of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is felt more troublesome than elsewhere, because of the remarkable windings of the Brain, through which great Arteries are carried; from whence great watchings, and at length raving Madness do molest the sick.</p>
               <p>But there still remains something requisite to be set down, as the chief cause of these, and most other distempers, which ought not to be despis'd (either by Jew or Gentile) seeing we have the word of God for it; and that is the crying sins of Mankind continually drawing God's Judgments on them.</p>
               <p>You may reade the 28<hi>th.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomie,</hi> where the Prophet <hi>Moses</hi> enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the many diseases, with which God


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98252:32"/>
would smite the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> for the wickedness of their doings, whereby they had forsaken him.</p>
               <p>And not onely they, but we also shall be subject to these grievous distempers, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal destruction also, if we do not turn to the Lord by unfeigned repentance, <hi>except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish,</hi> saith our blessed Saviour Jesus Christ in <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. Verse.</p>
               <p>Those poor creatures who have been miserably afflicted with these furious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, and happily recovered; can tell by sad experience, that they have been many times hurried almost to desperation, by the cunning wiles and temptations of Satan; which hath prevail'd on many to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands on themselves; from which let us pray, <hi>libera nos Domine.</hi>

'tis mortal; so likewise is it very pernicious, if it turn either to the Lethargy, or Convulsion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Principiis obsta, sero medicina paratur: Cum mala per longas invaluere moras.</hi> For unless speedy help be procur'd for the <hi>Phrensie,</hi> it killeth the party in a short time: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Mania</hi> or Madness becomes oft (by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees) so stubborn, and rebellious, that it can be cur'd onely late or never.</p>
               <p>Ttherefore the friends of the sick are to be admonish'd to consult with the honest Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, so soon as the signs begin to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest; for when it hath taken deep root, it is hard to be eradicated, or overcome, unless by an Herculean labour.</p>
               <p>First therefore let a Clyster be administred.</p>

               <p>After the Operation of it, you may open a Vein in the Arm.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>Menses,</hi> or the Haemorrhoids be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, then open the Saphena, in either Foot; and let the orifice be made pretty large, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thereby sharp and fatty vapours may more plenteously be effus'd together with the bloud: whereby the troublesome heat will be the better temper'd, and not a little diminisht.</p>
               <p>Neither will it suffice to let bloud once, but this evacuation is oft to be iterated, till (by the diminisht feverish heat) it appears that the cause is remov'd or overcome.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of CATARRHS.</head>
               <p>THE Catarrh is called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     </gap>, fluo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is called in Latin <hi>distillatio,</hi> because it is a defluxion of excrementitious and sharp Rheumatick humours from the Head, into most parts of the Body; invading not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the conglobated, and conglomerated Glandules; by which the Circulation of <hi>Lympha</hi> and Spittle are deprav'd: But also the Nerves, which causeth intense or vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pains, and inflammations in the parts ill affected, which is most commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a Symptomatical Fever, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the Rheum be thin and sharp, and do flow very violently.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98252:37"/>And seeing this distemper is not enough explain'd in Authours, either ancient or modern; I therefore (God prospering my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours) will bestow some pains in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and proposing the true causes and effects of it; which I hope will induce other liberal and ingenious spirited Artists to a farther inquiry after the occult causes, not onely of these, but other obscure diseases daily occurring in practice; that so by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, many things in the Art of Physick, as yet most obscure and confus'd, may be illustrated, and most commodiously explain'd.</p>
               <p>Experience confirms, that there are many kinds of Catarrhs; some are more thick, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more thin; some acid and salt, others more sweet; some Rheums are hot and sharp, flowing more violently, other cold and pituitous, flowing but slowly; hence it is, that some Catarrhs are attended with Fevers, and some without.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </note>The causes of Catarrhs are either external, or internal.</p>
               <p>The external cause is from external sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Cold, shutting the pores of the skin, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the discharge of sweaty Vapours by insensible Transpiration; for if the usual ports of the skin do deny passage to the sweat, it will in a little time condense, and thence become sour, by which the extreme


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98252:37"/>
parts are chilled, which doth manifest it self by a shivering; as any one may experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally observe after taking Cold.</p>
               <p>These humours having not vent through the porous skin (which is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) by the habit of the Body; they are conveyed to the Head (together with the <hi>Lympha</hi>) through the Lymphatick Vessels.</p>
               <p>The internal cause arises from pituitous humours, gradually collected (besides Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) in the conglobated Glandules, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveable about the <hi>Plexus Choroides</hi> in the side Ventricles of the Brain, and elsewhere; perhaps in the Tonsils, and all the rest of the small Glandules about the <hi>trachaea Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>; hence the <hi>Lympha</hi> becomes sourish salt, as is tasted in a <hi>Coryza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence also we may probably conclude, what way soever the conglobated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules are hurt, that the <hi>Lympha</hi> declines from its natural State and Quality: And as its depravation is milder or sharper, more grievous, or lighter pains are thence bred; of which we have many times an ocular demonstration in the flowing down of the Rheum through the Nostrils, which is oft so sharp, that it doth corrode the skin, and superficies of the face where it comes.</p>
               <p>If it be in quantity moderate, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed to the infinite little salivary Ducts or Chanels, in the conglomerated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98252:38"/>
which open into the palate of the mouth, and there pour out the salival Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour which they contain; which is either swallowed down into the Stomach, or else it is evacuated by spitting; and if Nature be overburthened by its plentifulness, it is also sent forth by the Nostrils.</p>
               <p>But if the <hi>Lympha</hi> becomes more sharp, acid and salt in the Glandules before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, it produceth first a stoppage, and burthensome Pain of the Head, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the retentive, and provokes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive faculties; so that Nature being driven to most violent motions, doth extravasate, and intravasate the Rheumatick humours, <hi>hic &amp; ubique, a Capite ad Calcem,</hi> through the most abstruse and inconspicuous passages of nature; so that it is the opinion of many learned Physicians, that a Catarrh is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of many diseases incident to humane Bodies.</p>

               <p n="2">2. If the Rheum flow through the Nostrils, it is but gentle; if to the Throat 'tis worse, but if to the Lungs, worst of all; and if it becomes inveterate, it is very hardly cured.</p>

                  </note> the Head is chiefly to be taken care of, because the Rheum doth continually flow from it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Head ought to be corroborated, and the superfluous moisture thereof to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up: And likewise the part or parts (to which the Rheum flows) must be strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; the vitious quality of <hi>Lympha,</hi> and the other humours is to be corrected, and their plenty diminisht.</p>
               <p>As Catarrhs consist of a different matter, and afflict divers parts, so they require di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of medicines to cure them; for if the matter be thick and viscous, it must be attenuated and cut with Aromaticks, and afterward evacuated with Phlegmagogues: So likewise serous and salt Catarrhs are to be temper'd with Oily things and Opiats, and the plenty of humours to be diminisht with Hydragogues; by which means the cure will be the sooner performed.</p>
               <p>For viscous Catarrhs, accompanied with a Cough, I commend these following medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>

               <p>As in other distempers always, so let me here admonish you in general, to be very diligent to attend to the medicines that most conduce to every particular Body, whereby they may be prefer'd before the rest; and as long as they profit, continue in the use thereof, that so the health of the sick may be every way promoted.</p>
               <p>When much bloud is voided by cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is great danger;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sputum Sanguinis.</hi>
                  </note> wherefore we must hasten the more to its cure; lest the opportunity here (if any where urgent) be lost by delay; for the singular substance of the Lungs is easily infected and corrupted, but difficultly restor'd and repair'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bloud carried down from the Head into the Lungs, and raising a Cough, is to be stopt in its efflux.</p>
               <p>To this end let a Vein be opened, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if a <hi>Plethora</hi> concur, or there be a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table heat of Bloud, or a suppression of its wonted emptying.</p>
               <p>After bleeding, let the over great heat be allay'd with sour and tart medicines; for example take the following Decoction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:98252:41"/>Take of Plantane, Housleek, Wood-sorrel, of each two handfulls;<note place="margin">

               <p>The flux of bloud may be stopt by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinating medicines, which have power to close the Vessels, either broken by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent coughing, or corroded by the sharpness of the descending Rheum.</p>
               <p>

               <p>This choice medicine often taken, will cure the most ruptions of vessels, and will soon stop the flux of bloud, beyond expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but I advise, that a sparing use of it should be continued for some time, after the disease is cur'd to sense, whereby the affected parts may be strengthned against the access of a new evil.</p>

               <p>If the Lungs be ulcerated, the Cure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will be promoted, if you add two or three drops of Balsam of Sulphur, with Oil of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise-seed, to every spoonfull that you give of the aforesaid medicine, or in any pectoral Decoction; it must be given oft in a day; the better to finish the Cure.</p>
               <p>In all Catarrhs if the Rheum have been long, you may use a Decoction of <hi>China,</hi> which will wonderfully temper the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; or you may add <hi>lign. sanctum, sassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras, sarsaparilla, &amp;c.</hi> which will dry up the Rheum by degrees.</p>

with Choler, it riseth to the Thoracick pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, by the Lacteal Veins, and so to the Heart and Lungs, and filling the airy conduits thereof, and sticking there, it causeth a brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with snorting.</p>
               <p>The same humour is also carried to the Stomach, which causeth many sour Belchings in this distemper; and if these flatuous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours become more sharp than viscous; so often as they come to the Lungs, they pierce into the sharp Artery, and do so provoke and molest it, that thereby the Lungs are compelled to cough, by which the Expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Air is deprav'd.</p>

                  </note>If there be much moisture contain'd in the sharp Artery, it will be the easier ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the help of coughing, but if the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea Arteria</hi> be affected with driness, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is spit out, though with great and much labour, but the universal Body is wearied in vain with indeavouring to cough; whence there is sometimes raised a vehement Pain both of the Head and Hypochondries, and other parts; yea sometimes a Rupture is bred by it, and the Urine and Excrements are thereby often involuntarily extruded.</p>

               <p>If the Patient hath a costive Body, let carminative Clysters be often administred; and if the Body be plethorick, let a vein be opened, either in the Foot, or apply Leeches to the Haemorrhoid veins, which will much conduce to free the respiration.</p>

               <p>After a sufficient quantity of bloud is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, it will be profitable to give a Sudorifick.</p>

               <p>But when there is much heat in the part inflam'd, beware of all unctuous things, and let your Fomentations and Cataplasms be made with Butter-milk, which doth egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously temper heat, and hinder St. <hi>Anthonie</hi>'s fire from being easily join'd with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation.</p>
               <p>The generation of matter being promoted, and the Tumor come to suppuration, let it be opened either with an Instrument or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Cauterie, in the softest and lowest

part of it; and let the matter be evacuated by little and little, because otherwise the strength of the sick will not be a little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, especially when there is much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in the Aposteme; wherefore let not the Tumor be pressed hard, which is familiar with many Chyrurgions, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proves prejudicial to the Patient.</p>
               <p>If the Orifice be too small, you may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it with a tent made of spunge dipt in Melilot pla<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I have often considered (with admiration) the laudable effect of Balsam of Sulphur with Oil of Turpentine,<note place="margin">

               <p>By this experiment not a little to be esteem'd I judge the cleansing and consolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ulcers following Apostemes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

in the correction of acid and corroding matter, adhering to the Ulcer, and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bloud, (at least in part that is apt to nourish it) and turning it into new matter; which may be corrected by the mention'd Balsam of Sulphur which is not onely Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, but abounds with a volatile oily Salt; by which the acid Spirit (which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the bloud into matter) is not onely dull'd, but so amended, that the bloud flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it soon repairs the parts before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd, and finisheth the last consolidation.</p>

               <p>The purulent matter of the Ulcer circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the bloud, doth infect, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees corrupt the whole mass of it, which makes it unfit for nourishment; hence it is that all the parts of the body do waste and consume.</p>
               <p>The causes are many,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Causes.</hi>
                  </note> sometimes purulent matter may be communicated to the Lungs, from the Plurisie or <hi>Empiema,</hi> inflaming and corrupting them, which causeth an Ulcer.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a salt and sharp Rheum flowing down from the Head to the <hi>Trachea Arteria,</hi> which doth not onely cause a vehement Coughing, but doth corrode the Lungs, being naturally tender; Hence an Ulcer will be caused.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:98252:51"/>Also many times <hi>Pustules,</hi> or <hi>Tubercles,</hi> are generated in the Lungs, and coming to suppuration, they break; and the matter flowing to the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> it may be spit up, if the Patient have strength; but oft times an Ulcer remaineth, which causeth a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</p>
               <p>These causes depend sometimes on Choler, sometimes on the juice of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on Spittle, sometimes on Chyle, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on <hi>Lympha</hi> any way Vitiated, by which the mass of bloud (in time) becomes also corrupted.</p>
               <p>When the Lungs decline from their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral consistency, they Will soon become hard and tumorous, and so by degrees they will be corrupted, and ulcerated; and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Ulcer corrupting, and makeing the mass of bloud glutinous, in circulating with it, doth so weaken and corrupt all the parts of the body, that they become unfit to perfect natural nourishment; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of necessity the universal body must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume and pine away; sometimes it is caused by an obstruction of the lacteal veins, which hindreth the natural passage of the <hi>Chylus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Authours mention many more causes of Consumptions; as <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> Nocturnal Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, want of Nourishment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

causing a violent Cough, by which the Lungs are exasperated, and there follows a Hectick Fever, sometimes putrid, from the purulent matter flowing into the Veins.</p>
               <p>To know whether the Lungs be ulcerated, let the Patient spit into water; if it sinks it is matter, which is an infallible sign of an Ulcer; for Phlegm always swims in water.</p>

               <p>The heat in an Hectick Fever is but little, and therefore rarely troublesome to the sick, except one or two hours after meat; at which time the heat is a little sharpned and increased, which may be known by an over frequent though weak Pulse; but it soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again to its former equality.</p>

                  </note>In the beginning when the moisture begins to fail, the Hectick Fever is not easily discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned because there is still sufficient moisture to entertain the natural heat; but if (by the long continuance of the Hectick Fever) the radical moisture of the solid parts begins to consume, it may then be easily known, for there follows a continual and lingring lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the whole body; which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to its extremity, may be call'd in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:98252:52"/>The External causes are all that may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion any of the other Fevers, for oft times Hectick Fevers are observ'd to follow other diseases, and especially Fevers of one day, proceeding from a great errour in Diet, and also from continual, and intermitting Fevers, when they are very vehement; but most frequently from Inflammations of the Bowels, especially of the Lungs, for when an Ulcer follows, then the whole mass of bloud is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by matter, and gets a singular gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness; which being communicated to the other humours, spoils them with the same fault, and renders them unfit to perform the natural Functions rightly.</p>
               <p>Sometimes Hectick Fevers are observ'd to arise immediately from excess of the nonna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, as most vehement anger, too much watchings, immoderate sorrow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued labour, want of food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Internal cause is, the over viscousness of the bloud and humours, because of which not onely the appetite of all food is dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and at length dejected, but the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment of all the parts of the body is dayly decreas'd; for when there is loathing of food, then fermentation, separation of usefull from unusefull parts, sanguification, generation of the Animal Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is hindred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed; whence the toughness, and slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishness of Choler, Spittle, the juice of the


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98252:53"/>
                  <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Lympha,</hi> is dayly augmented, and the evil becomes by degrees greater, and at length incurable.</p>

                  </note>If you perceive that there is so much of the radical moisture remaining, as is able to cherish the natural heat, which you may discern, if the colour of the body be fresh, if the figure be decent, if the proportion of the parts be according to nature, and the sick can (in some good measure) perform all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you may conceive some hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
               <p>But if the Body be extenuated, almost like a <hi>Sceleton, viz.</hi> when the body seemeth to be nothing else but Skin and Bone, (as the vulgar proverb is) acquaint the sick with the danger, least Death seize upon them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared.</p>

                  </note>The Cure of a Consumption, and Hectick Fever, will differ not a little, according to the diversity of causes producing them.</p>
               <p>When an Hectick Fever comes with, or succeeds Fevers with or without fits, then upon their account, the cure may be varied according to the divers harm of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, differently peccant.</p>
               <p>If a Consumption, or Hectick Fever, be caused by purulent matter from an Ulcer of


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98252:53"/>
the Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then you must endeavour to free the bloud and humours from matter, which may be done by any Antimonial me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines rightly prepared, perhaps before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; whether they be Diaphoreticks, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or Vomiters, as experience doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest; for it hath been observ'd, (even in a Phthisick, and an inveterate great Ulcer of the Lungs) to bring away a good quantity of matter, by Stool and Urine, so that then for many days, no matter was cast forth by a Cough.</p>
               <p>Among common things, all Vulnerary plants are good used in Decoctions. Let this or one like it, be a form of a Decoction in this case.</p>
               <p>Take the Roots of Plantain, Comfry, Round-birthwort, Liquorish, of each two ounces; Fennel, Scabious, Plantain, of each two handfulls; Figs, Raisons of the sun sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, of each four ounces; let them be all cleansed, bruised and boiled in three quarts of Barley-water till a third part be boiled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; then strain it, and add Syrups of Hore-hound, and Hyssop, of each two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>Laudanum opiatum</hi> ten grains. Mix it. Let the sick drink two ounces of this Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion oft in a day; and if you add one or two drops of Balsam of Sulphur with Oil of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise-seed to every draught, it will be the more effectual. The Balsam prepared of the truly


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98252:54"/>
Sulphureous and inflameable Flowers of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, is most excellent in this distemper, if it may be had, which may be taken as the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam of Sulphur.</p>
               <p>Also those medicines may be used which mildly amend and correct the viscousness, and glutinousness of all the humours; for which I commend all mild Aromaticks, and Oily Volatile Salts, as that cut and alter every viscous humour, and reduce it into its natural state.</p>
               <p>Those medicines are to be selected as do most conduce to, and agree with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of every sick person.</p>
               <p>Vitriolated Tartar is an excellent medicine, which will agree with all constitutions, and may be taken from ten to twenty grains (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other morning) in a little warm Broth.</p>
               <p>Also the following medicine is very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note>Take the Powder of Cream of Tartar, and Tartar Vitriolated, of each half a drachm; Volatile Salt of Harts-horn, Salt of Amber, of each ten grains. Mix it for two doses, which may be taken in Chicken Broth, in the morning.</p>
               <p>These choice medicines will conduce much to cleanse the bloud and humours from all purulent matter, if there be any hopes of the Patient's recovery.</p>
               <p>All Effusions of Bloud, Seed and Milk,

are to be shun'd, except the wonted empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which are natural and serve the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual.</p>
               <p>Let the motions of the Mind be moderate, and the exercise of the Body be gentle, and let sleep and watchings keep a mediocrity.</p>
               <p>Appoint a moistning and nourishing Diet, which is of easie fermentation, as Broth, and Jellies of young Creatures, and Milk of Goats, Sheep and Cows, and chiefly of wholsome Women.</p>
               <p>A Panado made with the Broth of a Chicken, the Crums of White-bread, and the Yelk of a new laid Egg, may sometimes be given the sick for a change.</p>

               <p>As for Fruit, Apples are much commended, especially Pippins, and Permains, which will much refresh the sick. If the Patient be cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, you may sometimes administer a Clyster of Milk and the yelk of an Egg.</p>

               <p>These humours are mov'd and driven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, either by their vitious effervescency; or else they are stirr'd up by violent motion or exercise of the Body, especially in the quick ascending of a steep hill; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are constrain'd, or urg'd by grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Passions of the mind.</p>

               <p>It may also be caused by the biting or stinging of any venemous Creature, and by any other vehement pain.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it is produc'd by a great heat, either of the Sun, Fire, Bath or Fever.</p>
               <p>Any of these Causes mention'd (being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme) may so change, and diminish the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral effervescency, and rare faction of the bloud, that the Heart it self is not thereby enough expanded, and contracted: So that the vital bloud cannot be sufficiently effus'd into the Arteries; and therefore the Pulse is felt less and more languishing, yea sometimes none.</p>
               <p>The internal Cause is glutinousness encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the bloud, and the other humours; and sometimes an encreased Acidity in the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas, Lympha</hi> and Spittle; by which the Circulation of the Bloud and Humours becomes too slow; hence the Ventricles of the Heart are not enough dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which causeth the Pulse to be weaker than is natural, for the effervescency of the bloud and humours being not potent enough, cannot provoke the Heart to contract it self, and therefore a Swouning or Syncope will inevitably ensue.</p>

               <p>Therefore to correct and amend the said humours abounding, both in the universal Body, and Bloud; I will here set down some forms of select medicines, for the sake of young Physicians.</p>

               <p>Two or three ounces of this Decoction may be taken at any time, twice in a day, either before or after meat, that so the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the medicine may mildly mix and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate it self, not onely with the food, but with Spittle in the Stomach, and also with the threefold humour flowing together in the small Guts; and thence with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal bloud and humours in all the Veins and Arteries; whereby the desired amendment, and correcting of them will be performed, sooner, easier and more happily.</p>
               <p>If any like a medicinal Wine better, they may infuse the aforesaid Ingredients in a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity of White-wine, and drink it daily both at dinner and supper time.</p>
               <p>These choice Medicines may be continued for some time; but when the sick is weary of them, you may use the same Ingredients in the form of a Powder, or Electuary, or make them into Troches, with Syrup of <hi>Stae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas,</hi> Mugwort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>When either of these fits urgeth, or is upon the party, you must use those outward things, which may stir up the external sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; as frictions of the external parts, shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Ears; also make a smoak with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or Partridg Feathers at the nose, or hold the Spirit of Salt Armoniack, (in a narrow mouth'd glass) to the Nostrils.

               <p>It is called <hi>febris in</hi> latin <hi>a fervore, quasi fervens,</hi> because it is a hot distemper.</p>
               <p>A Fever is a nonnatural heat, which may be so termed, because it is more than nature requires, for the continual management of her vital functions; for when nature is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or over-burthned by any distemper, there is a strugling endeavour of nature her self to remove it, which causeth this non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural heat.</p>
               <p>It may be called the Prince of diseases, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the general door, through which most of humane mortals take their <hi>exit</hi> of this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:98252:61"/>The cause of the preternatural frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the pulse, is either a permanent and over rarefaction of the bloud, or any sharp, sour, or salt vapour carried to the Heart, corroding the internal substance of it; by which the <hi>Archaeus</hi> or vital Airy spirit of the Heart is provoked to allarm all the faculties, and powers both vital and natural, that it may the more couragiously resist its inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Enemy, so that the spirits are thereby much stirred up and inflamed; from whence proceedeth a Conflagration, or vitious Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescency of the Bloud and Humours through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Body.</p>
               <p>Fevers are either continual, or intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>A continual Fever is that which remains from the first moment of its invasion, to the last of its duration.</p>
               <p>When a continual Fever is very mild, and remains but one day; it is called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>It is called in Latin <hi>Diaria, &amp; Ephemera febris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Fever is often excited by sudden passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind, as vehement anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and also by our abode too long in the Sun, or by vitiously using any other of the six nonnatural things so called; for which there is no great need to prescribe Medicines for a Cure, it being not difficult, the very nature

of such a Fever terminating it self, most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by a breathing sweat, especially if you substract the Patient from the inflammatory Cause.</p>
               <p>If the Fever continues longer, it may be called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ex <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The continual Fever is also called <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona, quae similem calorem ad finem usque ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is also called <hi>Acmastica, quae continuo crès<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit &amp; intenditur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Synochus,</hi> or continual Fever, may be divided into two sorts,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that which is not putrid, called in Latin <hi>Synochus non putrida,</hi> and that which is putrid, called <hi>Synochus putrida.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a <hi>Synochus non putrida,</hi> the bloud, and other humours is a little sharper than is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and the heat somewhat great and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous, declining a little to the nature and manner of those called putrid.</p>
               <p>Continual Fevers are oft times mixt or compounded with those intermitting, having some fits, and again remissions, so that they are not intermitting, but still remain conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:98252:62"/>These fits come sometimes every day, sometimes the third, and sometimes the fourth day; whence it may deservedly be nam'd, either a Quotidian, Tertian, or Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan continual Fever.</p>
               <p>These Fevers upon the account of their divers causes, may not unfitly be distinguish'd into Cholerick and Lymphatick Fevers.</p>
               <p>And because under the general name of <hi>Lympha,</hi> we do not onely comprehend, that <hi>Lympha</hi> which goes from the conglobated Glandules, and other parts to the Heart; but also the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and Spittle it self, proceeding from the conglomerated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, and also the Liquour that ariseth from the three-fold sway of the Guts, all mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Lympha,</hi> and the bloud in circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with it.</p>
               <p>Hence may Lymphatick fevers be subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into glandular, pancreatick and salivary Fevers.</p>
               <p>All these Fevers may differ something accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the divers Constitution of other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours together being in the Body.</p>
               <p>But I shall wave the nice descriptions and differences of Fevers, and let the dextrous, and judicious Physician put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as their Symptoms shall direct and indicate, for though there are many sorts of continual Fevers not putrid, yet the Cure is almost the same in all; I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

(in a few words) mention some of their differences, taken from the more grievous Symptoms oft accompanying them; after the example of famous Practioners, and chiefly great <hi>Platerus,</hi> and the most famous <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and judicious <hi>Sylvius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, let us take notice of the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heat, and most urgent burning,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</hi>
                  </note> which attend some Fevers.</p>

                     <hi>Causes.</hi>
                  </note> which doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie burning; in which the sick is very dry and thirsty, which is hard to be quenched.</p>
               <p>This heat is not of the essense of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, but proceedeth from the inflamed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as is before mention'd in page 98.</p>
               <p>Neither doth the great thirst in Fevers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from heat and driness, as in a true and natural thirst, but from some excrementitious matter, which adhereth to the sensitive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the internal membrane of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which is common to the Throat, Mouth and Lips, as that famous Physician, and ingenious Anatomist Doctour <hi>Alexander Read,</hi> did well observe; which is also the cause, that those parts are always afflicted in this dry and thirsty distemper.</p>
               <p>In this Symptome, Choler is peccant, not onely in a salt Acrimony, but also an infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable oiliness; hence the Pulse is very great, and over frequent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:98252:63"/>2. Raving may be oft observ'd in many Fevers, which is grievous to the sick for some time, chiefly when the Fever is malign, or epidemical.</p>
               <p>The cause of this is Choler peccant as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, which so diminisheth the viscousness of the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> that it causeth a vitious Effervescency with it, and being made sharper, it produceth a humour not much unlike black Choler, which causeth the Head-ach, and Watchings, and hence Ravings, and at length sometimes Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Death it self.</p>
               <p>There are many more Symptoms belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to continual or synochal Fevers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As first, a speedy wasting of several parts of the body, caused by Choler, the Cure whereof may be referred to the Cure of a Hectick Fever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A malignity, which suddenly dejecteth the vital strength, without manifest cause; which for the most part is Epidemical. But of this I intend to treat particularly in Chap. 8. of this Book.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The last Symptome which I shall here mention, is seldom observ'd; in which (all the time of the disease) the external parts are cold, while the internal parts burn; and therefore 'tis called by the Latins <hi>Lipyria fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:98252:63"/>Some think this distemper consists of a double Fever, Cholerick, and Pancreatical; and not without reason, because such like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours may be continually rais'd in the small guts, by the Juices of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over-sour; which may be confus'd onely with the Mass of Bloud, and breed a sense of cold in the habit of the Body, whilst a burning heat is stir'd up in the internal parts by a Fever, caused by Choler more oily than sharp.</p>
               <p>The cause of every continual Fever not putrid, is sometimes Choler vitiated,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </note> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Lympha</hi> together with the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> and Spittle, and many times all these together are ill affected.</p>
               <p>These vitiated humours flowing always to the Heart, cause a continual Effervescency in the right Ventricle of it; whence the Pulse is continually produc'd more frequent against nature.</p>
               <p>Fevers in Children are caused either by the Food abounding in quantity, or by some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious quality of it, or from an ill disposition of the digestive ferment.</p>
               <p>Milk is the general Food of Children, and there is such a propensity in its own nature to curdle, that if it be not quickly digested, it obeyeth the acid Ferment of the Stomach, and is soon coagulated like new tough Cheese, and if it be not speedily vomited up, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets

                  </note>The Stomach (in continual Fevers) is most commonly primarily affected through undigestion, or else from Excrements, not being separated and orderly evacuated; which causeth an irregular Ferment, or nonnatural heat in the Stomach; which (though begun else where) is much aggravated by vitiating Juices, found in this first Elaboratory of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:98252:64"/>For as in humane frame, the first heat of Nature (preparatory to all her depending motions) is the digestive heat for Chylifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Stomach; so likewise the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting or exasperating of the same, either by the sour Ferments, or too much of the overflowing Gall, is the Cause of most Fevers.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the beginning of the Cure,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cure.</hi>
                  </note> evacuation by vomiting never ought to be neglected by the carefull Physician (provided it be duely timed) because then most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it removeth the sole cause of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verish Intemperature, without the help of any other means.</p>
               <p>And here I commend Antimonials well prepared, before all others, seeing that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony as well rightly prepar'd, as admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, serves no less to purifie Man's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy than Gold.</p>
               <p>But if the Patient's body be costive, and there be eminent signs of a <hi>Plethora,</hi> or great fulness of Bloud; then let a carminative Clys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be first administred, and after its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on let a Vein be opened, and draw seven or eight ounces of bloud at a time, and if there be occasion let it be reiterated; for I always prefer its repeated less diminution, (as need requires) sometimes instituted in the same day, before great evacuations made suddenly, which hath brought many Evils to the sick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:98252:65"/>It matters little what vein be opened, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in Women, because of the monthly Terms either at hand, or hindred.</p>
               <p>And seeing it is the duty of every honest Physician to be Natures helper, he ought to endeavour to remove all impediments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the sick may be cured more quickly, safely and pleasantly, without demurs, to magnifie the Cure, and inflame the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
               <p>Wherefore since the first curative intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of most Fevers, is the discharge of the first turgent <hi>Monitor</hi> from the Stomach, and adjacent parts by vomiting, as is before said.</p>
               <p>Let the Patient (upon the discovery of the assaulting Enemy) take an Antimonial Emetick, and if one doth not suffice, let it be reiterated; by which the Morbifick matter will be evacuated, nature calmed, and the contemperating of the incited, or enraged nonnatural heat, will be the easier performed.</p>
               <p>But here the Sex is to be consider'd, the Female not so well enduring this evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cautio.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:98252:65"/>Wherefore administer no Emetick to them, except they vomit very easily; but rather let the peccant humours be diminisht, or emptied out gradually by the following de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction to be taken twice a day to three or four ounces.</p>
               <p>Take the Roots of Parsly, Fennel,<note place="margin">

               <p>This pleasant Medicine will conduce much to correct the salt sharpness of Choler, and will also amend its Oily inflameableness, and separate it from the Bloud, and mildly dispose it, and the rest of the abounding hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to be voided out by stool.</p>
               <p>After these Evacuations, give the sick the following Medicine twice a day in a little thin broth, or Water-gruel.</p>

               <p>I shall now give some directions to young Physicians and Nurses, and so conclude this Chapter of Fevers in general.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, give no Opiats in the beginning of a Fever, because they tye up the <hi>Archaeus</hi> of the Stomach, and first passages, thereby hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it from expelling, the occasional cause of the Disease.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Give the sick neither Mithridate, nor <hi>Diascordium</hi> (as is the common custome) nor apply it to the Wrists, nor Stomach, (nor any thing else that is nauseous) whilst Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Disease are strugling; but if the Patient tends to coldness, you may moisten a piece of Rose-cake, or a tost of stale Bread in <hi>Sylvius</hi>'s Spirit, or for want thereof in Brandy dulcified, and apply it to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach twice a day, which will revive nature, and fortifie it against the invading Enemy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Give no meat whilst the disease is on them, for the Stomach is not fit to receive it, neither hath it strength to digest it; and therefore it will become a recruit or supply to the Disease, except it be speedily vomited up again.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it be a Child, give it not any Milk, and if it Suck, wean it; for Milk is the first matter, and foundation of this disease in them; neither give it Beer, nor water, nor


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98252:67"/>
any cooling things to correct the heat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it will weaken nature, and strengthen the Disease.</p>
               <p>But hot Posset-drink turn'd with White-wine, or sound Beer with a little Vinegar, may be drank liberally, after the Cause is removed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the sick be Adult, you may give two parts of Water, and one of good Wine, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther French Wine or Sherry; but Malaga, or any other sweet Wine is not so good.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When the Patient begins to recover, the plainest broths, and gruels, are the best; till then a little is too much; and if you did use Salt and Vinegar, instead of Spice and Sugar, it would agree better with them.</p>

               <p>AN intermitting Fever is that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns after intervalls, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter in divers Fits; whence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the divers space of every access or fit; the same gets also divers Names, for if a new Fit return daily, answering the precedent in proportion, it is called a Quotidian.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:98252:67"/>If it comes every other day, it is called a Tertian.</p>
               <p>If the fit return after two days intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is called a Quartan, and so forward, although Quintans, Sextans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are seldom observ'd.</p>
               <p>And here you may note, that intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fevers do but seldom return in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act intervall of natural days of twenty four hours; but return quicker or slower,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </note> for the most part; wherefore then they are said to anticipate the expected time for some hours, which is disliked, or to come later, which is commended by some.</p>
               <p>Although it matters not, whether the fits anticipate, or come later; if so be that their continuance, and the grievousness of Symptoms (daily accompanying) be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish'd.</p>
               <p>There is great diversity among Authours concerning the Causes of intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which I shall not insist on; but in a few words will set down the true Causes of them.</p>
               <p>The causes then, are either external,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Causes.</hi>
                  </note> or internal.</p>
               <p>The external Cause of Agues is a stop of the usual necessary discharge of fermenting humours; the porous skin (being shut by external sudden cold) denies passage to the constant discharge of the sweatty humours,


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98252:68"/>
which happens most commonly about Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn; and likewise when any comes sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly out of a hot Climate, into a cold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; for the sweatty Vapours being detain'd by the Constipation of the skin, or shutting of the Pores, the same condense, and thence become sour, which chills the external parts, and causeth the shaking, or shivering cold fit, at the first invasion of this disturbing Foreigner; after which the inflaming Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Choler (being exasperated) doth act its part, and (having gain'd Dominion) it doth rarefie the Bloud by degrees; whence the Pulse becomes greater and stronger) which is increas'd by an irritation of the Acrimony of Choler, and the rarefaction of the Bloud at the Heart; for the heat and burning in the Heart, and thence in the whole Body, is increas'd by Choler succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively over-ruling.</p>
               <p>The internal Cause of Agues or intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fevers, is an obstruction of one or more of the lateral ducts or branches of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> or Sweet-bread, by reason of viscous Phlegm; which being separated from the Bloud by the Glandules of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> is there collected by degrees; whence it is sent (in too large a quantity) to the main duct or pipe thereof, which detaineth the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> contrary to nature, which


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98252:68"/>
ought continually to flow into the small Gut called <hi>Duodenum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Juice of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally sourish, being compelled to stand still in its passage, quickly grows more acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, or acid; because the Volatile Spirit (which is naturally conjoin'd to it, to temper it) doth gradually fly away; by which this Juice (becoming more sharp and acid) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a putrefactive Ferment; whence at length it makes way through the obstructing Phlegm, and is effused into the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> where meeting with Choler, it stirs up a vitious effervescency, or preternatural Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from whence comes the Ague fit, with all its Symptoms; as in the beginning Horrour, Chilness, Cold, Shaking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then presently follows Reachings, Yawning, and Vomiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At length acrimonious and flatulent Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours (raised by the aforesaid vitious Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescency) are carried through the Lacteal veins, and Thoracick passage, and so through the <hi>Vena cava ascendens,</hi> (in what form soever) to the right Ventricle of the Heart; and by its Acrimony, alters and troubles the vital Effervescency, and by over stirring the Heart, causeth a more frequent Pulse; and many times produceth grievous Symptoms, as great Heat and Thirst, difficulty of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Heart-ach, Raving, Swouning, and

                  </note>The nature of viscous Phlegm is such, that though it be pierced through by the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> too acid and acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet it doth presently run together and unite again, and so repairs and renues the obstruction that was in part opened; and the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> being stopped as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, grows sour by standing still as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, so that it forceth through the Phlegm that stopped its natural passage, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth, a new fit; sooner or later, as the Phlegm (obstructing the lateral passage of the <hi>Pancreas</hi>) is pierced through by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Juice.</p>
               <p>For if the obstructing Phlegm be not very glutinous, and the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> be plentifull and acid, a new fit of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Fever will return in the space of twenty four hours, and therefore 'tis called a Quotidian<note place="margin">

                  </note>

               <p>But if the Phlegm be very viscous and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> be little in quantity, and also tart and obtuse; so much the slower will the new fit of the intermitting Fever be produced; so that it is sometimes three, sometimes four days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the returning of the fit; from whence it is called a Quartan, or Quintan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

Phlegm, and the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> are in a medium, <hi>viz.</hi> The Phlegm more glutinous and plentifull, than in the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian, but not so much as the Quartan; as likewise the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> is more in quantity, and more acid than in the Quartan, but not so plentifull and acid, as in a Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian) so oft new fits of intermitting Fevers will return almost every other day, from whence they may be called Tertians, which much differ in their Symptoms beyond what other intermitting Fevers do, although none of them return in the exact intervall of the Days or Hours before mention'd, but return quicker or slower for the most part.</p>

               <p>IN the Chapter of Fevers in general I told you, that Synochal, or continual Fevers, were without any fit, to their last and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ceasing; and likewise I did distinguish them into putrid, and not putrid.</p>
               <p>Those that are not putrid, have little or no malignity in them, but the putrid are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompanied with malignity.</p>

                  </note>A malignant Fever differs from others in this, that it draws its putrefaction immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98252:71"/>
from its own matter, putrefaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined with it; from whence the vital strength is suddenly, and unexpectedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; or far more grievous Symptoms oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, than are wont to be observ'd in such a like disease.</p>
               <p>Malign Fevers are either more acute, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in few days; or longer, continuing more days.</p>
               <p>And they are either contagious, and epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical raging among many in the same time, having a common cause, as the Air or Food vitiated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Infecting others, or else they are not contagious.</p>
               <p>Among contagious Fevers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Calenture.</hi>
                  </note> we may not neglect to speak something of a Calenture, because it is a contagious distemper, assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not onely those which use the Sea; but also many that live near the Sea-shore, in Sea-port Towns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are subject to it.</p>
               <p>The signs of this disease are a great pain of the Head,<note place="margin">

                  </note> sometimes with violent raging fits, and <hi>delirium,</hi> the rest of the Body being in good temper; the sick do fancy the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a green Meadow, and will indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to get into it.</p>
               <p>The cause of a Calenture is the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the Climate, together with ill diet, causing strong obstructions, and an ill habit of body, by which flatuous vapours are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd in the body, and in time ascend to the Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:98252:72"/>The cause of the malignity (in this, and all other putrid fevers) is a sharp volatile salt in the Air,<note place="margin">

                  </note> which is drawn into the Lungs by degrees, and weakens the liquor of the glandules (which is naturally sourish) and makes it sluggish, and of little force, whence the natural consistency of the bloud is diminish'd, and the separation of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal spirits often hindred.</p>
               <p>The sharp volatile salt aforesaid, may be also swallowed down with food or spittle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Stomach, or it may enter the pores of the body; by which not onely the liquor of the glandules, but the bloud also may be infected; hence depends the variety of symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which may be observ'd in these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.</p>

                     <hi>Signs.</hi>
                  </note>In Malign fevers, there oft precedes a light shivering, after which a gentle heat soon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; the pulse is frequent and unequal, though little and weak, and sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, the sick is often drowsie, and possest with a kind of Lethargy; and when they sleep, they are often vex'd with turbulent dreams; they are often grip'd in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and troubled with loathing and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, accompanied with the Head-each, raving, giddiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> also there is great thirst, weariness, and unquietness of the whole body; sometimes there happens cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick and setid loosnesses; and also a hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage

               <p n="2">2. If the sick get no ease after sweating promoted by Art, there is little hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; also if the extreme parts soon wax hot, and again are presently cold, 'tis an ill sign.</p>
               <p>First to preserve and defend the body from all malignity,<note place="margin">

               <p>I commend the frequent, and moderate use of sour and tart things mixt with all things potable, for the Patient's drink, or food; as Barberries, Quinces, Oranges, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates, Limmons, Wood-sorrel, Verjuice, Vinegar, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of malign Fevers, and also the Calenture, if a loathing urgeth, part of the acrimonious volatile salt adheres to the tunicles of the Stomach; wherefore in this Case, first administer an Antimonial Emetick, which is well prepared, mild and fixt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath an admirable sulphur in it, whereby any sharpness is wonderfully tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, and the Malign Poison is thereby in part sent out by Vomit and Stool.</p>

                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:98252:73"/>After the Operation of the Emetick, let a Cordial Sudorifick be presently admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, that the remaining part of the Malign Poison may be driven forward, and expelled most safely, and commodiously out of the Body.</p>

               <p>Let the sick take a quarter of this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick Julep, and dispose the Body to sweat, and after half an hour, take one or two spoonfulls more, and so go on, till a profitable Sweat follow.</p>
               <p>In the interim if the sick be thirsty, let them drink a little warm Broth temper'd to a gratefulness, with juice of Oranges, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, or Verjuice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the sweat will not onely be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, but also the hurtfull Acrimony of the peccant Salt will be corrected, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaged.</p>

                     <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </note>The Cause is chiefly the sins of Mankind, provoking the great God to send this Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous distemper as a judgment on them for their Impiety.</p>
               <p>The Cause (next to God's judgment) is a sharp venemous and contagious volatile Salt in the Air, very much heightned (inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Air into the Lungs, or is swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down with the food or spittle into the Stomach; it may also get in through the pores into the Body) by which the acid li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor in all the conglobated glandules is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made sluggish, that it doth not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate with its wonted force: whence the natural consistency and rarefaction of the Bloud is diminsht, and the separation of the Animal Spirits hindred; and the vital strength is much opprest, by which the Pulse becomes not onely little, but also languishing; till at length the Spirits are extinguisht, and Death (unexpected to many) carries them speedily (<hi>torrenti similis</hi>) in fiery Chariots, God knows where.</p>

                  </note>All the signs in Malign Fevers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (and much heightned) in the Pest; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many other grievous symptoms, as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrhaea, Hemorrhage at the Nose, Ears, Eyes, Mouth and Secrets; sometimes yellowness of the Eyes, Buboes in the Groins, Armpits, and behind the Ears, and in some white Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98252:74"/>
and Carbuncles, also spots called the Tokens, with raving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </note> therefore no certain prognostick can be drawn of it; for many have died when there hath been great hopes of recovery, and on the contrary, many have escaped with mortal signs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Bubo is less dangerous than a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle, and it than the spots, (vulgarly the Tokens) which most commonly portend Death wheresoever they are.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. If a Carbuncle rise after a Bubo, and look white, with a litle push or tail at the end of it, 'tis dangerous, except the Fever do very much abate; and if after cauterizing, or cupping, the Carbuncle abate not in twenty four hours, 'tis a sign of Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, except matter appear; and if Carbuncles seize the Stomach, Guts, Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or other Intrails, it portends Death.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Deliriums, Drowsiness, Heart-ach, Trembling, Convulsions, great driness of Tongue, are all bad signs; also a Dysentery


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98252:75"/>
is most commonly mortal; but a Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage at the Nose, or <hi>Menses</hi> are not so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <p>To preserve from this Pestiferous distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, although transmigration in the fear of God may be lawfull, yet let none think to escape by flying, and so neglect their duties to God, for 'tis impossible to run out of his reach, for he filleth Heaven and Earth with his presence; wherefore let servent prayers be put up to God, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions fail not; and then make use of an honest Physician.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You must endeavour to purifie the infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Air, with great fires, wash the house daily, and after sprinkle it with Vinegar; and Fume either with Pitch, Frankincense, Mirrh, Amber, Benjamin, Wood, and Berries of Juniper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>THE Small-pox, and Measles are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and in Latin <hi>Morbilli, quasi parvi morbi, vel parvorum morbi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are also called <hi>Variolae, &amp; Pustulae, ex vario, vel varium facio, quod cutis fit varia.</hi> Because the skin is of various forms.</p>
               <p>These distempers are most commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a Malign Fever, which oft proves Epidemical, Contagious and Mortal, and therefore may justly be termed Pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>
               <p>The Small-pox is a cutaneous Eruption, or large Pustules, something like to Warts on the Skin, with Inflammation, which in few days comes to suppuration, if the sick recover.</p>
               <p>The Measles are little Pustules in the Skin, with a deep redness, and may be best per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by feeling; they are usually discussed in five or six days without suppuration.</p>
               <p>There is an other sort of Pustules, or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles, like little Bladders, incident to Men, Women and Children; which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Inflammation or redness; and also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Fever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:98252:77"/>Some call them Cristals, others Blisters, but Country people call them Swine-pox, Hen or Chicken-pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these also may be referred, those red fiery spots which break out about the fourth or fifth day (in Malign Fevers) all over the Body; and if the sick recover, they vanish about the eighth day, after which the <hi>Cuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi> cometh away in flakes; this is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Scarlet Fever.</p>
               <p>The signs of the Small-pox approaching,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signs.</hi>
                  </note> are pains of the Head, shining before the Eyes, with redness and swelling of the Face, and sometimes bleeding at the Nose; also a grievous pain of the Back, which reacheth to the Neck, with great heat and pricking all over the Body; there is often loathing of the Stomach, and vomiting, with trembling of the Heart, great terrour in sleep, difficulty of breathing, and sometimes raving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion.</p>
               <p>The cause of the Small-pox and Measles, is an ill quality or impurity of the Mothers bloud,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Causes.</hi>
                  </note> with which the Child was nourish'd in the Womb, which doth communicate pollution, and defile the mass of Bloud; and after the Child is born, when there is an ill disposition of the Air proportionable to the disease, there followeth a peculiar efferves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency or ebullition of the Bloud and other humours, by which nature is inraged and


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98252:78"/>
provoked to cast forth the impurity.</p>
               <p>The excrementitious matter is either thin or thick; if it be thin, the Measles fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if thick, the Small-pox are produced.</p>
               <p>And if there be a Malignant constitution of the Air, it causeth not onely a purging forth of the corrupt matter of the Bloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but corrupteth the whole mass of Bloud, and so produceth a dangerous and Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Small-pox.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Progn.</hi>
                  </note>If they come out red, and soon ripen or turn white, being round pointed, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the skin; if the voice and breathing be free, without any grievous symptoms, there is no danger, but if there be a great Fever (which is not abated after their erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) with great thirst, and difficulty of breathing, also black or bloudy Urine, or Stool, Hemorrhage at the Nose, Mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth signifie a great acrimony, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of the bloud, that nature is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to evacuate it by such preposterous ways; and are most commonly mortal signs.</p>
               <p>So likewise if it be long e'er they come out, and they be green, blewish, or black, and sink in again, the sick is in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Death.</p>
               <p>As for the Cure of these distempers, if they be Malignant,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cure.</hi>
                  </note> or Epidemical, let the same means be used as is prescrib'd in Malignant Fevers, but if there be little or no sign of


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98252:78"/>
Malignancy, you may first administer an Antimonial Emetick, and after its operation, give this or the like Cordial.</p>

               <p>Let the sick take two or three spoonfulls of this every half hour till a sweat be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted; after sweating, keep the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in a warm Room, till the danger be over.</p>
               <p>Before the Eruption, (if there be eminent signs of a <hi>Plethora,</hi> and the sick be adult) Phlebotomy may be used with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Thirst is the first natural Passion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and also of Beasts; as is manifest by their first sucking milk out of the Breast to asswage it.</p>
               <p>The causes of thirst augmented,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </note> are either external or internal.</p>
               <p>The external are the Air over heated by


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98252:80"/>
the Sun, over salt Food, too much exercise of body, vehement passions of the mind, as much anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> prolong'd watches, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy either too costive, or too loose, much sweating, Urine voided too plentifully, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notable Evacuation of Bloud, Milk or Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The internal Cause is deduced (for the most part) from too sharp Choler, carried down into the small Gut; where it raiseth such an Effervescency with the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> flowing thither, that thence are elevated salt Vapours to the Stomach and Gullet, and there produceth a sense of drought.</p>
               <p>It may also pierce through the lacteal Vessels, and so to the Heart, and infect the Bloud too much with its Saltness, whence the Spittle, and the other Humours also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too salt, by which a great Thirst is stirred up and augmented.</p>

               <p>The following Julep may serve for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

               <p>If hunger be deprav'd in quality, then vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious things, which are not Food, (as Coals, Ashes, Clay, Turfs, Leather, and I know not what) are desired.</p>

               <p>In Latin 'tis called <hi>inappetentia,</hi> because in this distemper the sick hath no desire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter food, but their minds are averse to, yea they loath most kind of meat and drink, which sometimes riseth to that height, that it takes away their strength.</p>
               <p>This differs from vomiting onely in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, it being a desire to vomit up whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever troubles the Stomach, but cannot, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reason of weakness, or toughness of the matter.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>All loathing is either natural, or adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious.</p>
               <p>The natural (for the most part) is common to Women with Child; wherein 'tis thought by some, that the mind of the Child in the Womb is affected, as well in this distemper, as in the disease called <hi>Malacia,</hi> or longing; wherein if the Woman have not presently what she longs for, wheresoever she first puts


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98252:83"/>
her hand on any part of her body, in that part the Child is mark'd, as we may see often by experience.</p>
               <p>The adventitious loathing, or that which cometh by accident, is stir'd up in healthy People by prejudice, they esteeming some sorts of food ungratefull, or prejudicial to their Health, and therefore their Stomachs loath them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes nauseousness, and loathing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to vomiting, immediately follows In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance in eating and drinking, which is dangerous.</p>
               <p>That we may the better judge of the causes of this distemper, let us first consider what is the natural Cause of Hunger, by which we may the easier discover it.</p>
               <p>I judge the chief Cause of natural hunger to be the remainders of food fermented in the Stomach, and the longer it stays there, it is still more and more fermented by the Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; which is continually swallowed down, and intermix'd with it; and at length it raiseth a somewhat sour and gratefull Vapour, which pleasingly affects the upper Orifice of the Stomach, and so natural hunger seems to be produc'd.</p>
               <p>And if food be with-held somewhat longer than ordinary, then this hunger is increas'd even in healthy People; which I think is promoted and augmented by the Juice of the


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98252:84"/>
                  <hi>Pancreas,</hi> having a friendly Effervescency with Choler and Phlegm in the small Guts, from whence sour and gratefull Vapours are sent to the Stomach, which increaseth hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and if food be seldom taken, it may proceed to fainting fits.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </note>Hence we may gather, that if there be a vitious Effervescency of the aforesaid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the small Guts, then vitious Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours are thence produc'd, which rising up to the Stomach, and other parts adjacent, not onely diminish hunger, but more or less deprave Thirst, as also the senses of tasting and smelling; hence it is that the sick do loath all sorts of food, as soon as they smell, taste or see it.</p>

                  </note>1. Want of Appetite or Loathing is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression from the natural State, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dangerous; and is worse in Children than Adults, because they require more Nourishment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In all diseases this is an evil Symptome, and if the sick recover and want Appetite, or loath their Food, there is danger of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. First by freeing the mind from every prejudice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By correcting or purging out the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and peccant humours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:98252:84"/>If the Humours incline upward, they may be safely carried out by an Antimonial vomit; and after the operation, at night go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bed, let the sick take this Cordial Opiate.</p>
               <p>Take the Waters of Damask-roses,<note place="margin">

               <p>But if the humours be very viscous, (and the Stomach be not nauseous) let them be purged out by stool, with such Medicines as have power to alter, amend and evacuate the vitious humours.</p>
               <p>For example.</p>
               <p>Take of the Decoction of <hi>Senna Gereonis</hi> four ounces; the best <hi>Manna,</hi>

               <p>After purging, the Stomach must be strengthned; which may be done by this excellent Diet-drink.</p>
               <p>Take the Roots of <hi>China, Sarzeparilla,</hi>

Liquorish, of each one ounce and half; let them be bruised and infused in two Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons of Fountain-water very hot, for the space of twenty four hours, then boil it to the consumption of the third part; strain it, and add Syrups of Cinamon, and of the Juice of Rasberries, of each four ounces; mix it, and let it be put into Bottles.</p>
               <p>The sick may drink four ounces of it three times in a day.</p>
               <p>Also candied Ginger, and Nutmegs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd are good to corroborate the Stomach; a little of either of them may be eaten before the taking of the Diet-drink.</p>
               <p>You may anoint the Stomach with Oil of Mace by expression; after which apply a Plaster <hi>Stomachicum magistr.</hi> to the Region of the Stomach.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is called in English a Sobbing or Yexing, being something like the Clocking of Hens with Chickens.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:98252:85"/>This disease was thought by the Ancients to be a deprav'd motion of the Stomach onely, by which it striveth to expell something which is hurtfull; but experience doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that it is a convulsive Motion of the Midriff, and not of the Stomach, because in this distemper, expiration is deprav'd; and this is chiefly perfected by the Muscles of the Belly, both by drawing down the Breast, and compressing all that is contain'd in the Belly, and driving them forward towards the Midriff, and so compelling it upward (its proper motion together concurring) by which a greater straitness is made in the Breast, which causeth the Lungs also to be straitned, and consequently the Air contain'd in them to be suddenly expir'd.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, in this distemper, the Stomach is primarily affected by sharp Vapours, Wind, or humours whencesoever proceeding, which piercing to the membranous Centre of the Midriff, provoke it by pricking, or corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to perform that convulsive motion; in which the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is contracted with a great force towards the Region of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which suddenly and violently driveth it forward and outward, the convulsive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soon ceasing, and again often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>The causes of the Hicket are either exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or internal.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:98252:86"/>The external are hurtfull, sharp and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous food, or medicines, taken into the Stomach, by which the Midriff is soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and compelled to this violent, and presently interrupted convulsive Motion.</p>
               <p>The internal cause riseth up out of the small Gut, by the vitious Effervescency of the humours there meeting; from whence sharp, halituous or windy Vapours are rais'd to the upper Orifice of the Stomach, by which it is soon corroded; and thence the sharp flatuous Humours, or Vapours, are presently carried through the Vessels of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and sticking in its substance, do corrode its sensible parts, and compell it to that Convulsive repeating contraction of it self.</p>
               <p>When the Hicket is the Symptome of any other grievous disease,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Progn.</hi>
                  </note> as an acute Fever, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is dangerous, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mortal.</p>

                     <hi>Cure.</hi>
                  </note>In most ordinary Hickets, the party is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly restor'd, either by stopping the Breath, or by suddenly surprising them with fear.</p>
               <p>But as often as sharp poisonous Food or Medicines, or any flatuous humours be in the Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> causing the Hicket; they must be presently expelled by an Antimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Emetick, which will not onely empty the peccant humours upward and downward,


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98252:86"/>
but will correct and amend the hurtfull hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the Body.</p>
               <p>After the Operation of the Emetick, the following Cordial Opiate will conduce to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipate the molesting Vapours, which remain about the Mouth of the Stomach; and will stay the Hicket, and mildly procure sleep.</p>
               <p>Take the Waters of Treacle, Cinamon,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cordial Opiat.</hi>
                  </note> Syrup of Mint, of each one ounce; the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Baum and Mint, of each two ounces; <hi>Confectio Alkermes</hi> two drachms; <hi>Laudanum opiatum</hi> six grains; Spirits of Harts-horn, Niter dulcified, of each twenty drops; mix it.</p>
               <p>Let the sick often take two spoonfulls of this Opiate, till they be dispos'd to rest.</p>
               <p>If this distemper be obstinate, and yields not to the aforesaid Medicine, it shews that over-viscous Humours are conjoin'd to its Cause.</p>
               <p>Therefore in an obstinate Hicket, it is better that the peccant humours be empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downwards, with such Medicines as will both cut, and educe them. For which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend these Pills.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>pil. foetidae, ex duobus,</hi> of each fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen grains; Oil of Harts-horn four drops;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Purging Pills.</hi>
                  </note> make it into Pills; take them in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fasting.</p>
               <p>Let these or the like Aromatick Pills with gums be taken at least twice a week; which


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98252:87"/>
will not onely educe the hurtfull humours, but discuss Vapours, and Wind.</p>
               <p>In the interim, let not the frequent use of the aforesaid Cordial Opiate be neglected, for it will wonderfully conduce to the Cure.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it is good for the Patient to sneez, for it hath often prov'd succesfull.</p>
               <p>Drinking of warm Milk from the Cow is also much commended, because it will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage the hurtfull humours which remain about the Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is a deprav'd motion of the Stomach, and a certain sign of health weakned; for in perfect health nothing is wont to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd out of the Stomach by the Mouth.</p>
               <p>In vomiting sometimes food, (either crude, or more or less fermented) is cast out by the Gullet and Mouth; sometimes Bloud, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Choler, and other times manifold hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and matter of divers Colours, Taste and Consistency; and sometimes the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments returning to the Stomach (as in <hi>Iliaca passio</hi>) is expell'd by that preposterous way of vomiting, wherein, <hi>omnia naturae praepostera legibus ibant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the differences occurring in several sick People, are very difficult to be numbred, or reduc'd into a certain order; and much more to make an exact Examination of all the Symptoms, and thence to give a solid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every one.</p>
               <p>In this distemper the Stomach is either primarily, or secondarily affected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:98252:88"/>The Stomach is primarily affected to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, when the cause is in it self.</p>
               <p>As by taking a Vomit, or when there is an Inflammation, or Exulceration of it; for then it is easily stir'd up (by food, or any other thing swallowed) to a violent and preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Contraction, and turning of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby it is compell'd to cast out whatsoever is contain'd in it.</p>
               <p>The Stomach is secondarily affected, when it is drawn by consent of other parts first distemper'd; as by the contracting motion of the Guts, either in part or wholly, in that most grievous disease called <hi>Ileos,</hi>

                  </note>The Cause of <hi>Ileos,</hi> or <hi>Iliaca passio,</hi> is an excrementitious viscous matter that doth adhere unto the Gut called <hi>Ileo</hi>; which in time is coagulated into a very hard substance, almost in the form of Bullets; (of which I have had large experience) whence all pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through for the excrements by siege is stopt, and anon their regress and ascent to the Stomach follows, with a miserable vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of them.</p>
               <p>The Rupture of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> may be also the cause of this grievous disease, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be so great, that not onely the small Guts, but the great ones also fall through the lacerated hole, either by reason of their weight, or else by the perpetual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching of what is contain'd in them, which renders them uncapable to be reduc'd, or put back through the same hole; whence the excrements, (having not passage down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) are more and more hardned to that degree, that they can hardly be dissolv'd, so that a hard and unsupperable Tumour doth soon follow, which hinders the reflux of bloud, and causeth an inflammation, and consequently a gangrene of the Guts, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a violent vomiting of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 'till death do put a period to the Patient's misery.</p>

               <p>If the lower orifice, called <hi>Pilorus,</hi> be affected, it is called <hi>dolor seu colica ventriculi</hi>; especially if it come of wind.</p>
               <p>The pains of the Guts may also be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd, because one while the small guts, and other whiles the thick guts are griev'd.</p>
               <p>As often as the upper part of the small gut, (nearest the Stomach,) is pain'd, because that part of the gut is over the right Region of the Lions, it maketh the Patient (and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Physician) think that the pain is in them.</p>
               <p>But if that part of the small gut which riseth up from the Loins and Mesenterie, (Towards the left <hi>Hypochondrium</hi>) be afflicted with ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and distensions, with a notable hardness, this is attributed to the Spleen, even by some Physicians, although without any solid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98252:94"/>
when indeed this distending pain is altogether Hypochondriacal.</p>
               <p>If the pain be in the Gut <hi>Ileon,</hi> it is thence called <hi>Iliaca Passio,</hi> which hath been already treated of.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever pain is rais'd in the Gut <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> may be called <hi>Colica Passio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These may be distinguish'd from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, chiefly from the situation of either Gut.</p>
               <p>For the Gut <hi>Ileon</hi> is for the most part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted hither and thither, up and down about the region of the Navel, and from thence a little upward; but the <hi>Colon</hi> from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel downward, the pain of the Cholick gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally pressing to the bottom of the Belly, as well as to each side, and the Back, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Gut is writhed which is almost in the manner of a Roman S. being roll'd to the Navel, and from thence with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable winding through the middle of the Belly, it is writh'd to the left kidney, and groin, and so down to the <hi>Os sacrum,</hi> and bladder, and ends in the right Gut; whence the pain rising in the circuit and circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Belly below the Navel may truly be called Cholical.</p>

as in the internal or blind Hemorrhoids; or else it is a corroding pain, accompani'd with more or less itching, perpetually provoking to siege as in the <hi>Tenesmus,</hi>

               <p>The causes are either external,<note place="margin">

               <p>The internal causes are divers; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Worms may be the cause.</p>
               <p>But a burning pain is produced either by an obstruction of the Capillary veins of the Stomach or Guts, by which the bloud is forc'd to stand still in the vessels till at length (after a great distension) the vessels burst, and the bloud is effus'd, which breedeth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and a manifest pulsation about the part affected, by which it may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd from any other Kind.</p>

                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:98252:95"/>But for the most part, a burning and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding pain riseth from Choler too fat, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully and vitiously raising an effervescency with the juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> too acid; as experience teacheth in outward things; for if you pour Spirit of Vitriol to oil of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, it will presently raise an effervescency join'd with a notable heat and burning.</p>
               <p>This burning pain is chiefly felt in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Loins, because there is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of Choler, and the juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi>; and from thence ariseth vitious sharp va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, which produce griping pains of the Stomach, and pricking pains in the Guts, as also other wandring pains therein.</p>
               <p>If the pain be chill and cold, it is caus'd from the juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> very acid and sharp; which raiseth a vitious effervescency with Choler (not oily) and phlegm together, as we may observe, if we mix Spirit of Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol with any volatile Salt not oily, how it will raise an effervescency, coupled with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Chilness, and Coldness onely sensible; hence we may conclude, that the operation of the acid Spirit in producing cold, is much promoted by phlegm.</p>

                  </note>The cause of the Colick is over viscous phlegm, mixed with Choler, peccant both in its Saltish acrimony, and volatile oiliness; by which the viscous phlegm is rarifi'd into Wind; and if the excrements are contain'd


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98252:95"/>
beyond their course, they harden, and adhere to the Gut, whereby the natural ferment is vitiated, and the windy blasts are more and more rarifi'd, and being shut up and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Cavity of the Gut <hi>Colon,</hi> it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a violent distension and contraction of it.</p>
               <p>But if the aforesaid humours be mixt with the juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> over sharp, acid and harsh; then there is a wonderfull sense of contortion in the part affected, urging and writhing from place to place, according to the winding or rolling of the Gut.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the Worms.</head>
               <p>WOrms may be generated in all parts of the Body; those which are bred in Ulcers, may more fitly be called Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, in Latin <hi>termetes</hi>; but I shall onely treat of those which are bred in the internal parts of the Body.</p>
               <p>Every man living in all places, and climes, doth more or less suffer by the frequent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of these little intestine Enemies; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the weaker state of Man, as Infants, and the female Sex; whose ferment, or digestive heat being not sufficiently master of their great moisture; part of it is turned into pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, which corrupteth the humours.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is no wonder that active Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (being never at rest) by the quickning animating heat, which causeth Concoction, doth frequently generate Worms either in the Stomach or Guts, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious occurrences of matter, and seminal dispositions.</p>
               <p>There are three or four kinds of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred disturbers, which we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>

               <p>This part of the <hi>Chylus</hi> being crude, and unfit for sanguification, is left (undrawn by the lacteal Veins) in the intestines, where it is mixed with pituitous humours, and elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the temperate heat of the guts, which is the efficient cause of such like generations.</p>
               <p>The form which lay hid in this matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is afterward generated by the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat of the Bowels, and according to the diversity of the latent forms, sundry sorts of worms are bred.</p>

               <p>THIS cruciating disease may be called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>This disease doth also need as well the Name, as the invocation of <hi>Miserere mei Deus</hi>; the sick being in such extreme misery, that 'tis incredible to all but them that have endur'd it.</p>
               <p>The most urgent and exquisite pain under this affect, being in that most tender and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible part, <hi>viz.</hi> the Belly, may seem to have some Alliance with the Iliack or Colick pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and indeed they are sometimes its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants, but much different from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Causes.</hi>
                  </note>The causes of this lamentable Distemper, are either external, or internal.</p>
               <p>The external general occasional cause is contracting Cold in the Region of the Belly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which doth cramp not onely the Muscles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> but also the tender Fibres of the Intestines, cruciating all the affected parts with obdurate Contractions; which is


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98252:107"/>
more aggravated when the Moon doth come to opposition with the Sun. Which may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so observ'd in all Spasms and convulsive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that about the full of the Moon, the tide of such nervous diseases doth rise highest: Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in those places where the direct aspects of the nocturnal luminary have the most power; which demonstration will evince to be between the Tropicks, which many of our Mariners, (who have sailed that way) can tell by wofull experience.</p>
               <p>Another external procuring cause of this grievous disease is a mineral Gas ascending from the Caverns of the Earth, infesting the Air with its poisonous Fumes, whereby not onely the tender fibrous, and nervous parts of the Belly are oft times crampt with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive spasms; but the mineral Fumes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inspired with the Air into the Body, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce most eminent apparent evils, as the Corruption of the Chyle into porraceous and adust Choler, from whence followeth irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Vomitings, and the Constipation of the Belly, with obdurateness of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which inflames the Bowels,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signs.</hi>
                  </note> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails a Symptomatical fever, with a heavy and slow pulse; and as the pain doth aggravate more and more, there is want of sleep and rest, with other uneasiness, and commotions of Body and Mind; as the Operatours in Chymistry have sometimes experience of


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98252:108"/>
(to their cost and trouble) in mineral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations; for if a Vessel chance to break, the sharp and acid Vapours, or Gas of the mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, immediately seiseth the Animal spirits of all that are in the Elaboratory; by which they are mov'd unequally (against the will) through the Nerves to the Musculous parts, which causeth Convulsive motions, with trembling and shaking of the Limbs, and other accumulated evils.</p>
               <p>The like grievous Symptoms (though not so violent) happen to many People that inhabit near the mineral Mines in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and also in some Places of <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Derby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> &amp;c. Where there are Lead-works, from whence mineral Fumes continually ascend from the separating Oar, which infesteth the Air, and is a great producer of such Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive effects.</p>
               <p>At the first seisure of this evil, the Muscles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and sometimes those of the Breast and Back, (through contractions) prove hard and painfull, as in our ordinary Cramps; which Symptoms will evince, that these Vapours are peccant in an acid Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>The internal Cause, is also sour Vapours ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing most commonly out of the small Guts; which the concurring symptoms (consider'd and weighed with an attentive mind) will confirm; for these Vapours being sharp, are


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98252:108"/>
driven forward into the Nerves, and gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with great pain, aggravate and produce this Convulsive spasm.</p>

                     <hi>Progn.</hi>
                  </note> it causeth such obstructions in the fibrous and nervous Passages of the Muscles, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Lameness and an Atrophy soon succeeds, increasing the Weakness of all the Members of the Body, till at length it ends in a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical resolution of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a pregnant Woman, or a Woman af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Abortion, be afflicted with this grievous evil; it is very dangerous, and many times mortal.</p>
               <p>As for the Cure,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cure.</hi>
                  </note> we must endeavour to ease the pain, and strengthen the weak parts with all expedition,</p>
               <p>The pain may be eased, and diminish'd as well by internal, as external Anodynes and Narcoticks; to allay the violent Motion of the Animal spirits, and abate the grievous Spasms succeeding.</p>
               <p>The following Cordial Diaphoretick opiate is excellent in this Case.</p>
               <p>Take the Waters of Fennel, Peony, Treacle,<note place="margin">

each one scruple; Tincture of Castor two drachms, Spirit of Salt Armoniack, Oil of Cloves, of each four drops; <hi>Laudanum opiat.</hi> six grains; mix it, and give four spoonfulls every three hours.</p>
               <p>By the frequent taking of this Volatile and Anodyne Sudorifick, the peccant humours will be temper'd and diminisht, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, involuntary, and impetuous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Animal spirits will be reduc'd, and brought to tranquillity, by which the binding Constrictions of the Belly-ach will be the easier remov'd.</p>
               <p>Bathing in this distemper, hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us'd with admirable success; for by the frequent use thereof, the cutaneous and mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Fibres will not onely be relax'd from contracted Spasms; but the pores will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so kept open for the constant discharge of transpiring Particles.</p>
               <p>A natural Bath, such as is in the City of <hi>Bathe,</hi> is excellent; but when it is not to be had, an artificial Bath may be very usefull for the ends propos'd.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is also called <hi>Icterus</hi> in Latin; it being a spreading of a yellowish Colour over the whole body.</p>
               <p>It was the common received opinion of the Ancients, that the chief cause of this Disease, is an obstruction of the Cystick pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the small Gut, so that Choler is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wholly hindred in its natural descent; wherefore it doth ascend to the Liver, and so to the Bloud, with which it is transfer'd to the habit and superficies of the body, where it doth shew it self in its colours.</p>
               <p>But it may be manifested from many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, and experiments, both Anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and Practical; that the Jaundice may be produc'd without an obstruction of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Choler.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:98252:110"/>Although I suppose that the Jaundice may sometimes be rais'd by the aforesaid obstruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either by Choler it self most glutinous, or lapidescent; which I have had sufficient experience of, having dissected several dead bodies, in which I have found stones not onely in the Gall, but Cystick passage also.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, it hath been oft ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in dissecting <hi>Icterical</hi> people, that the Cystick passage was not obstructed, but the excrements were dyed yellow, although not so much as usual.</p>
               <p>Whence it is manifest, that it may be bred without any obstruction in the passage afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
               <p>The causes then are either external or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.<note place="margin">

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>The external cause is the biting of a viper, whose poison is of a subtile, volatile and spirituous nature; which doth soon render Choler over spirituous, after the biting of the Serpent.</p>
               <p>But the aforesaid poison being antipathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical to humane nature, it doth presently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to defend every individual part from the potent killing quality of the poison; and therefore doth immediately send the balsamick bile to antidote the venome; and in circulating with it, the volatile salt of the Choler is broken, by which it is less apt to effervesce with acids, and therefore is easily


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98252:111"/>
joyned with the other humours (being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confus'd with the bloud) by which the superficies of the whole Body becomes yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ebriety, or the abuse of strong drink, may be a procuring cause of this Disease, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the volatile spirit of the drink may be too plenteously mixt with Choler, which renders it spirituous, by which it becomes less apt to effervesce with the acid juice of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and hence most intirely to join it self with the other humours.</p>
               <p>The internal cause is unexpected sorrow of mind, by which all the humours become glutinous and viscous, because the juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> is thereby made more tart.</p>
               <p>It may be also caused by obstructions, as is before mention'd; either by Choler gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, or lapidescent, or by viscous phlegm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>This must also be observed in all other Diseases.</p>

               <p>It may be called in Latin <hi>mala corporis ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitudo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:98252:113"/>There are many causes of this Distemper, which may be distinguisht according to the diversity of the conjoin'd Symptoms.</p>
               <p>It doth accompany all Chronical Diseases, as Dropsies of all kinds, Hypochondriack suffocation, Scurvy, Pox and Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for it doth spare none, neither Peer nor Peasant, of any age or sex; but it most frequently sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth on Women when their monthly terms are supprest.</p>
               <p>The cause is either external or internal.</p>
               <p>The external cause is either bad Diet, a long time receiv'd, or for want of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing Food after sickness, for the Stomach being weak cannot digest course Diet, by which the nutriment of the Body doth by degrees become peccant in quality, vitiating the humours, and Bloud it self, so that an ill nourishment of the Body doth follow.</p>
               <p>The internal cause may be the suppression of the Terms in Women, which is more or less corrupted about the Womb, having not its natural evacuation, from whence the whole mass of Bloud is indued with a vitious quality, by which the nourishment of all parts of the Body is deprav'd.</p>
               <p>Also Choler, and the juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> (which are always confus'd with the Bloud) being alike vitious or peccant in quality, do not onely corrupt the separation of use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unusefull parts, but by the vitious


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98252:113"/>
effervescency of these humours manifold fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous vapours are rais'd, which do not onely increase anxieties about the Midriff, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried to the Heart, there follows a pressing pain and palpitation thereof; and in circulating through the Lungs, it causeth a <hi>Dyspnoea,</hi> or difficult breathing; and being thence transferr'd every way throughout the Body, it doth breed a general weariness in all parts.</p>
               <p>But when the vitious humours abound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in plenty, then several kinds of the Dropsie at length succeed; if not the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Body groweth lean by degrees.</p>
               <p>From what hath been said, the production of every Cachexie may easily be deduced by a judicious Physician.</p>
               <p>The signs are paleness of the Face,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signs.</hi>
                  </note> short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of breath, palpitation of the Heart, and often apressing pain of it, accompanied (for the most part) with a lingring Fever, either continual, or intermitting, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of both, in which the Urine is crude or watry; at length there is a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness of the universal Body, which in some doth pine and become lean, but in others the Body doth swell, and is turgid.</p>
               <p>If this Disease be not helpt in time, it will become by degrees so stubborn and rebellious,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Progn.</hi>
                  </note> that it will puzzle the wisest and most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Physicians to cure it; for by the


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98252:114"/>
long continuance thereof, phlegm becometh very tough and glutinous, on which all Chronical, or prolong'd Diseases depend; besides, all the other humours are by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees vitiated, which incorporate with the Bloud, and diminish its effervescency, so that the separation and excretion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious parts (to be voided together with Urine) do not follow, from whence many grievous symptoms succeed, which oft proves mortal.</p>

                     <hi>Cure.</hi>
                  </note>The cure of every <hi>Cachexie</hi> will consist in the correction and amendment of the Bloud any way vitiated.</p>
               <p>If flegm be tough and glutinous, it must be corrected and evacuated, for which there are variety of choice medicines prescrib'd in the fourth page, of the cure of diseases of the Head; in the use whereof you must perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere for some time, or else the laudable suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and happy wisht for cure will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in vain.</p>
               <p>Any other humours that are peccant in quality (by which the bloud is vitiated) must be alter'd and reduc'd to their natural Constitution by selected Medicines, which will amend and empty them out by degrees.</p>
               <p>In the interim good Food (which is easie of digestion, and wholsome nourishment) must not be neglected, whereby nature may be cherished, and health by degrees procured.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Ancients have assigned three sorts of Dropsies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>'Tis called in Latin <hi>aqua intercus, ex inter &amp; cutis,</hi> because the Water is between the Skin and the Flesh.</p>
               <p>This is the most proper Dropsie, in which the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> Secrets, Thighs and Legs are affected.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second is called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, phlegma vel pituita</hi>; because it is caused of white Phlegm gathered in all parts of the Body.</p>
               <p>Some Authours make a difference between <hi>Anasarca,</hi> and <hi>Leucophlegmatia</hi>; that <hi>Anasarca</hi> is caused by a serous humour, and <hi>Leucophleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia</hi> by a phlegmatick and more viscous humour; but all Dropsies except Tympanies seem to me, to be little less than a distinction of degrees of one and the same Disease.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>The Ancients did take the Liver to be the chief part male-affected in these distempers; but <hi>Helmont</hi> (who was happy in a remedy to cure it) doth severely reprove them, and is so bold to tax the whole Schools with the ignorance of Anatomical dissections; he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inspected many Carcases of dropsical Persons (of whom he makes distinct men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) doth assert the Livers of them all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way vitiated, and therefore he concludes the Liver faultless in dropsical affects; and he derives the Cause of Dropsie to be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Kidneys with the Stone or Gravel; and so the water which should be transferr'd through the Kidneys, to the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, (to be evacuated by pissing) is forced into the Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But experience teacheth that Dropsies may


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98252:115"/>
be caused many ways; wherefore I shall betake my self to a more evident description thereof.</p>
               <p>The causes of Dropsies are either external,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </note> or internal.</p>
               <p>The external Cause is the Constipation of the porous Skin, impeding transpiration, whereby the discharge of sweaty Vapours through the Habit of the Body is lessned and interrupted; hence what moisture is usually carried off by sweating, doth rebound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and condense into an Ichorous water, and is there (by degrees) aggravated and increased, through the hindrance of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary transpiration; till at length a great quantity of water is accumulated, and stagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the affected parts, in time may work farther alterations on the subjected Bowels.</p>
               <p>Matter of fact hath evinced this to me, having cured several Hydropical patients onely by sweating, and external applications.</p>
               <p>The internal Cause of the Dropsie, may be over viscous Chyle, or Phlegm of the Guts, coagulated in the lacteal Veins, and causing an obstruction in more or fewer of their Branches, so that the Liquour rising ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the continual Conflux of Choler, the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and the Phlegm of Spittle; or else from Chyle, or from drink plentifully drunk, being stopt and intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in its motion, it doth by degrees more


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98252:116"/>
and more distend the Vessels, that at length they burst; and the moisture receiv'd into them, is poured out between the Membranes of the Mesentery, and presently after into the Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This disease is sometimes suddenly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by much drinking in a burning Fever, join'd with an urgent and permanent Thirst.</p>
               <p>After the same manner (though difficult to be known) may a Dropsie of the Breast be caused, <hi>viz.</hi> by an obstruction of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Lymphatick Vessels, by glutinous Phlegm carried together with <hi>Lympha</hi> into the said Vessels, and there coagulated, by which the motion of <hi>Lympha</hi> is hindred, so that the Lymphatick vessels being much distended, by the great quantity of <hi>Lympha</hi> gathered in them, at length they burst, and the <hi>Lympha</hi> piercing (through the <hi>Pleura</hi>) into the Cavity of the Breast, procureth a Dropsie in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause of a Tympany.</hi>
                  </note>The cause of a Tympany is wind, together with a serous humour piercing through the Guts into the Cavity of the Belly, and being there detained, it is more and more rarified, by which the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is not onely expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but the whole <hi>Abdomen</hi> inflated, and violently distended.</p>

               <p>And for the benefit of those Physicians and Chirurgeons, that live in the West-Indies; there groweth (almost every where in moist places) a large Cane, much like the Sugar-cane; the Planters generally call it the dumb Cane, because they that taste it, are presently dumb, and unable to speak for two or three hours; after which the Tongue returns to its former use and volubility with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice.</p>
               <p>The reason why this remarkeable Plant doth so affect the Tongue upon the touch of it, is its power of attracting such plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of moisture into it, as doth distend all the Vessels thereof, and render it immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, till the crouded moisture be gradually discharged.</p>
               <p>Hence we may conjecture, and indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth, that of this Plant may be prepared diversity of medicines as Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plasms, Oils, Ointments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which will be effectual to attract, and easily and kindly discharge the swollen part of the Ichorous water; which may be used for some time after the evacuation of it, the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a farther accumulation, or return of the Disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:98252:119"/>Likewise may medicines be prepared, (by a skilfull Artist) of this Plant, very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to be taken inwardly, not onely against Dropsies, but the Scurvy, Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If these choice medicines are not to be had, and nothing be effected by other means; A harmless <hi>Paracenthesis</hi> may be instituted in the Dropsie of the Breast, or <hi>Abdomen</hi>; provided the Apertion be made by such a little hollow instrument as is describ'd in page 81, 82. of the Cure of the Pleurisie, for by such a small wound, there is no danger to the sick.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. Of the Scurvy, and Hypochondriack Suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, commonly called the Fits of the Mother.</head>
               <p>THE Scurvy being a Hypochondriack disease, it will not be amiss to treat of them together.</p>
               <p>The Scurvy is called in Latin <hi>Scorbutus</hi>; it is a Complication, or Concatenation of Diseases, generated by the Conjunction of divers Causes contributing to a scorbutick Deformity.</p>
               <p>The Scurvy is generated, or planted essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in the vital Principles, or digestive Offices, and therefore it is not discerned by sense, but the effects are distributed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Body, and are augmented more or less, according to the strength and debility of parts, to resist or consent and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved.</p>
               <p>The Hypochondriack suffocation is called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acus.</note> 
                  <hi>vel quod ad Hypochondria pertinet, vel sub cartilagine fita sit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is called by the Latins <hi>Hypochondriaca melancholia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ancients thought that this was an uterine disease, <hi>in quibus mulieres uteri fuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98252:120"/>
laborant</hi>; and therefore it was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and in Latin <hi>morbus Hystericus, vel Hysterica passio</hi>; and in English 'tis called Fits of the Mother; it being most subject to Women, from the suppression of their month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Courses.</p>
               <p>But because men are also molested with longing, and suffer often both the Sense and Disease of Suffocation, especially when they become Cachectick, or of ill habit of Body: and also they are cured with the same medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, that Women are cured with, when they are vexed with this distemper, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think this suffocation may be more properly called Hypochondriacal.</p>
               <p>It may be called the Mother of the Scurvy, because the vital Principles (in this disease) are seduced to declension and deviation from their rectitude, the digestive offices being all depraved.</p>
               <p>The causes of these diseases are either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or internal.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Causes.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>The external, are sometimes a sedentary studious, and melancholy life, by which the vital Principles do receive much prejudice, decay and fall off from their functions, and become languid and feeble; also the Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infested with noxious Vapours, is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cause of these distempers; for such Air being drawn into the Body by inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth commix with the spirits, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitate


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98252:121"/>
and deprave the faculties, from whence Scorbutick and Hypochondriack effects do ensue; and as the Body is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirable or impervious, these diseases are more or less varied, and remitted in their Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; and therefore the constipation of the pores, prohibiting transpiration, is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al organical cause of preternatural Spots in the Scurvy, which appear chiefly upon the Thighs and Legs; not from the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the material cause, and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous propension of gross matter downwards; but because those parts are more weak in their assimilation, being remote from sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of vital Spirits, therefore they have the first tokens of defection.</p>
               <p>The internal Cause is a vitious quality of all the humours, and also of the Animal spirits, which are confus'd with the bloud, and communicate their faultiness to it, by which the bloud is also vitiated, so that the nourishment of the Body is deprav'd several ways, according to the variety of the quality peccant; in which the colour of the native Skin, and especially of the face languisheth, and is changed pale.</p>
               <p>In these diseases, not onely the appetite of food, but its fermentation is also deprav'd; wherefore Anxieties about the Midriff and Hypochondries, and a pressing pain of the Heart will soon follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:98252:121"/>For when the food is ill fermented, and driven forward through the small Gut, it is confus'd with the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> and Choler, which are a like vitious, the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick juice being too sharp and acrid, and the Bile over thick and salt; from whence the separation of usefull and unusefull parts, is not onely corrupted, but also by the vitious Effervescency of these humours, are rais'd manifold halituous Vapours, which do not onely increase the fore describ'd Anxiety, but being carried to the Heart do breed a Palpitation of it, whence it circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates through the Lungs, and causeth a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of breathing, and thence being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every way, it causeth a weariness in all parts of the Body; and if an Acrimony of the humours do concur, then it is manifested internally with pain.</p>
               <p>The cause of the inordinate effervescency of Bloud, in the Hypochondriack suffocation, is not onely the unequal flowing of <hi>Lympha,</hi> but also of the Liquour rising out of the threefold humours, vitiously effervescing in the small Gut, from whence vitious Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours are sent to the right Ventricle of the Heart, and procure a great Confusion, and disturbance in it; hence followeth a notable Palpitation of the Heart, by which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Effervescency of Bloud seemeth to cease in the right Ventricle for a time, with


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98252:122"/>
its motion and pulse, and also respiration is taken away to outward sense.</p>
               <p>The symptoms and signs of these diseases are very many, yet are never seen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in one and the same Body.</p>
               <p>The usual signs are pain of the Head, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation of the Heart, puffing up of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Loathing, Vomiting, Belching, Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, Cough, Tumour and Putrefaction of the Gums, with much spitting; looseness and blackness of the Teeth, and sometimes great pain in them; the breath stinketh, and is sometimes fetched with much difficulty; also Convulsions, Palsie, Gout, Dropsies, and all other obstructions; sometimes the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and trembling and looseness of the Lims, with red purple spots dispersed; also the Pleurisie, pain of the Hypochondries, and also of many of the external parts, as the Neck, Arms, Hands, Thighs, Legs, Feet and Anckles, with laziness, and often faint sweats; there is also sometimes malign Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, dry hard Tubercles, <hi>Erisipelas</hi> and Ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matous tumours with many others, which to enumerate, were to comprehend an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Genus of Atomes, within a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Limitation.</p>

                     <hi>Progn.</hi>

                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:98252:122"/>2. If the Patient hath a continual pain and giddiness of the Head, it doth threaten an Epilepsie, or Apoplexy.</p>

               <p>In some Regions, these diseases are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with most other distempers, or at least do easily degenerate into them, by which they are rendred the more difficult of curation.</p>

                  </note> the sick must observe a good diet, without which Physical means will profit but little; and here we may also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that no Aliments, or Medicines (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther altering or purging) will be very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, unless specifick Antiscorbuticks be mixed with them.</p>

Pomgranates, Apples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Seeds of Mustard, <hi>Angelica,</hi> Radish and Juniper-berries, <hi>cum-multis aliis</hi>; of which may be prepared diversity of good medicines both Chymical and Galenical.</p>
               <p>The volatile Salts both of Animals, and Vegetables, are excellent to open all obstruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and temper the humours; Also <hi>Elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir proprietatis,</hi> the Spirit of Salt Armoniack, Horse-radish and Scurvigrass, the Spirit of Niter and of Salt dulcified, Salt of Steel, Wormwood, and Tartar, Oil of Juniper, Cloves, and Cinamon, are all Specifick Antiscorbuticks.</p>

               <p>THE Green-sickness is called in Latin <hi>Icteris, &amp; Febris alba</hi>; In English the Virgin's Disease, the White Fever, and the White Jaundice; because in this disease the native colour of the Face is pale.</p>
               <p>This disease is caused either from defect of Bloud,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </note> or it proceedeth from plenty of


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98252:125"/>
crude, viscous, phlegmatick humours, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing the veins about the Womb, by which the courses are supprest; the veins of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix being obstructed, that superfluous Bloud which nature hath ordained to be evacuated that way, having not passage, doth return to the greater Vessels, and is circulated with the whole mass of Bloud and humours, by which they are in time vitiated, and a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexie</hi> or ill habit of body is thence caused; for the Bloud and natural humours, being indued with a vitious quality, the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the parts of the body will be deprav'd several ways, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the quality peccant; whence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise not onely the fermentation of Food, but also the Appetite of it is deprav'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Anxieties and Palpitation of the Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> troubleth the sick, as well before as after Food taken in.</p>
               <p>This distemper may be also caused by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal coldness of the air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and sometimes great fear, and sudden shame may be the cause of the suppression; also aliments, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments that are too astringent taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>

                  </note>In these diseases the Urine cometh away crude, thick and less colour'd, because the phlegmatick, watry humours abounding, incorporating with the Bloud, do dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the desired effervescency; so that the


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98252:125"/>
separation, much less excretion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious parts, to be voided together with Urine, doth not follow.</p>
               <p>If the Hypochondries be afflicted, and the veins of the Womb obstructed, there will be great loathing of wholsome Food, and a desire after those things which ought not to be eaten, as Ashes, Salt, Coals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is called <hi>Pica,</hi> and in Women with Child <hi>Malacia,</hi> of which we have hinted in the Chapter of Hungar Vitiated, page 145, 146.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Bleeding at the Nose, is sometimes beneficial, but if the Bloud doth disburthen it self by the Eyes, Ears, Mouth, or Bladder, it is preposterous, from whence may arise other bad Symptoms.</p>

               <p>An obstruction of the Vessels by viscous Phlegm, may be cur'd by the frequent use of such medicines as have power to loosen the peccant humours, and again make them fluid.</p>
               <p>All fixt metallick and mineral Sulphurs, and also volatile Salts, prepar'd not onely of several parts of Animals, but also of scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Plants, (such as are the juice of Hedge-mustard, Scurvigrass, Garden and Water-cresses, Dandelion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) conduce before all others, to loosen and dissolve Phlegm coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, or Bloud clotter'd, as having an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious power of dissolving all things coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, and conglutinated in humane bodies, and of reducing the same to their wonted fluidity, and moreover to move sweat, which together being mildly promoted, the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red dissolution of the aforesaid viscous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be obtained much easier, and sooner.</p>

               <p>The following is also very effectual.</p>
               <p>Take the Waters of Fennel, Hyssop, of each two ounces; distill'd Vinegar six drachms; the Carminative-water of <hi>Sylvius</hi> half an ounce; Syrup of the five opening Roots one ounce and half; Powder of Crabs-eyes one drachm; <hi>Sperma Coeti,</hi> Mummy, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony Diaphoretick, of each one scruple; <hi>Laudanum opiat.</hi> four grains; mix it.</p>
               <p>Let the sick often take two spoonfulls of either of these mixtures, especially in bed, to promote the power of the medicine, and to facilitate a sweat; by the help whereof the mention'd power of the Sudorifick will the better come to the place of obstruction, and will attenuate, loosen, and make fluid the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obstructing; the whole Mass of Bloud will also become more fluid and moveable, being rarefi'd by the volatile Salt of the medicine.</p>
               <p>If the Patient be plethorick, let the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaena</hi> vein be opened, for by opening and breathing a Vein, the motion and circulation

               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:98252:128"/>The external Causes may be by an Ulcer in the Matrix, or some outward Violence, and sometimes by too much Coition.</p>
               <p>The internal Causes are either a sharp se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous humour abounding in the Bloud, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing its fluidity, or else an over great heat in the Womb, stirring up a more potent, and therefore a swifter rarefaction of Bloud, provoking an expulsion of it, either by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, (or some other preternatural opening) of the vessels of the Womb.</p>
               <p>The white Flux of the Womb, is an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious humour flowing from it.</p>
               <p>This distemper is subject not onely to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but sometimes to Maids also.</p>

               <p n="1">1. If there be an Ulcer there, the Womb will not admit of Coition, without pain, and


<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98252:128"/>
the matter which floweth from her is strin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and more digested, and sometimes bloudy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> the seminal matter cometh in a small quantity, and seldom, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be gotten by acting with an unclean Person, then the Urine is sharp, with many other malignant Symptoms.</p>

               <p>The white Flux is not very dangerous, but is often difficult of curation, especially in old Women, because they abound with Phlegm; and 'tis hard to divert the humours from this Chanel, it being the sink of the body, through which the superfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of a healthy Woman are every month evacuated.</p>
               <p>If this distemper continue long, it may breed great evils, as Barrenness, Falling out of the Womb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. Of Barrenness.</head>
               <p>BArrenness is called in Latin <hi>Sterilitas.</hi> It may be called in English Unfruitfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it being an impotency of Conception.</p>
               <p>We reade in the Scripture that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of old did think it a reproach to be Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; and therefore when <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived who before was Barren, she said <hi>the Lord hath taken away my reproach among Men</hi>; as you may reade at large in the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Luke</hi>'s Gospel.</p>
               <p>Very few Women in a Marriage state but desire Children, yea some would give all they have in the world for a Child, and are very impatient if they do not Conceive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rachel</hi> said to <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 30 ver. 1. <hi>give me Children, or else I dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will now briefly shew you, what may be the cause of Sterility.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:98252:132"/>1. First, want of Love between a Man and his Wife, way hinder Conception.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Any malignant distemper in the womb, may corrupt the Seed, and be the cause of Barrenness.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion that Witch-craft may be the cause.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, the Whites or any moist distemper of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> may be the cause of Barrenness.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the cause is in the Man, for if he doth want Sperm, or is unable to erect his Genital by reason of any weakness or distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in his Secrets; or if he be effeminate and taketh little or no delight in the act of Venery, he is not fit for <hi>Venus</hi> School.</p>
               <p>There are some Rules left by the Ancients to try whether a Woman be naturally Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adviseth to put a Clove of Garlick or a little <hi>Galbanum</hi> into her Womb, and if her Breath do smell of it, be sure she is fruitfull.</p>
               <p>If Barrenness be caused by any Disease af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting either the man or the woman,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Progn.</hi>
                  </note> then there may be hopes of Conception when health is procured; but if it be evil shape of of the members in the woman, or the man not fit for <hi>Venus</hi>-School, <hi>patientia est optima virtus.</hi>

whatsoever hindreth Conception.</p>
               <p>Many things are antipathetical to secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, as Jet, Glow-worms, Saphires, Sma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragds, the <hi>Matrix</hi> of a Goat or Mule, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Vinegar, Mints, Watercresses, Beans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which I advise you to avoid, and make use of those things which have a peculiar virtue to help or cause Conception, and remove Barrenness.</p>
               <p>The After-birth of a Woman dried and powdred, and taken often a drachm at a time; also the Stones and Liver of a Bore-pig, the Juice of Sage, the Roots of Satirion and <hi>Eringo</hi> candied, are all good.</p>
               <p>There are many medicines prescrib'd in Authours to help Conception.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quercetanus</hi> doth commend this infusion.</p>
               <p>Take the <hi>Matrix</hi> of a Hare and the Stones of a Ram prepar'd with Whitewine,<note place="margin">

               <p>The following Electuary is also excellent.</p>

               <p>Let the Woman take the quantity of a Nutmeg of it every night going to bed, and drink a glass of Sack or Muskadel, or of the aforementioned Infusion after it.</p>
               <p>If a cold and moist distemper of the Body and Womb, accompanied with the Whites be the cause, look for the cure in its proper Chapter.</p>
               <p>If it be caused by Witchcraft, there are some things commended by Authours to be worn about the party against Fascination, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pizle of a Wolf, a Diamond, a Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth-stone, Rue, Squills, Sea-holly, <hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penum, Amara dulcis, Hypericon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But above all, let fervent and devout Prayers be put up to the Throne of grace for help; and reject and despise Incantations or Charms, and all other Diabolical means.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. Of Abortion or Miscarriage.</head>
               <p>ABortion is called in Latin <hi>Abortus, vel intempestivus foetus.</hi> Because it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Birth; the Child being brought forth, either dead or alive before its fit time of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
               <p>This is the worst Symptom, that attends breeding Women.</p>
               <p>It may happen from the first Moment of Conception, to the end of the sixth Month; but it is most usual in the end of the third, or the beginning of the fourth Month.</p>
               <p>The causes are either external, or internal.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Causes.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>The external Causes are a great excess in things nonnatural, as too great Anger, Fear, and other Passions, or else it may be through defect; for if the Mother undergo Penury or Famine, or lose much Bloud, the Child wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Nourishment.</p>
               <p>Many times things longed for, and not obtained, kill the Child.</p>
               <p>Also strong purging Medicines, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the terms, and all fetid smells, falls, blows, lifting, carrying, dancing, running, riding or any other outward violence, may be the Cause of Abortion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:98252:134"/>The internal Causes may be the depraved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the humours, by which the Mass of Bloud becometh vitious; also Acute or Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick diseases, especially of the Womb; and also violent Coughing, Sneezing, Vomiting, Convulsions and Fluxes of the Belly, may loosen the Ligaments of the Womb, and so cause miscarriage.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signs.</hi>
                  </note>The signs of Abortion at hand, are great pain about the Loins, and Share-bones, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with shivering; the Breasts growing little and flaggy, the Situation of the Child changed towards the Bottom of the Belly, with a bearing down, and evacuation of Bloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Also the Pills prescrib'd in page 240. may be used in this case.</p>

               <p>HArd labour may be called in Latin <hi>partus, vel enixus laboriosus; quod ipse nitendi &amp; pariendi actus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time of a natural Birth ought to be accomplished in the space of twenty four hours; if the Womans travel continue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time with vehement pains and dangerous Symptoms, it may be called hard labour, or difficult Travel in Child-birth.</p>
               <p>There are various Causes of hard Labour, sometimes tender Women by reason of pain,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Causes.</hi>
                  </note> are very fearfull, and do endeavour to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pains, and consequently the Birth also.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Child being weak or dead, and not following the Water in Due-time, before the passage be too dry may be the Cause; especially if the Mother be weak, by reason of any Disease afflicting her, or by too much Evacuation of Bloud, or there be not sufficient Motion of the Womb, and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Belly.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Child's head may be too big, or the passage too strait.</p>
               <p>Also the Child may be turned in the Womb, and the Hands, Shoulders, Back,


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98252:135"/>
Belly, or Buttocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may come forward to the Birth, and then the endeavour to bring forth will be painfull and difficult.</p>
               <p>The signs of hard Labour are easily known;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signs.</hi>
                  </note> if the Child do stir, and there be strong pains, and no water appear, the Secundine is strong.</p>
               <p>If pains be weak, and long before they return, and more in the Back than Belly, the Infant is weak.</p>
               <p>If the Woman be little, and her Husband big and full shouldred, then there is a great Child, which will cause tough work.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hard travel in Child-birth is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, for sometimes the Mother,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Progn.</hi>
                  </note> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Child, and many times both do lose their Lives.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Woman be in Travel above four days, the Child can hardly be alive; and therefore must be drawn away before it be too late; for if it be neglected, it will cause Fevers, Faintings, Convulsions, Sleepiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Forerunners of Death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If sneezing cometh of its own accord, it is a good sign of deliverance.</p>
               <p>First give this Cordial to strengthen both the Mother and Child.<note place="margin">

               <p>Then such things as hasten the Birth may be safely administred.</p>
               <p>To encrease the Pains, and further the Womans Labour, I commend sneezing, and also the following Medicines.</p>

               <p>Some things have a peculiar property to help the Birth; as the stone <hi>Aetites,</hi> Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, Storax, the Eyes of a Hare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> held near the privities.</p>
               <p>The time being come, the Woman must be put into a posture, (which every Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife doth understand) and let her not labour too much, till strong pains come; and then


<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98252:136"/>
let her resolve on patience, and not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly in the time of her Travel.</p>
               <p>If she be faint, you may give her some of the formention'd Cordial Julep to comfort her.</p>
               <p>Let your hands be anointed with some Anodine Ointment.</p>

               <p>In Latin they are called <hi>morbus Renum,</hi> which comprehends not onely any Ach in the Kidneys, but also the Stone and Gravel in the Reins.</p>
               <p>Nephritick pains may be caused divers ways.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. First by a sharp salt matter, or a sharp and serous <hi>Lympha</hi> in the Kidneys, which doth easily concrete into a Stone, especially when the Ferment of the Reins is much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated; which may be known by those cruel torturing Fits, that come by intervals.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:98252:138"/>2. Worms in the Kidneys, which for the most part arise from Bloud there corrupted, may be the cause of pain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An Abcess or Tumour in the Kidneys, following an Inflammation, doth hinder the passage of Urine, and is always accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great pain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It may also be caused by glutinous Phlegm, obstructing the fleshy parts of the Kidneys, and hindring the separation of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; so that it is not strein'd into the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of the Reins as usual, but is deprav'd and vitiated: Whence the natural descent of the Urine, through the Ureters into the urinal Bladder is also hindred.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </note>The same also may happen sometimes by a stone sticking in the Funnel, and stopping the entrance of the Ureters.</p>
               <p>Although I think that Stones sticking in the Ureters themselves, cannot long hinder the passage of Urine; because it hath been found by experience, (in dissecting of dead Bodies) that Stones near the bigness of a Doves-egg; have been sticking in the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; by the sides of which Stones, Urine descended freely, which was evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Ureter was no were distended, unless where the Stone did stick: Neither was there any Urine contain'd in the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, above the obstruction; besides when the Party was living, there was no stoppage of Urine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:98252:138"/>Those fits which come by intervals, are caused by a debility or vitiousness of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kidneys, which generates crude, salt and sharp matter, which causeth those cruel Tortures; and should all the Gravel and Stone come away, the pain would not be the less, untill the Kidneys themselves be reduc'd to their right temper: For many in perfect health have voided much Gravel at a time without the least pain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is evident that Gravel is onely the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and not the producer or primitive cause of this pain.</p>
               <p>The Symptoms of Nephritick pains are so much like that caused by the Stone,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signs.</hi>
                  </note> that they cannot be easily distinguished; for the signs of both are great pain of the Loins, loathing or vomiting, there being a great consent between the Reins and Stomach.</p>
               <p>The Patient often pisseth bloudy water, and when the Reins are ulcerated, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is often evacuated with the Urine.</p>
               <p>Wherein the force of concreting or grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of Stones (in divers parts of the Body) consists, is not enough known;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause of the Stone.</hi>
                  </note> I will freely declare what I conjecture in this obscure matter, whereby I may (according to my power) the more help others (that are ingenious) to search out this hidden truth.</p>
               <p>All the Stones that are generated in the


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98252:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Body, may be dissolved in the sour Spirit of Salt <hi>Peter</hi> or Niter; whence I conclude that the Coagulation of Stones cannot be expected from an acid Spirit as such, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from another somewhat contrary to it in part at least.</p>
               <p>If any consider the several things, that promote the growing together of natural things, they will find that such force is in tart things; whence the Glutinousness, and Toughness of fluid things is wont to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd; to which if earthy, and volatile salt parts be join'd, something will be produc'd not much unlike Stones.</p>
               <p>I incline therefore to this opinion, that an earthy and salt matter, join'd to that which is glutinous, groweth together into Stones by help of a tart humour.</p>
               <p>Also Gravel of all kinds (that is usually seen in the bottom of Urine) testifieth that the conglobated Glandules are all affected, by a frequent external Cold, or else by sour things taken in, and when the Gravel is great it is then near to the Nature of Stones, yea sometimes groweth together into Stones, especially in cold phlegmatick Bodies, where (for the most part) it giveth Stones their first rising, and daily cherisheth their production, and increaseth them; and the more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where a glutinous, stone-making faculty doth concur in the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:98252:139"/>Many Histories mention,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Histories.</hi>
                  </note> that Stones are produced from a stone-making Spirit, or Breath out of the Earth, which hath turned the Bodies of Men, Beasts and other things into Stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riverius,</hi> (in his last edition) quoteth <hi>Aventius Annal. Bavar. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Anno</hi> 1343. who saith, that above fifty Men, with many Cattle were turned into Stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ortelius</hi> telleth the like story, that whole Herds in <hi>Russia</hi> have been turned into Stone.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Camerarius</hi> reporteth, that in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Chilo</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> at the blast of a South-wind (which happeneth four times in a Year) whole Troops of Horse have been turned into Statues of Stone, standing in the same warlike Posture, in which they were marching.</p>
               <p>Children are most inclinable to this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in Nature, because they have much moisture, and weak digestions, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Crudities.</p>
               <p>Stones are generated in many parts of the Body, as the Gall, Reins, Bladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I once opened a Woman that had sixty four Stones in her Gall.<note place="margin">

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>I also dissected another whose Ureters were stony, and out of her Gall I took out a large Stone, and a small one (about the bigness of a Hazle-nut) out of the Neck of the Gall.</p>
               <p n="1">

               <p n="2">2. Pain from acrid <hi>Lympha,</hi> &amp;c. may be cured in those that are young, if the strength be not too much dejected, nor the Disease hereditary.</p>

                     <hi>Cure.</hi>
                  </note>That we may now address our selves to the Cure of these grievous Diseases; I would advise those who are not very skilfull in the Art of Physick, to forbear giving of any thing in these Distempers, without the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of an experienc'd Physician; for I believe many Stones have been bred in those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (who before were free from it, and were onely troubled with Nephritick pains) by the frequent taking of ill Medicines; for many Remedies have been invented to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Stone; but experience teacheth that they are most of them inimical to the Reins and Bladder, and debilitate their Ferment.</p>
               <p>The solvent of the Stone ought to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenious, and so singular, that it submit not to any digestions, or fermental Powers, through which it passeth in its way to the parts affected; for the Virtue of all common Remedies taken at the Mouth, are alter'd and transmuted in passing three digestions: For


<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98252:140"/>
acid things, (from which much hath been hoped) as soon as they are past the Stomach, lose their acidity, and are converted into a saline Nature, so that the dissolving Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the acid is wholly transmuted before it gets either to the Reins or Bladder.</p>
               <p>Likewise those Medicines which are injec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Bladder with a Syringe, ought to be agreeable to its Ferment, that it may not be painfull thereto; for if but a small quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of any sharp Medicine be injected, it stirreth up an intolerable Strangury, it being wholly foreign to the Ferment of the part.</p>
               <p>And seeing the Stone, and all other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers of the Reins and Bladder, are wont to be bred, and increased in length of time; the Remedies which you administer must be long us'd, before you may have experience of their effects.</p>
               <p>I will here set down some choice Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, not onely to hinder the increase, but to dissolve small Stones in humane Bodies, if they be long enough us'd.</p>
               <p>Amongst which we may deservedly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the first place to Spirit of Niter (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stones of any kind are so easily and manifestly broken and dissolved by it) which may commodiously be mixt in any ordinary Drink, or Wine and Broths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to a light acidity; whose excellent effects all may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.</p>

               <p>If the Patient be plethorick, Phlebotomy may be used with good success.</p>
               <p>If a Stone chance to stick in the Ureter, which causeth numbness, by its pressing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Muscle <hi>Psoas,</hi> and the Nerves,</p>
               <p>In this Case, apply a Ventose on <hi>os Ilium,</hi> which may bring the Stone by degrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bladder; afterward anoint the parts grieved with Rabbets fat.</p>
               <p>If the Stone in the Bladder be very big, there is little hopes of dissolving of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Patient (being in continual pain) be willing to submit to Lithotomy; I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise them to make choice of an experienc'd Artist; lest by Precipitancy the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour neglect to cleanse the Bladder, after the Extraction of the Stone; by the neglect of which, many have generated the Stone again, and have been forced to endure that dreadfull operation the second, and sometimes the third time, under which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have died, and others who recovered, have never held their Urine.</p>
               <p>In other Nephritick pains, if the fleshy parts of the Kidneys be obstructed, they may be opened by Diureticks, that cut, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate, and make glutinous Phlegm fluid. For example,</p>

               <p>I speak these things by experience, and because it is of great moment in practice, I commend them to the truly Studious of Physick.</p>
               <p>If the Urine be bloudy, it testifieth the opening of some Vessel of Bloud in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, Ureters, Bladder, or its Neck.</p>

               <p>It being a quick or plentifull pissing or making of water.</p>
               <p>The cause is either external, or internal.</p>
               <p>The external, or primary efficient Cause,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </note> is an immoderate drinking of stale Beer, Sider, or acid Wines, either French or Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish; by which an incurable <hi>Diabetes</hi> hath been ofttimes suddenly contracted.</p>
               <p>The internal Cause of this Disease, is sharp, serous humours abounding in the Bloud, by which not onely the whole Mass of it doth in time become too thin, but the nervous Juice is also thereby ill affected, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Reins inflam'd, by the continual flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the over acid serous humours: Whence the attractive faculty of the Kidneys is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, drawing the serosity of the Bloud more potently from the emulgent Vessels into the Funnels, and provoking the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive faculty, it is soon sent (through the Ureters) to the Bladder, from whence it is often evacuated by pissing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:98252:144"/>The signs are a continual pissing, so that much more moisture is voided,<note place="margin">

                  </note> than is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the Body, by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>It is always accompanied with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Thirst; the sick is also feverish, something like a Hectick.</p>

                     <hi>Progn.</hi>
                  </note>If it continue long, it will decay all the radical moisture of the Body, which will render it incurable, but if it be taken in the beginning, and the Patient be young, it may be easily cured.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cure.</hi>
                  </note>All things which have power to incrassate the thinness of the Bloud, and temper the over acidity of the humours, may be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred in this Distemper.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the Cure, after a stool hath been procured by an emollient Clyster, you may open a Vein in the Arm.</p>
               <p>The next day a gentle Purge of Rhubarb may be administred; but if the Stomach be foul, and the sick can vomit easily, you may give an Antimonial Emetick with good success, because it will potently draw the sharp peccant humours from the emulgent Vessels and Reins, and evacuate some of them both by Vomit and Stool.</p>
               <p>After the Operation of the Emetick, let the sick take two spoonfulls of this Cordial Opiate often, which will ease pain, and thicken the humours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:98252:144"/>Take the Waters of Barley, red Poppies,<note place="margin">

               <p>You may prescribe this, or such a like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, for the Patient's ordinary drink.</p>
               <p>Take the Roots of <hi>China, Sarseparilla,</hi>

               <p>Let the Diet be cooling, and thickning Broths and Jellies made of Knuckles of Veal, with the Roots of <hi>China</hi> and Comfry boiled in it, is excellent.</p>
               <p>You may also make Panado's of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Broth, with a few Crums of White-bread, and the Yelk of an Egg.</p>

                  </note>The causes are either external, or internal.</p>
               <p>The external Cause is a large Wound in the sphincter Muscle of the Bladder, which sometimes happens in Lithotomy; for by extracting a great Stone, the sphincter Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle may be so much lacerated, that it ceaseth to be contracted, and the Orifice of the Bladder to be shut, wherefore the Urine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilleth of its own accord.</p>
               <p>It may be caused internally by the Palsie, Apoplexy, Epilepsie, Syncope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Ebriety may be the Cause of the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Nerves, which from the Loins are inserted into the Neck of the Bladder, and so render the sphincter Muscle incapable of Contraction; hence the Urine is involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily voided.</p>

or if it be caused by a Wound in the sphinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Muscle of the Bladder, it is incurable.</p>

               <p>If it be caused by Ebriety, Sobriety may be commended to cure it, especially by the help of inward means to strengthen the parts affected.</p>
               <p>Many things have been given to Children, that have been troubled with this Distemper; the most effectual are these.</p>
               <p>Fried Mice, the inner Skins of Hens-giz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, Cocks-weasands, <hi>Pudenda suilla,</hi> Stones of a Hare, Snails with the shells, all or any of these dried and poudred; also the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Agrimony, Egg-shells, the burnt Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of an Hedge-hog, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Any of these may be given in red Wine, or in Lime-water chalibeated, which may be dulcifi'd with Syrup of Comfry.</p>
               <p>If Phlegm do abound in the Body, you may purge it with Phlegmagogues.</p>
               <p>Also sweating with gentle Diaphoreticks, is very effectual.</p>

               <p>These differ onely in degree, for when the Urine is totally obstructed, it may be called <hi>Ischuria,</hi> but when little is voided, and by drops, it may be called <hi>Stranguria.</hi>

                  </note>These distempers may be caused by vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Phlegm, or coagulated Bloud in the Ureters, or <hi>Vrethra,</hi> especially if a Stone, or some Gravel do also stick in the Passage, by which the obstruction will be more strengthned.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it is caused by a schirrous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or other excrescency of Flesh, as a Carbuncle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> growing in the <hi>Vrethra,</hi> or Chanel of Urine.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it is caused by a preposterous holding in of the Urine, either, for shame or


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:98252:146"/>
want of opportunity to evacuate it; so that the Bladder being extremely fill'd and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, it hath not power to contract it self, hence the voiding of Urine is supprest.</p>
               <p>It may also be caused by sharp humours, fretting and ulcerating the internal Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Bladder, by which it is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally stirred up to contract it self, and expell the Urine which is in it; so that the Bladder is empty, having little or no Urine in it, as I have known by experience.</p>
               <p>This may be called a Bastard <hi>Ischuria,</hi> which may be also caused by some hurt in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive or expulsive faculty of the Reins.</p>
               <p>If the aforesaid Causes be violent, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth an <hi>Ischuria,</hi> but if remiss, then a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury is stirred up, in which there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Irritation to extrude the Urine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though slowly, and by drops, with exceeding pain and trouble.</p>
               <p>Suppression of Urine is dangerous,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Progn.</hi>

               </p>

                     <hi>Cure.</hi>
                  </note> and draw away the Urine with a Catheter, as I have often done both from Men and Women with good success.</p>

seek the Cure in the Chapter of Nephritick pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Glutinous Phlegm, and coagulated Bloud, may be cut and attenuated with Aromaticks boild in Water or Wine, and mixed with oily volatile Salts, Spirit of Niter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Stone-Horse dung is rich in Volatile Salt, wherefore if you mix the Juice of it with Rhenish-wine, and drink it often, you will admire its wonderfull effects, in curing not onely Stoppage of Urine, but most other obstructions.</p>
               <p>Those Diureticks prescrib'd in page 266, 267. are also very effectual here.</p>
               <p>Let the Belly and parts affected be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Dears-suet, which will conduce much to give ease.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Vrethra</hi> is obstructed by a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You must gently thrust in a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Instrument made of Lead or Silver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first anointed with some consolidating Ointment.</p>

               <p>Hence it was first called the <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> and afterward the French disease; since which time, many of the precipitant youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Europeans</hi> (to their great Costs and Pain) have been punished with this impure vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Affect.</p>
               <p>This Itch in spite of Mortals will be catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (where there is no fear of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain) but the beginning natural momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany Pleasure, will often urge a smartfull end; so that this is the product of that sin of uncleanness, for which God hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 13.4. <hi>Whore-mongers and Adulterers God will judge.</hi>

               <p>To describe this virulent contagious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, It is an universal sour taint of the sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick parts; the seed in the spermatick Vessels being first corrupted with a cold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested Putridness, is sometimes conveyed outward to the groins, infecting the obscene parts with a filthy eating Crusty scab.</p>
               <p>But if the poisonous malign quality (got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by impure Coition) be transfer'd to the Liver, which is the chief Subject of its more easie invasion, and its special residence; it

must necessarily suffer egregious corruption, from whence the afflicting taint is dispersed into the whole habit of the Body, vitiating and corrupting the Nutrition of every part; by which the sick becomes wholly cachec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and the filthy Pox (without speedy help) tyrannizing with many malign Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and afflicting both the body and mind, doth at length hurry the Patient into the pit of silence.</p>

               <p>It may be called in Latin <hi>morbus spinalis,</hi> it being a Disease of the Spine of the Back.</p>
               <p>This spinal Disease is commonly called in English Rickets.</p>
               <p>It is peculiar to Children, because they abound with a crude phlegmatick matter; for if they labour under a cold moist Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, there is presently a Penury and Paucity of the Animal Spirits; for the Brain, <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum,</hi> and <hi>spinalis medulla,</hi> being more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:98252:153"/>
than is wont, is unfit for percolation, so that the most spirituous part of the Bloud cannot pierce, or be strein'd through it: Hence the separation of the Animal Spirits is diminisht.</p>
               <p>For the aforesaid cold, moist, phlegmatick Humours, compacting the soft substance of the Brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is thereby too much thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and straitned in its porous passages.</p>
               <p>The coldness of Air, Water, or Snow, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently affecting the Head, seems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and prove this opinion; because when the Glandules of the Brain are affected and thickned by a stuffing of the Head with Coldness, then a more sparing production of the Animal Spirits useth to follow.</p>
               <p>The essence of this Disease consists not onely in the Animal, and vital, but natural Constitution also, all the Functions being (in time) vitiated: For the <hi>spinalis medulla</hi> being primarily affected, all the Nerves which proceed from it (in its passage through the <hi>spina Dorsi</hi>) must of necessity be stupifi'd, and vitiated with a loose Feebleness; hence also all the nervous, membranous, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous parts, through which those Nerves are carried, or inserted into, must conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be vitiated with an inward weak Slipperiness; so that the very ends of the bones, as well as all the Faculties of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, bear a share in this Distemper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:98252:154"/>When the Rickets is confirm'd in Infants, it seems to have some affinity with divers other Diseases, <hi>viz.</hi> a Chronical fever, an extenuation or leanness of the Body, and an <hi>Hydrocephalus,</hi> and many more, which are frequently complicated with this affect.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note>And indeed not onely this, but most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diseases (in process of time) do unite unto themselves other affects of a different kind, and therefore (for the most part) there is a complication of Chronical diseases before Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Causes</hi>
                  </note>The Causes are either external, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</p>
               <p>The external may be any of the Non-naturals exceeding, either in excess or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>All things cold and moist do powerfully contribute to this Disease, especially an over cold and moist Air, which is most frequent in the Spring; the Air being then cloudy, thick, rainy, and full of vaporous Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Children of those which inhabit near the Banks of the Sea, or great Rivers, Ponds or Marshes; (that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to too much Rain, or are fed with a great Number of Springs) are more or less subject to this affect; for by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of such cold and moisture, the Bloud and Humours becomes too slippery, and


<pb n="291" facs="tcp:98252:154"/>
therefore (in their Circulation) they must unavoidably cause a softness and looseness in all the parts.</p>
               <p>Also experience testifieth that those Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which are born, and nursed near the Lead-mines in <hi>Derby-shire,</hi> &amp;c. are generally affected more or less with a languidness of the Limbs.</p>
               <p>For the Air being infected with noxious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Exhalations, which (for the most part) fight against the inherent Spirits of the parts, by a kind of venemous malignity; by which the spirituous pulsificative Force of the external parts is extinguished, and the strength of the Limbs, and whole Body much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and diminish'd.</p>
               <p>Hither we may also refer fine soft Linen, applied actually cold and moist, (being not well dried by reason of the moistness of the weather) to the Spine of the Back, which is near the Original of the Nerves; the use thereof being too long continu'd, it cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Roots of this Disease in that tender Age.</p>
               <p>Likewise Aliments of any kind, which are too moist and cold; or too thick, viscous and obstructive, do manifestly cherish this Distemper.</p>
               <p>And I am induced to believe that Ebriety in English people, especially the Gentry; and eating of much Flesh; and not using frequent


<pb n="292" facs="tcp:98252:155"/>
labour, or exercise, may be a reason why this Disease is more common and natural to Children in <hi>England,</hi> than in other Regions, perhaps far exceeding it both in cold and moisture; as <hi>Scotland, Holland,</hi> &amp;c. wherein this affect hath not been observ'd to be very common.</p>
               <p>And therefore ebriety and eating of much Flesh, and defect of motion, and want of exercise doth most frequently, and most effectually concur to the production of it; because the inherent heat (in stupid and sluggish People) is not sufficient to resist and expell the superfluous moisture by a due transpiration: By which means the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bloud is become slow and lesned, and the production of the vital heat very feeble, and weak; so that nature is thereby forced to permit all the parts of the Body to be affected with a certain softness, looseness, and internal lubricity, more than is meet; which do sufficiently evince, that this is an efficacious cause, and a part of the essence of this Disease.</p>
               <p>Hence we may easily infer that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of such Parents are more inclined to this distemper, than others who drink mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, and eat less Flesh, and are more active and lively.</p>
               <p>The internal Causes, are excrementitious Humours luxuriant in the Body, especially

Phlegm and serous humours retained, and vitiated, being naturally cold and moist, and little spirituous, and affected with an internal slipperiness, wherefore upon a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous accumulation of these humours, the production of this affect succeedeth; because thereby a Colliquation of the parts, and a dissipation of the inherent Spirits will be easily introduced; whereby all the parts will afterwards be rendred obnoxious to this cold and moist Distemper.</p>
               <p>Many diseases preceding this affect, may be the cause of it; especially those which do extenuate, and much weaken the Body, as all Fevers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And also all cold and moist, phlegmatick, and cachochymick Distempers, which will induce a stupour and dulness in the affected parts, and cause obstructions.</p>
               <p>Also any great Pain, Inflammation, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, Fracture, Luxation, or any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural affect, that hinders the standing and playing of the Child, may be some cause of this Disease.</p>

                     <hi>Signs.</hi>
                  </note> a kind of slothfulness and numbness doth invade the Joints, and by little and little is increased, so that daily they are more and more averse from motion; besides in the beginning of this affect, there is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally observ'd, a certain laxity, softness, and flaccidity of all the first affected parts; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb n="294" facs="tcp:98252:156"/>
which followeth a great debility, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guidness, and enervation of all the parts subservient to motion; so that (for the most part) they speak before they walk, which is vulgarly held to be a bad <hi>Omen</hi>; and if it vehemently increase, they do not onely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally lose the use of their Feet, but can scarce sit with an erected posture, and their weak and feeble Neck can hardly sustain the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the Head.</p>
               <p>In the progress of the Disease, the Head and Face increaseth in bigness, but the fleshy parts below the Head, are daily more and more worn away.</p>
               <p>There is also observ'd in this affect, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain swellings, and knotty excrescencies about some of the Joints; these are chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous in the Wrists, and somewhat less in the Ancles, and in the tops of the ribs; the Bones in the Armes and Legs, and sometimes the Thighs, and Shoulder-bones wax crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Teeth come forth slowly, and with greater trouble than usual, and at length the Breast becomes narrow, and the <hi>Abdomen</hi> swollen, with an extension of the Hypochondriacal parts, which hindreth the free motion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> downwards; and by consequence doth somewhat inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the breathing, so that respiration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes difficult, accompanied with cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Pulse being also weak and small;


<pb n="295" facs="tcp:98252:156"/>
and in the increase of the Disease, all these signs become more intense and evident, and many, and more grievous, are daily accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If this Disease be light and gentle,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Progn.</hi>
                  </note> the Children affected therewith may be easily restored to health; sometimes by the sole benefit of Age, the vital heat being increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and summoned forth to the external parts by the force of frequent exercises.</p>
               <p>But if it so vehemently prevaileth, that the increase thereof cannot be prevented by the best internal means, and also most prudent applications, then there is immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it proceed from other Diseases, or be complicated with them, it will be the more difficult of curation; especially if the Bones of the Armes, and Legs be crooked, and there be great bending and tumour of the Joints of the Wrists, Ancles and Ribs.</p>
               <p>But if the Symptoms decline, and the Child do easily endure agitation, and have often eruptions in the Skin, as Wheals, Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or Itch, then there is great hopes of recovery.</p>

If they be not cured in five years, they will grow deformed and crooked, and (for the most part) will become dwarfs, and live sickly, being either Cachectick, or Phthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical, till death do put a Period to their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Life.</p>

                     <hi>Cure.</hi>
                  </note>As for the Cure of this disease, both the Child and Nurse must keep a good diet which is easie of Concoction.</p>
               <p>In the mean time you must not neglect the best Chyrurgical and Pharmaceutical means which will most conduce to the spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy recovery of the weakly Infant.</p>
               <p>Universals being premised, the most effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and approved Chyrurgical means in this affect, are Incision or Scarification of the Ears, and little Fountains or Issues; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many more may be used, <hi>viz.</hi> Frixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Blisters, Ligatures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Incision or Scarification in the Ears, is to be performed on the Ridge, in the inside of the Ear above the hole; which must be stopt to hinder the Bloud passing into it.</p>
               <p>This Operation must be often repeated, at least once or twice in a month; which hath proved succesfull when many other remedies have been ineffectual.</p>
               <p>And here it may be noted, that Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being made in that place, must needs be of greater efficacy than if it were instituted in any other part of the Ear, or elsewhere.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, Because the beginning of the fifth pair of Nerves is near that place, many of their Branches being distributed through the hollow of the Ear, and are thence convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the <hi>Spinalis medulla,</hi> from whence it shooteth out little Branches which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny


<pb n="297" facs="tcp:98252:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Nerves of the marrow of the Back, to the ends of the very Legs and Feet; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ingenious Anatomists have accurately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Scarification being there made, it is probable, that the matter (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly oppresseth the very beginning of that Nerve) is immediately evacuated, by which it is freed from obstruction; and having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so gotten vigour (being excited by the pain and Inflammation) it driveth out all stupid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from within it; by which means the Branches of the Nerves from thence arising, which are communicated to the <hi>Spinalis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla,</hi> and many other parts may be in some measure excited also.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because by this means, there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular evacuation of the Head, which is wont to be oppressed with fullness in this affect.</p>
               <p>Besides, the Bloud being somewhat lesned, the thickness and toughness thereof must thereby be corrected; and (by consequence) an equal distribution of it promoved to a more regular nourishment of the parts.</p>
               <p>Issues in the Neck are also much approved in this disease, because they very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to lessen the unusual magnitude of the Head, and to evacuate the superfluous watriness thereof, and repress the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate increase of the bones; also it manifestly


<pb n="298" facs="tcp:98252:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
drieth up the too much humidity of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Marrow, exciteth heat, strengthens the Nerves, and expelleth the astonishment.</p>
               <p>As for the Pharmaceutical or Physical means, you must be sure to cleanse the first passages either by Clysters, Vomits or Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purgations.</p>
               <p>When the Belly is Costive and the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are hardned, or some flatuous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours afflict the Bowels with vehement pain, then Clysters are chiefly required; and they may also be injected before any preparation, Vomit or Lenitive purgation.</p>
               <p>I need not prescribe any forms, because a little Milk and Sugar, with a few Anise-seeds boiled in it may serve.</p>
               <p>Also an Emollient or Carminative Clyster (that is gentle) may be injectrd when there is occasion.</p>
               <p>Emeticks if well prepared, and prudently administred are very efficacious, and will conduce much to the Cure.</p>
               <p>And here I again commend Antimonial Vomits before all others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, because they not onely power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully evacuate Crude or corrupt humours, and all manner of impurities contained in the Stomach by Vomit; but by an agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and commotion, raised in all the parts, especially in the Bowels, they loosen the gross and viscous humours adhering to the


<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98252:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Guts, and convey them through their many involutions and labyrinths, by which they are expelled by Stool; in which respect they are also profitable against torments of the Colick, and very conducible to unlock obstructions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They most effectually irritate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive faculty of all the parts of the Body, by which they compell forth the hidden and unappearing causes of diseases, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of intermitting Fevers; for by the very straining to Vomit, the Guts are also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimulated to cast out by siege; the Liver poureth away the Choler by the Biliar pore; the juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> is voided into the small Guts; the Spleen perhaps doth unbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then its excrement into the Stomach; the Kidneys exern through the Ureters; the Lungs by a strong Cough eject their Phlegm through the Wind-pipe; the Head emptieth it self of salt waterish Rheums by the Palate, Nostrils and Eyes; finally the whole Body (for the most part) is rendred more prone to a <hi>Diaphoresis,</hi> either by a manifest sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or else by insensible transpiration.</p>
               <p>If any are afraid of Antimonial prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (though most safe and potent) they may administer Salt of Vitriol, from five to ten grains, either in Posset-drink or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convenient Vehicle.</p>
               <p>Also the following may be safely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred.</p>

               <p>Those that are averse to vomiting may take lenitive Catharticks, which must be made pleasant and potable, that the young Patient may not loath the taking of them.</p>

               <p>This and all other Gouts are most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accompanied with a fierce, cruel, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting pain; and thus much, if not too much of the Names of the Gout.</p>
               <p>The Causes are either external, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Causes.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>The external Causes are Gluttony, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, immoderate Venery, Idleness, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cold, and excess or defect of any of the non-naturals.</p>
               <p>The internal Cause of all Arthritick pains, is the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> too acid and sharp, which raiseth a vitious Effervescency with Choler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby a Fermental sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is increased; and when it is exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, it is sent forth into the extreme parts, and meeting with that seedy Glue, which is between the Joints, doth not onely affect it with its fermental Acrimony, but is also the grand Cause of the virulent tormenting pain and inflammation in the part affected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:98252:161"/>But seeing the pains are different, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in divers People sick of this Distemper, but also the Pains of the Gout are divers in the same sick party, we must therefore, as well by reason as experience, search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true Cause thereof.</p>
               <p>Therefore in as much as the present mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesting pains, are not always freed with the same medicines, no not in the same fit; much less all that are Gouty.</p>
               <p>We may hence consider that divers hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, as Choler, Phlegm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are diversly mixt and fermented with the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> which is peccant in a four Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, being the primary Cause of all Gouts.</p>
               <p>And here we may note,<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> that this over acid humour doth molest the sick (chiefly in the beginning of the fit) with a corroding pain; but after a while, when Choler (by its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding heat) hath gotten the Predominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it causeth a divers burning pain, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diversity of its faultiness.</p>
               <p>But if viscous Phlegm be predominant, the pain is much dull'd, and the motion of the part hinder'd with a phlegmatick Tumour, rather than an acute pain; which ought to be accurately observ'd by every ingenious Artist.</p>
               <p>When the Gouty humour hath invaded any joint, there is presently an unusual heat,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signs.</hi>
                  </note> and more exquisite sense in it, than formerly,


<pb n="306" facs="tcp:98252:162"/>
so that the least touch of any hard thing doth hurt the part; and the longer it continues, the more the Pain increaseth, with redness and swelling of the part affected, and most commonly attended with a Symptomatical Fever.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note>1. The Gout is a Chronical disease, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with violent Pain, but is seldom mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, except in very weak Bodies that are much decay'd by Sickness, or old Age.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it continue long, till the Joints are knotty, it is incurable, according to <hi>Ovid,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But if there be no Knots in the Joints, and the Patient is laborious, and the Body is (for the most part) soluble, and there be swelling of the Veins called <hi>Varices,</hi> then it may be happily cured.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it becomes habitual to the sick, the morbifick <hi>Idea</hi> is implanted in the vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and transfer'd through the seed, which makes it Hereditary.</p>

                  </note>The Cure of the Gout will consist,</p>
               <p n="1">1. First in defending the afflicted Joints, as well against future Pain, as freeing them from that which doth molest at present.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the universal amendment of the juice of the <hi>Pancreas.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. In the altering and diminishing of Phlegm any way peccant.</p>
               <p>To asswage the present Pain I commend the following Medicaments, which will conduce much to mitigate the sharpness of the acrimonious humours in all Gouty peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ease the part affected.</p>
               <p>When there is excessive heat, you may bathe the Gouty part with this Fomentation very hot, with wollen Stuphs, which must be often renewed.</p>
               <p>Take the Waters of the Spawn of Frogs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </note> Fumitory, Elder, of each one quart; Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Mary-golds one pint; <hi>Opium,</hi> Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, of each half an ounce; mix it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Art.</p>
               <p>But when the Pain is more corroding than burning, I commend the following to be used as the former.</p>
               <p>Take of Treacle-water half a pint; the Waters of the Spawn of Frogs, Parsley, of each one quart; <hi>Opium,</hi> Camphire, of each half an ounce; mix it.</p>
               <p>After Bathing with either of these; apply this Cataplasm.</p>
               <p>Take Powders of the Roots of Marsh-mallows, Flax-seed, Barley-meal,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pultess.</hi>
                  </note> of each four ounces; new Milk three pints; boil it to the Consistence of a Pultess, and add Oils


<pb n="308" facs="tcp:98252:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Flax-seed, Earthworms, the Ointment <hi>Martiatum,</hi> of each three ounces; Camphire half an ounce; mix it according to Art.</p>
               <p>Where exceeding heat doth concur, and the Body abounds with sharp Choler; instead of sweet Milk, you may substitute Butter-milk.</p>
               <p>Also a Pultess made of the Crums of White-bread, new Goats or Cows milk and Saffron, with Oil of Lin-seed, and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, may be deservedly commended, to asswage any Pain.</p>
               <p>If the sick be very phlegmatick, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of motion doth afflict, more than pain; then Opiats may be omitted, and things more Aromatical may be used in all external Applications.</p>
               <p>The following Pultess, or one like it, may serve for Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plasm.</hi>
                  </note>Take the Powders of Orris-roots; the Flowers of Chamomel, and Elder, Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min-seeds, Barley-meal, of each four ounces; the Tops of Wormwood, Mints, of each four handfulls; boil them in two quarts of water of the Spawn of Frogs, to the Consistence of a Pultess; when it is almost cold, add Treacle-water, Oils of Chamomel, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, of each three ounces; mix it.</p>
               <p>Also the Root of Briony, and Cuckow-pintle bruised, and made into a Pultess with Cow-dung is excellent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:98252:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>If you add Volatile Salts of Animals, or Vegetables to your Medicines, whether Fomentations, Cataplasms, or Ointments, they will be the more effectual.</p>
               <p>You may prepare an excellent Volatile Salt of Earth-worms (of great Virtue) for the Gout, which may be resolved into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour by fermentation, and putrefaction.</p>
               <p>If the Gouty Patient do abound with Phlegm, or the Juice of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> exceed in an acid Acrimony causing a corroding Pain; it may happily be mitigated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd with Balsam of Sulphur made with Oil of Amber, with which let the grieved part be embrocated, and it will forthwith raise a very hot Effervescency, which will presently cease again, and remove the great Pain in a moment, even to admiration.</p>
               <p>After the pain is over, you may apply one of the former Cataplasms, or some Anodyne. Ointment, to comfort, and (by degrees) restore again the membranous parts.</p>
               <p>The following Linament may serve for Example.</p>
               <p>Take Oils of Earth-worms, Scurvigrass,<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:98252:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>In the mean time, inward means (to take away the Cause, and ease the pain) must not be neglected.</p>
               <p>If the Patient have a plethorick Body, after a Stool hath been procured, by a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative Clyster, with <hi>Electuar. Caryocosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, &amp;c.</hi> Let a Vein be opened.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But Leeches applied to the Hemorrhoidal veins, are effectual in all Gouts.</p>
               <p>Two or three days after bleeding, you may administer the following Pills.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>But if the sick be inclining to vomit, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister an Antimonial Emetick.</p>
               <p>You may purge and bleed so often as you see occasion.</p>
               <p>Issues near the part affected, and also to raise Blisters upon the part, have been found by experience to be very effectual.</p>
               <p>Also bathing and sweating in nitrous or sulphurous Baths, either natural or artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, are much approv'd of.</p>

            <p>A <hi>New Idea</hi> of the Practice of Physick; written by that famous <hi>Franciscus De-le-boc Sylvius</hi>; late chief Professour of Physick in the University of <hi>Leiden.</hi> The first Book; of the Diseases either constituting, producing, or following the Natural functions of Man not in Health. Wherein is contain'd, beside a new Method in General, a Vindication of the Spleen and Mother from fits attributed to them. As also a new Discovery of intermitting Fevers, the Yellow-jaundice, and other Diseases, never before discover'd. All clear'd by Anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal experiments, and Chymical demonstrations; as also by their Cures. Faithfully translated by <hi>Richard Gower,</hi> formerly Student under the Authour. Printed for <hi>Brabazon Aylmer,</hi> at the three Pigeons against the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> in <hi>Cornhill.</hi> in <hi>Octavo.</hi>
