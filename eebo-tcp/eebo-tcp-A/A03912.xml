            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bath of holy baptisme, we are regenerate, washed, pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rified, and made the children of God, by the workmanship of the thre persons, which formed also heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and earth, and al the glorious fairnes of them, they brought the children of Israel out of the house of bondage, they preserued them from the tyranny and oppression of the Heathen, they gaue also vnto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then prosperitie and aduersitie, peace &amp; war, pouertie and riches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they gouerne the vniuersal church, whose workes be vnseparable.

I entend to wryte a comentary to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie, but I wil take it out of gods word and I wil open scripture with the key. I defend that Malachie meaneth none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sacrifice, then an oblacion of a pure and contrite heart: and I proue it thus. First Malachie speaketh of such a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as shall be offered in all places vnto God, as vndoubtedly this hath bene, &amp; shal be to the worlds end. He speaketh also of a cleane sacrifice:<note place="margin">The sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

If he had bene chief,<note place="margin">Gene. 19</note> the scripture wold not name the twain, remaining Lord which in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the twain Lord also, signifieth vnto vs, that there was no superiorite, no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, no prerogatiue among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but equalitie, as in the trinitie, whiche is figured by these thre men.

Why then doth the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture say, Loth sayde vnto them, oh nay my Lord, behold for as much as thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt hath found grace in thy syght. &amp;c. These two men signifie Christ and the holy Ghost, not the father, for so much as they saye that the Lorde sent them to destroy that place. For Christ and the
