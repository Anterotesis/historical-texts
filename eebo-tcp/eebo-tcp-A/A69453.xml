            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe General acceptance which <hi>Sylvia's Revenge</hi> found amongst all sorts of Readers, encouraged the <hi>Author</hi> to think of a Second Part, which tho' wrote after another manner, has equally as much of Satyr in it as the first.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylvia</hi> is for continuing the Old Quarrel between the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster;</hi> the <hi>Cannons</hi> are mounted, and the <hi>Portcullis</hi>'s drawn down, and she seems to be Deaf to any terms of Capitulation; but tis hoped Matters may come to some Accommodations in time, and the <hi>White Flagg</hi> be hung out, and such Articles agreed upon as it shall be hard to determine which Party is the Victorious.</p>
            <p>If there be any soft and tender Lines in the following Essay, they must be asrib'd to the warmth of <hi>Sylvia's</hi> Passion; but if there are others which carry Thunder and Lightning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them, they must be own'd to proceed from that Concern, the <hi>poor Creature</hi> has for her Injur'd Sex; for we all know that in the matter of Love and Revenge, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are Inimitable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62305:3"/>But why <hi>Sylvias Complaint?</hi> and why not <hi>Sylvia's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint?</hi> Is the Feminine Government so fixed that it fears neither open Assaults nor secret Vnderminings? Are there no grievances to be redrest, no incroachments upon their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? no Violation of their Priviledges? If such things are, who more fit to represent 'em than a <hi>Woman?</hi> especially one who can speak <hi>feelingly</hi> of 'em; for when a Woman finds the glittering Title of a <hi>Mistress</hi> is only made use of to Decoy her to anothers Will, her Blood must creep very slowly in her Veins, who has not some resentments of the Matter; and it has ever been the Civility of all Nations to give Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers leave to speak.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Sylvia</hi> has the Approbation of the <hi>Ladies,</hi> she Values not the Censures of the <hi>Men,</hi> she being her Sexes Champion, and will Defend their Cause against the Pen of any Daring He whatsoever.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>It is resolv'd, she will write on and try,</l>
               <l>The Wit and Courage of the Enemy;</l>
               <l>Her Sexes Cause she'll Nobly carry on,</l>
               <l>'Gainst the bold <hi>Satyr,</hi> and the sly Lampoon,</l>
               <l>Until there shall not be a <hi>Scribling Fop,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That Dares pretend to take the Cudgells up.</l>

               <l>'TWas in <hi>JVLY,</hi> one glorious Afternoon,</l>
               <l>When to avoid the <hi>scorching Heat</hi> o'th' <hi>Sun,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To a thick <hi>Grove,</hi> compos'd of <hi>Beech</hi> and <hi>Oak,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>(A place where <hi>Poets</hi> oft their <hi>Muse</hi> invoke.)</l>
               <l>I went alone, but fearing lest I shou'd</l>
               <l>Be thoughtful in so dark a <hi>Solitude,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62305:4"/>To Charm the seeming horrour of the place,</l>
               <l>I brought with me the Works of <hi>Hudibrass,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>— (Diverting <hi>Author,</hi> in whose ev'ry line</l>
               <l>Exalted Wit, and weighty Judgment shine.)</l>
               <l>Each Page with mighty pleasure I perus'd,</l>
               <l>But as I o're his Charming Numbers mus'd,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Methought</hi> I heard a strange Confused Noise,</l>
               <l>Of Sighs and Groans, which seem'd of <hi>Female</hi> Voice;</l>
               <l>Amaz'd I listned, and without a pause</l>
               <l>Resolv'd by curious search to find the Cause;</l>
               <l>The Eccho was my Guide, which quickly brought</l>
               <l>Me to the place to find out what I sought;</l>
               <l>In the most private part of all the <hi>Grove,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>By Nature fram'd for <hi>Solitude</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>;</l>
               <l>To my Amazement and Surprize I found,</l>
               <l>In Melancholly posture on the Ground,</l>
               <l>A <hi>Fair</hi> and <hi>Young,</hi> but pensive <hi>Virgin</hi> laid,</l>
               <l>She was (or at the least she seem'd) a <hi>Maid</hi>

               </l>
               <l>Her Habit <hi>Rich,</hi> but Careless in her Dress,</l>
               <l>Which best the Sorrow of the Thoughts express;</l>
               <l>Tears from her Eyes like <hi>liquid Pearls</hi> distill,</l>
               <l>A sight would Savages with pity fill;</l>
               <l>Thrice gently on her <hi>Brest,</hi> her hand she struck,</l>
               <l>And mixt with Sighs, these following words she spoke:</l>

               <l>We have no Weapons for our own Defence,</l>

               <l>Shou'd I within my thoughts but take a veiw</l>
               <l>Of all those Ills our wretched <hi>Sex</hi> pursue,</l>
               <l>From Infancy till Aged we become,</l>
               <l>The Number would amount to such a Sum;</l>
               <l>My Thoughts would sinck beneath the pondrous weight,</l>
               <l>Those Ills I do not mean which angry Fate</l>
