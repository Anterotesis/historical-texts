            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Brief TREATISE Of the Principal Fruits and Herbs That grow in Barbadoes, Jamaica, And other Plantations in the West-Indies. The First Part.</head>
            <p>THis short discourse of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the <hi>Fruits</hi> which that gallant Island of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> yields, I thought would not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, as well for that I do not know that any has hitherto distinctly spoken thereof, as also because they being for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29668:3"/>
the most part the same with those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, not only in the Western Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but also in <hi>Guinea,</hi> the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and most hot Countries, one and the same pains will serve to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the Properties of them all; or at least to give such a general Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Account, that whatever you meet with in th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the first place, we must in general observe, that all Fruits in hot Climates are better, as being as by Nature pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to an higher degree of Maturity, than in Cold; for the Sun making his nearer visits with auspicious Beams, and an innocent and complemental Warmth both better disposes the Earth's teeming Womb, and by a most excellent Chymistry, refines the ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fruits from their gross dull phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29668:3"/>
Juices; Winter, Snows, Frosts and other Excesses, are there only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred and talkt of, not known; and that Sol's too ardent kisses may not be offensive, Nature provides al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways delicate cooling Briezes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing Gales of Wind, which not only relieve the Inhabitants from the ill effects of an excessive Heat, but much conduce to the melioration of the Fruits. Which being thus brought to its full and absolute perfection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gathered, may much safer be eaten in those warm Countries, than in Cold, where they have not Sun enough to digest their Rawness into a Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so fit for Food. And as it is not fit for Man or Beast to labour so much and so hard in hot Regions, as in cold; therefore the wise Creator has by his Hand-maid Nature given them food prepared to their hands, that they might have no such need of Toiling, there being there no Winter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume what Summer brings forth, but a continued Spring or perpetual Harvest
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29668:4"/>
of most excellent and never-failing Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getations, some of the chief of which we shall proceed to speak of in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Of Pine Apples.</head>
               <p>THis incomparable <hi>Fruit</hi> deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly claims precedency for its delicacy and excellency; for when full Ripe, its Taste is so exquisitly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleasant, that it seems to exceed all others that the Earth produces; whence 'tis reported, that when some of them, by great care, and the favour of a speedy Voyage, were brought into <hi>England,</hi> (for very rarely can they be preserv'd so long) and presented to King <hi>Iames,</hi> he was so ravisht with its charming deliciousness, that he said, <hi>It was not fit to be tasted by a Subject, but only proper to Regale the Gusto of Princes, inured to the highest Delicacies.</hi> The four grand Qualities, whence all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Tastes do proceed, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tringent</hi> or <hi>Saltish,</hi> the <hi>Bitter,</hi> the <hi>Sweet</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:29668:4"/>
and the <hi>Sour</hi> are herein so equally mixt and compounded by Gods Hand-maid (Nature) that 'tis hard to distinguish which of them does predominate; but the truth is, the most delightful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator and King of all Tastes, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sweet</hi> doth a little exceed all the other three, so that there is nothing appears but an inviting Beauty, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Redolency, and ravishing Taste, that feasts in the highest degree, all those Senses at once.</p>
               <p>For it must be noted, That all the various and numberless Tastes of things, both in the <hi>Annimal, Vegetable,</hi> and <hi>Mineral Kingdoms</hi> do all proceed and arise from the four grand Qualities aforesaid, (at large described in my <hi>Way to Health,</hi> and <hi>The Good House-wife made a Doctor, &amp;c.</hi>) so that there are but four perfect Tastes, they being the Radix of all others, as the seven Notes are the Basis or Foundation of all Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Harmony; and according to the Equality of those four, or the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or predominancy of each, such a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29668:5"/>
Taste does carry the upper dominion in all things, and accordingly is the same more or less grateful to the Pallate and Stomach, and homogeneal to the Body.</p>
               <p>But though our Pines are one of the best sorts of Fruits in the world, they stand the Inhabitants of those parts, and the Eaters of them, but in very little stead, being by our English chiefly eaten after or betwixt Meals, to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure wanton Appetite and depraved Senses; for which cause their genuine nature and operation is hardly known to those that devour the most of them; however, their excellent Taste, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Smell, and curious Shapes do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their noble Vertues, being either eaten alone, or with Bread on a well prepared Stomach; for they moderate, cool, comfort and refresh the Spirits, cleanse the Passages, remove Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that fur the Pipes, and also purge away and help to digest all slimy and sharp Juices that offend Nature, being light of Concoction, and if eaten full
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29668:5"/>
Ripe, on an empty stomach, it power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully purgeth by Urine.</p>
               <p>It makes a good breakfast or supper with the help of Bread, it being clean and easie, that the natural Heat can easily overcome and digest it at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and Bread does dry up the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of the Fruit, and renders the Nourishment more firm. But note likewise, that this rare Fruit is only good <hi>Raw</hi> (as we usually, but impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call it) that without any other Preparation, than what Nature, and the Sun's digestive Heat gives it; and entire and alone (except only a little Bread eat with it) it is so compleat, that it will not admit of any alteration or composition, since they cannot add to its Vertues, or raise Nature to an higher degree, as in many other things may be done; but here, what-ever humane Art is used, or things inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, it is still for the worse, because <hi>Nature</hi> (the Art of God) has already cook't it to the sublimest Perfection, it being the best and most fragrant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29668:6"/>
Fruit the <hi>West-Indies</hi> do bring forth, most wholsom and healthy to be eaten now and then, <hi>viz.</hi> two or three times a week to make a Meal or part of a Meal with it; for the God of Eternal Wisdom hath appointed all things to be used with Sobriety, Temperance and Order, for which end he hath given all these brave comforts unto the Sons of men: This is a Fruit highly digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Coelestial Energy, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> in the Sign <hi>Leo.</hi>

               <head>Of Plantains.</head>
               <p>THis is a brave noble Fruit, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and grateful to the Senses, if not gathered till full ripen'd on the Trees, they afford a Nourishment of a middle nature, but not so quick nor brisk on the Pallate and Stomach, nor so easie of Concoction as <hi>Pines,</hi> because in these the <hi>Lunar</hi> Property does pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate, and the four Qualities or Tastes are not so equaliz'd; yet it must
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29668:6"/>
be acknowledged a good and wholsom Fruit, especially for such as live easily, and work but little; for hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers ought to have food that affords a Nourishment more firm and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; and therefore such should eat Bread, or some other dry Food with them.</p>
               <p>It is a general custom to gather them before they are ripe, and let them ripen off the Trees, which is both contrary to Reason and Nature; for thereby the purer brisk spirituous parts are as it were totally destroyed; so that the true lively Vertues and Sweetness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of a dull heavy nauseous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant Taste, and harder of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, affording a much worse Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment. Nor is this Fruit good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any way prepar'd as by Art, tho' it be customary for many to make Tarts with them, and compound them with several Ingredients, which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; for Nature has already advanced them to the highest degree, provided you let them alone long
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29668:7"/>
enough, <hi>viz.</hi> till they are full Ripe; and all alteration then is for the worse, and not for the better. <hi>But the Women must be doing something, though it be Mischief, as Mother</hi> Eve <hi>has given them an Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if when 'tis full Ripe it be eaten temperately, either alone, or rather with some Bread, it is wholesom and profitable to Nature; but be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised not to eat them in wantonness on full Stomachs, or between Meals, as the custom of the English is, but not without great prejudice to Nature; for they are naturally a little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dull and heavy, and therefore they require a brisk Appetite and well prepared Stomach, and store of heat to concoct them. This Fruit is under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the Sign <hi>Pisces</hi>; as to heat they are moderate, <hi>viz.</hi> rather cooling than hot; when full ripe they gently open Obstructions of the breast, being eaten with Bread in a Morning; but unripe they are bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and if baked with Sugar, Spices,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29668:7"/>
and the like, lose their natural opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thereby become hot, and apt to obstruct the Passages, and tire the Appetite and Stomach, generate evil Juices, dull Spirits and thick Blood, and therefore so prepared are no commendable Food.</p>

also healthful; but if they are eaten green, or ripned off the Trees, then their nature and operations will be altogether contrary, and have many ill effects; for before Fruits arrive to their full Maturity, the <hi>Astringent, Bitter</hi> and <hi>Sowr Qualities</hi> do too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently predominate, and all such things must therefore prove hurtful to the Body; whereas when full ripe, the sweet balsamiak and pure spirituous Qualities do tincture the <hi>Saturnine</hi> and <hi>Martial Properties,</hi> and as it were cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate their poysonous fierce hot Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they can scarce be felt or tasted, the powers and vertues of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> being become more strong.

               <p>LImes are an Immature Fruit, in which two extream Properties do predominate, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Saturnal</hi> and <hi>Martial Poysons,</hi> because the Sun and Coelestial Influences, have not had Power to raise or awaken the balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick or friendly Vertues of Nature, or bring the Properties into an equal operation, as is done in other Fruits; for these two fierce Qualities are so powerful, as indeed being the very
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29668:19"/>
Radix of the Fruit, that the friendly Property or good Vertue is wholly hid or captivated by them, so that it cannot be tasted or felt; hence the Juice of this fruit does contain (as I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where declared) a <hi>Saturnine</hi> churlish fire, which is of an hard coagulating astringent or binding nature and oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, like the raw cold saturnine Air of Winter, which does congeal the Water, and harden all things. 2<hi>dly.</hi> A sharp keen Martial Property, of a sour harsh fretting nature and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now these two Extreams mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together, do render it very hurtful to the genuine nature of the Stomach, and generate bad Blood, stir up the original Poysons by simile, and the Saturnine Property does draw toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and congeal the Excrements in the Bowels; and the Martial Fires are forth-driving, and cannot endure to be bounded, from whence proceed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Diseases, as <hi>Gripes, Collicks, Illiacal Passions,</hi> or cruel <hi>Belly-Akes.</hi>

               <p>In this Vegetation all friendliness and pure Vertues are captivated, and the original forms of Nature do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate, there being in it no kind of Equality or Harmony, but all is out of Tune, and the four <hi>grand Qualities,</hi> whence all Tastes proceed, have here their operations in Discord, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly combate one another; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever any may pretend, the frequent eating of it must needs prove pernicious to Health; for those fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned fierce poysonous Qualities do by degrees as it were insensibly prey upon and violate the natural Heat, and hinders the way of the Spirits, as if men designed to mortifie their natural Legs, on purpose to use Wooden ones
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29668:21"/>
or Crutches; so they destroy the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine innate heat of their Stomachs, and vainly endeavour to procure a false and adventitious one, that may better (forsooth) supply Nature. The truth is, this hot fiery Sawce does powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stir up or beget Appetite, and warms the Stomach, which does intice many to eat it with their common food, but they never consider the mischiefs it brings unto Health, being like <hi>Brandy,</hi> a dram of which after a full Meal of heavy Victuals, will help Concoction, and ease the burthened Stomach, but the frequent use of it will so destroy the natural Heat, that the Stomach will not be able, after a little time, to digest its food, neither with it nor without it: So this Spice being too much eaten, wounds Nature to the very Heart; for by degrees it debilitates the proper Heat, infects the Blood with a salt sharp keen Quality, partches up and consumes the sweet Oyl and Radical Moisture, suffocates the pure Spirits by whole-sale, causing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29668:22"/>
the <hi>Blood</hi> (their limpid Fountain and natural habitation) to become wheyish and watery. Especially, if <hi>Chollerick</hi> or <hi>Sanguine Complexion'd People</hi> shall accustom themselves to the eating of such Sawces, it will much sooner and more deplorably vitiate the <hi>Tone</hi> of their Stomachs, than of such as are <hi>Pleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick</hi>; but they are not good nor natural for any whatsoever, except now and then in a Physical way for very cold dull heavy <hi>Phlegmatick People,</hi> and they must eat it sparingly too; but the mischief is, whoever shall accustom themselves to these Sawces, cannot forbear from Excess therein, without great trouble and constraint upon themselves: The very same is to be understood of all other Extreams, as <hi>Brandy, Tobacco,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>Besides, all such things are far more pernicious, and bring greater danger to Health in hot Countries, than in colder Climates, as many have found by woful Experience, because there the central Heat is nothing so strong
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29668:22"/>
and powerful as in colder Regions, and consequently the pure Spirits and Radical Moisture weaker, and more apt to be wounded, suffocated or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, as all do know that have Eyes that can see into the <hi>Arcana of Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to our <hi>Guinea-Pepper,</hi> it is such an Extream in Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> so hot and poysonous, that if the bigger sort be dryed, and the Cods cut and the Seeds scattered amongst Clothes, Hats, or the like, that are to be packt up, it proves the best Preservative from the Moth, and other Vermine that is known; for its excessive keenness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys all Generation, even in the very bud. Likewise, if it be burnt in a Room, the Doors and Windows being close shut, it will destroy and kill all <hi>Buggs, Fleas,</hi> or the like, and you too, if you do not get out in time, its fumes are so hot, poysonous and penetrating, when once the fire has open'd its body, and manifested what before internally lay hid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:29668:23"/>This bigger sort our English do commonly pickle, and so preserve it for a common Sawce to eat with <hi>Flesh:</hi> Now this pickling of it with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Vinegar</hi> does still add to its heat and sharpness; For <hi>Salt</hi> is of an hot harsh sharp Nature, and if it be not mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately eaten, dries, heats and is of a partching operation, very inimical to Health, but a Ring-leader to the <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> and other Diseases, and <hi>Vinegar</hi> is also of an hot keen fretting Nature, especially when joyned or incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with such high fires and things of unequal Natures: Therefore the frequent use of this sort of Swace is to be accounted very injurious to Health, especially in such hot Climates, where the continual influences of the <hi>Sun</hi> do more exhale and draw forth the Radical Moisture, thereby weakning the central parts, which ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather to be refresht and cherisht by proper Foods, than annoyed and prejudiced by such hot violent things, as do yet further depress and debilitate them.</p>

The excellency of this Herb does chiefly reside in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasteful or bitter Quality, which at first eating is somewhat unpleasant, but a little custome will make it friend- and more delightsom than others that are less bitter; for all Herbs are the most grateful to the Stomach, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest of Digestion, in which the Bitter Quality or Taste is a little predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for this property is lively, and the cause of Motions quick and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating;

               <p>IT is a very common conceit amongst the <hi>Europeans,</hi> that of late are come to Inhabit in Plantations of <hi>America,</hi> that by the Nature of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29668:26"/>
Climate or by reason of the unusual Heats, People there are not so long-liv'd as in the more cold <hi>Northren</hi> parts of the World; and for this they appeal to Experience; <hi>Do not we see</hi> (say they) <hi>how men are cut off by Diseases in the prime of their Years, and very few attain to old Age?</hi> Whence 'tis a common Proverb amongst them, <hi>Soon Ripe, Soon Rotten,</hi> as if this were the very Nature of the Climate; but this is all Mistake; they blame the Climate, when themselves are only to blame: 'Tis their own Intemperance, not that of the Heavens, which shortens their days: The wise and merciful God hath ordered so providentially all parts of this habitable World, that his Creature [<hi>Man</hi>] may thereon live comfortably, if he please: 'Twas the Error of the Antients when they divided the Earthly Globe into five <hi>Zones,</hi> to imagine two of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabitable, one of which they called the <hi>Frigid Zone,</hi> through excessive Cold, and the other <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:29668:27"/>
through extreamity of Heat. But Experience has confuted their guessing Philosophy, and shews us, that both these are commodious enough to dwell in, if Discretion and Sobriety be used; Is one Region cold? God has given its Inhabitants strong Constitutions, great Stomachs, gross suitable Food, and Furze wherewith to defend them. Is another very hot? Here are refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Briezes constantly imployed by Nature, to fan and divert them, rare delicate Fruits, easie of Digestion, to supply all the necessities of Nature, and support them in Strength and Health. But such is the Perversity of men, that being depraved by custom, they pursue and take quite contrary measures to those that Nature dictates, and in the hottest Climates gorge themselves with the grossest Foods, various Dishes of <hi>Flesh, Fish</hi> and <hi>Fowls,</hi> whereof they daily eat to Gluttony, and the strongest Liquors, as <hi>Madera Wines, Brandy</hi> and <hi>Punch</hi>; so that where they need the least, finest and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29668:27"/>
lightest Meats and Drinks, they cloy and oppress Nature with the grossest and strongest; And is it any wonder that they are then afflicted with Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, or cut off by immature Deaths? If a man will turn the top of his Candle downwards, and extinguish it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Tallow, how unjustly does such an one blame the Winds for putting out its light?</p>
               <p>The sweet Influences of the Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stials, and especially the heat of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's bright Eye (the Sun) does in hot Countries prepare all sorts of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getations and Fruits, so as that they become more wholsom and proper for the Body, than in colder Regions, thereby pointing out which is the most natural food in such Climates; of which the Natives (though by us esteemed <hi>Barbarous</hi>) are so wise as to take notice; for they in most hot Countries do more incline to eat <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> (though not so much as they ought, nor do they prepare many of them so well as they should) yet
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29668:28"/>
thereby, and by being strangers to Riot and Intemperance, they retain an undisturbed Health to very great Ages; So in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> where the food is chiefly <hi>Herbs, Fruits</hi> and <hi>Grains,</hi> and their Drink only <hi>Water,</hi> to meet with Persons of <hi>One Hundred Years of Age,</hi> is common; nay, it is credibly reported, that some of those called <hi>Brachmans,</hi> who do wholly abstain from eating either <hi>Flesh</hi> or <hi>Fish</hi> do lengthen out their days to <hi>One Hundred and Twenty,</hi> and <hi>One Hundred and Fifty Years</hi>: And in <hi>Guinea,</hi> tho' it be a very hot Country, and generally the Constitution of the Air accounted very unwholsom, yet you shall see the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> frequently live <hi>One Hundred and Twenty Years</hi> in great strength and vigour. By all which it is plain, that the fault is neither in the Soil, nor the Climate, but it is <hi>Intemperance</hi> both in Quantity and Quality, is the main cause of the grievous Distempers and short Lives of our English that travel into hot Countries, and also of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29668:28"/>
Weakness and untimely Death of so many of their Children. For Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious in the Excess they commit, such as cannot rationally be imagined of any that had not a mind willfully to destroy themselves: for to omit their Extravagances in ordinary Diet, the vast Quantities of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Fish</hi> which they unnecessarily devour, I have heard it credibly related and affirmed, That there has been the Quantity of <hi>One Thousand</hi> or <hi>One Thousand Two Hundred</hi> Bottles of <hi>Wine, Madera</hi> and <hi>Claret,</hi> consumed at one Feast, made by a common Plantes of <hi>Barbadoes</hi>; and that the like Superfluity (as if they would vye for Luxury with the old <hi>Romans,</hi> in the declining Age of their Empire) is not infrequent in that and other <hi>Western Plantations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let all the World judge, if men will thus seek Death in the Errors of their Lives, how is the Country to be complained of? He that takes his share of three or four such Treats, will have little reason to accuse the heat of

the Weather for casting him into a <hi>Feaver.</hi> If our English, and others, that travel to and live in those <hi>Westenr, Eastern</hi> or <hi>Southern Regions</hi> would be but so obedient to Nature, and kind to themselves as to observe a proper Order and right Method of Living, they would not only live long, but healthy. And for their furtherance and benefit therein (I mean, such as have not absolutely forsworn hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any Remonstrances of Reason, nor betrothed themselves to Madness and ruinating Debauchery) I shall here add a few general Rules or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the Preservation of Health, very necessary to be regarded by all such as live in <hi>Hot Climates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Flesh</hi> ought not to be eaten at all, or very sparingly; for <hi>Flesh</hi> in hot Countries is nothing so firm, good and wholsom as in cold (though the eating thereof may well be spared in both) but on the other side, <hi>Herbs, Roots</hi> and most <hi>Fruits</hi> are abundantly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29668:29"/>
more excellent for Food in hot Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates than in Cold; The same is to be understood by <hi>Fish,</hi> as experience has taught the <hi>Natives</hi> of all such places, who therefore do more incline to eat <hi>Herbs, Fruits</hi> and <hi>Vegetations</hi>; and for want of this Prudence, have not many of our <hi>Northern People</hi> after a full Meal of <hi>Flesh</hi> or <hi>Fish</hi> in those hot parts, been suddenly surprized with various cruel Diseases, as <hi>Feavers, Fluxes,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Full</hi> and <hi>Liberal Eating</hi> of any sort of Food, proves of more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous consequence to Health, especially if the Foods be gross, fat and succulent, because the natural and central Heat is by the great Power of the Coelestial Influences continually exhaled, and so becomes more external, which does in a degree debilitate the Digestive Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for which cause a mans Stomach and Appetite is rarely so sharp and strong as in cold Countries.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:29668:30"/>3. <hi>Great Drinking,</hi> especially of strong exhilerating Liquors, as <hi>Wine, Brandy,</hi> or other <hi>Spirits,</hi> is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious; for all such Drinks, if not cautiuosly used, and well allay'd with <hi>Water,</hi> proves of fatal consequence, and wounds Nature to the very heart, as daily Experience does testifie, and doth sooner destroy Health than in cold Countries, though bad in both. I know this is contrary to the <hi>Vulgar Notions,</hi> but it is agreeable to <hi>Truth, Experience</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi>; only People, by a vitious Inclination, had a mind to debauch themselves with strong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, and the Devil, to humor them, suggested that such Liquors <hi>(forsooth!)</hi> were necessary, and most to be used in hot Countries; and so they got a colour for their Excess, and continue the Maxime and now plead, <hi>They must be Drunk if they mean to be Healthy, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Nature,</hi> as well as <hi>Christianity,</hi> will read them another Lesson; for in hot Climates, the natural or central
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29668:30"/>
Heat being not so strong, by reason of the forcible Influences of the Sun, powerfully exhaling the Radical Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, opening the Pores, and too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently evaporating the Spirits, the <hi>Stomach</hi> and <hi>Digestive Faculty</hi> thereby become weak, and the inclination to drinking is encreased; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son many desire hot spirituous Drinks, finding a present Refreshment; for such Liquors do powerfully awaken the internal or central Spirits by <hi>Simile,</hi> which makes the Drinkers quick, lively and brisk, during the time of their operation, which is but for a Moment, but afterwards they find themselves heavy, dull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed, their Stomach more feeble, cold and raw than before, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines them to take t'other Dram; and still, the more the worse, till Nature be debilitated to the utmost Extremity. The same operation have all <hi>Wines</hi> and other Drinks, if Temperance be wanting, but not so violently as the former; therefore in all hot Climates
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29668:31"/>
there ought to be double the care and temperance, as in cold, both in <hi>Meats, Drinks</hi> and <hi>Exercises</hi>; of which, the Natives of hot Countries may be our Examples; for they do, for the most part live temperately, their Drink <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Wine allay'd with Water</hi>; their Food mean, or more simple and innocent than ours, whereby they are better preserved in Health; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of all People in hot Climates being not so able to bear or endure <hi>great Meals</hi> and <hi>superfluous Drinking</hi> of strong Liquors, as in cold. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most of those that in such places accustom themselves to the frequent use of those <hi>strong spirituous fiery Drinks,</hi> and the common course of gorman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing on <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Fish,</hi> become very obnoxious to the <hi>Dry Belly-Ake,</hi> or <hi>Griping of the Guts, Dropsies</hi> and the <hi>Gout.</hi> For all such Foods and Drinks too violently stir up and consume the natural Heat and Moisture, whereby the digestive Faculty of the Stomach is rendred uncapable to concoct or
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29668:31"/>
make any perfect seperation, whereby the body grows oppressed with a <hi>Mass of Crudities</hi> and <hi>noxious Iuices,</hi> that sometimes fall into the Joynts, infee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and tormenting them; and this is the original of that Rich Evil, call'd, The <hi>Gout.</hi> In other Complexions these and the like Disorders prey upon the sollid parts, and waste the <hi>Flesh,</hi> taking away natural strength and vigour; so that such Persons pine and languish under such a load of daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested Aliment; for nothing is more usual in Nature, than for Extreams to generate or occasion each other, and these you call <hi>Consumptions.</hi> In others, for want of Heat and Moisture the Excrement in the Bowels, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into so hard a substance, that it cannot freely pass; and this is that which the learned call, <hi>The Illiacal Passion,</hi> and the Vulgar, <hi>The Plague in the Guts,</hi> for which most cruel Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease there is scarce a Doctor that hath yet found out a certain Remedy.</p>
               <p>Now in these our <hi>Western Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:29668:32"/>
all these tormenting Diseases are much encreased by the frequent Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of that pernicious Drink called <hi>Punch,</hi> the Nature and effects of which I have herein before hinted, but more fully demonstrated in my Treatise, entituled, <hi>The Country-Man's Companion,</hi> pag. 110.</p>
               <p>In some other Constitutions the central Heat and <hi>Humor Radicalis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wasted by such unfit Meats and Drinks so received, is turn'd into a flux of Humors, both windy and watery, which swells the lower parts of the body; and this is the generation of your <hi>Dropsies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as the Lord our bountiful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is always good, and his Hand-maid (Nature) an indulgent Mother; so they have, as it were, chalked out the means of preventing these Evils, and prescribed proper Diet and Drinks in every Country and Climate to its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, by the natural Productions of each respective Region, would men be so wise to follow those Dictates;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29668:32"/>
for all hot Climates, (as is before intimated) do furnish their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants with wonderful variety and plenty of brave noble, and most fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant <hi>Herbs, Fruits, Roots</hi> and <hi>Grains,</hi> and most pure <hi>Water,</hi> far exceeding those of cold Countries, both in Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and Quality; for in those hot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, Heaven's bright Lamp, that central Fire of the Universe, the <hi>SVN,</hi> has greater power, strength and vertue to fit and prepare all things for our use; and if our English, and others, would be so prudent as to accustom themselves to those harmless natural simple Food and moderate Drinks, then the fore-mentioned Distempers would hardly be known amongst them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They ought likewise to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the proper <hi>Times</hi> of their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or Meals, that is to say, to eat about <hi>Eight</hi> or <hi>Nine a Clock in the Morning,</hi> and then again at <hi>Four</hi> or <hi>Five 'ith Afternoon</hi>; for the common
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29668:33"/>
time of Dinner about <hi>Twelve</hi> or <hi>One,</hi> is neither Rational nor Natural, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Sun</hi> is then near the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and doth then so powerfully draw forth, exhale, and weaken the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Centeral heat of the Stomach, that it indisposes the whole Body, more than at any other time of the day, so that then Nature is not so well able to perform her <hi>Kitchin-work</hi> in the Stomach, by a perfect Concoction or Separation of the Meats and Drinks, and so all the Senses are dulled, and the Intellect stupified, and not a few seeds of diseases are thereby sown through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Body. Besides the long Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings Work or Exercise, has by that time pretty much wearied, dulled, or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated the brisk lively Spirits, which are alwayes the main supports of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction and Digestion, and so Nature is still rendred the more uncapable of doing her work with ease. But in the Morning, after Nocturnal Repose has recovered the wasted Spirits, and made them Brisk, Airy, and full of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29668:33"/>
Life, the digestive faculty is fortified, and rendred able to digest the same quantity of Food, with much more ease and safety. The same is to be understood in the Afternoon, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Night, for then the heat of the day being over, and the Body becomes Cool, Airy, and full of Life, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a sufficient time before sleep, as at <hi>Four</hi> or <hi>Five</hi> a Clock, such Suppers will not Incommode Nature, nor hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Rest, as late eating is apt to do, especially in hot Countries, and still the more in maturer Age, or such as begin to be striken in years, to whom such Meals are most injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such as have due regard to their Health and Strength, ought for the reasons aforesaid to <hi>Rest</hi> from <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> a Clock till <hi>Two</hi> in the Afternoon, which will wonderfully recover their Spirits, and render them much better able to go through with their Labour with a lively Vigour, and to do more

They ought to avoid the frequent eating and drinking of all Foods or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors in which the <hi>Sweet</hi> Quality is too highly predominant; for sweet Foods are of far more dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence as to Health, than most Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple imagin; for all Sweet things when fermented in the Stomach do turn to the highest <hi>Sowerness,</hi> viz. into a keen sharpness, which does not only spoil the digestive faculty, but infects the Blood with a Mangie, Scorbutick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, causing stoppages in all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts, whence proceed Indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and akeing Loyns, and feeble Joynts. For the same cause it is, that such as eat much <hi>Sugar</hi> or sweet food, are extreamly troubled with rotten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd Teeth and Gumes; for those dullified foods cause such a sour acid
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29668:34"/>
                  <hi>Quality</hi> as generates putrifaction, which centers on the Teeth and between the Gumes, and so destroys them: And it were far better and more healthy for People, if they would accustom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seves to Foods and Drinks in which the Bitter and Sower Qualities were more predominant, especially in hot Climates where most sorts of Fruits are sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, for the Root of all Motion, Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Cleansing, consists in the Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Quality; for which reason the <hi>Sophys</hi> or <hi>Wise-men,</hi> both of the <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> and <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries have taught the People to moderate all or most of their foods with <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> that are of a <hi>Bitterish Quality,</hi> which does wonderfully support Nature and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Health, whereby they attain to very great Ages, as we noted before of those in <hi>Guinea,</hi> and the same may be observed elsewhere; for those Patriarchs whose Longevity we find Recorded, did all of them live in very hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: But their Temperance support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature, and so it will (in a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable

degree) all that practice it. And therefore if these Rules of Health be seriously regarded and followed, those causeless scandals on the Climate, the Heat, &amp;c. of these happy <hi>Western, Southern</hi> and <hi>Eastern</hi> Regions (not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior for Health or Pleasantness (if rightly understood) to any in the World) will cease, and the English Traders or Inhabitants may there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their lives in Comfort to as good an old Age, as they would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised themselves in their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: But without Discretion and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in <hi>Diet, Drinks, Exercises</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> of the mind, Diseases will certainly attend us, wherever we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side; and an immature Death be apt to seize us: There is no Region so happy, no Elevation of the Pole so temperate, no Air so salubrious, as to keep People in Health whether they will or no, and those that obstinately violate Nature, and wilfully persue courses absolutely destructive, may justly be rank't amongst the number of

                  <hi>Self-Murtherers</hi>; for it matters not much whether a man kill himself <hi>all at once,</hi> or by repeated Acts <hi>and degrees,</hi> only the <hi>latter</hi> seems <hi>less excuseable,</hi> since it has not the pretext of a sudden Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Passion, but seems a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate design of destroying both his Body and Soul, against all Cautions and Arguments from time to time of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to him, both by Reason and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to the contrary: Those there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that would avoid the Brand of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Felo's-de-se,</hi> let them before it be too late abandon <hi>Riot</hi> and <hi>Excess,</hi> and embrace <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> so shall they have <hi>Health</hi> of Body and <hi>Strength</hi> of mind, and <hi>length</hi> of dayes here, and a <hi>blissful Eternity</hi> hereafter.</p>

            <p>Nay, many times not only our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Enemies, but our Treacherous Friends betray us to these intollerable Miseries; for so far is the Root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness irritated, and such an Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it hath got over us, that for vain trifles our paltry Parents, shall sell their Children, and Husbands their Wives into perpetual Slavery; Nor let any Christian Tyrants for this upbraid us; for if it be (as in truth it is) a most unnatural wickedness in our People to sell them, is it not upon the matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as bad in the Christians to buy them? Nay, rather is not the chiefest Crime in them, since they are the Tempters and Occasioners of it? for they allure our <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whilst we are thus mew'd up in the Ship, besides the inconveniencies of heat, and danger of suffocation, and the Torture of our Chains, we also run the hazard of being half star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for the Ship-Masters out of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, and for their own Lucre, will not allow us fit or competent Meats or Drinks, but just enough to keep Life and Soul together, and that corrupt, decayed stinking and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome, by which all our Healths and Lives are destroyed or impaired; for oft times half or more of our wretched Number dye in the Voyage, and others of us, of more sturdy Spirits and Tempers, when they see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thus Captiv'd, scorning to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a Life that thenceforth would be only advantagious to others, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome to them, by refusing all Sustenance, have shortened their dayes.</p>

            <p>So also we are forced to stand and work at the Coppers, in the hot sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherous Fumes, till Nature being overcome with weariness and want of proper Rest we fall into the fierce boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Syrups, and in these disasters little or no pitty is taken of us, for though some indeed profess a superfinal sorrow

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29668:46"/>
to Maturity in fewer years: 3<hi>dly.</hi> The continual Heat of the scorching Sun opens the Pores, and at those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable <hi>Sally-ports</hi> powerfully draws out and steals away the sweet Oyl and Radical Balsom of Nature, which causeth a dull faintiness and wearisom Indisposition to attend the whole Body with great <hi>Drought,</hi> which proves very injurious to <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Strength:</hi> 4<hi>thly.</hi> All sorts of Foods are here of a weaker or more unfirm Nature than those of cold; and as they sooner arrive to Maturity, so consequently they sooner perish and corrupt.</p>
            <p>For all which reason, it is unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to expect men should constantly and without due intermission undergo such Labour and Travel in torrid Climates, as in those more temperate and refrigerating. Do not hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries presently set open all the Gates and secret Passages of Nature, even to the very Centre? which weakens and evaporates the pure subtle or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Spirits, whence follows exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29668:47"/>
Sweating, Drought &amp; Faintiness; whereas on the contrary, cold Climates shutting up the external Passages, drives the natural heat inward, and makes it more central, which occasions strong natural Heats and Stomachs, able to digest the firmest Foods, and in great Quanties, whence Persons there become strong, hardy and healthy; likewise most sorts of Food in cold Countries is of a firmer, stronger Nature, and generates a more vigorous Nourishment, and firmer Flesh and Fat, and their Fruits will generally keep longer good: Nor did the All-wise <hi>Iehovah</hi> intend or require men to work and labour so strenuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much and long in hot Climates, having in his natural Providence made no such occasion for it, because there is there no Winter, nor sharp saturnal Airs to cut off and destroy what the Summer brings forth, but Nature here is always pregnant and teeming, and displays her self in all Seasons of the year, with pleasant and fragrant
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29668:47"/>
Fruits, and prepares them to an higher degree, and fitter for present Food, though not so firm and lasting. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, People in hot Regions have not need of so many things, there is no occasion for their Houses being so close nor furnisht with so many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Beds and Bedding, continual Fires, and the like Provisional Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations to be laid up before-hand, either for Man or Beast; as also half the Clothing will furnish Nature; and the same is to be understood of Foods; for all things necessary to the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Life are far easier, and with half the Labour procured in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. But these things our Masters never lay to heart, but lay burthen upon burthen, till we utterly sink under the weight of their Oppressions; though many of them cannot but be sensible, that they themselves, though they do little or nothing but eat and drink of the choicest Meats &amp; Drinks, and sleep their fill without disturbance,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29668:48"/>
yet they are here nothing so strong or able to endure Labour and robust Exercises, as they have been and would be in cold Countries; which Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if they had any Bowels of humane Sympathy and Compassion, should encline them to moderate our Servitude, and grant some Allowances of respit and Refreshment unto us, such as might enable us both more cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually to serve them.</p>
            <p>It is a custom amongst many of the great Dons of Masters, to allow their Servants little more than only a small piece of Ground to raise their whole Food and Sustenance from; and tho' this be hard, yet that which renders it worse, is, that they will not allow us any sufficient time to manure it, but we must abate it out of that little time which is permitted us to rest in, otherwise, it must be done upon their Sabbath day, whereon we are allowed to rest from our ordinary La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for our Masters; but if then we must work as hard to manure our
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29668:48"/>
small pittance of Ground, or else starve, I do not find what great advantage we have of that day more than another.</p>
            <p>It is also an order or custom in some Plantations, where the Christians inhabit, to allow their Negroes two hours Rest at Noon, <hi>viz.</hi> from eleaven of the Clock till one, which is a wise and righteous Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but few there are that will admit us above half that time, but hurry us again to work, which proves very injurious to our Healths; for then the Sun (which is the central heat of the Universe) draws near the Meridean, which does powerfully open the Pores, especially of those that labour hard in the scorching beams thereof, and exhales the Radical Moisture, which weakens and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the whole body and mind, and renders us unfit for the After noons work; for he that shall rest from eleaven till wo, which is three hours, shall thereby be rendred so lively, lightsom and brisk, that he shall be able to perform more labour than
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29668:49"/>
another man of the same natural strength, that is kept to it all day long, or allowed but one hours rest only, and with much less prejudice to Nature.</p>
            <p>This is a thing worthy to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered by our Masters; for it would add much to their <hi>Profit and our Health,</hi> which is also their <hi>Wealth</hi>; for pray tell us, <hi>O you brave and swaggering Christians!</hi> who exercise this strange and severe Mastership over us, who sport your selves in all manner of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity and wantonness, and grow fat with our Blood and Sweat, gorman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing with the fruits procured by our <hi>Slavery</hi> and sore <hi>Labour</hi>; set by your <hi>Rum-Pots,</hi> your <hi>Punch-Bowls,</hi> your <hi>Brandy-Bottles,</hi> and the rest of your <hi>Intoxicating Enchantments</hi> for a while, and stand still a little, and suffer the cool of the day to overshadow you, and the long obstructed Fountain of Reason in your Hearts to send forth its streams, and then you will be able to tell us what heart or life, strength

dear and tender Infants, they make our Wives, during the time of their Pregnancy, work equally with the rest, even until the very day of their delivery, or Birth of their Children, which we can scarce call their <hi>Lying-in,</hi> for, alas! they have no moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nurses, nor groaning Cheese, none of the Comforts of Ale, or Wine, or Caudles, or rich refreshing Suppings, but must be content with a few dry <hi>Potatoes,</hi> and a Caudle made with stinking <hi>Mackarel,</hi> or Broths of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsom putrified Flesh, and glad if they can get it; for in truth they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them little or nothing more than at other times, and but two or three dayes Rest; and then they must out again into the Field with their young and tender Babes, and leave them sprauling on the Ground, which is their only Nurse and Cradle; nor can they expect any Rocking, unless God to punish our Masters Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, should send an Earthquake; Nay, when they cry for want of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29668:53"/>
presence and tendence of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and for lack of Sustenance, our rough and churlish Overseers will hardly allow time to give them Suck.</p>
            <p>If our Women be disordered by the natural Infirmities attending their Sex, or by the frowardness and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Children, which have broken their and our short Hours of Sleep; No body comes and asks, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth! how have you rested to Night?</hi> Nor cries, <hi>Pray keep no Noise, she has not slept well to Night</hi>; No, no, let the case be how it will, as soon as the Gray-ey'd Morning draws the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Day, and the Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to peep from behind the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the East, the blustering Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer blows his Horn, or Sheal, and then presently all Excuses set apart, we and our Wives must turn out with our tender Children, whether we or they be well or sick, disposed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed, it matters not, to Work we must go, under the Whip and the Spur, and the Sun's scorching Beams
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29668:53"/>
all the day long, and none comes and desires them to eat a bit and drink before they go out, to prevent the Wind; but on the contrary, if our Wives never so truly plead their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to labour thus, they find no Ears open to hear them with pity, but severe Hands and lusty Whips rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to lay on cruel Stripes upon their tender and fainting Backs, and so they are forced to carry their Children with them into the Work-field, and suckle them there, when they can get an opportunity all day, and so lug them home again at Night, and have no refreshing Drinks, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Foods to supply them with dry or moist Nourishment. These things, though our hard hearted Masters regard not, yet methinks, our <hi>Mistrisses,</hi> if not out of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity or good Nature, yet out of respect to <hi>Woman-hood,</hi> and their <hi>own Sex,</hi> and by a Compassion raised from their own experience of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiulties of Child-bearing, might be
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29668:54"/>
induced to prevail with their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to be more tender in such cases, but so far are even these counted of the softer Sex, from any such <hi>

                  </gap>ommi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seration,</hi> that where they alone have the sole command, as when they are left Widdows, or the like, many of them are more fierce, dogged, pinching, oppressing and severe than the men themselves.</p>
            <p>But we are not only with unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Beating, made to labour beyond our strength and abilities of Nature, but many of our Masters will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us Food that's sufficient, either in quantity or quality, to support and maintain Health, Strength and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; so that being pined with want as well as worn out with excessive Drudgery, we oft times perish, or at least become poor, lean, feeble, and hardly able to go. For as when they do allow us Ground to plant for our Nourishment, the same is so little, as not to be half sufficient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and so much the worse, because
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29668:54"/>
they afford us no time to Till and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it; So when they pretend to buy us any Food, more than our Plantation-Provisions, <hi>viz.</hi> either Fish or Flesh, they will go to all the Merchants in the Town, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently inquire out, and buy the worst they can lay their Hands on, <hi>viz.</hi> stinking decayed Flesh and rotten Fish, and cry, <hi>It is good enough for</hi> Negro's, <hi>they care not how bad it is, so they can buy it cheap</hi>; Some of them indeed are so free that they will allow us one salt <hi>Mackarel</hi> or two a Week, but others will afford us none, which lays us under a necessity either to Starve or Steal; for we are reduced to such Extremity, that if a Horse dye, and is buried several dayes, if some of our People come to know it, they will dig up the putrified stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Carrion, and make good Chear of it; others will eat all the Cats, Dogs, Rats and Mice they can lay their Hands on; So that through Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and the depravedness of our
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29668:55"/>
Minds, with evil Customs, we are immers'd into all the Beastiality and Uncleanness, which the <hi>Christians</hi> have never endeavoured to regulate, or prevent, but rather the contrary.</p>
            <p>By these, and variety of other the like Miseries and Oppressions, many of us have been brought to dispair, and chuse a miserable sinful Death, rather than such a wretched Life, whence some have Hang'd, others Drown'd themselves, some cut their own Throats, and procured to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the like violent Deaths; but our Blood is of no value in the sight of our Masters, which yet we doubt not but will cry unto thee. O thou most just Creator and Governour of men! for Revenge upon those that have been the prime occasions of all these Evils.</p>
            <p>For these hard Usages and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do terribly awaken the central Wrath and sleeping Poysons of the Original Nature, by which means and provocations we become sullen,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:29668:55"/>
dogged, malicious, envious, angry and revengeful, all which devilish Dispositions are occasioned, or much increased in us by the harsh Tyranny of our Masters; Hence many times we neglect our Labour, run away, spoil our Business, &amp; in the anguish of our <hi>souls</hi> continually curse our Masters and their Posterity; And thence on the other side, our Masters take occasion to redouble their Cruel Usages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and be-labour themselves to Beat and Whip us, and hang us up by the Hands, Feet, and the like, and so <hi>Bastinado</hi> us till our Bodies become like a piece of raw Flesh, and we are just ready to give up the Ghost: For though we are, <hi>O Great Creator</hi>! the Work of thy Hands, and were made in thine Image, and endued with rational and immortal Souls, yet we are nothing more in many of our Masters esteem, than <hi>their Money,</hi> and if some of them could find out a way to torment and plague us ten fold more, they would do it, provided
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:29668:56"/>
we might still be but able to perform our Drudgery, to maintain them in Superfluity and Gluttony.</p>
            <p>For our precious Lives are reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more than those of so many Dogs, though they cannot gratifie their Pallates and Paunches, nor maintain themselves in their Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and sinful Vanities, but meerly by our Labours, yet on any irregular Passion or devilish Humor, some of them will sacrifice our Lives to their Fury, and neither count it Murther, nor any Sin, neither did we ever hear that their Law in such Cases made Inquisition for Blood, or punished those that committed such Murders, otherwise than by a Fine, or ordering them to pay so much Sugar for the business; as if there were any Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Proportion or Adequateness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween such a <hi>Crying Crime,</hi> and such a <hi>triffling</hi> Punishment. Do not your Plantations which have drank up our innocent and unrevenged Blood, cry unto the Lord, the righteous Judge
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:29668:56"/>
of Heaven and Earth, for Justice and Retaliation? For divers of our <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men</hi> have been Butcher'd this way, and little more notice taken of it than if we were Fleas or Gnats, or Wolves or Bears.</p>
            <p>Nay, some of us have been Burnt for running away (and yet we were therein justified by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for who would not escape, if he could, out of Slavery?) and this too, although their Mistrisses and Masters might have sold them, to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported elsewhere; but their Envy, Passion and Revenge was so great, that they prefer'd it before their Gain; one Widdow Woman above all the rest, (as we have heard) burned her <hi>Negro</hi> for running away, and saying, that, <hi>Where-ever he met her, he would Kill her</hi>: So when she caught him, she was Judge, Jury, Executioner, and all, though at the same time she might have sold him to be Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Mevis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here was (as doubtless 'tis true) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge

in the highest degree! If she had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatned him, as he threatned her, she had been even with him, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would satisfie her Malice but to Roast him. O thou most just and eternal Lawgiver, and Perswader of all Creatures! Do these things taste or favour of <hi>Christianity</hi>? Have they any such Examples left them by thy Primitive Servants? Or did thy eternal Son, the Saviour of the World, preach any such Doctrine, or set any such Example in his meek and holy Pilgrimage on Earth? If not, by what Authority, or by what Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation against his divine Law do you practise these things? Is it not from the power of the Serpent and the Dragon, <hi>viz.</hi> the devilish fierce wrathful hellish Nature? Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly if they Repent not of these their cruel Crimes, though they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Christians</hi> never so much; <hi>the Christ of God</hi> will say unto them, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, I know you not, ye bloody Workers of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:29668:57"/>By what right, or on what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions is it, O you nominal <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>! that you take upon you to make us your Slaves, to over-labour, half starve, beat, abuse and kill us at your pleasure? Is it because we are not of your Religion and Belief? Hath God any where given a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to those that profess <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> that they may, when they list, fall upon any Persons, whom they call <hi>Heathens,</hi> and dispossess them of their Lands, or lead them away Captive, and make Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of them, and use them in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects as Beasts, or rather much worse? This was not sure the way by which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other good men of Old, (whom we often hear you speak of and practise) did convert our <hi>Heathen</hi> Ancestors to your Faith: We have heard some of our <hi>Christian</hi> Masters say, <hi>That Christ,</hi> (whom you pretend to follow as your <hi>Prophet, Lord</hi> and <hi>King</hi>) <hi>is Son of the Eternal and most Merciful
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29668:58"/>
God, his Right-hand, and his eternal Love, in which he reconciles himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mankind, even all those that shall live in this Love-Principle, from which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds nothing, either of Wrath, Anger, Violence, Malice or Oppression, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the contrary, as Patience, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, Good-will, Compassion, Charity, and the like, to all the World</hi>: This, if we mistake not, is the true Christian Doctrine, which most of you do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in Words. But how does this consist or agree with the <hi>Violence, Injustice</hi> and <hi>Oppressions</hi> which you exercise upon us? Or is your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one thing in profession, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in practise? This we are sure of, though, your <hi>Tongues</hi> may be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> your <hi>Hands</hi> are <hi>Heathen</hi>; nay, most times your <hi>very Language</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your before-mentioned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, for how else comes it to pass that you <hi>Rant,</hi> and <hi>Rave,</hi> and <hi>Swear,</hi> and <hi>Curse,</hi> and call devilish <hi>Names</hi> so fast upon the least thing, wherein we displease your Humors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:29668:58"/>But perhaps you will say, That not by virtue of your Religion, but by some super-excellent or higher Dignity of Nature above us, you claim a Right to make us your Slaves and Vassals. But pray, have you this Prerogative from your Descent or Pedigree? Or from some different Fabrick of your Bodies? Or from your extraordinary <hi>Endowments</hi> of Mind? As for the first, do not the Oracles of your Religion oblige you to believe, that the great God created the Man whom you call <hi>Adam,</hi> and that from him came all the People that ever since were, or are in the World? And if so, are we not of as good Parentage, as ancient a Family, as noble a Descent as the best of you? Ought you not then to love us as your Brethren, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from the same common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? or at least respect us as your Kinsmen, and of the same Lineage.</p>
            <p>Are not our <hi>Bodies</hi> of as proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable a Frame, and as well furnisht with useful <hi>Limbs</hi>? Are not all our
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:29668:59"/>
               <hi>Senses</hi> as good and quick as yours? Nay, are we not naturally obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to fewer Diseases than you, though now indeed by your harsh usage our Days are often shortned, and our Health impaired; but this is not the fault of our Constitutions, but of your Severities, which bring upon us those Weaknesses and Disorders, which we were never before acquainted with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For any Exercises of Running, Leaping, Swimming, and the like, which of you can equal us? As for the <hi>blackness</hi> of our Skins, we find no reason to be ashamed of it, 'tis the <hi>Livery</hi> which our great Lord and Maker hath thought fit we should wear; Do not you amongst Furs, prize pure <hi>Sables</hi> as much as <hi>Ermins</hi>? Is <hi>Iett</hi> or <hi>Ebony</hi> despised for its Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour? Can we help it, if the Sun by too close and fervent Kisses, and the nature of the Climate and Soil where we were Born, hath tinctur'd us with a dark Complexion? Have not you variety of Complexions amongst
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:29668:59"/>
your selves; some very <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Fair,</hi> others <hi>Brown,</hi> many <hi>Swarthy,</hi> and several <hi>Cole-black</hi>? And would it be reasonable that each sort of these should quarrel with the other, and a man be made <hi>a Slave</hi> forever, meerly because his Beard is <hi>Red,</hi> or his Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows <hi>Black?</hi> In a word, if our <hi>Hue</hi> be the only difference, since <hi>White</hi> is as contrary to <hi>Black,</hi> as <hi>Black</hi> is to <hi>White,</hi> there is as much reason that <hi>you</hi> should be our <hi>Slaves,</hi> as we yours.</p>
            <p>Lastly, as to our <hi>Souls,</hi> you dare not deny but they are <hi>Immortal</hi> as well as yours, consequently capable of as much Bliss and Happiness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well as yours, created in the Image of God, and of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Original: Have we not the same Faculties, Understanding, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and Will? Are we not endued with a reflex Power, whereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn or approve our own Actions as they are either good or evil? Are we not, if we had the advantages of Education, altogether as docible, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29668:60"/>
apt to learn Arts and Sciences as any of you? witness <hi>Averves, Avicenna,</hi> and others of our Country-men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were famous <hi>Physitians, Philosophers, Astrologians,</hi> and the like. For in us as well as you, are contained the true Natures of all Elements, the Seeds of all Sciences, and an hidden Epitom of the four Worlds, <hi>Intellectual, Rational, Elemental</hi> and <hi>Sensitive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, we are not so ready at Words, nor so nimble to express our Conceptions, but we can more than guess at what is Just, and Fit, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and Seemly, and know what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the dignity of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and what not, though the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> despise us by the Name of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>; we must acknowledge that we are not so well acquainted with the wordy and notional matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor do talk so much of it, nor keep so much ado about it, as many of the <hi>Christians</hi> do, for we do not Wrangle, nor Fight, nor Backbite or Hate one another for, or touching
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:29668:60"/>
the Worship of God: Nor do we Kill, Burn or Imprison any for not agreeing with us, or being of our Intellectual Complexions, because God in his Wisdom has made all things to differ; many there are whose Eyes are open see into the truth of these things.</p>
            <p>As for our Faith, touching God and Eternity, we have not much to say, neither do we ever use many Words; For we have only one Book, <hi>viz. Our selves,</hi> in which is contained the true Nature and Property of all things, both Internally and External<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and happy is he that can read but the <hi>Christ-Cross-Row</hi> in his own Book, it is more profitable to him than a multitude of Books, cry'd up and admired by the World: And this we do know and acknowledge, that there is a good and an evil Spirit or Principle within us, one which prompts, and invites, and leads us to Good, and the other drawing us to Evil; and by the light of the good
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:29668:61"/>
Principle, we distinguish between what is Right, and the contrary; and whensoever we do Evil, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and reproved for it by this good Genius, whereby we are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that Lying, Swearing, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Idleness, Disobedience to our Masters, Burning of Houses, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the like, are Sins against God; and when at any time we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any such things, we are accused and condemned for the same in our Hearts, though our Masters, nor any Creature else know thereof.</p>
            <p>In short, the main Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Christians</hi> and us, seem to be no more than these, that they are <hi>White,</hi> and we <hi>Black,</hi> because they are born in one Climate, and we in another; they have <hi>Learning,</hi> as Reading, Writing, speaking of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Languages, and we have none of those Ornamental Advantages; but they may please to remember that the more Paint Glass has upon it, the more it keeps out the Light; They
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29668:61"/>
are educated under certain <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> and taught divers <hi>Notions of Religion,</hi> which we are not skill'd in: But the grand point of Religion, <hi>To do as we would be done by,</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand as well as they, and are sure they practise it less than we. What then do they talk so much of <hi>the Leaves,</hi> when we can see <hi>no Fruits</hi>? let us <hi>feel</hi> their <hi>Christianity,</hi> and <hi>see</hi> it, as well as <hi>hear of it,</hi> and no doubt then we shall be more in love with it.</p>
            <p>These, I say, are the chief Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; for as to the natural <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>roper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> there is but very little, setting aside Custom and Education. For as I said before, as to the Members of the Body, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Faculties, we are alike in all particulars; neither is there any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as to the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> they are as much subject to Passions, Lusts, and irregular Affections as we, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to Sicknesses, Mortality, and all other Misfortunes; And as your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet hath said, <hi>God</hi> (whose wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:29668:62"/>
Works we both equally are) <hi>is no Respecter of Persons, but every one t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:29668:62"/>
and of the heavenly Mysteries than we do, then there is the more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them; and how they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves in their Practice we cannot see; for surely they do very little or not at all live in, and under the <hi>Christian</hi> Spirit; for that leads all that are guided by it, to love even their Enemies, to take Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, and do unto all as they would be done unto, and also endues it Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers with the Virtues of <hi>Meekness, Humility, Self-denyal, Temperance</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> and to deny all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts.</p>
            <p>But instead of these dictates of thy most holy Religion, O thou great Preserver of men! they enslave and oppress thy poor unworthy Servants, and are drunk with our Blood and Sweat; We rise early, and lie down late, and labour beyond our strength, whilst our luxurious Masters stretch themselves on their soft Beds and Couches, they drink Wine in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing Bowls, and set their Brains

a-float without either <hi>Rudder</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,</hi> in an Ocean of other strong and various Drinks, even till they are Drunk, and vomit up their Shame and Filthiness, whilst we are allow'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Water, and now and then a little <hi>Cowou:</hi> They feast themselves with the fattest Lambs, and variety of rich costly Foods, and live in all Uncleanness and Gluttony: They have their Men-Servants, and their Maids, their Coaches and Horses to wait on them, whilst we groan under the over-grievous Burthens, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Labour which they impose upon us: They wantonly consume the Encrease and Product of our heavy Pains in Riot and Voluptousness, in Superfluity, and all kind of extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Vitiousness; their chief <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Philosophy</hi> being to gratifie their liqourish Palates, and insatiate Paun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and to enslave us with many intollerable Burthens; so that their Lamps are ready to be extinguished by their Superfluity and Excess of Oyl,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:29668:63"/>
whilst they make frequent and solemn <hi>Feasts,</hi> (that is, offer Sacrifices, and celebrate Festivals to their Idol <hi>Belly-God-Paunch,</hi> the Divinity which they chiefly adore) and invite our rich Masters and Dames, and there they sit Eating and Drinking, (whether they have any Appetites or no) in a formal way, perhaps two or three Hours, inticing each other to Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandize and Guzzle down great Quantities, and variety of rich Food and strong Cordial-Drinks, not only beyond the Necessities, but even the power of Nature; and yet not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content, when they have thus already exceeded all bounds of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, they yet proceed to gorge themselves with Wine, various sorts of brave noble Fruits, Tarts, Sweet-Meats, and a thousand Novelties brought from forreign Regions of themselves, more than sufficient for a sober and temperate Meal, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Injuries they thereby do both to their Bodies and Minds, nor

regarding in the mean time, the star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving condition of us their poor Slaves, that would be glad of the Crums that fall from their over-spread Tables; and yet 'tis from our sore Labour, and grievous Sweat, and pinched Bellies, that what they thus wickedly waste upon their pampered Lusts, is extracted.</p>
            <p>Alas! how few of our <hi>Christian</hi> Masters, do ever consider or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to put into practice either <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence</hi> or <hi>Sobriety,</hi> though their own Prophets and Apostles commend those Virtues as the surest Bulwarks and Fortifications against Temptations and Viciousness, and such as render the Body pleasant and healthful, fit to discharge all its Functions, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Mind to be the Temple of the Lord. But these are things too sublim for our gorbellied <hi>Christians</hi> to consider of, when a number of them gather themselves together to the Burial of a Swine, which they will Roast (or burn) it whole, and then
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29668:64"/>
bury it in their ungodly Paunches, and make them swim in their foolish Hogshead, accompanied with <hi>drunken Healths,</hi> and <hi>roaring Huzza's,</hi> where one or two of these <hi>Epicurean</hi> swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing roaring <hi>Christians</hi> will destroy in Superfluity as much as an hundred of us poor Vassals can get with our hand and sore Labour.</p>
            <p>But why, O ye <hi>Christians</hi>! do you thus violate the Commands of our Creator, and withstand, and walk contrary to the pure innocent Laws of Nature, and by your <hi>Intemperances</hi> and <hi>Oppressions</hi> contemn the great Law of Love, and doing unto all their fellow Creatures as they would be done unto: Consider these things impartially, and count us no longer <hi>Dogs,</hi> nor hide the Pearl any longer in your ungodly Earth, and be as stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and careful to look for it, and find it, as you have carelesly lost it, and you shall see and know the Errors of your wayes; and above all, know this, that every Master must give an
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:29668:65"/>
Account of his Stewardship to the grand Master of Heaven and Earth, and that there must be Retaliation made, either in this World, or the World to come.</p>
            <p>But alas! what likelihood or hopes are there of our Relief, Ease, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment from those <hi>Oppressions</hi> and <hi>Burthens</hi> under which we languish, when these we complain of are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so unnatural, that they deal as hardly and cruelly with their own Seed, even the Fruit of their own Loins, as with us? For do not our Masters, to gratifie their raging Lusts, sometimes take our Women, and make them their Concubines, <hi>viz.</hi> either our Wives, or our Daughters, which best pleaseth them, (For <hi>Adultery</hi> is accounted no greater a Crime amongst many of them than <hi>Fornication,</hi> &amp; both of them but <hi>Venial Sins, Tricks of Youth,</hi> or <hi>Modish Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries</hi>) upon whom they beget mungril Children, that are neither White nor Black, but between both,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:29668:65"/>
which therefore are called <hi>Molatto's,</hi> and when these poor Women in compliance with such their brutish Heats, have conceived by them, and brought forth, yet the Fathers, being without natural Affection, though they are their own Seed, do expose them, and make them perpetual Slaves, both they and their Posterity. Now what can be more hellish Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, or greater Baseness, then for men to afflict their own Seed, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Children in their Drunkenness and Paroxisms of Lust, and then not to care what becomes of them; nay, to make themselves Authors of their Miseries as well as of their Beeing, and instead of providing for, and well Educating them, to enslave and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over them, and leave them in that wretched condition to all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations: There cannot sure be a greater Sin against Gods pure Law in Nature; Do not the whole Hosts of the four Worlds condemn this? and will not the very Beasts of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29668:66"/>
Earth rise in Judgment against such vile hard hearted Wretches, and Nature disown and spue them out as abominable?</p>
            <p>For as the Cruelties and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of our Masters are <hi>our Plagues</hi> at present, so they will certainly draw down Judgments on <hi>themselves</hi> in time, if not prevented by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reformation; for their Violence awakens the center of dark Wrath, both in the internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Nature, and by a secret and sympathetical Power these awakened poysonous Properties do strongly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the malignant Influences of the <hi>Coelestials,</hi> and attract their <hi>Male Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations</hi>; for every particular Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in <hi>Nature</hi> has a Key in it self to open the Gate of its own Principle, whence proceed many Calamities, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree of the Sin or Evil committed, there being a certain Secret (by powerful sympathy) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Coelestial</hi> and <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Bodies, by and through whose evil Influences mutually work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:29668:66"/>
on each other, <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,</hi> and <hi>Calamities</hi> are engendred; as on the other side, by their benigne Influences sweetly clasping and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing each other in <hi>Harmony, Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty, Health</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> do proceed.</p>
            <p>For this cause it is in point of <hi>Self-Interest,</hi> a thing of dangerous Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for our <hi>Christian</hi> Masters to be so severe towards us; for the groaning of him that suffereth Pain and Torment, is the beginning of Trouble and Misery to him that is the cause thereof. And it would be well for them, and happy for us poor Vassals, if our Masters would but be so sober as to consider, and be sensible of this Truth, that their fierce <hi>Wrath, Violence,</hi> and <hi>Oppressions</hi> to us, do clearly demonstrate that the <hi>poysonous Wrath</hi> is awakened, &amp; does predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in them, so that let them call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by what <hi>name</hi> or <hi>title</hi> they please, <hi>His Servants they are whom they obey</hi>; the <hi>dark fierce Spirit</hi> has overcome the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:29668:67"/>
good Genius in their Soul, and all the pure Virtues, as <hi>Temperance, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, Fellow-feeling, Courtesie, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> are clapt under Hatches, just as we were when we were brought Captive out of <hi>Guinnea,</hi> into the Land of Bondage. And then this irritated Wrath, or poysonous Spirit, does powerfully penetrate all <hi>Elements</hi> and <hi>Bodies,</hi> and where-ever it finds matter capable or disposed to receive its malignant Rayes they incorporate: For the <hi>All, wise Creator</hi> has endued every thing in all the four Worlds with an attractive and influential Virtue; and therefore the Sons of men by their <hi>Vncleanness, Violence</hi> and <hi>Oppressions</hi> do first awaken and stir up the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spirit in themselves, which kindles the Wrath in the <hi>Coelestial Bodies,</hi> and attracts their ill Influences; and if whole Nations or Countries live in the irritated Wrath, then there are showered down Epidemical Diseases, as <hi>Pestilence, War, Famine,</hi> and the like,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29668:67"/>
all according to the nature of the Evils committed, or Properties of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that were awakned.</p>
            <p>The same is to be understood when any particular Person or Family has awakned the <hi>poysonous Wrath,</hi> it doth powerfully attract the male Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, whence Sickness, waste of Estate, and many other great Troubles &amp; Miseries, both to the Body and Mind follow; the truth of this daily Experience doth testifie; how many of our great Masters have by their <hi>Vitiousness, Vncleanness, Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Violence</hi> and <hi>Oppressions</hi> both to Man and Beast, whom they have had the Government over, fallen into great Disorders, Distempers, Losses, Crosses, Troubles and Vexations, so that their Children that were kept so fine and choice, that they would hardly suffer the Air to blow on them or their Legs to carry them whilst they lived in Prosperity, are many of them come to nothing? some forced to work hard for their Bread, others
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:29668:68"/>
have taken worse Courses, and have been immaturely cut off.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Evils both private and publick are sometimes more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, also the good Life and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of some sober People that live in a Town or Country, do interpose, and in some degree withstand or mittigate the poysonous kindled Wrath, so that the Judgment is sometimes deferred, and with-holden, as for two or three Ages, according to the degrees of the awakned Evils, and the intermingled Virtues.</p>
            <p>Therefore since we have obtained the favour to plead our own Cause, we will be bold to tell our Masters, that these things cannot be otherwise, it being the eternal Law of God in Nature, that whatever <hi>Evil, Violence</hi> or <hi>Oppression</hi> is committed, either by Superior or Inferior, if not repented of, there must be a time of Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either in this World, or that to come, according to the Nature of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29668:68"/>
Evil; for as there is such an Affinity between man and man, that they can move each other either to Love or Hate, so there is a proportionate Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude between him and the <hi>Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial Bodies</hi> and <hi>Elements,</hi> Man being not only the Image and Likeness of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> but the <hi>Horizon</hi> of both Worlds, in whom the superior and inferior Natures are conjoyned, and have their Intercourse; for he is the Off-spring of the Stars, as well as the Sun of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us praise and magnifie the Lord, Creator of this wonderful Nature, which is surpassing humane Understanding and Number; For there is no Religion or form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the World so noble and well-pleasing to him, as for mankind to imitate him by living in, and under the power of the eternal Principle of his <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> which will lead all that hearken to the Voice of <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> into all Innocency and Well-doing, and thereby as naturally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29668:69"/>
or draw down the sweet and pleasant Virtues out of all things, as the <hi>Loadstone</hi> doth Iron.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, our Masters have built their <hi>Babel,</hi> and fortified themselve; with the Poysons of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> and Fierceness of <hi>Mars,</hi> and made <hi>Gluttony</hi> their <hi>Trade,</hi> and <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> their <hi>Study,</hi> whence proceed all our Miseries and Oppressions, which at long-run recoyl back upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with Interest, destroying all their peace of Mind, health of Body, and outward Estates. For are not most of those that thus violate our <hi>Creator's</hi> Law in Nature, miserably afflicted with many cruel Diseases, as the <hi>Stone, Collick, windy Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Palsies, Cramp, Leprosies, Kings-Evils, Gout, dry Belly-Aches, Dropsies, Consumptions,</hi> and an hundred other Evils of this Nature, which they also intail on their Prosterity; so also are they plauged with Vexations and Discords between Man and Wife, and with disobedient and rebellious
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:29668:69"/>
Children; <hi>Rot</hi> and <hi>Murrain</hi> amongst their Cattel, their Crops blasted or spoiled by unseasonable Weather, Losses and Disappointments in their Trading, even to the consumption of their Estates; All which are the <hi>Iudgments of God,</hi> and just Rewards that follow <hi>Oppression<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Violence</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> and of spending the Blood and Sweat of their poor <hi>Slaves</hi> in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Wantonness; for they make nothing to squander away Talents in Courtly Vanities, and value not Money in the way of <hi>Gluttony,</hi> then it shall go by whole Sale: But if a poor Slave breaks but <hi>a Glass</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carries in any little inconsiderable thing, then presently the <hi>livid Poyson of Saturn</hi> is raised, and the flaming <hi>Thunder-bolts of Mars</hi> are let fly in the greatest Fury and Fierceness imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and the best word that comes out of their Mouth, is, <hi>Dog, Devil, damn'd Dog, Bitch,</hi> and the like hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Expressions, not to mention their horrid <hi>Oathes, Curses</hi> and <hi>Execrations,</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:29668:70"/>
which lewd Words are followed by <hi>inhumane Blows</hi>; for they fall upon us with <hi>Whip and Spur</hi> till the Blood come, and we are almost killed with their Cruelty.</p>
            <p>And though they boast, and speak excellent things of the <hi>Christian-Religion,</hi> and contemn us for being ignorant of it; yet 'tis plain they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver design that we should know and embrace it; for why else do they make it loathsom in our Eyes, by acting so contrary to its <hi>Genuine</hi> Nature and Principles? Why do they dress up that which is the <hi>greatest Beauty,</hi> and the most <hi>amiable</hi> thing in the World, in the shape of a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deformed <hi>Hag,</hi> or terrible <hi>Fury,</hi> that seems good for nothing but to <hi>Bite</hi> and <hi>Scratch,</hi> and <hi>Prog for its Paunch,</hi> and wallow in Uncleanness like a Swine? Were they in earnest, or desirous to make us <hi>Christians,</hi> and save our <hi>immortal Souls,</hi> they would remove out of our way all <hi>Stumbling-Blocks</hi> of Scandal, &amp; draw us with the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29668:70"/>
Cords of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Meekness</hi>; they would set us Examples by their blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Lives, and holy Conversations, they would be at pains and charge to teach us the Foundation Principles of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and to read the <hi>Bible,</hi> and would in those, and other Exercises of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> bring up our little <hi>Ones</hi>: But so far are they from any of this, that they act the direct contrary, and desire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep us <hi>Heathens,</hi> that we may continue their <hi>Slaves,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are Guilty not only of oppressing our Bodies, but (as much as in them lies) of <hi>damning our Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our God is more merciful, and expects a Return but proportionable to the Talent he hath intrusted; his Ways are the Paths of Love, and all his Out-goings are Compassion; he hath not left us without a guide, even a Light shining in a dark place, to the conduct whereof, if we give heed, we shall do well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:29668:71"/>Nor do we in this Complaint in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to tax all our <hi>Christian</hi> Masters, for we must acknowledge that there are some few of them more Just and Merciful unto us; for though under them we labour hard, yet we have our Food in some order, both as to Quantity and Quality, and have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Rest, which gives us Life and Vigour in our occasions; neither do they lay upon us Burthens greater than we can bear; besides, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten speak kindly to us, which chears and comforts our Hearts and Spirits; they call us no evil Names, which is well liking unto us; They allow us the usual time each day to rest in, and eat our Food; They treat our Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men more kindly, and allow them better Accomodations, when they bring forth their young Ones: And though sometimes some of this better sort, will command our young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be their <hi>Concubines,</hi> yet then in such cases, if they prove with-Child, they will have some regard to their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29668:71"/>
own Seed, and respect to the Women: And it is also observable, that all such as deal any thing gently, and with Moderation and Compassion towards us, are generally blessed with the Dew of Heaven, and with consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Profits, and their Men and Women Servants, and Cattel, do stand to Health, and thrive; for by well-doing, though it be but as it were by halfs, they attract some of the sweet Influences, both of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior and inferior Worlds, and go not without a Reward; which might teach all our Masters to imitate that course, and use Pity, Good-will and Equity in their dealings with us, whereby they would not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a good Conscience void of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which is the greatest and most durable Riches on this side the Grave, but also might increase their outward Wealth, by saving them in their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses one, two, three or four Hundred Pounds <hi>per</hi> Year, in the buying of Slaves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:29668:72"/>For the Tyranny, ill Usage and Improvidence of the generality may further appear by the great Numbers of our Country-men and Women that are brought every Year to <hi>America,</hi> and the Isles thereabouts, which shews the vast Consumption or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction that is made of us in those parts; we shall only give one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; in the small Island of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes</hi> there are supposed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly resident, <hi>forty</hi> or <hi>fifty</hi> Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of our Country-People, that are <hi>Slaves</hi>; and though we have our Custom of <hi>Plurality of Wives,</hi> and are naturally as fruitful as most Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet <hi>our Off-spring</hi> will not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Number, but they are forced yearly to bring in by Shipping, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Thousands</hi> more of our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as <hi>fresh Supplies,</hi> and to maintain the <hi>old Stock</hi> or Number; so that it looks like the <hi>Fields of Mars,</hi> where often <hi>Recruits</hi> are required to supply the place of the <hi>slaughtered Soldiers.</hi> Now would not any rational man
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29668:72"/>
conclude, that if <hi>One Thousand</hi> Men and <hi>One Thousand</hi> Women, (most of them young, and capable of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) lived in a seperated place or Isle, where they want for no Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, for a matter of ten or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years, who, (I say) could but in reason expect these two Thousand to be multiplyed at least to four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, or more, and that they would encrease so fast as to grow rather Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and Super-numerary, than that there should be any occasion to purchase more at dear Rates, from remote Regions: For thus it usually happens in other parts of the World, as <hi>England,</hi> (which is the Country of many of our <hi>Christian</hi> Masters) does not it spare every Year great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Men, which of late Years have settled several <hi>Colonies,</hi> and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled divers Countries and Islands in <hi>America,</hi> which are like to become very numerous, and yet still their own Country rather over-stockt, than wanting of men to carry on their
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29668:73"/>
Affairs; besides, there come thence great Numbers of Young men, as <hi>Factors, Sea-men, Soldiers,</hi> and others that daily are transported by Troops, many of whom never return again: And how many Thousands of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might <hi>England</hi> spare yearly? of whom many that are fit and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Generation, are never mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and others, through want of good Husbands in time, or to please their Parents humours, or for base Lucre, marry Old, and have no Issue, and yet still <hi>England</hi> wants no People, but (as we have heard) is able to spare two or three Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand on a good occasion; And why might not we in <hi>America</hi> encrease and multiply proportionably, were it not for those violent Oppressions, and harsh Usages, which our Masters afflict us with, whereby we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed before our time? And is it not a strange, &amp; an unheard of thing, that a fourth or fifth part every Year should dye, and be made away with,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29668:73"/>
more than there are born? Or can there be a more undeniable Evidence of the <hi>Cruelty</hi> exercised upon us, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioning this extraordinary <hi>Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and the <hi>immature Deaths</hi> of such great Numbers of us yearly?

4<hi>thly</hi>; To avoid <hi>evil Communication,</hi> because it corrupts good Manners, and vain Words, but especially wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ones. 5<hi>thly</hi>; To observe the <hi>Rules of Purity,</hi> and abstain from all <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of <hi>Evil,</hi> both in Words and Works. 6<hi>thly;</hi> To free our selves from <hi>Envy, Strife, Malice, Back-biting</hi> and <hi>Slander</hi>; not to accuse men behind their Backs of what they will not speak to their Faces, or cannot prove. 7<hi>thly</hi>; Not to judge of things we <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not,</hi> lest we be judged; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn those things of which we have no certain Knowledge or Experience. 8<hi>thly</hi>; To be sensible that the Lord by his <hi>all-seeing-Eye</hi> and <hi>divine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> beholds all our Wayes, and that to him there is nothing hidden. 9<hi>thly</hi>; To believe and know for a certain truth, that the Lord will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliate and Reward every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Works. 10.

be in good earnest, and tell me the truth.</p>

               <p>I do assure thee, they are the Principles of our Lord, Christ, the Son of the living God, that he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the World when he was on the Earth, and which his Apostles recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and left them on Record in the <hi>Bible</hi>; and which he still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to Preach by his Spirit in the Hearts of all that are his.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>What are they, prethee?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Negr.</speaker>
               <p>First, I admire the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of your Doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>wonderful Mystery</hi> contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; it undoubtedly surpasseth all other Religions in the World, as much as the Sun's Light doth that of a <hi>Glow-Worm</hi>: It seems to me to be an <hi>open Gate</hi> into <hi>Paradise,</hi> and a <hi>Leaf</hi> of the <hi>Tree of Life</hi>; so agreeable to the Nature and Glory of the <hi>great God,</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:29668:81"/>
so suitable to the condition of <hi>weak Man</hi>; no wise Person can make any scruple of the things you have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, they command assent; for they proced from a <hi>true Root.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then I cannot but also much wonder and admire that you <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> live and walk so wide from, and <hi>contrary</hi> unto all those undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Truths, and holy Rules, so that what you preach with your <hi>Tongues,</hi> you pull down with your <hi>Hands,</hi> and your daily Conversation gives the Lye to your Profession.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mast.</speaker>
               <p>You now grow <hi>Sawcy</hi> thus to upbraid us; we have indeed <hi>our Failings,</hi> but I hope we do not walk so <hi>Retrograde</hi> as you talk of: What Instances can you produce to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain so general a Charge?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Negr.</speaker>
               <p>I intended not to <hi>upbraid</hi> you, but to satisfie my self, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may have <hi>some Reason</hi> that I do not know of, why you <hi>act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to what you teach; nor do I say that all, and <hi>every Christian</hi> does so,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:29668:81"/>
there may be Hundreds and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands that <hi>I</hi> am not acquainted with, and there are some that I know, of whom I cannot say, but that in a very great measure they live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that righteous Doctrine; but for the generality or major part, I must say, That in all, and every of the aforesaid Points by you mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the whole Tenour of their Ways, and the continual Practice of their Lives, is directly contrary to the same: And since you command me to instance Particulars, I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it in some of the chief.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You say, that Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion teacheth <hi>to Fear the Lord,</hi> that created Heaven and Earth: The truth of this we make no doubt of; but how can we believe, that <hi>very many</hi> who go under the Name of <hi>Christians</hi> do obey this Voice of Wisdom, since they so lightly and vainly use the <hi>Name of God</hi> in their Triffling, and wicked Talk, and boldly Swear by it (and that for the most part <hi>falsly</hi> too)
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:29668:82"/>
in their ordinary Conversation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his express Commands; nay, not a few, will commonly challenge the great God to <hi>Damn</hi> or <hi>Confound</hi> them, with divers other Blasphemies; And do you call this <hi>Fearing the Lord</hi>?</p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>be Merciful,</hi> and <hi>do as you would be done by,</hi> you in the next place assign, as a grand and important point of <hi>Christianity</hi>; but where shall we find it? We cannot perceive any thing of <hi>Mercy</hi> to dwell in your Hearts; for you commit <hi>Oppression</hi> with Violence; and that which you call <hi>Trade</hi> or <hi>Traffick</hi> (as 'tis manag'd amongst you) is little better than an Art of <hi>Circumventing</hi> one another; and you practise all sorts of <hi>Cruelty,</hi> not only on the inferior Creatures, but also on those of your <hi>own Kind,</hi> else what makes us your <hi>Slaves,</hi> and to be thus Lorded and Tyrannized over by you? In a word, not only <hi>We,</hi> but the whole Creation groans under your heavy Burthens; &amp; yet you tell us of your <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>good Nature,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:29668:82"/>
and boast of your Christian <hi>Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. You acknowledge, this divine Religion requires of you to be <hi>Sober</hi> in Meats and Drinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not to indulge Nature with things Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous: But does it not appear by your Conversation, that you never regard its Counsel, since your Wayes are directly opposite? Do not we see it a common Practice amongst the <hi>Christians,</hi> to drink to <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> and eat to <hi>Superfluity</hi> and <hi>Gluttony?</hi> &amp; even of those that seem most reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, scarce any, that have wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but will <hi>indulge themselves</hi> great variety of rich compounded Foods, and Cordial-Drinks, that contain too great Nourishment, beyond not only the <hi>Necessities,</hi> but even the <hi>Power</hi> of Nature, and the <hi>digestive Faculty</hi> of the Stomach, which produces many evil Effects; for besides the waste of the good Creatures, and a most <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful</hi> abuse of the Creator's Mercies, it heats the <hi>Blood,</hi> makes it thick, hot and sharp, and causeth all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:29668:83"/>
to glow with an unnatural Heat, makes both the Body and Mind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie, and disables each of them from performing its Offices as it ought, and also sets open the <hi>Gates of Venus</hi> to many lewd Practices: And thus in defiance to the Laws of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to his own Personal hurt, one great <hi>over-grown Christian</hi> shall spend as much in <hi>one Day,</hi> to gratifie his Lusts or Vanity, as an <hi>Hundred or Two</hi> of his poor <hi>Slaves</hi> can get by their sore Labour and Sweat. And as for <hi>Exercises,</hi> there is rarely here in this Island any of the <hi>Christians</hi> that will labour, except pure Necessity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain them to it, but you <hi>lay heavy Burthens</hi> on us, and as your most illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Prophet, saith, <hi>will not touch them your selves with one Finger.</hi> So that you make it a <hi>Genteel</hi> Quality, and honourable, to break and violate that great Command of the Creator in the beginning, which I have heard is recorded by a most famous Prophet of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and whom you also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:29668:83"/>

You say that the next great point of <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine, is to free your selves from <hi>Envy, Strife, Malice, Back-biting</hi> and <hi>Slander</hi>; which is also contradicted by your general practice; for what is more frequent amongst you than <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi>? And though in your Prayers you formally use those Words, <hi>Lord forgive us our Trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us,</hi> yet at the same time Envy lies lurking in your Hearts, and the very next moment shall erect it self; for do not many of you keep your Neighbours and Brethren in loathsom Prisons for some very little offence, or in truth for none at all, but only to shew your Power, and gratifie
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:29668:86"/>
your devilish Fury: And as for the Gentleman called <hi>Strife,</hi> he rides the Fore-horse, and is Quarter-master-General amongst you; what Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Swearing, Damning, Railing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is there in every House between Fathers and Children, Brothers and Sisters, Relations and Neighbours, ready to destroy and murder one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all about <hi>Things,</hi> not worth a wise mans Thoughts?

               <p>And for <hi>Backbiting</hi> and <hi>Slandering,</hi> even Eating and Drinking, is scarce more universally practised amongst you; almost every man speaks <hi>Evil</hi> or slighting of those that are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,

though to their Faces he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements and Flatters them.

Persons, though they understand them no more then a blind man can distinguish Colours, or the Deaf judge of Musick; but right or wrong without any true sight or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, they will pass their Verdict, and shoot their Bolts, for they count their Tongues their own, and think they may say what they list, and so call <hi>Evil</hi> good, and <hi>Good</hi> evil, and abuse their own Consciences, and their Neighbours, so greatly are many of the <hi>Christians</hi> depraved.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The eighth Point you menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, was, <hi>That the Lord beholds all mens Wayes and Doings, and that unto him, and his Divine Eye there is not any thing hid</hi>: Which without all doubt, is a most certain truth, which neither <hi>Christian</hi> nor <hi>Heathen</hi> dare to deny; for as your own Prophet saith, <hi>It is he that searcheth the Heart, and tryeth the Reigns.</hi> But how can we perswade our selves, that you do in truth and in earnest believe this, since we daily find that you stand more in

awe of <hi>Mens seeing,</hi> or <hi>knowing</hi> your Wickedness, than of <hi>God's beholding,</hi> and revenging of it; and therefore you love to <hi>seem,</hi> and be counted <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,</hi> and <hi>Iust,</hi> and <hi>Merciful,</hi> but scarce a Soul of you seriously endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to <hi>be so</hi>; 'tis the <hi>Name</hi> and the <hi>Credit</hi> you look after, not the <hi>Thing,</hi> which shews that you seek to please, and be well spoken of by Men, but regard not the righteous Judgment of God, who looks through the <hi>Fig-Leaves,</hi> and requires Truth and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the inward parts: This Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie of yours is notorious, and every one almost taxes his Neighbour for it, and yet all generally practise it, and each huggs himself therein, as one of your own <hi>Poets</hi> complaineth;

On the contrary, to <hi>believe</hi> and know (as you say) <hi>That the Lord will Retaliate every man according to his Work,</hi> is a most true and necessary Principle; but if <hi>Christians</hi> did so, surely they could not, nor would do as they do; For what kind of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Returns</hi> do or can you expect for all your Oppressions to us your poor Vassals? For do not you oppress us at your pleasure, <hi>beat, whip, over-labour,</hi> and <hi>half-starve</hi> us, and many of you scruple not <hi>to Kill us</hi> for a small Offence, and possibly for none at all, but in your Drunkenness to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate your fierce devilish Passions?

must pay <hi>so dear</hi> for, either in this World, or that which is to come, if you were sufficiently sensible of the Compensation that must be made for the same.</p>

'Tis a noble Truth, that men should walk according to the <hi>divine Principle,</hi> and <hi>forsake all Vngodliness</hi> and <hi>worldly Lusts</hi>: But the generality of <hi>Christians</hi> take contrary measures for the Gospel of Truth, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly nor outwardly doth teach any to <hi>compel others</hi> by outward Force to believe, and do as they do, be it right or wrong; but advises all to do as they would be done by; and to let their <hi>Moderation be known unto all men</hi>; and to <hi>bear with one another in Love:</hi> Whereas you impose upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>tye up</hi> other men to your own Conceptions, and without any Compassion or Charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fall upon such as will not go your way, and do as you do, though you have nothing to object against their Lives and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations.

the Doctrine of <hi>Christianity,</hi> where-ever it is entertained in the Love thereof, will bruise the Head of the <hi>Serpentine Nature,</hi> that is, of Lust and Uncleanness, and all Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, yet we see you daily wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all those <hi>Pollutions</hi>; so that you do not only contradict this <hi>holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> which you boast so much of, but some of you do also severely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute others for <hi>obeying</hi> the same and submitting to its guidance; And as for <hi>brutish Vncleanness, Adulteries, Whoredoms,</hi> &amp;c. they are but your <hi>Sports</hi> and <hi>Pastimes,</hi> things that many of you <hi>glory in</hi>; and to be <hi>Chaste</hi> and <hi>Modest,</hi> is to be an object of your Scorn and Derision.</p>

And do not many endeavour to spread their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by <hi>Violence, Fighting</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> and by Cruelty, to force all to be of their Complexion in Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing? Which self-conceited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings are a true <hi>token</hi> and <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,</hi> that they love to contradict the whole course of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi>; for he hath made all things <hi>to differ,</hi> and by that difference the Universe is sustained; and from those <hi>various Notes</hi> proceed the sweetest Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? Is it not for want of this Spirit of Humility, that you <hi>wrangle, fight,

contend, punish</hi> and <hi>imprison</hi> each other, for not thinking as others do, or because they have not all one <hi>coloured Hair</hi>? For alas! men's Minds and Understandings are as different and various, as their Complexions or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages; wherefore then are you angry with your Creator, because he hath not made you all alike? If you were not blind and ignorant, and yet very presumptuous and Self-admirers, this could never be amongst People that believe all in <hi>one Prophet,</hi> and <hi>one God</hi>: I perceive therefore it is not about <hi>true Virtue</hi> that you make all this ado in the World; 'tis for your own Conceits, your own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, your own <hi>Dreams,</hi> that you thus contend and disquiet your Neighbours.</p>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:29668:92"/>
good Words, long Prayers, and fair Speeches, that will break or untye the wrathful Net, which men all their Lives have been tying; but look what Principle has carried the upper Dominion in the Heart, to that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom you belong.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>inferior Creatures,</hi> they groan under your Cruelties, you <hi>hunt</hi> them for your <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work</hi> them for your <hi>Covetousness,</hi> and <hi>kill</hi> them for your <hi>Gluttony,</hi> and set them to fight one with another till they dye, and count it a <hi>Sport</hi> and a <hi>Pleasure</hi> to behold them <hi>worry</hi> one another; whereas the same should be matter of <hi>Grief</hi> to you, to see the Gate of Wrath thus opened amongst the Creatures, and that you your selves have been the <hi>original Cause</hi> thereof, by violating the Law of your Maker.</p>
               <p>Thus, Master <hi>Christian!</hi> have I briefly shewed, that in all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars by you mentioned, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of you <hi>Christians</hi> do act the clean contrary; what then do you

boast of, and wherein are you better than we? Only that you pretend to understand more, and <hi>do</hi> less, and so deserve the greater Condemnation.

Hearts? Is <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> a Virtue? Or will <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Dissembling</hi> bring a man to <hi>Heaven</hi>? Christianity (by that very Description you have given of it) is such a blieving in Christ, to bring us unto God and everlasting Glory, as maketh the <hi>Love of God</hi> become the very Nature of the Soul, and thankful <hi>Obedience</hi> its Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and an <hi>heavenly Mind,</hi> and an <hi>humble, pure, harmless</hi> and <hi>holy Life,</hi> to be its <hi>Constitution,</hi> and <hi>constant Trade</hi>; and the Interests of fleshly Lusts, and the Pomps and Vanities, the Riches and Honours of the World to be truly esteemed but as <hi>dross</hi> and <hi>dung</hi>; Now tell us in good earnest, is <hi>this</hi> the Life which you <hi>live,</hi> or which you <hi>hate</hi>?

Why will you glory in the part of a <hi>Parrot,</hi> or an <hi>Ape,</hi> to say over a few Words, or move your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies into such Forms and Ceremonies, whilst you detest the humane and

divine part, to <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> to God?

What is there in the World that you are so averse to, as to <hi>be seriously</hi> that which you profess to be? That is, to walk uprightly and sincerely in all those fourteen Particulars by you enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

Call us <hi>Heathens</hi> as long as you will, I am confident <hi>Christ</hi> hath not more bitter Enemies in the World, than some of you that wear his <hi>Livery</hi>; We <hi>Blacks</hi> are more gentle to you, than you <hi>Christians</hi> are to one another; and I have been assured, that all the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> in the World have shed <hi>less</hi> Christian Blood, than what <hi>Hypocrite
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29668:94"/>
Christians</hi> themselves have greedily let out, or occasioned to be destroyed: Thus you honour <hi>dead Saints,</hi> and abhor the <hi>Living,</hi> and would gladly make more <hi>Martyrs,</hi> whilst you keep <hi>Days</hi> in Commemoration of those that <hi>others</hi> made. Can any thing be more preposterously absurd, more foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, than these <hi>interferring</hi> Contradictions? Were it not better to <hi>be</hi> what you call your selves, or to <hi>call</hi> your selves what you are? If you <hi>approve</hi> of these Christian Doctrines, why do not you square your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations accordingly? If you think them <hi>needless Notions,</hi> why do not you disown them? Or why do you so much cry up and magnifie them? Be either <hi>Christians</hi> indeed, or cease to upbraid us for being <hi>Heathens</hi>; for such <hi>shuffling Hypocrisie</hi> is more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to God and Man, than the most ignorant <hi>Paganism.</hi>

               <p>We boast not of <hi>Wisdom</hi>; what I have said, arises from plain <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> which no Person whom our Creator hath endued with a rational Soul, can be ignorant of, if he do not wilfully quench and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish in himself that Light which enlightneth every man that cometh into the World, and which one of your own Prophets calls, <hi>The Candle of the Lord.</hi> Nor are we altogether such ignorant <hi>dark Heathens</hi>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:29668:95"/>
the Faculties of our Minds, our <hi>Senses</hi> and all the Furniture of Nature, are equal, and the same in us as in you: We are not <hi>Beasts,</hi> as you count, and use us, but <hi>rational Souls,</hi> and in us is contained the true Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of all Elements, and created things; Nor do we contemn or flight the <hi>Light of the Gospel</hi>; as you call it, but we wonder at you that so much <hi>talk</hi> of it, and so <hi>little practise</hi> the good Rules of Life contained therein. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, since you are pleased to grant us the Liberty to plead our own Cause, we might tell you, that we have the <hi>same Gospel</hi> that you so much talk of, written in our Hearts, and doing by Nature the things that are written in the Law, being without the Law, are a Law unto our selves, as one of your illuminated Prophets speaks: And if we do the things that are right in the sight of God, and walk in his innocencent Law in Nature, according to <hi>our measure</hi> and <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> we have so far discharged
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:29668:96"/>
our Duty, and we doubt not but the goodness of our Creator will accept thereof, and pardon our <hi>involuntary Misprisions,</hi> and <hi>Failings</hi>; and if you have a <hi>larger</hi> Manifestation of the eternal Light and Love of God, which we have no reason to doubt, then the more is required of you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the greater and more sore will your Condemnation be.</p>

you not altogether unlearned, and can neither <hi>spue Latine,</hi> nor <hi>sputter Greek,</hi> nor understand the <hi>Hebrew Rabbins,</hi> and the <hi>Talmud</hi>; your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses are not trim'd with Flowers of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> nor can you <hi>chop Logick,</hi> nor make <hi>Syllogisms,</hi> and run down both Truth and Sense with <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> and the <hi>Magick</hi> of a concluding <hi>Ergo</hi>: What Divines or Clergy-men, what cunning <hi>Lawyers</hi> have you to boast of?

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:29668:97"/>
your <hi>Shame</hi>? As for our <hi>Complexion,</hi> 'tis the Livery of our Creator, the property of the Climate and Soil, wherein his good Providence dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of us to be born and bred; we made not our selves <hi>Black,</hi> nor do you make your selves <hi>White</hi>; wherein then have you any thing to brag of above us? If for this cause you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise us; you at the same time despise that <hi>adorable Power,</hi> which is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker both of us and you: And thought <hi>White</hi> be an Emblem of <hi>Innocence,</hi> yet there are <hi>whited Walls</hi> filled within with Filth and Rottenness; what is only <hi>outward,</hi> will stand you in no stead, it is the <hi>inward Candor</hi> that our Creator is well-pleased with, and not the outward; have a care therefore that you be not found as <hi>black within,</hi> as we are externally.</p>
               <p>You upbraid us with eating <hi>unclean Foods,</hi> Carrion, Vermine, <hi>&amp;c..</hi> But I pray, is it not your <hi>Cruelty,</hi> in not affording us what is sufficient to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Nature otherwise; that makes
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:29668:98"/>
us do it? This is first to make us <hi>Cripples,</hi> and then beat us with our <hi>Crutches</hi> for being Lame. As for our poor Coverings, or going Naked, as long as Man remained in the innocent State, he wanted no Garments; and you are forced to <hi>Rob</hi> several sorts of Creatures to cover your <hi>Shame</hi>; nor do you bring into the World any greater <hi>Ward robe</hi> with you, than we do; nor have you occasion to carry out any more. But how depraved and dishonourable does it look, for that <hi>noble Creature,</hi> [Man] not only to be glad to borrow of his inferior Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to hide his Shame, but also to grow <hi>Proud</hi> of those Ornaments, which are but the <hi>Spoils,</hi> or the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> and many times the <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of Beasts and Flies, or Insects, and the like lower Graduates?</p>
               <p>As for Order in <hi>Marriages,</hi> we have as much as you; for though Plurality of <hi>Wives</hi> is contrary to your Custom, it is not to <hi>ours</hi>; and he is no wise man that admires or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:29668:98"/>
the various Customs of different Regions, any further than they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict Nature: Now this Custom of <hi>ours,</hi> as it is be friended with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples amongst the antient <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and the Laws of many Nations so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for Civility, as to esteem all others <hi>Barbarians,</hi> so it seems some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to agree with the Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and to prevent Out-rages against Nature, it being not fit, nor <hi>natural</hi> for Men to meddle with their Wives when they are <hi>Breeding,</hi> or great with-child: However, these any things are more of <hi>Custom,</hi> than any thing else, and we our selves esteem that man most <hi>happy</hi> that contents himself with <hi>one Wife</hi>: But you, although your Customs and Laws forbid <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy,</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> yet whilst you comply somewhat in the former, do make nothing, many of you, to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the <hi>latter,</hi> as often as you can meet with an opportunity.</p>

Reason to believe you, from your cruel Usages, and not allowing us what is necessary for Food and Rest, which yet is to be wondred at, since if we are not worthy (forsooth!) to be your <hi>Brethren,</hi> we are however your <hi>Money.</hi> So that — this Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty towards us, doth savour more of <hi>Envy,</hi> than of <hi>Christianity</hi> or <hi>Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> It is also true, that we have no <hi>Lip-learned Doctors,</hi> nor are confined to the old musty Rules of <hi>Aristole</hi> or <hi>Galen,</hi> nor acquainted with the new Fancies of your modern <hi>Fire-working Chymists,</hi> or <hi>Vertuosi,</hi> nor will we compare our selves to you in those things; but we have so much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as not to content our selves to <hi>see with other mens Eyes,</hi> and <hi>put out our own,</hi> as many of your learned <hi>Rabbies</hi> do; nor want we amongst us those that God and Nature have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Gifts of knowing the <hi>Vertues of Herbs,</hi> and that can by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Skill, administer <hi>good Medicines,</hi> and perform greater Cures, than your

famous Doctors with their <hi>hard Words</hi> and <hi>affected Methods.</hi> Neither will the Art of <hi>Chymistry</hi> advantage us; for since God hath hid all sorts of <hi>Meettals</hi> in the deep Bowels of the Earth, and on the contrary adorned its <hi>Surface</hi> with so many noble and salutiferous <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> we conceive he intended the <hi>latter,</hi> not the <hi>former,</hi> both for the <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Physick</hi> of man; And also we observe, the most who have hazarded their Healths and Lives, to get them out of these <hi>Subterranean Caverns,</hi> have done much hurt by the use of them in the World Yet in our own Country we have in divers parts the best Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals near at hand, viz. <hi>Gold,</hi> which too many of the <hi>Christians</hi> make their <hi>God.</hi> Our Women, 'tis true, have no other Ornament than what is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, which is more than abundance of yours have, for they want the great Ornament of that Sex, <hi>Modesty</hi>; for though ours go <hi>naked,</hi> yet they are not so <hi>impudent</hi> as your Misses, who

make a <hi>Trade</hi> of Lasciviousness and Filthiness.</p>
               <p>We drink not Wine in Bowls, nor without; and it would be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more becoming <hi>Christianity,</hi> if you <hi>did not</hi> too; for doth it not heat our Blood, irritate the central Heat, set the whole Body into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Flame, &amp; precipitate the Mind into Fury and Madness, and excite the Senses to Uncleanness and Beastiality? For pray, good Master! tell me, how many Villanies of all sorts do some nominal <hi>Christians</hi> commit against God, and his pure Law in Nature, by reason of their Excesses in that kind? And what grievous <hi>Diseases</hi> do such Debauches occasion both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and for the future? Nay, to the further shame of <hi>Christians,</hi> have you not by lewd Examples <hi>defiled</hi> and <hi>debauched</hi> us <hi>Ethiopeans,</hi> and the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> amongst whom you converse? So that instead of learning us Virture, and courting us to your Faith and Religion by <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Godliness,</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:29668:101"/>
you set before us <hi>destructive Presidents,</hi> and make us more the Children of the Devil than we were before; which has forced many of your Religion to make strict Laws, that no <hi>Christians</hi> shall suffer <hi>Indians</hi> to <hi>drink</hi> strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicating Liquors, or sell the same unto them; so that we must needs say in that respect, you have been <hi>kinder to us,</hi> than to your selves; for seeing the great Inconveniences and Hurt the drinking thereof does do us, you endeavour to prevent the same, and yet you continue and encrease the evil Practice thereof your selves, and so long as the <hi>Christians</hi> thus trade in Debauchery and Superfluity; there is no likelihood or hopes that they should draw any considerable Number of us, or the neighbouring <hi>Indians</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their Religion, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it is the most excellent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that ever was communciated to the World: But the vicious Lives of its Professors, their saying, and not <hi>doing,</hi> cuts off in the Bud, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:29668:102"/>
destroys the growth and encrease of those sublim Truths, and makes the World despise both the <hi>Christians</hi> and their Doctrine; for it is not your good Words, and long Prayers, (and indeed some are short enough) that are pleasing to our Creator, or edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us; It must be your <hi>good Works</hi> that shall convince any of the Truth, and beget Love and Amity in all men.</p>
               <p>But instead thereof, you spend your time in <hi>Riot, Excess, Vanity,</hi> or <hi>wicked Plays,</hi> whereof evil <hi>Daemons</hi> were the Inventers, whilst we <hi>sigh</hi> and <hi>groan</hi> under your heavy Burthens. But our Cries are slighted by you, and your <hi>Ladies</hi> too, who many of them will <hi>Swagger,</hi> and <hi>Curse,</hi> and <hi>Rant,</hi> and equally oppress, and as much abuse us as your selves, which Fierceness and Cruelty looks more <hi>monstrous</hi> in them, though bad in both Sexes, and where-ever practised, must of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth be retaliated.

with various <hi>Pretences.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you accuse us of <hi>evil Carriage,</hi> and that the same hath been the Original of all our Griefs and sore Oppressions, there is a certain Truth therein, tho' not as you intend it, for if we and our Fore-fathers <hi>had not violated</hi> the innocent Law of Nature by Violence and Transgression, we had never fallen under <hi>your Yoke,</hi> nor been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away Captives out of our own Native Country; but now we have by the divine Justice been retaliated, for ours, and our Princes Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; However, though we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this is but just from God, yet that doth not concern you, nor can you from thence justifie your Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, which could not be occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the Miscarriages you speak of, because they had long been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised upon us, <hi>before</hi> any of us made any of those ill Attempts you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; 'twas your Cruelties put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those extravagant courses: And since Oppression (according to the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:29668:104"/>
Doctrine of your most holy wise Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>makes Wise Men mad,</hi> 'twas no wonder if some of our silly Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were thereby so far transported, as to seek by unjustifiable means, to gain their Liberty, or a Melioration of their wretched condition.</p>
               <p>Besides, if we had indeed offended you, yet you ought not to retaliate <hi>Evil for Evil,</hi> since on the contrary your Christian Doctrine enjoyns you to return <hi>Good for Evil,</hi> &amp; to <hi>love even your Enemies</hi>; how dare you then in the Light of this holy and everlasting Gospel, to talk and act after this manner? Do you indeed dream that your Cruelty, and ruling us with a <hi>martial Rod,</hi> and <hi>barbarous Fierceness,</hi> will make us <hi>Tractable</hi> and <hi>Friendly,</hi> or to love our Masters, and do our Labours with willingness? Alas! we imagined you to be greater <hi>Seers</hi> into the Mysteries of God, and his Law in Nature, than to entertain such vain and impossible Conceits; For how contrary is this not only to your
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:29668:104"/>
Christian Principles, but also to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the common Sense and Experience of all mankind? <hi>With the Froward thou shalt learn Frowardness,</hi> saith your own Prophet. And again, <hi>Did ever the Wrath of Man accomplish the Righteousness of God</hi>? Or <hi>Tyranny</hi> beget <hi>Love</hi>? If those who have the government of <hi>generous Horses,</hi> or go about to tame <hi>wild Beasts,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by <hi>gentle Vsage</hi> to make them tractable, and fit for Service, rather then by Cruelty and Beating; much more those who have the command of <hi>Men</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should bring them to Order and Discipline by the mildest and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est means, and all the Arts of Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Perswasion; not treating them worse than <hi>Gardiners</hi> do those <hi>wild Plants,</hi> which by careful looking to, and good Usage, lose the <hi>Savage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of their Nature, and in a little time come to bear excellent <hi>Fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In vain therefore you go about to excuse your Tyranny and Oppression towards us, by making the World

believe, that you are as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, or forced to be cruel to us; Though yet the same be true in one Sense, <hi>viz.</hi> you are irritated there- unto from you own innate awakened <hi>Wrath,</hi> which does predominate in your Hearts and Souls, and then those fierce Arrows of <hi>Mars,</hi> and Poysons of <hi>Saturn,</hi> which you let fly at us, do by simily stir up the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Venoms, and wrathful Qualities <hi>in us</hi>: And this, and this only, is it that hath occasioned some of the <hi>worser sort</hi> of our Country-men to Curse you and your Posterity, and to endeavour to kill and destroy you, which is a <hi>crying Sin,</hi> which we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther justifie, nor can execute, since 'tis condemned by God, and his Law in Nature; And all that have attempted such savage Mischiefs, ought not to go unpunisht, neither will they; for the just Law of Retaliation will take hold them; but will you therefore punish the Innocent for, or with the <hi>Guilty</hi>? because some called <hi>Christians</hi>

commit <hi>Murders</hi> and <hi>Treasons,</hi> must all of that Profession be cut off by the <hi>Ax,</hi> or the <hi>Gibbet</hi>? If you will deal ingenuously, your own Hearts will tell you, that the occasion of these Evils committed, or endeavoured to have been committed, arise from your <hi>Sins,</hi> and the great <hi>Abuses</hi> wherewith you have from time to time afflicted us, <hi>viz.</hi> your Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering us at your pleasure, and no Account or just Compensation ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for the same. Therefore does our innocent Blood call for Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on you, and (without serious Repentance and Amendment) must be reckoned for. Consider well these things, and then tell us; Do you think, or can you in Reason, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that the great Tyranny, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, and cruel Usages you have practised upon us, will in due time be brought back upon you and your Land or Posterity, if you do not atone for these Evils, and give us Ease and Refreshment? And though
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:29668:106"/>
we are never so submissive, can not the kindled Wrath raise up other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to destroy you and yours in a Moment? Therefore be intreated to bethink your selves in time, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the Cup of Wrath is almost full.</p>

               <p>I have considered what you alledge, touching the severe Usage, which we have and do daily offer to your Country-men; &amp; I must confess, I cannot well seehow the same can be reconciled to the Doctrine of our holy and harmly Christian Religion: But alas! What would you have us do? If we should <hi>leave off</hi> these Practices, how should we <hi>live at the Rate</hi> we do? fill our Tables daily with variety of costly Dishes, and swill our selves and numerous Visitants with <hi>rich Wines,</hi> and other strong Liquors: How should we maintain our Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and our Pomp, and raise great <hi>Estates</hi> for our selves and Children, and leave our Posterity great, and rich, and honourable in the World?
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:29668:106"/>
We consider nor your Labour, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness, Disorders, Sickness, Hunger, Drought, want of due Rest, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Food, nor any the like Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships that you suffer: If we can but live in State and Abundance, and make vast Quantities of <hi>Sugar,</hi> or other Commodities yearly, which is our chief delight, and the highest good we desire; and he that does thus do, how hard soever he uses his Slaves, is counted a <hi>brave Husband,</hi> and a <hi>good Christian</hi> too, a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table man, fit for others to make Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples by, and imitate his prudent Conduct.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:29668:107"/>
Temporal Happiness to you or them, by over-charging us with labour; For does not Reason and Experience let you know, that Houses built with <hi>mouldering Stone</hi> and <hi>rotten Timber,</hi> will not long continue; and that Estates heap'd together by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, carry along with them <hi>a Curse</hi> and are blasted from the <hi>Radix,</hi> so that at most they seldom descend to the <hi>third Heir,</hi> and rarely out-live the first or second Generation?

Are they not all long since crusht to pieces by one another, because their Foundations were laid in Violence and Spoil, Injustice and Oppressions? The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who baptized the <hi>New World</hi> in <hi>Blood,</hi> murdered many <hi>Hundred Thousand Indians,</hi> on pretence of propagating the Christian Religion, when in truth
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:29668:108"/>
it was only to get <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Empire</hi>; Have they not met with Retaliation? Have they not decreased in Power <hi>ever since</hi> those Cruelties, and instead of grasping an <hi>universal Monarchy,</hi> (which their Ambition promised themselves) are now scarce able to defend their own antient Patrimony, or keep off an Enemy from the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Castile</hi>? If all these <hi>mighty Men of War</hi> have <hi>Shipwrackt</hi> by <hi>steer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Course,</hi> how hope you with your petty <hi>Pinnaces,</hi> and tottering <hi>Skiffs,</hi> to avoid the like Tempests?

               <p>On the other side, I pray observe, there are many <hi>honest, compassionate,</hi> and truly <hi>Christian</hi>-spirited Men amongst you, that do not willingly oppress either Man or Beast, and yet
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:29668:108"/>
you see how they are blest, and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and enjoy more true Content and Happiness in one Week, than you whose Minds are continually distracted with greedy Desires, or anxious Fears, do in all your Lives; Nor are any of your Estates so firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly establisht, as those whose Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors use Mercy and Gentleness in all their Doings; for Vertue and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing will as naturally attract the Influences, and favour both of God and Man, and of the <hi>Coelestials,</hi> as well as inferior Creatures, as a <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi> does <hi>Iron</hi>: And whosoever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours sincerely to live according to the innocent Law of God in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, shall be filled with good things, but those that study to grow rich by Wickedness and Oppression, shall be sent <hi>empty away,</hi> and both their Estates and their Hopes be scattered like <hi>Leaves</hi> before the Wind.</p>
               <p>Nor is your Practice herein less Impudent than Ungodly, all Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness being indeed the height of Folly,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29668:109"/>
and Piety and Vertue evermore the <hi>best Policy.</hi> For why should you oppress us, by whose Labours you are sustained? And our Ill is your Loss, are we not your <hi>Money</hi>? And what a small matter more than you allow us, might plentifully supply us? As suppose such Masters as have Fifty, a Hundred or two Hundred <hi>Negroes,</hi> if they would add to our Allowance, Fifty, or one Hundred, or two Hundred Pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> it might maintain us in lively Strength, and sufficient Vigour to go through with our Labour with cheerful Spirits, and brisk Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; then should our Souls (instead of <hi>Cursing,</hi> and calling for Vengeance upon you) <hi>Bless</hi> you, and serve you cordially and willingly, with all our Power. For those that are wise amongst us, matter not their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom so much, provided they might but be admitted such necessary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, Priviledges and Accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as our bountiful Creator by his

Hand-maid, <hi>Nature,</hi> has plentifully provided for all his Creatures, and especially for the race of Men: And then would you have Peace in your own Houses and Spirits, whereas now you are always filled with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Anger, Strife, Jealousie or Suspitions; nor need you ever then fear our <hi>Rising</hi> up against you, to cut you off, or any other Invasion; for nothing does so much disarm the Rage of the fierce Wrath, as Well-doing and Innocency; these being the surest Bulwarks both against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward Enemies.</p>

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:29668:110"/>
you, ever have cause to Repent of these merciful Resolutions, for the only way for you to have <hi>good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> is for you first to be <hi>good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>; and though some of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men are <hi>untractable, sullen, morose, cruel</hi> and <hi>revengeful</hi> (more especially by reason of the Oppressions before-mentioned) so others of them have notwithstanding given you strong Motives to believe their Integrity and faithful Honesty towards their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and <hi>Christians</hi> in general, for many of us at several times, and on sundry occasions, have givem most clear and demonstrative Testimonies of our Faithfulness, in discovering several <hi>horrid Plots</hi> and <hi>Conspiracies,</hi> which some of the worst of us had designed against our Masters; And how little do many of us value our dear <hi>Lives,</hi> to save our <hi>Masters</hi>? And how ready are we to go, run, work, watch and defend our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to preserve their Rights? So that many of our Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:29668:110"/>
have been heard to say, <hi>That they would as soon, and willingly trust their Lives with some of their</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro Slaves, <hi>as with the most trusty</hi> Christian Servants <hi>they had.</hi> And I doubt not, but if our Masters deal justly, and with tenderness preserve us, by allowing us such suitable Food, Drinks and Rest as are needful for the support of our Lives and Health, and suitable to the Climate, we should <hi>all in general</hi> become more tractable, obedient and diligent, and thereby not only perform our Labour much better, but secretly attract the sweet Influences of God and Nature on their Heads, and then twenty of us would dispatch as much Work and Business as thirty do, or can do, that have neither Food that is proper, either in Quantity or Quality, nor <hi>due Rest,</hi> for want of which, the whole frame of the Body, and all the Members grow heavy, dull, weak and heartless, and the Mind indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and averse from, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:29668:111"/>
for Work or Business, which can never go on well, and to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, where the chief motive is <hi>Whip</hi> and <hi>Spur,</hi> Fear on the one side, and Cruelty on the other.</p>
               <p>Besides, if we and our <hi>Wives</hi> were kept in good Heart, we should be able to get not only <hi>more strong</hi> and <hi>healthy</hi> Children, but <hi>more in Number,</hi> which would supply your Business far better, than for you every Year to be at that great Charge of buying such Numbers of <hi>new Negroes,</hi> of whom many fail, and many dye upon the change of Climate; For by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Hardships used to us, and especially the Cruelties towards our Wpmen, during their Pregnancy, they so often <hi>Miscarry,</hi> that we upon the Island cannot keep our Number, but decrease so fast, that you are forced every Year (at vast charge) to fetch about <hi>ten Thousand</hi> (as I have heard) new Ones; whereas there is no doubt to be made, but if we were conveniently supplied with Food and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:29668:111"/>
competent Rest, and some due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or Commiseration had to our <hi>Wives when they are big,</hi> then every of our Masters Families would so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease by his <hi>own Bread,</hi> that there would be no more occasion for buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of new Ones, which would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully enrich you; so that if either you regard the Rules of your <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> and will not justly be bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for <hi>Hypocrites</hi> or <hi>Atheists</hi>; If you have any respect to <hi>Humanity,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Honesty,</hi> and that universal <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
