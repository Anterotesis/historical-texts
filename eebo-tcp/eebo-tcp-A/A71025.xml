            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE HIGH-BORN PRINCE, HIS GRACE, JAMES. Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IF <hi>Tamerlan</hi> the Great were this day alive, he would doubtleſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of this most worthy Choice that I have here made of your Graces Noble Perſon and Name, to place at the Frontiſpiece of this exact Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his Life and Conquests.</p>
            <p>He was a Soveraign Prince, of an Heroick Spirit, of an undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb facs="tcp:40153:3"/>
and of an admirable Conduct in War. He was call'd betimes to make uſe of theſe great Virtues at the Head of an Army, where Providence always Crowned his Actions with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. At firſt he roſe out of a ſmall Province of <hi>Aſia,</hi> but in a few years, he ſpread the Glory of his Name and Victories, all over that part of the World. He was a Prince ſo exact in the Execution of Justice, and of ſo ſingular a Piety and Goodneſs, that the Chriſtian Profeſſion, as well as his own Religion, flouriſhed all over his Dominions under his Protection, And his greatest Enemies thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy at last, to have been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, and to be Govern'd by a <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Nation, Great Sir, if not the whole World, ſees your Graces Noble Soul enrich'd with the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Virtues, and divine Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
<pb facs="tcp:40153:3"/>
Providence hath alſo led you out betimes, and cauſed you to march after <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> in the ſame Paths of Honour. The ſafety of <hi>Europe</hi> hath called your Grace into the Field, to ſhew your Valour and Conduct, to give Laws to unruly Enemies, and ſet Bounds to the unjust Greatneſs of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Your Graces noble Mind, your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, your Fame, and Victories, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us as glorious in this Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern World, under our Monarch of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as <hi>Tamerlan's</hi> ever did, either under the King of <hi>Parthia</hi> his Father, or the Grand <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle. And your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſincere Devotion for our Proteſtant Religion, your mild and courteous Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, your great Affection and daily Services for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have render'd your Name Sacred every where in City and Country, and
<pb facs="tcp:40153:4"/>
cauſed us all to look upon you as a ſecond <hi>Tamerlan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did Providence put into your Hands the ſame Power, Opportunities, and Authority, we ſhould doubtleſs ſee, through your Graces Wiſdom and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name render'd as famous all over <hi>Europe,</hi> and as dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our proud and inſulting Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as ever the <hi>Parthian</hi> was to the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> the <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meluks,</hi> and other <hi>Barbarians,</hi> forced to ſubmit to the Empire of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> the Great.</p>
            <p>This notable Reſemblance, together with your Graces Affability, Mildneſs, and moſt ſweet Diſpoſition, hath encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd me to this Preſumption, for which the greatneſs of my reſpects, the Excellency of the History, and the Nobility of the Subject will, I hope, mediate for, and obtain a pardon from your Graces goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40153:4"/>If I may be ſo happy in this Addreſs to give your Grace ſome little ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and delight you in the reading of the brave Exploits of this Heroe, as <hi>Alexander</hi> was in the peruſal of the War-like Actions of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and cauſe your Grace to caſt an Eye of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour upon this ſmall Treatiſe, and its mean Author, I ſhall attain to the chief End aimed at by this Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <head>THE HISTORY OF <hi>TAMERLAN</hi> the Great.</head>
            <p>THE Divine Providence ſeems to take a delight ſometimes to ſurpriſe and ſtartle the minds of men, with the ſtrange and unexpected Revolutions and great Changes that happen in the World: Such as are the terrible Earth-quakes that bury Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Provinces in their Ruines, the irreſiſtable Floods that carry all before them, the ſad Fires that turn into Aſhes in the twinkling of an Eye the beautiful Works and the proud Fabricks of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages. This Divine and wiſe Providence ſeems alſo to take a delight, to produce in the World, in the greateſt times of need, thoſe admirable ſouls and Great Men, who come as Bleſſings to Mankind, to baniſh away all Confuſion and Diſorder, and ſettle Peace and Happineſs amongſt men; like ſo many skilful Phyſicians they come to purge Nature from all its ill humours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> were Agents of this Divine Providence, employed for that charitable
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40153:6"/>
purpoſe. So likewiſe when <hi>Bajazet,</hi> that cruel Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> deſtroyed the Provinces of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> and made a havock of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Gods Providence choſe <hi>Tamerlan</hi> the Great, to give a check to his Pride and Cruelty, and ſtop him in his full career, wherein he intended to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the World.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtory of this great <hi>Hero</hi> I ſhall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, that it may encourage and direct all Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Spirits in the Employment of War, and inform the reſt of the World with a juſt and true Account of the brave and glorious Actions of this Noble Conquerour.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>TAmerlan</hi> ſignifies <hi>Celeſtial Grace.</hi> He was the Son of <hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Zagatay,</hi> or of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> Nephew of the <hi>Grand Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and not the Son of a vile Shepherd and Robber, as his Enemies have baſely invented to diſcredit him, out of malice or ignorance; that the geateſt Revenues and Riches of the Eaſtern Kings conſiſt in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Flocks and Herds, rather than in their Golden Mines, which nevertheleſs are alſo there to be found in their Dominions.</p>
               <p>The Province of <hi>Zagatay,</hi> or <hi>Sachetay,</hi> lies Weſt from the <hi>Sogdians,</hi> and is properly the ancient <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia.</hi> The chief City is <hi>Samarcande,</hi> ſeated upon the River <hi>Iſſarle.</hi> It grew ſo mighty in riches and number of men, as well as in beauty, during the Reign of this Prince, that it may now be compared to any other City of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40153:6"/>When <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was happily born, in his perſon were diſcoverable from his Infancy ſo many rare ſigns of a great Courage, and of a ſweet Diſpoſition, that gladded the heart of his old Father, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to incourage thoſe Gifts of Nature, by the tuition and teaching of the rareſt perſons and Doctors of the Country. After a good and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proficiency, this young Prince became the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, the love, and the wonder of his people. Before he was full fifteen he had learned from his Maſters all that they could teach him for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his body, or to grace his mind. He had ſome inſight in the Myſteries of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and skill in <hi>Taliſmanical Figures,</hi> which is called the <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> or <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> and of the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> and which ſince hath been much us'd by the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> aſwell as in riding of a Horſe, handling of a Lance, drawing of a Bow, and wreſtling. The King his Father looked upon him then as worthy to Govern the Kingdom, in which he employed him a little after; and the rather, becauſe he ſaw himſelf aged and weak, and deſired nothing more but to ſequeſter himſelf from buſineſs, and to ſerve God the reſt of his days in the contemplation of his glorious Works.</p>
               <p>But before he accompliſhed this great Deſign, though he had for his Son all the eſteem and good opinion that he deſerv'd, he was not ſo unadviſed as to venture in ſuch young hands the Government of his Realm, without a precaution and ſufficient proviſion for his advice and counſel; for if he had done otherwiſe, he would have but expos'd his Kingdom to thoſe dangers and loſſes which are not eaſily repair'd.</p>
               <p>To prevent all miſchiefs of that nature, he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40153:7"/>
placed near his Son, to eaſe and direct him in the management of Affairs, <hi>Odmar</hi> and <hi>Haly,</hi> the two greateſt and wiſeſt men of the Kingdom, noted for their Noble Birth and for their Experience in Affairs, aſwell as for their other Vertues and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to his Intereſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> received theſe two great perſons from his Father as the tokens of his love, and ſince he never undertook any thing without their advice. He embrac'd them always with ſo much reſpect and affection, that for fear of forgetting one after his deceaſe, he wore his Ring upon his Finger, aſwell to call to mind the good ſervices that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him, as to hinder him from forgetting two rare Precepts which he had given him, when he was to ſit in Judgment, and to do juſtice to his Subjects.</p>
               <p>This noble way of acting ſoon won him the hearts of all his Subjects, ſo that they looked upon him as their life and ſoul. From hence we may obſerve, <hi>That a mild and loving diſpoſition, together with an acknowledgment of good deeds, is the ſtrongeſt Charm that a Prince can uſe to win the ſouls of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and get their prayers and affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his young days, and at his firſt coming to the Crown, he enjoyed quiet and peace at home, through his Fathers care to ſcatter and ſend at a diſtance all troubleſome ſpirits, who might have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed the State. But this peaceable time he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed rather in Study than in his Divertiſements; inſtead of ſpending his hours in a Bath, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt delight of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> he ſpent them in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Arabian</hi> Books, and in meditating the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> at ſuch moments only when he had finiſhed his weightier Employments relating
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40153:7"/>
to the Government of his Kingdom. In the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of which he often ſaid, <hi>That his good Genius did aſſiſt and help him, and that having ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from Heaven he could not but ſucceed in all his Deſigns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had ſo great a care of and ſo much eſteem for divine matters and things, and for whatſoever concern'd the Religion of his Forefathers, that he would not be perſwaded to ſuffer any alteration. Nevertheleſs he gave liberty to all Religions that teach to worſhip <hi>one God Creator</hi> of all things, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this as his Reaſon, <hi>That his Divine Majeſty did delight to be ſerved and adored in divers manners.</hi> But he was a declared and an irreconcileable Enemy of Idols and Idolaters, whom he always vexed.</p>
               <p>He was of a middle ſtature, his ſhoulders were but narrow, his legs beautiful, his body full and well ſet, a comely face with good features, and his eyes ſo full of goodneſs, mildneſs, and majeſty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that it was no eaſie matter to look ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly upon them. Therefore the Prince was wont to turn away out of modeſty his eyes from him that ſpoke to him, that he might finiſh his diſcourſe with more confidence. He had but little hair upon his Lips and Chin, it was curl'd, very thick, and of a fine Aſh-colour; he wore it long, contrary to the cuſtom of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who ſhave their Heads be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leaving but ſome few locks behind, which they cover over with their Caps, but he had almoſt always his head uncovered. Therefore when one of his Favourites asked him why he had not his Head ſhav'd as other perſons of his Country; he anſwered, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand my Friend one thing which I will tell thee, becauſe I will thereby acknowledge thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to me, That my Mother was of the Race of</hi> Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40153:8"/>
                  <hi>therefore in remembrance of my Forefather, ſhe hath commanded me to preſerve my hair: This is the cauſe of my long hair.</hi> This ſecret being afterwards ſpread abroad, gain'd to him the reſpect of all his Subjects, chiefly of his Army, who imagin'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome extraordinary vertue in his hair. This belief was confirmed by his wonderful skill and ſtrength in wreſtling, becauſe the ſtrongeſt <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> were not to be compared to him, and that ſuch as were foiled thought it an honour, though over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, to ſtruggle with a Prince of ſo much repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>This being the right deſcription of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> it is eaſie to be imagin'd, that reſt and a quiet life was not pleaſing to him. But though his aim was at Glory and Honour, he choſe rather to check his <hi>Martial temper,</hi> than to invade his Neighbours, and trouble their Peace without cauſe. Providence that had adopted him ſuffered not long his courage to be without exerciſe: It led him upon this great Theatre of the World, there to appear in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner. We ſhall ſee him next in his firſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s War with the <hi>Moſcovites.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Moſcovites</hi> broke the Peace: they were weary of that Reſt which they had long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; thinking themſelves therefore ſo dreadful, that all their Neighbours were to ſtand in awe of them: They made ſome In roads upon the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories that are on this ſide of <hi>Cazan</hi> and <hi>Aſtracam,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40153:8"/>
and that border upon both <hi>Empires.</hi> They had never received any dammage from theſe Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: Their intention was only to conquer them without any Right or Claim. They enter'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore amongſt them with their Army, and cau'sd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing to paſs through Fire and Sword, ſparing neither Towns nor Villages; beſides, they plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a City bordering upon <hi>Zagatay,</hi> or <hi>Sachetay,</hi> and under <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s protection.</p>
               <p>In this ſurpriſe, theſe poor Inhabitants, being not able to ſtop the fury of thoſe Northern <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> ſought a remedy from their Tears and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and from the Power and Juſtice of their Protector. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was ſenſible of their wrongs, and the affront done to his Perſon and Government, by the Inſolency of the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> who had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd ſo little regard of him. He promis'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to puniſh them, and check their cruelty and boldneſs: For that intent he takes advice, what to do in this juncture, from his two faithful Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, who encouraged him to declare an open War with the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> in defence of his People and Confederates.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Odmar</hi> and <hi>Haly,</hi> according to their Princes expectation and Orders, were buſie in gathering together all their Troops diſperſed in Garriſons, to raiſe new Souldiers, and form a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Body, with the aſſiſtance of their Allies. At the firſt beginning of the Spring, <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> at the Head of his Army, marches againſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who were encamped upon the Borders, near the River <hi>Maſpha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Moſcovites</hi> were in all one hundred thouſand Foot, and fourſcore thouſand Horſe; moſt of them old Souldiers, who had been in many Encounters with their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40153:9"/>Of this fourſcore thouſand Horſe, ten thouſand were <hi>Polanders,</hi> ſent from the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly re-united by a League with the <hi>Moſcovites</hi>: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides there were eight thouſand <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and many Noblemen of that Nation, under the command of a great Lord, called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus. Tamerlan</hi> had in his Army threeſcore thouſand Horſe, and one hundred and fifty thouſand Foot-men, brought up in Armes, but they were not to be compar'd with the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> who had exercis'd themſelves in ſeveral Campagns; whereas the <hi>Parthians</hi> never ſaw an Enemy during the Government of their King <hi>Og,</hi> who had always been at peace with all the World.</p>
               <p>At the ſight of the Enemy, <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s warlike Courage and <hi>Martial</hi> fury was kept in by the fear of a miſtake: He thought it therefore wiſdom to take a view of their Camp, by which he underſtood that he could not go to them without paſſing at the foot of a little Hill, which they were poſſeſſed of before his coming. They had planted there ſix thouſand of their Foot, who might have ſtrangely gawl'd <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s men, had they attempted to ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> on that ſide, and yet they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to begin the aſſault there; but firſt <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> judg'd contrary to the judgment of his Privy <hi>Council,</hi> that they were firſt to beat the Enemy from that advantageous Poſt, and that without engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in a Battel. The <hi>Moſcovites</hi> were ſo well fortified in this place, that it was no eaſie matter to force them. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> therefore draws them down by a Stratagem: He gave Orders to twenty thouſand Foot, commanded by <hi>Haly,</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to aſſault the Hill, and when he ſaw the reſt of the Army drawing near to their aſſiſtance, he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40153:9"/>
cauſed his whole Army to paſs over the River of <hi>Roſna</hi>; by that means he reduced the Enemy to a neceſſity of fighting.</p>
               <p>This proceeding of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was ſucceeded by two advantages: Firſt it put his <hi>Cavalry</hi> in ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Guns and Darts of this little Hill, unto which they had been otherwiſe expos'd: Next it caus'd him to ſucceed in his deſign of ending this War, which the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> was reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. He was perſwaded that he could draw away his Men from this Poſt at his pleaſure, in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; and that in a Night, as he was wont, he could retreat back twenty Leagues. But he found by experience this to be a real truth, <hi>That humane wiſdom, in that very moment when it is the moſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is but dark and blind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two Armies in the mean while were in ſight of one another without engaging; for they ſtood at a ſtand, looking at what paſs'd upon the Hill, where the <hi>Parthians,</hi> recruited from time to time, and in ſeaſon, endeavour'd to drive from thence the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> who, being aſſiſted with continual ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, made a ſtout reſiſtance. The Fight laſted two hours with equal advantage on both ſides: for both Parties were encouraged by the many Witneſſes that beheld them. But <hi>Haly,</hi> at laſt, took this equality for an affront, or a kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat. This made him call upon his Men to do their uttermoſt, to force Victory to declare for them. They obeyed his perſwaſion, and gave ſuch a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous onſet, that their Enemies, weary and tired out with the former aſſaults, began to give back by degrees; which when <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Men perceived, his <hi>Parthians</hi> ſet upon them ſo ſtoutly, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had no time to rally again together, but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40153:10"/>
ſhamefully fled, and forſook their Station.</p>
               <p>This unexpected diſgrace, inſtead of affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> and filling them with fears, which are the uſual ſequels of ſuch kind of defeats, filled them with impatiency to be revenged, and make amends for their loſſes; chiefly becauſe they were reduced to a neceſſity of fighting by the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Enemies approach, who had paſs'd the River for that purpoſe, and from whom there was no flying with ſafety. This made them paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately deſire the ſignal.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moſcovites</hi> Army was thus embatteled. The <hi>Van,</hi> led by the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> the <hi>Emperours</hi> Son, was compoſed of five and twenty thouſand Horſe, <hi>Poles, Hungarians,</hi> and <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> in a Body. They charged with their Lances in double Files, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind a ſufficient diſtance to retreat, but this prov'd to their diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>The main Battel, where their greateſt ſtrength was, conſiſted of forty thouſand Horſe, followed by all their Infantry. The <hi>Emperour</hi> was there in Perſon, with the greateſt part of the <hi>Lords</hi> of his <hi>Court.</hi> The Reer was a great Squadron of ten thouſand Horſe, in a ſquare Body, of their beſt and compleateſt Troops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army march'd in another order: This Prince had divided all his <hi>Cavalry</hi> into nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſquadrons, every one conſiſting of ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, only his own ſquadron had ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and his <hi>Infantry</hi> ſtood in Battalions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Odmar</hi> led the <hi>Van</hi> of nine ſquadrons of Horſe, having forty thouſand Foot upon the Wings, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand on each hand.</p>
               <p>The Body was commanded by <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ten ſquadrons of Horſe, his own in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40153:10"/>
and fifty thouſand Foot, all choſen Men, the ableſt of his Army.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Tanais,</hi> his Couſin, brought up the Reer, having forty thouſand Foot in ſix Diviſions, and three thouſand Horſe, named <hi>Oliacks,</hi> or Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, to ſecond them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Parthians,</hi> encouraged with a proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs upon the Hill, waited for nothing but for the Signal, to fall on their Enemies. And <hi>Tamerlan</hi> himſelf, when he ſaw them advance in ſo good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ſave them the trouble of marching part of the way, met them in the middle, ſending his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to <hi>Odmar</hi> to go forward: But this wiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced <hi>Captain,</hi> who alone was authoriſed by his credit and long experience in War, to oppoſe the deſires of his <hi>Prince,</hi> ſent him back word, that he would ſtop where he was; that he would wait upon the Hill for the Enemy, and would not loſe the advantage gain'd already of the higher Ground, of the Wind and Sun. Three things that help'd them to win the day, and that incommoded ſo much the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> Army, that during the Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had always Duſt in their Eyes, ſo that by this means they were leſs able to ſee to the wants of their Army.</p>
               <p>Though at this time <hi>Tamerlan</hi> ſaw nothing in the Countenances, and on the Faces of his Souldiers, but that which promis'd ſucceſs and happineſs, yet to annimate them the more, he thought it fit to ſpeak to them in this manner.</p>

                           <p>'TIS neither for Riches, my dear Companions, nor for larger Bounds to my Empire, that we are to fight this Day: 'Tis for that which is far more excellent and noble: 'Tis for the Glory and Honour of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: 'Tis to ſhew theſe Enemies before us, that we are the ſame <hi>Parthians</hi> who put a ſtop to the <hi>Roman</hi> Conqueſts; the ſame who were not to be daunted by thoſe <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> Theſe that ſtand againſt you have neither their Courage nor Virtue.

I ſhall only recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you the remembrance of your Anceſtors Glory, and theſe conſiderations; that your Prince is in the Encounter with you; that he never knew what it is to run away, or flye from an Enemy; that he hath made you paſs over the River never to go back without Victory in your Hands; and that he puts all his truſt upon your undaunted Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Faithfulneſs.</p>

               <p>Theſe words caus'd ſtrange Tranſports in the minds of the Souldiers, which made them break out into loud cries to be led on to the Battel. Their furiouſneſs was ſo great, that they were not to be kept in at the ſight of the Enemy. <hi>Odmar</hi> ſoon ſatisfied them, by ſending to <hi>Tamerlan</hi> for the Sign, and word of Command, when he ſaw the time convenient; but he was prevented by the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> who charged firſt, and gave a furious onſet. The <hi>Parthians</hi> received them with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted reſolution, which had cauſed them to give back, if <hi>Odmar,</hi> at that time, had not by his fall diſorder'd his ſquadron. By this accident his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40153:11"/>
began to ſhake, and was afterwards broken, and himſelf hurried away in the Croud; ſo that he was forced, after a conſiderable loſs of Men, to ſhelter himſelf under the left Wing of his <hi>Infantry,</hi> on that ſide of the Mountain whither the Prince had ſent already ſix thouſand Horſe as a recruit.</p>
               <p>When he was mounted again, he rallied all his Men that he could pick up, and fell upon the ſides of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> Army, where the <hi>Hungarians</hi> were, who this day behaved themſelves ſo bravely, that only with three thouſand Men they broke through <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Battel. At this he retreated, according to the <hi>Parthians</hi> manner, which made the Enemies imagin them to run away. This fond conceit had ſo puft them up, that they thought the Victory to be already in their Hands: But aſſoon as the Reer was come up, led by the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais,</hi> who had rallied together about fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and all the Foot; he obliged the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> to run away in their turn, after ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary reſiſtance, that one may juſtly ſay, that their Vertue and Courage was forced to yield to the greater number.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Parthians</hi> perceiv'd that Victory ſmil'd upon them, they purſued their advantage ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that their Enemies had neither time to rally nor to underſtand themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was here wounded in the Forehead, and near the left Eye, having left two Horſes kill'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moſcovites</hi> Army was totally routed, many Lords and chief Officers taken Priſoners; the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> himſelf was once fallen into the Hands of a <hi>Parthian</hi> Souldier <hi>incognito,</hi> but he happily ſav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and met with ten thouſand Horſe that had not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40153:12"/>
been broken; with them he retreated ten Leagues, and for his greater ſecurity he paſs'd over a River in the Night, beyond which he rallied together all that he could ſave of his Army.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Cavalry</hi> behav'd themſelves in the Battel like Men of Courage, but when they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forſaken of the Foot in the hotteſt Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when they were fiercely charged, and Fortune ſeem'd to turn them her back, they were then forc'd to yield to the <hi>Conquerour.</hi> They ſuffer'd therefore more than the <hi>Infantry,</hi> that ſav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves along the Mountains in the dark of the night, which favour'd them in all their flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> having purſued them three Leagues, return'd to the Field, where he ſolemnly gave God the praiſe for the Victory obtained.</p>
               <p>The next day aſſoon as it was light he review'd all his Army, and underſtood that he had loſt not above ſeven or eight thouſand Horſe, and between three and four thouſand Foot; whereas the <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> wanted ſeven and twenty thouſand Foot, and about fifteen or ſixteen thouſand Horſe.</p>
               <p>We muſt acknowledge that <hi>Odmar,</hi> this day, was the ſafety of his Prince and of the whole Army; and that after his diſgrace he behaved himſelf won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully well and wiſely, in that he aſſaulted the Enemy upon the Flanks, when they had beaten both the <hi>Van</hi> and the <hi>Main Battel,</hi> and were going to fall upon the Reer, led by the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Tanais,</hi> under whoſe Wings <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was retreated. If <hi>Odmar</hi> had not acted in this manner, the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> would have doubtleſs, and with eaſe, defeated the <hi>Reer,</hi> and won the honour of that glorious day. By this 'tis eaſie to underſtand, how great is the advantage of that Commander, who having pitch'd
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40153:12"/>
upon a Field, and choſen a favourable Ground and Place, waits ſtedfaſtly for his Enemies coming, chiefly when he hath both Wind and Sun to fight with him. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> forgot not to mind his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Captains of this happineſs. It is alſo certain, that when the <hi>Reer,</hi> is well commanded it is able to reſtore the Battel when it is in a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſPerate condition, and to ſnatch the Victory out of the hands of the ſtouteſt Enemies.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> as I have already ſaid, had given thanks to God, and taken a review of his Army, he commanded all the dead, both his own men and the Enemies to be buried, and afterwards he rewarded all thoſe that had well behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Fight. But his joy for the Victory was qualified with the grief for the death of <hi>Haly</hi>; he was killed with an Arrow, as he was going to the Fight, after that he had gain'd the Mountain, and performed Actions worthy of an Immortal Glory. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> caus'd his Body to be embalmed, and to remain with him in his own Tent, till he return'd to <hi>Samarcande,</hi> where he cauſed a ſtately Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre to be made for him, which renders his name famous in ſucceeding Ages, and gave a beginning to the glorious Structures, which he cauſed afterwards to be erected in his <hi>Capital</hi> City, and which have made it to be one of the moſt famous Cities of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> after this Victory, was not puft up with Pride, as ſome of his Age are in ſuch great ſucceſſes; many times they are ſo apt to forget themſelves, that they become unſufferable to their beſt Friends. But after the ſlaughter, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held ſo many thouſands reeking in their Blood, he lamented at the hard and unavoidable fate of ſuch
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40153:13"/>
as command in great Armies; and addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thoſe that were about him. <hi>O how happy is my Father in his choice of Peace, and in preferring a ſolitary and quiet life to this troubleſome, painful, and cruel employment of a Souldier, which he muſt ſometimes embrace that governs a Kingdom. Is it not grievous, that ſuch an one cannot purchaſe to himſelf Glory, but by the Death of ſo many millions of his own Species, and oftentimes the deſtruction of his deareſt Friends.</hi> In this manner <hi>Tamerlan</hi> receiv'd, with diſpleaſure, ſuch bloody ſucceſſes purchas'd at the price of ſo many lives.</p>
               <p>In the mean while he ſupply'd the duties of his place, and gave Orders to advance into the <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> Country; marching after their flying Army that were rallied into a Body of thirty thouſand Horſe, which, together with the Foot, ſeem'd to be willing to venture another Battel, but their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had no ſuch reſolution, when he ſaw the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> ſo ſoon at his Heels, ready to enter into his Country, where the People were frighted at the approach of ſo victorious an Army. To ſecure himſelf and his Men, he paſſed over the River of <hi>Nifort</hi>: on the other ſide he called together a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Officers,</hi> who advis'd him, for the preſervation of his Subjects, to ſend a ſolemn <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie</hi> to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> with Overtures of Peace, rather than to hazard another Battel againſt a <hi>Prince</hi> who had juſtice on his ſide. They were the ſooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to this, by the generous behaviour of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> with the Priſoners that he had taken; for thereby he ſeem'd to give an aſſurance, that he would not refuſe reaſonable offers of Peace, and that after he had ſhewn ſufficient proofs of his Courage and Power, he would likewiſe give ſome Tokens of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40153:13"/>
his Moderation and Generoſity. In purſuance of this Deſign, the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> ſends him <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> to treat of Peace, and offer all poſſible amends for the wrongs ſuſtained by his Subjects In-roads into <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Country.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> were arriv'd at <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s <hi>Camp,</hi> they found a moſt obliging reception. He was ſo far from inſulting over their unhappineſs, that he ſeem'd to pity them, and treated them with ſo much kindneſs, that though a <hi>Conquerour,</hi> he ſeem'd to have as much modeſty as the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They declared that they were come in their Maſters name to deſire a Peace, upon ſuch Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as he ſhould propoſe, which they expected would be favourable, for they were confident that he would uſe his Victory with moderation, which he was to take rather as a kind gift of Fortune, upon which no perſon can ſettle his aſſurance, than an evident proof of the greatneſs of his Forces. He anſwer'd them, that he had taken up Armes only to protect his Subjects and Confederates from the inſults of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi>; and if they had prov'd happy and ſucceſsful, he acknowledg'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be therefore indebted to the great <hi>God of Hoſts,</hi> who had favour'd the juſtice of his Cauſe: That becauſe he held and had received this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from his pure goodneſs, he was not therewith puft up with pride; that they might have learn'd ſo much from the manner of proceeding of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who had it recommended to them from their Predeceſſors, <hi>not to want courage in adverſity, nor to be inſolent in proſperity; but to obſerve a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in both, and ſeek the execution of Juſtice.</hi> He told them, that it was but juſt that they ſhould give ſome ſatisfaction to the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and promiſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40153:14"/>
never to moleſt or trouble his Allies; that they ſhould pay down all the Expences of the War, which amounted to three hundred thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats, and that they ſhould become Tributaries, and give him yearly one hundred thouſand Ducats; and that for the performance of theſe conditions, they ſhould deliver <hi>Hoſtages,</hi> which were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed every year; and that he for his part would grant them peace, and ſend home all their Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of War.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conditions were readily accepted, ſo that <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> full of glory and ſatisfaction, return'd to <hi>Samarcande</hi> to his Father, who was ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed in the affairs of the world, that theſe <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperities</hi> of his Son wrought no alteration upon his countenance, and in his diſcourſe, no more than in his mind.</p>
               <p>But every where in the <hi>Princes</hi> march he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in <hi>State</hi> with <hi>Arches</hi> of Triumph, with Sports, and all the marks of a publick joy and pomp, which <hi>Tamerlan</hi> accepted as the ſigns of his Subjects affections with a grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their love.</p>
               <p>In theſe great cauſes of publick joy he ſeem'd to be very moderate and modeſt; when a ſolemn <hi>Embaſſy</hi> came to him with rich Preſents, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his Victory, from the <hi>Grand Cham</hi> of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle,</hi> with the offer of his only Daughter in marriage, promiſing to cauſe all his Subjects to acknowledge him as the <hi>Heir</hi> of his <hi>Empire,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was his neareſt Kin, and had no hopes in his old age to be Father of any more Children.</p>
               <p>This pleaſing news was welcom to this young <hi>Prince,</hi> and the rather, becauſe by this great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, he was in hopes to be able to put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40153:14"/>
the mighty things that he deſign'd in his mind, which ſhould immortalize his Name. He prepared himſelf with all poſſible diligence for this journey towards <hi>Quinſay,</hi> where the <hi>Emperour</hi> his Uncle liv'd. He was by his Orders received, as in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, by all the great <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> as well as by all the Inhabitants of this great City, who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd his arrival with the richeſt ſhews, becauſe he was one day to be their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of their lives and fortunes.</p>
               <p>The days immediately after his magnificent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were ſpent in ſports and gallantry, in Plays, Races, Encounters, and other Divertiſements, in which the vain-glorious <hi>Tartars</hi> were glad to ſhew their addreſs and dexterity.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Tamerlan</hi> met with none there that could beat him in all theſe Exerciſes. He was ſo expert in them, in ſhooting with Bow and Arrows, and in fencing with a ſharp Sword, that he gain'd the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and love of all his Subjects.</p>
               <p>At the end of ſix days ſpent in theſe delights, the Emperour caus'd him to be ſolemnly crowned, with the applauſe and conſent of all ſorts of men, for the Prince was deſirous that this Solemnity ſhould precede that of his Marriage, that his Right to the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> might be better ſecur'd, and that it might not ſeem that the <hi>Empire</hi> fell to him by the marriage of his Wife, but by a Lineal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, for Daughters in that Country cannot inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Crown.</p>
               <p>Immediately after <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was married with all the ſplendour and glory imaginable. In this occaſion, all the magnificence and pomp of the old <hi>Rome</hi> ſeem'd to appear at <hi>Quinſay,</hi> to render this Solemnity more glorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40153:15"/>After the Conſummation of the Marriage, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> ſpent two Months at this <hi>Court,</hi> with all the ſatisfaction and honour that he could deſire; for he was mightily beloved, and generally look'd upon as the only hope of the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Tartary.</hi> But at laſt his natural inclination to return into his own City of <hi>Samarcande,</hi> where he took more delight than in any other place of the World, together with the deſire to ſhew himſelf to his own Subjects as the Succeſſor of the greateſt Empire of the World, prevail'd upon all other conſiderations, and oblig'd him to take leave, with his beloved Spouſe, of his Father-in-law, and of all the Friends that he had got in that Court. He arriv'd in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Princeſs to this City, where he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected with the longing of his people. We muſt acknowledge that the abode is very pleaſant, as well in regard of its ſituation, as for a beautiful River that waters it, and renders it one of the richeſt thereabouts for Trade, and the fertility of the Soil. At his arrival he met there with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of ſeveral Princes, ſome were come to congratulate him upon his new Promotion, others to make a League with him, others to avoid his diſpleaſure, that they might not have him for an Enemy. The moſt pleaſing Embaſſie was that of the Emperour of <hi>Moſcovy</hi>; for beſides the ſtately gifts, ſeveral beautiful Horſes, and the richeſt Furs of the Country, as <hi>black Foxes,</hi> and <hi>Sables,</hi> which the Embaſſadours brought, he ſaw himſelf freed from the apprehenſion which he had conceiv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the news that this Prince did gather together his Army. He underſtood that it was to march againſt <hi>Poland,</hi> and ſome other Neighbours. The <hi>Poles</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited in vain the Prince by their Envoys, and by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40153:15"/>
ſome of the chief of the Court, whom they had gain'd to ſend Succours. They alledg'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, that the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> was but a reconciled Enemy, that he would quickly become more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful if he met with ſucceſs in this attempt; and if he could overcome ſo great a Kingdom as <hi>Poland</hi> is, to add it to his former Dominions, that then it would be too late to ſeek a remedy to prevent an evil, which was now to be hindered by ſending ſome ſuccours and aſſiſtance to the <hi>Polanders,</hi> who would ever after become the <hi>Parthians</hi> Scouts on that ſide of their Empire, and watch over the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their common Enemy: Beſides, it is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rule amongſt Princes, not to ſuffer their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to grow too great, for fear of the uſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Theſe reaſons made no impreſſion upon <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s mind: This was all the anſwer he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, <hi>That he had given to the</hi> Moſcovite <hi>the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thing that he had in the world, namely, his Faith, and that he would not be the firſt to break it; but if on the other part he did offer to violate the Treaty, he knew how to puniſh and bring him to reaſon, ſeeing that he had been able to overcome him when he had nothing but the Kingdom of the</hi> Parthians, <hi>which is but a little Province of</hi> Tartaria; <hi>and that now that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Lord of ſo great an Empire, he had leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſtand in fear of him: that he was fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that in obſerving the rules of Equity and Juſtice with all the world, he had reaſon to expect that his Sword would be able to make way into new Empires, and other Kingdoms; and that whiles the</hi> Moſcovites <hi>were imployed and buſie in their deſigns, he would endeavour to proceed on in his purpoſes, to get to himſelf honour and glory: that the Peace concluded and ſworn to the</hi> Moſcovites, <hi>was known to all the Neighbours, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40153:16"/>
ſhould never be broken by him; beſides, that it was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to himſelf, and advantagious to his people.</hi> He told them, <hi>that he knew for certain that God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes commonly Princes who lightly ingage themſelves in unjuſt wars and quarrels; and that this Leſſon having been learn'd and carefully practis'd by his Fore-fathers, had been a means to raiſe and eſtabliſh his Family, and cauſed it to continue for three hundred years ſafe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, by this obſervation of the Rules of Juſtice; ſo that in all that time none of his Predeceſſors have ever been croſs'd with unſucceſsful attempts, for the God of Hoſts is a lover of Right and Juſtice.</hi> He told them, <hi>that if he had, as ſome declar'd, ſo great a delight in War, and ſo earneſt a deſire to appear in action, he had means enough, without committing injuſtice, to ſatisfie his mind, by requiring from ſome of his Neighbours the Lands which they had taken from the King his Father, who had never demanded any reſtitution, out of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs for the world, or an earneſt inclination for Peace: that in caſe of a refuſal, it would be juſt and glorious for him to recover his poor Subjects, and free them from the tyranny of an unlawful Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Odmar,</hi> who had been one of the moſt earneſt perſons to perſwade him to aſſiſt the <hi>Polanders,</hi> with an intention to weaken the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſeem'd at leaſt to yield to theſe reaſons. He was mightily raviſh'd with the juſtice and equity of <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s diſcourſe, and to conſider how he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated his courage with the Rules of Reaſon: And though the judgment of many of the wiſeſt of the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> grounding their opinions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the antipathy of both Nations, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Religions, was contrary to that of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan,</hi> they could not prevail to make him alter his reſolution. <hi>Odmar</hi> alone knowing the cauſe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40153:16"/>
ſtrengthen'd it the more; ſo that it overcame the advice of thoſe who ſupported their opinion by undeniable Maxims of State, and the experience of many Ages. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> nevertheleſs underſtood very well that they had good reaſons on their ſide, and that by reſiſting their judgments he acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rules of humane wiſdom; and it may be he had followed their advice, if it had not been for another great deſign which he had found, the <hi>Great Cham</hi> was the firſt Author of it in a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at <hi>Quinſay,</hi> he caus'd him to reſolve upon it: only <hi>Odmar</hi> had been privy to it; for there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of the weighty Affairs of the Empire, they took together a reſolution to carry the War into <hi>China,</hi> as well to drive thoſe people into their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient bounds over which they had paſs'd, as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure on that ſide the Empire of <hi>Tartary.</hi> In the mean whiles preparations were ſecretly made for this great Enterpriſe, for which the Prince had a mighty fancy, without diſcovering his mind. He depended upon the ſuccours which the Emperour his Uncle had promis'd, and with which he was confident to re-eſtabliſh the <hi>Tartarians</hi> in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient poſſeſſions, and that he ſhould gain the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, becauſe he had Juſtice on his ſide, which doubtleſs would favour him in his undertaking. Whatever inclination he had naturally for War, he had thought it a crime to ingage himſelf in a quarrel only out of a motive of ambition, or for pleaſure, and he had look'd upon himſelf as the Author of all thoſe deſolations, diſorders, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which accompany and follow War: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he often deſired of God the Spirit of Wiſdom and Diſcretion, and the power to overcome his own paſſions, which he would ſometimes ſay was a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40153:17"/>
                  <hi>more glorious Victory for a Prince, than that which wins for him Kingdoms and Empires.</hi> Therefore when he could find Juſtice on his ſide, and ſee that ſhe did incourage his ſtrong inclination for War, then his Soul was fully ſatisfied in it ſelf, ſending forth out of his eyes, and upon his countenance, certain motions which ſignified his joy and inward contentment; chiefly when he was to demand his own Territories, to free his Subjects from ſlavery, or deliver his Allies from an apparent oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>There was never a Prince leſs guilty of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he was never angry when his judgment was oppos'd, but rather well pleas'd when he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by ſtronger reaſons than his own; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he honour'd and reſpected ſo highly wiſe and vertuous men, that without any regard to their Rank or Dignity, as ſoon as he could hear of any, though in the deepeſt miſery, he was wont to ſend for him, receiving him in this obliging manner; <hi>My friend, I intreat thee let me be a partaker of thy Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and I will make thee a partaker of my Riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this ſubject he did often complain, <hi>that he had many gifts offered to him of Gold, Silver, Jewels, and rich Moveables, but very few did offer him thoſe Ornaments and Graces which are needful to govern well ſo many differing Nations that he had in his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt the chief Officers of his Court, and deareſt Friends, there was a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> a Chriſtian, named <hi>Axalla,</hi> who had been brought up with him from his Cradle, and for whom the <hi>Parthians</hi> had a great reſpect. He was the chief incourager to ſet the Prince on to great and noble Actions, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Enterpriſes. The difference in Religion never hinder'd <hi>Tamerlan</hi> from liſtning to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40153:17"/>
him; for, as I ſaid before, when God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, the Creator of Heaven and Earth was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, he never troubled himſelf, nor enquir'd into the differing Modes of worſhip. He was wont to ſay, <hi>that it did become the greatneſs of the Divine Majeſty, to be ſerved and adored by all the Nations of the Earth, in divers manners, according to the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of people.</hi> But he hated all <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and would not ſuffer them to abide in his Dominions: So that the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> which <hi>Axalla</hi> profeſs'd openly, hinder'd him not from enjoying and poſſeſſing the greateſt honours and dignities of <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army and Court.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. The War proclaim'd by <hi>Tamerlan</hi> againſt the King of <hi>China,</hi> but ſtopt by the Revolt of a <hi>Calix,</hi> a great Lord of <hi>Tartary;</hi> his defeat, and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</head>
               <p>WHen <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had privately made ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient preparations for the Expedition that he had promis'd his Uncle, not only for the reaſons already mentioned, but alſo becauſe it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Publick Peace, to imploy the Subjects of ſo great an Empire in a Forreign War; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe either their numbers, or their ſtirring diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, might have proved prejudicial to the <hi>State,</hi> every one was ſurpriſed to ſee that the Cloud that had been long a gathering, was going to fall upon <hi>China.</hi> The King of this large Country, who is named <hi>the Off-ſpring of the Sun,</hi> expected no ſuch matter: But to acquaint him with the reaſons of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40153:18"/>
ſuch great preparations, Embaſſadours were ſent to him, to require a reſtitution of all the Lands, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and Feedings, which he had taken from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> contrary to the laſt Treaties. Theſe Lands are lying beyond a River called <hi>Tachii,</hi> and beyond that famous Wall which bound both Empires, and which the King of <hi>China</hi> caus'd to be built to ſecure himſelf and people from the frequent Inroads of the warlike and reſtleſs <hi>Tartarians.</hi> What anſwer this proud <hi>Monarch</hi> would make to this Embaſſie was known before; therefore all the Troops were commanded to advance and haſten to their general Rendezvous.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Parthians</hi> were to meet at <hi>Hirdas of Baſchir,</hi> where the whole Army was to joyn them; but the <hi>Tartarians</hi> were ordered to gather together in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Ergimul,</hi> where <hi>Tamerlan</hi> with all his Forces was to come to them at a certain day.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Cham</hi>'s Army had two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting men, all well diſciplin'd and inur'd to labour and pains. In this Army beſides were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſiderable Lords, and worthy Commanders, who had render'd themſelves famous in many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters and Wars, in which the Emperour, before the decline of his Age, had been ingag'd, and by which he had inlarg'd the bounds of his great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Embaſſadours were return'd out of <hi>China,</hi> they brought this inſolent anſwer, that this proud Prince, puff'd up with a ſtrange conceit of his own power, wonder'd that the King of the <hi>Parthians</hi> was ſo bold to make War upon him; that he judg'd it more reaſonable for him to reſt ſatisfied with that which he could take away from him with his mighty Army; that he regarded
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40153:18"/>
not the progreſs that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had made with his Forces, nor their ſucceſſes already, they were too weak to be compared with the numerous Armies of the <hi>Chineſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This proud Anſwer caus'd all deliberation to ceaſe. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> inſtantly ſent a Meſſenger to the Emperour, to let him underſtand the poſture of Affairs, and this vain-glorious Anſwer of the King of <hi>China.</hi> In the mean while, he gave all neceſſary orders for Proviſions and Ammunitions to be ſent to the Rendezvous of the Army from all parts, and for the <hi>Tartars</hi> Army to advance forward, with an intention to joyn both his Armies in few days. But before his departure, he was willing to take his leave of the King his Father, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his juſt Cauſe and Expedition to his Prayers.</p>
               <p>This good Parent being ſenſibly mov'd at the goodneſs and piety of his Son, imbrac'd him ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times. After many hearty wiſhes for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous Expedition, he ſpake to him in theſe terms, <hi>Farewel my Son, I ſhall ſee you no more: I feel my ſelf departing to my final reſt; I am going to exchange this periſhing life, ſo full of miſery, for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more happy.</hi> Then he took his Royal Ring from off his Finger, and gave it to his Son, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the cauſes of his Wars. The old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call'd <hi>Odmar,</hi> and ſpoke to him to recommend his Sons concerns to his care and fidelity, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo full of gravity and goodneſs, that he ſeem'd to have ſomething in him more than humane.</p>
               <p>After this the Prince return'd to <hi>Samarcande,</hi> where the Empreſs his Spouſe was, whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to carry with him in the wars, according to the Cuſtom of that Nation. And as he was natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very thankful for the ſervices that he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40153:19"/>
he viſited the Tomb of his faithful ſervant <hi>Haly,</hi> and according to the manner of his Law, he caus'd prayers to be ſaid, during three days entire, for the peaceable reſt of his Soul. Finally, he gave order to the Government of his Kingdom, and for the preſervation of the Frontier Towns, and committed all to the inſpection of <hi>Samay,</hi> a man of great worth and experience, who had tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor'd him in his young days. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> could not eaſily forget ſuch kind of ſervices, he had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reſpect for thoſe that taught him Vertue; he kept for them as much affection, as if he had been ſtill under their tuition. This generous inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo full of goodneſs, made him highly reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and beloved of his People. He went from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marcande</hi> to <hi>Hirdas</hi> of <hi>Baſchir,</hi> where his Army was quarter'd, conſiſting only of one hundred thouſand Foot, and fifty thouſand Horſe. There he gave orders to the reſt of the Army, to march as ſoon as he ſhould ſend them word.</p>
               <p>His greateſt dependency was upon the Forces of the <hi>Grand Cham</hi> his Uncle, who mightily incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd this War. But when he was at the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, he was forc'd to make a ſtop, becauſe of his indiſpoſition, occaſion'd chiefly through the change of the Air, as his Phyſicians imagin'd.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Army of the <hi>Grand Cham</hi> was upon the march, under the Command of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libes</hi>; and for fear the rumour of his Diſtemper ſhould cauſe any diſturbance in the Empire, unto which he was newly promoted, he was careful to inform by Meſſengers, very often, his Uncle, of the condition and temper of his Body.</p>
               <p>He had good cauſe to ſuſpect, that a certain great <hi>Lord</hi> of the Country, named <hi>Calix,</hi> was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40153:19"/>
his Friend, nor content with his Promotion, becauſe he had not been with him, to acknowledge and render him homage, as the other <hi>Lords</hi> of the Empire. Though at that time men diſcours'd of <hi>Calix,</hi> in a manner, that was able to beget a jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> his good diſpoſition would not ſuffer him to take any notice of it, neither did he think it convenient to attempt any thing during his Uncles Life, or trouble the Peace of an Empire newly put into his hands. Some thought that what he had done was out of policy, to oblige more ſtrongly to himſelf the hearts of his new Subjects, who had already a love for him; and to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more dreadful to thoſe that were angry at his Promotion, he had craftily ſuffered this Cloud to gather together, and the beginnings of a Civil War to ripen, that he might gain to himſelf more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, credit, and reputation, by diſſipating and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying it; that he was able to ſtifle it in the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, for Empires are gotten and kept by the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Souldiery, by treating them well and civilly, as his manner was; and that it was eaſie to diſappoint ſuch as are of a ſtirring nature with a little patience, for in time they may be deſtroyed in divers Expeditions, or they may be removed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral quarters, far from the places where they have credit, or they may be imployed in long and tedious ſervices, where they may alter their minds, and the power of doing miſchief.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s delays and long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in one place was ſubject to divers cenſures, ſome thought it was caus'd only by his diſtemper, others better inform'd, imagin'd that it was the product of a faithful advice, and good knowledge of that which was acting againſt him, which

doubtleſs would break out as ſoon as he ſhould be on the other ſide of the Mountains of <hi>Paſanfu. Calix</hi> expected this with great longing: as ſoon as he had underſtood that the Forces of the <hi>Grand Cham</hi> were beyond the River of <hi>Meau</hi> that runs on the other ſide of the Mountains, and that they were incamp'd at <hi>Bouprou,</hi> he thought it high time to diſcover his deſign.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe he gather'd together his chief and moſt intimate Friends, declaring to them, that now the time was come to diſappoint all the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Parthian,</hi> who purpoſed to ſubdue them, and keep them under his Command; that ſeeing their Emperour was ſo unadvis'd of his own head, without the approbation of thoſe who ought to have a ſhare in ſuch Elections, they for their parts ſhould not neglect ſo fair an opportunity of redeeming their precious Liberties; that <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> was diſeaſed, the <hi>Grand Cham</hi> aged, the greateſt part of his Army at a diſtance, and that there could not be offer'd a fitter opportunity to ſet on foot ſuch a deſign; that their Enterpriſe was ſo likely to ſucceed, that as ſoon as they ſhould ſet footing in the Province of <hi>Cattay,</hi> that the whole Country would declare for him, becauſe his Father had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd it many years, and becauſe the Inhabitants, not knowing <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> would believe all that he ſhould tell them; that the Province of <hi>Zagatay</hi> was at a great diſtance from them, that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> would have much ado with the powerful Enemy who had mock'd his Embaſſie ſent to prevent the War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore their Enterpriſe would doubtleſs ſucceed happily, when he ſhould have ſent to aſſure the Great <hi>Cham,</hi> that their intentions were not againſt his Perſon or Government, with promiſes not to

                  <hi>Calix</hi>'s Speech had a good colour, it was ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd with many Reaſons and Inſinuations. He had ſpent a whole year in winning the peoples fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that he might be able to uſe them in due time. He prepar'd all manner of Ammunitions, and had ſpar'd no coſt nor labour to compaſs his deſign. But though all things were carried ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any noiſe, <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had intelligence of all theſe practiſes againſt his Perſon. At firſt he made light of it, or ſeem'd ſo to do, wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing all the reports of the Rebellion of this <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Fool,</hi> that it might break out to the eyes of the World, and render <hi>Calix</hi> more guilty, and himſelf leſs blameable, by bearing Arms in his Uncles Dominions, whoſe diſpleaſure he was loath to draw upon himſelf. It is very likely that he could have prevented this miſchief in its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but he had good cauſe to deal otherwiſe. His long abode at <hi>Cachobach,</hi> near a Months time,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40153:21"/>
becauſe of his indiſpoſition, as was pretended, had a good reaſon.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Tartarians</hi> Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Calibes,</hi> hearing of the mighty prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and intentions of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> to aſſault them, murmured becauſe they were idle, and let ſlip the opportunity of ſhewing their courages to their Enemy, and their new Prince. The Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders endeavoured to pacifie and quiet the Souldiers martial diſpoſition, with news that came at every foot of ſome unexpected obſtacle that ſtaid <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> from joyning with them. It was eaſie to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, that his quick and ſpeedy temper in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his reſolutions, was ſtopt by the knowledge of <hi>Calix</hi>'s Conſpiracy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> and that he delayed the time only, that he might have a favourable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to puniſh him: Nevertheleſs, he was willing that <hi>Calix</hi> ſhould believe, that he was paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Mountains, to aſſault the famous <hi>Wall</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by all the Armies of the <hi>Chineſes</hi>; for that purpoſe he gave an expreſs Command, that care ſhould be taken that none might forſake the Reer, to give notice where he was with his <hi>Camp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This wiſe proceeding ſucceeded well; for <hi>Calix</hi> imagining that his Enemy was at a vaſt diſtance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring with the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> though he was on this ſide of the Mountains, caſt off all diſſimulation, and with as much indiſcretion as he had hitherto ſhewn wiſdom in his ſecreſie, commanded all his Forces to march againſt the <hi>Prince,</hi> to ſurpriſe and intangle him.

I am in duty bound to help him to puniſh <hi>Calix</hi> for his Rebellion and Inſolency: He alone hath reſiſted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours intentions, and refus'd to acknowledge me, and yield to my Promotion to the Empire of <hi>Tartary</hi>: But we muſt alſo think at the ſame time of reſiſting our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemy, whoſe vaſt Armies are as likely to aſſault us, as to oppoſe our attempts.</p>
                           <p>It is very likely that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> are made the bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by <hi>Calix</hi>'s Rebellion, with whom it is probable they hold Correſpondency, and to whom they may have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd aſſiſtance and protection, with a deſign to divert our Forces, which they ſaw were all coming againſt their Country, to re-take what they had uſurped upon us. Therefore, my Friends, I think it beſt, that whiles I ſhall go back to chaſtiſe the ambitious Rebel, <hi>Calibes</hi> ſhould ſtay upon the Frontiers with five and twenty thouſand of the <hi>Parthians</hi> Cavalry, and forty thouſand of the Emperours, and with one hundred thouſand Foot to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Chineſes</hi> from breaking into our Country.

               <p>This Diſcourſe of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was well lik'd of by all the chief Officers of the <hi>Council,</hi> though ſome that had not underſtood this Rebellion were of a contrary judgment: They ſaid, that it was a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity to ingage in a War with the King of <hi>China,</hi> in ſuch a time when a Civil Diſſention breaks out like a Cancer that conſumes the Entrails of the Kingdom, and diſappoints all foreign deſigns; that it was wiſdom to ſecure the Heart of a Country, before one attempts the Conqueſt of another. But theſe perſons were not well acquainted with the Princes Secrets; for the long knowledge of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious practices of <hi>Calix,</hi> had made him keep up an Army always ready to march at his firſt motion. They knew not that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> apparently diſpleas'd at this Rebellion, was not really angry to go into his new Empire with weapons in his hands, for a Cauſe that his Uncle judg'd to be juſt, becauſe this would gain to him the affection of the Souldiers, and give him a new poſſeſſion of, and Title to the Empire that had been given him, and becauſe this tended to the ſecurity of his Dominions for the future; for by the puniſhment of this Rebel, others would ever be diſcouraged from making new at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
               <p>We muſt confeſs that <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s wiſdom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd as well by this ſeparation of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army, as by obliging <hi>Calibes</hi> to ſtay upon the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40153:22"/>
Borders, though he knew very well that this <hi>Lord</hi> was deſirous to follow him, to be an Eye-witneſs of the event of this Civil War, that he might go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern himſelf according to the good or bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> who had an eye upon <hi>Calix,</hi> and without whoſe advice he never did any thing, commanded the <hi>Van</hi> of the <hi>Parthians</hi> Army that was left behind. Thus both Armies were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. The King of <hi>China</hi> was a long while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding any thing of this inward Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: He thought the whole Army of the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Tartarians</hi> had been at hand; for <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had taken great care to ſtop the paſſages, that no News could paſs. This favour'd <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s deſigns not a little.</p>
               <p>The Army where his Perſon was, marched back with diligence, and great hopes of ſucceſs. The <hi>Van,</hi> led by <hi>Odmar,</hi> ſtaid upon the borders of thoſe Provinces where <hi>Calix</hi> had his Agents, until the <hi>Prince</hi> had ſent to acquaint the old <hi>Emperour</hi> with all things that had paſſed. But when the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was return'd, he underſtood that the <hi>Emperour</hi> was deſperately ſick, and that the whole <hi>Empire</hi> was inclineable to Rebellion. This News made him leave his Infantry behind, and to draw with more haſte nearer to the Enemy with all his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry. His coming was to him unexpected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calix</hi> had been with his Army of one hundred thouſand men before the great and proud City of <hi>Cambalu,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Province of <hi>Catay.</hi> The Inhabitants had open'd their Gates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with as much joy, as if he had been their lawful Soveraign. They were ſo blind and fooliſh, as to ſend ſome of their own Citizens,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40153:23"/>
with the Deputies which the Rebel had diſpatch'd to the Court held then at <hi>Quinſay.</hi> They had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in his name, to aſſure the <hi>Emperour</hi> of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and fidelity, and with ſtudied expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to impoſe upon him, by colouring his Revolt with the hatred againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League which they had lately made never to own <hi>Tamerlan</hi> for their Prince. They beſeeched his Majeſty to ſubſtitute in his place <hi>Calix,</hi> that their glorious Empire might not be inſlaved to a Stranger of <hi>Zagatay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this ſame time there was news ſecretly flying, that the Prince of <hi>Parthia</hi> was already upon the borders of <hi>Catay,</hi> and that he was followed by the beſt Troops of the Empire. <hi>Calix</hi> could never ſtifle this Rumour, to keep on his ſide ſuch as had too unadviſedly ingaged themſelves in this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, out of a perſwaſion that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> would not be able to return in eight Months from his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into <hi>China,</hi> whatever ſucceſs and happineſs he met with. <hi>Calix,</hi> with all his ſubtle fetches, could not work upon their minds already poſſeſſed with the fear of the puniſhment which their Rebellion had deſerved: They were as much ſurpris'd and affrighted, as are a company of Scholars when their Maſter finds them quarrelling, and in a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, contrary to their duty. At this time the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> were Courting of <hi>Calix</hi> at <hi>Cambalu,</hi> where he received the Homages of the Provinces that yielded to him. But this unexpected coming of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was a dreadful news that daſht all their joys; ſome of them were aſham'd of their ſudden and inconſiderate Rebellion, which ſo much the more deſerved a puniſhment, becauſe it was acted againſt their lawful Lord, and againſt the greateſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40153:23"/>
Captain of the World, whoſe Vertue was worthy to command not only the Empire of <hi>Tartary,</hi> but alſo of the whole World. The rumour of his march ſpread every where amongſt the people, and as the Moon, which never continues two days the ſame, this report increas'd and decreas'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the affections of the Authors and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainers of it. But this caus'd the moſt paſſionate perſons for <hi>Calix</hi>'s Intereſt to grow cold, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their intentions. The Inhabitants alſo of this great City gather'd together in Companies, ſome of five hundred, others of a thouſand, others of two thouſand, to conſult, but not able to come to any ſetled reſolution, for they were afraid of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi>'s juſt diſpleaſure, having incens'd him by their baſeneſs and infidelity; for they had been ſworn unto him, and by the Emperours Command had acknowledged him for their <hi>Lord.</hi> They ſaid amongſt themſelves, <hi>that he was lawfully deſcended from ſo many Monarchs who had reigned over them very juſtly; therefore their troubled Conſciences fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied him at their Gates, ready to puniſh them for having raſhly open'd them to a Rebel, who had plotted againſt his lawful Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whiles theſe people were thus juſtly troubled with ſeveral diſquieting apprehenſions, <hi>Tamerlan</hi> expecting the Forces that he had ſent for out of his own Kingdom of <hi>Zagatay,</hi> drew nearer by degrees to the City of <hi>Cambalu.</hi> His Army had paſs'd <hi>Cain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du,</hi> and march'd ſtrait to <hi>Calalia.</hi> The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Cambalu</hi> had been deceived with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful promiſes of <hi>Calix</hi>; and as many perſons do, they had flattered themſelves with large expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of proſperity, without thinking how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful the affairs of the World are, and how ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40153:24"/>
to change. When therefore they ſaw the Prince upon their borders, they were mightily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd with fear and diſpleaſure for their Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As ſoon as <hi>Calix</hi> underſtood it, he went out of the City, with a firm reſolution to fight <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> with all his Army. He gathered his men from all parts, intending to try the fortune of a Battel. At the ſame time he received ill news from the Court, that the Emperour was ſo far from being pleaſed with his undertaking, that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Souldiers, in conſiderable numbers, to gather together out of all the Garriſons, and to march to help his Nephew, unto whom in his moſt deſperate ſickneſs, when he thought to have left the world, he had ſent his Imperial Ring, giving out an expreſs Command, that all his Subjects ſhould obey him as his own Perſon.</p>
               <p>This news, together with that of <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, cauſed him to haſten to hazard all in a Battel: For that intent, he took out of <hi>Cambalu</hi> fifty thouſand men, partly Inhabitants, and partly Garriſon Souldiers, plac'd there by the Emperour. This Garriſon was in number thirty thouſand: <hi>Calix</hi> had won them by the means of their Officers and Governours, who were of his Party, and had conſented to deliver up into his hands this great City.</p>
               <p>When all his Souldiers were together in a Body, they amounted to fourſcore thouſand Horſe, and one hundred thouſand Foot. His deſign was ſo well ordered, that if the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> whom he had ſollicited under-hand, had anſwer'd his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and enter'd into the Province of <hi>Zagatay</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſtop the march of the <hi>Parthians</hi> Army, in whom <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had the greateſt confidence, it is certain
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40153:24"/>
that <hi>Calix</hi> might have put this Prince to a <hi>non-plus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chiefly becauſe he had the City of <hi>Cambalu</hi> to aſſiſt and favour him. It is therefore very dangerous for ſuch as govern to anger great ones, or not to mind their behaviour. If their diſpleaſure be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by their Credit and Intereſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, they are more inclineable to ſtir and cauſe diſturbances.</p>
               <p>We muſt here acknowledge, that the Emperour of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> was a great Friend to <hi>Tamerlan</hi> in this occaſion, by refuſing to aſſiſt a rebellious Subject a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his lawful Prince. He had in vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſſwade him from his wicked purpoſe, and reduce him to obedience. <hi>Odmar</hi> much taken with this juſt proceeding, was wont to ſpeak of it often to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> ſo that he was an uſeful Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to preſerve friendſhip between theſe two Princes.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Succours of the <hi>Parthians</hi> were come to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> he march'd with diligence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Calix.</hi> He underſtood, by the means of two thouſand Horſe whom he had ſent before, that the Enemy came to meet him in good order. This news caus'd him to detach two thouſand more to ſeiſe upon the paſſage of a River named <hi>Brior,</hi> as well to ſecure his Proviſions, as to ſtop there, and ſuffer the Rebels to think upon their fault, which either a little time would infallibly call to mind, or the want of food, unto which he hoped to reduce them, or at leaſt to put them in diſorder. In this particular, Rebellious Armies differ much from Royal Armies, where Order and Diſcipline joyn hand in hand, and preſerve Union and Plenty.</p>
               <p>In this march of the Prince againſt <hi>Calix,</hi> he forgot not the Command of the Emperour his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40153:25"/>
to make a notable example of this Rebel, and of his Confederates, to ſecure by that means the peace of his Empire, and of his days.</p>
               <p>This conſideration made him act with caution, that he might not miſcarry in any thing. He ſaw that his own Army did increaſe every day by the arrival of new Levies from all parts, whereas the Enemies Army wanted already Proviſions, becauſe they could ſcarce have any from <hi>Cambalu,</hi> a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs lying between the City and the Camp, and certain Mountains at the end of the Wilderneſs, where a Subject of the <hi>Grand Cham</hi> commanded, named <hi>Cangi.</hi> This Lord had promis'd to let the Proviſions paſs when <hi>Calix</hi> was in his Territories, but as ſoon as he was at a diſtance, he refuſed it, and took all that came into his hands; he had a greater power to perform this, becauſe <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had ſent him four thouſand Horſe to guard him and his Country.</p>
               <p>This grievous accident, which <hi>Calix</hi> never could foreſee, caus'd him to reſolve upon a Battel: But <hi>Tamerlan</hi> underſtanding his wants, and the cauſe of his ſpeedy reſolution, had ſeized all the Paſſes and Fords of the River of <hi>Brior</hi> for his own Army; it had fourteen miles behind it a fat and a plentiful Country, beſides the Salt Lake, and the River of <hi>Oſtan,</hi> which was beyond: ſo that he could ſtay till the Enemy did aſſault him; for this wiſe and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Prince judg'd it advantagious to him to ſuffer the Enemy to ſpend himſelf, and his Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by degrees.</p>
               <p>The two Armies ſtood two Months looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another: All this time was ſpent in light skirmiſhes. When <hi>Calix</hi> underſtood the intent of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> he reſolv'd to return back to <hi>Cambalu,</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:40153:25"/>
where he knew that he ſhould have all things in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance; and the rather, becauſe he underſtood that ſome practices were acting againſt him there. As ſoon as the Prince perceiv'd it, he paſs'd over the River with all his Army, which conſiſted of one hundred and fifty thouſand Horſe, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Foot. After that he had conſulted his chief Officers, he reſolved to try the fortune of a Battel.</p>
               <p>This reſolution was grounded chiefly upon two reaſons; firſt, becauſe he was afraid that <hi>Calix</hi> would return, and ſpend the Winter at <hi>Cambalu,</hi> where he ſhould be forc'd to go and fight him. This would cauſe the total deſtruction of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City, for he doubted not of the Victory: ſecondly, becauſe if he did win that City by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, he was afraid that his Army ſhould grow too rich and wealthy with the plunder, and by that means would be leſs fit for the great Actions, in the proſecution of which he intended further to imploy them. This reſolution that he was forc'd to take griev'd him; he was not willing to enter into the poſſeſſion of his Empire by Bloodſhed and Cruelty. This conſideration caus'd him once more to ſummon <hi>Calix,</hi> and adviſe him to lay down his Arms, with promiſes of pardon, and to receive him into his favour.</p>
               <p>The unadviſed <hi>Calix,</hi> whoſe courage was not contemptible, ſlighted all theſe gracious offers; his ambition render'd him cruel to himſelf, and caus'd him to look upon all other conditions of life, under that of a Soveraign, as unworthy of him. He could not ſubmit, but choſe rather, though but for a day, as a Prince to govern, than to live many years as a Subject. He could not truſt nor relye

totally upon the promiſes of his Prince, with whoſe generoſity and good nature he was never acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: He thought the deſtiny of men in his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, condemns them either to a fatal Ruine, or raiſes them up to a Throne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army went over to <hi>Chincy,</hi> marching ſeven Leagues: as ſoon as the Enemy underſtood it, they alter'd their deſign, and returned back, with an intention to venture a Battel. It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Calix</hi> turning himſelf then to ſome of his followers, told them, with his eyes lifted up to Heaven, <hi>that in all his life-time he had never received a more pleaſing news:. The</hi> Parthians, ſaith he, <hi>have paſs'd over the River, and are coming towards us: If therefore</hi> Tamerlan, <hi>who dallied with us before, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us now to end our Quarrel by a Fight, my happineſs is great, whatever be the event, it muſt needs procure me an immortal glory: If the advantage happen on my ſide, what Prince is there in all</hi> Aſia <hi>that may contend with, or be compared to me, for I ſhall be Lord of all</hi> Tartary <hi>and</hi> Zagatay, <hi>for I fight againſt the Armies of theſe two Kingdoms which I have divided: but if I be overcome, the greatneſs of my undertaking will leave behind me a great deal of Reputation in the world, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I have ſtopt with my Army, during two Months, between the Rivers of</hi> Brior <hi>and</hi> Oſtan <hi>all the Armies of</hi> Zagatay: <hi>Therefore if we chance to loſe the Victory, it will prove for our honour.</hi> During this diſcourſe, his Attendants took notice in his looks of a Noble Air, which made him eſteem'd and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd of every one.</p>
               <p>When the Armies drew near, the Scouts met, and thoſe of <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army were driven back into their Camp, which accident vext <hi>Odmar</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded then the <hi>Van.</hi> The Prince told him, that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40153:26"/>
at the approach of the Enemy he ought to have increas'd the numbers; he excus'd himſelf, in that he imagin'd that <hi>Calix</hi> would not be ſo bold as to advance three Leagues towards the Army at that inſtant.</p>
               <p>The next day was ſpent in giving out Orders to every one: The Captains went about in the Ranks, exhorting their Souldiers to behave themſelves well; and both Captains and Souldiers incouraged one another to fight valiantly, by declaring the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters where they had been already.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calix</hi> was forty years of age, much reſpected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Nobility of his Blood, and the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Rank that he held in his Country. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour eſteem'd him ſo much for his experience in War, that before <hi>Tamerlan</hi> appeared in <hi>Tartary,</hi> he was always look'd upon as worthy of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>The Armies ſtood one againſt another, for eight hours in the morning, skirmiſhing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times according to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> manner, before the Battel: A great Plain, and even ground lay between them. <hi>Odmar</hi> commanded the <hi>Van,</hi> where were ſixty thouſand Foot, and forty thouſand Horſe, which he ſeparated into four great Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, cauſing one to go before the other to the Fight. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> marched on in the ſame Order, but his Squadrons were ſtronger. The <hi>Infantry</hi> of the <hi>Van,</hi> and of the <hi>Main Body,</hi> were on the right hand, and on the left. He had taken out of his Army, to make up the Reer, ſix thouſand <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and two thouſand <hi>Tartarians,</hi> giving the Command to <hi>Axalla</hi> a <hi>Genoeſe</hi>; but, as I have ſaid, had been brought up with him from his Infancy: He had by his affection for him, by his vertue, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40153:27"/>
and valour, deſerved his Princes eſteem and confidence. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> order'd him not to fight but in the extremity, and to have a care to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all that ſhould be broken in the Army. <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> performed this ſo exactly, that he did this day notable ſervice to his Prince. He was no leſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd by the Men of War, though he profeſſed a Religion contrary to theirs; for he was a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> and imitated by many whom he had ſent for out of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and beyond the <hi>Pontus Euxinus</hi>; theſe accompanied him with their courages and perſons in the Battel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calix</hi> on the other ſide was Eloquent, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a great Speaker; he incourag'd therefore his Souldiers with the honour and liberty of their Nation, to play their parts like men, and follow his example. He had divided his Army into three Bodies, only he had placed his <hi>Infantry</hi> at the right hand, and his <hi>Cavalry</hi> at the left; he himſelf was in the middle Body, ſurrounded with his Foot, as with a Circle, according to our manner of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Odmar,</hi> a crafty and experienced Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſtopt when he ſaw the Enemy coming, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their motion; but when he perceived that their greateſt Body was ſhaken at the onſet of his firſt Squadron, he cauſed his two others, the one to charge at the right hand, and the other at the left: They were ſo furious and happy, as to put the three Bodies of <hi>Calix</hi>'s Army into a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo that they were forc'd to reunite in one.</p>
               <p>At that time <hi>Tamerlan</hi> came in, and cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all that ſtood before him, nothing was able to reſiſt his fury: he made way through the thickeſt of his Enemies, ſome he put to flight, others he laid in heaps; the cries and lamentations of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40153:27"/>
dying were heard in every place; the diſorder and hurley-burley was generally all over the Field: here you might have ſeen weak Squadrons diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others more numerous; there you might have beheld Troops of Horſes taken by ſuch as were more greedy of prey than honour; every where <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army ſeem'd to have gain'd the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when fifteen thouſand freſh Troops, led by <hi>Calix</hi> himſelf, came into the Field, and gave a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious charge upon the Princes <hi>Battalion,</hi> and broke it all to pieces. This Reſerve proceeded from ſome that at the firſt onſet fled to the Carts and Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, where they had rallied, whiles <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s men were purſuing the victory, and killing. When therefore this Body of Horſe appear'd firſt, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi>'s Army being in diſorder, they had no great difficulty to overcome them: The Victory was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt.</p>
               <p>This oblig'd him to retreat in fighting, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the manner of the <hi>Parthians</hi>: The Prince had been diſmounted, but reſcued at the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which caus'd him to look to his <hi>Reer,</hi> which could not yet come up to him. His <hi>Infantry</hi> had open'd it ſelf when he gave the onſet: It had not yet been aſſaulted, but only upon the skirts in the ſeveral Encounters. At the ſame time therefore that <hi>Calix</hi> purſued ſo vigorouſly the Princes Army, that by a ſtout reſiſtance had leſſen'd the number of the Enemy, <hi>Axalla,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Reſerve,</hi> or the <hi>Reer,</hi> came up to the <hi>Infantry</hi> which had ſcarce been ingag'd in the fight. The Clouds of duſt hindered <hi>Calix</hi> from perceiving this Body that was in the <hi>Reer,</hi> and that was falling upon him and his men, who advanc'd in very good order, bearing all down before them. At that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40153:28"/>
theſe words were often heard repeated, <hi>Give back, give back, give back. Axalla</hi> had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thouſand, or twelve hundred of his Body, to advance, and free the Prince: They charg'd home to the Enemy, ſo bravely, that <hi>Calix</hi> began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture what would become of his Empire, of his Glory, and ambitious deſigns, by what was then acted: The diſpleaſure made him penſive a little moment, but reſolution caus'd him to ſend a Party to ſtop the Enemies fury, while he rallied his ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Troops. He gathered together about ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand, with them he thought to have beaten <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Reer: But he was not a little troubled, becauſe the duſt hinder'd him from diſtinguiſhing the Foot from the Horſe; he imagin'd therefore that all <hi>Axalla</hi>'s Party were Horſe. In this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he ſhew'd his courage and reſolution with a ſetled countenance, by exhorting his men to play their parts, and purſue their good fortune which they had already; and aſſuring them, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s men before them were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſuch as had already fled, who endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to rally; and that with a ſtout onſet it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to hinder them. Whiles he was ſpeaking, his Party increas'd: But <hi>Axalla</hi> conſidering that his Maſter had put into his hands that day the fortune of two great Empires, was reſolved to anſwer his expectation, by hazarding his life for his intereſt and glory, with a reſolution of dying upon the place, or of carrying away the Victory, he call'd to ſuch as were neareſt to him to follow his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; therefore with an incredible fury he broke through the Squadron led by <hi>Calix.</hi> This Prince was wounded with a Lance in the mouth, when he had performed the duty of a Commander, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40153:28"/>
common Souldier, and expreſs'd ſufficiently his undaunted courage. In the hurley-burley he was taken Priſoner by <hi>Axalla</hi> himſelf. It was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately nois'd abroad all over the Field, together with the advantages that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had obtain'd, for he himſelf had defeated a Body of Horſe, by charging them in the Flank. <hi>Axalla</hi> before had broken them, but they were rallied together again, and had not <hi>Tamerlan</hi> ſeaſonably come in, they might have ſnatch'd the Victory out of his hands. This bad news broke the hearts, as well as the Troops of the Enemy that fled immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>In this Fight there died above fifty thouſand men on both ſides; ſo that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> purchas'd the Victory at a dear rate, and was forc'd to confeſs, that in all his life-time he never was more likely to be undone than at that time. He imbrac'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd <hi>Axalla</hi> for his couragious behaviour and wiſe Conduct that day. This Noble Captain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>Calix</hi> before him, wounded with a Lance in the Mouth, and with an Arrow in his Side. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> ask'd him ſome queſtions, but <hi>Calix</hi>'s pride and inſolency would make no anſwer, pretending that he could not well ſpeak. He was kept till the next day, the laſt of his life, for he was judg'd worthy to die by a Council of War. His Head was chopt off, and ſent as a Preſent to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Cambalu.</hi> All the other Commanders were treated in the ſame manner: There was a neceſſity for this ſeverity, to hinder all Civil Broils from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing again; it was therefore needful to cut off the Chieftains.</p>
               <p>After the Fight, <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army meeting with no reſiſtance, march'd into the Province of <hi>Catay,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:40153:29"/>
which is full of all kind of Fruits, Graſs, Beaſts, and Fowl, more than in any other part of <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> The Prince gave a ſevere Command to all his Souldiers, not to offer to abuſe the Inhabitants, whom he would deal with as with his beſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>The Cities of <hi>Cangi, Sochgi, Gonzae, Tagin, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara,</hi> and <hi>Congu,</hi> that had revolted, ſtaid not for a Summons to yield, but wiſely ſent their Deputies to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> to implore his mercy.</p>
               <p>This good Prince forgave them, requiring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them, but that they ſhould furniſh his Army with Proviſions, telling them, that for the future they ſhould be better adviſed, than to be ſo eaſily perſwaded with the empty promiſes of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious perſons, who would endeavour to draw them from that obedience which they owe to their Lord and Maſter.</p>
               <p>This kind and courteous dealing being divulg'd all over the Provinces, wrought a great change in the minds of thoſe, who expecting no favour from <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s hands, were yet reſolved to venture all, and ruine themſelves and their Country. The Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Cambalu</hi> had taken this ſtrange reſolution, to ſell their lives at a dear rate, if they were to loſe them; for this City was full of thoſe Mutineers, who knew themſelves as guilty as their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that had been puniſh'd already; expecting therefore no mercy for themſelves, they thought it might mitigate their puniſhment, if they could but draw into it the reſt of their Citizens.</p>
               <p>But this kind and gracious dealing of their Prince put other thoughts into their Souls, and rais'd their hopes. Nevertheleſs, the Armies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the City, increas'd daily the fears and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40153:29"/>
apprehenſions of the people. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all that was there acted from thoſe that favour'd his Intereſt: They ſent him word, that at laſt every one was reſolved to obey the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,</hi> and perform his Commands; therefore he left his Army at <hi>Gonza,</hi> only thirty thouſand men he order'd to march thither to fill up the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Garriſon. When they were enter'd, they put all things in a good poſture, and caus'd every one to ſubmit to the Princes pleaſure without murmuring. He himſelf was received into the City two hours after his Garriſon in a triumphing manner, for the Inhabitants laboured, in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to make him forget the wrong they had done him. He had only pardon'd the meaner ſort of people, the reſt he left to the will of the Emperour his Uncle, unto whom he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd a Meſſenger, to inform him of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, of <hi>Calix</hi>'s death, and of the impriſonment of ſome of the chief Commanders and Leaders of the Faction; and to deſire to know what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment he would have inflicted upon thoſe of <hi>Cambalu,</hi> who had been the greateſt Mutineers. By this kind and inſinuating dealing, he purchas'd to himſelf in this great City the reputation of a merciful and gracious Prince. He gain'd alſo the love of every one by courting them, chiefly thoſe who had been faithful to his Party.</p>
               <p>After eight days ſtay in this place, he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a thouſand prayers and praiſes, which were again reiterated a little after, when news came from the Emperour, that he would have Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice done upon the Authors of the Rebellion. This was perform'd in the <hi>Cham</hi>'s Name, and by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40153:30"/>
his Officers two hundred of the Inhabitants were executed, and their Heads were lifted up in the publick view, for an example to all ſuch as ſhould afterwards attempt to rebel. This cruelty of the <hi>Great Cham,</hi> condemn'd by the common people, caus'd them to extol the goodneſs of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> who by this yielding to his Uncles will, laid a greater Obligation upon him, and nevertheleſs purchas'd to himſelf the univerſal eſteem of the Country.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the Emperour began to riſe from his ſick Bed, which caus'd him to have an earneſt deſire to ſee the Prince, who delayed this Interview till he had been with his Army, where he intended to adviſe, whether it were not beſt to ſtay firſt, and expect what news he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from his Army upon the borders of <hi>China.</hi> Thus he went as far from <hi>Cambalu</hi> as he could, that he might not be thought to have any hand in the execution of the Citizens.</p>
               <p>In this manner this dangerous and Civil War was ended, to the advantage of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> whoſe diligence had been notable in the extinguiſhing of it: One may juſtly ſay, that he conquer'd this great Empire, for there was a dangerous and a general conſpiracy and riſing againſt him: His vigilancy diſappointed all his Enemies. In ſuch like caſes, ſpeedy and early appearances in the Field, are of the higheſt importance for a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Affairs, to incourage his own Party, to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſuch as are wavering, and to prevent all falſe reports, with which the common people are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cozen'd. His chief endeavour ſhould be to perſwade, and make it appear, that the Rebels
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40153:30"/>
are not to be fear'd, and that he himſelf dreads them not; but this he can never do, unleſs he commands his own Army: By this means he will have a great advantage over the Rebels. It is not to be imagin'd, that a Revolt is to be ſtifled by weak Remonſtrances, for that perſwaſion ſavours of as much indiſcretion, as the Authors of the Rebellion have had craft to cauſe their injuſtice to be entertain'd under the notion of Equity: Therefore without delays, a Soveraign Prince muſt fall upon the Rebels, ſcatter and deſtroy them with the fear of a ſpeedy puniſhment. By no means let him be prevail'd upon to grant pardon to the Chieftains of the Rebellion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> dealt in this manner with <hi>Calix.</hi> He knew his deſigns a great while before he was in a capacity to put them in execution; therefore he provided a timely remedy, a powerful Army in the Province of <hi>Zagatay,</hi> to be ready to march at his firſt Command. In the mean while, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be buſie in his Expedition againſt <hi>China,</hi> that he might by that means better diſcover the chief of the Rebellion, and their wicked inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; by this act of wiſdom he diſappointed <hi>Calix,</hi> who doubtleſs might have prevail'd upon a negligent and weak Prince given to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: But <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had better qualities, he found the benefit of his cares and vigilancy; for before this he was not well ſetled in the Empire; but by this Victory he became ſuch an undoubted Succeſſor and Owner of it, that the death of the <hi>Great Cham</hi> could not cauſe any alteration or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his Right. From hence it is eaſie to conclude, that as his kindneſs and moderation
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40153:31"/>
were ſtrong Chains to bind the hearts and ſouls of his good Subjects, his courage and ſeverity knew how to puniſh the Rebels, and ſeditious perſons, and bring them to obedience. As ſoon therefore as <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had overtaken his Army, <hi>Odmar</hi> who expected him, and caus'd them to march in good order, and ſlowly, received him with the Captains and Souldiers, with acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and expreſſions of joy, calling him in the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Language, <hi>Moſt great and victorious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the way he diſcours'd with his Captains concerning the Greatneſs and Beauty of the City of <hi>Cambali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> till he was come into the Tent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for him, where he remain'd alone with <hi>Odmar.</hi> He told him all that had been acted in that rebellious City; afterwards he deſir'd his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whether he ſhould viſit the <hi>Great Cham,</hi> his Uncle, at that time or no. <hi>Odmar</hi> underſtood by his words, that he remembred what Honours he had received at <hi>Quinſay</hi> when he was there, and that he had a ſecret inclination to ſpend the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the young Empreſs, and to go in the Spring into <hi>China.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as he was an Enemy of Flattery, and loved his Prince entirely, as one of his moſt faithful and chief Officers, he ſpoke to him boldly in this manner; <hi>Brave and Invincible Emperour, let all the world underſtand, I beſeech you, that</hi> Tamerlan <hi>knows how to uſe his Victory, as well as to gain it. Do not you mind, that the Army which you have left upon the borders of</hi> China <hi>is buſily imployed in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Enemy above ſix months; that the Chief Commander is a</hi> Tartarian, <hi>and one of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40153:31"/>
of his Nation. Know you not that the</hi> Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians <hi>and</hi> Parthians <hi>never think a Prince worthy to reign, if he cannot go with them to the War: And do you not conſider, that you have undertaken this War to increaſe the glory of him who hath made you his Succeſſor, and inlarge the bounds of his Empire, by re-taking the Lands which the</hi> Chineſes <hi>have uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: It concerns you therefore in gratitude to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them with ſpeed. Conſider likewiſe, that your Glory and Reputation will appear to him greater at a diſtance, than near at hand, and more pleaſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will at a diſtance tend to inlarge his Empire, and render his Affairs more proſperous, whereas near at hand your Fame will but diminiſh his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and it may be cauſe a jealouſie in him. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſometimes are ſubject to change, and by a ſudden repentance to ſtrive to ruine the perſon whom they have exalted too high. What need have you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a journey ſo much deſtructive to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory? Is it not better to ſpend the Winter bravely in your Tent with your Army, than in the ſtately Palaces of</hi> Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

No doubt but the King of</hi> China <hi>believes that you
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40153:32"/>
are much ingag'd in your own Country with your hands full, that your Army is daily weakned by the Rebels, who had almoſt ſnatch'd the Empire from you. He believes your deſigns are diſappointed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the weakneſs of the Army commanded by</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libes; <hi>their behaviour cauſeth him to conceive, that they are ſent thither rather to ſecure</hi> Tartary, <hi>than to aſſault</hi> China. <hi>It may be he hath heard ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons tell him that which many of your own people ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but I dare not affirm it as true, becauſe it is not lawful for me to enquire into the wiſe counſels of Princes; that the cauſe wherefore you have left</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libes <hi>the Chief of the</hi> Tartars <hi>upon the Borders, was only to ſecure his perſon, and to remove the cauſe of your fears, rather than out of any deſire to proceed on in the Conqueſts which you pretended to make. Loſe not therefore, mighty Prince, ſuch a favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſucceed, which God offers to you; oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is bald, catch hold of her whiles you may: But if I have offended your Majeſty with the freedom of my diſcourſe, uſe me according to your pleaſure, I am your Slave, and here is my Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Speech of <hi>Odmar</hi> made <hi>Tamerlan</hi> ſad; he chang'd countenance often, but <hi>Odmar</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs continued on, being ſo much the more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by his zeal and affection for his Perſon and Glory. He repeated to him again the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, kiſſing the Hem of his Garment, as they uſe to do to the Emperours. The Prince, with his eyes fix'd upon him, told him, that this was the cauſe of his penſiveneſs, he was overcome with his affection and faithfulneſs, and was not in a power to reward him according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings; that in this particular he had found,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40153:32"/>
more than in any other thing, a ſign of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wiſdom, in that he had choſen <hi>Odmar</hi> to be near him, and aſſiſt him with his wiſe Counſels: That neceſſity, that made him caſt away all thoughts of reſt, taught him, that <hi>Soveraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> are like their <hi>Creator</hi> in this, that his Glory hath no limits, and conſiſts in action; that though he had flatter'd himſelf with the thoughts of reſting a while from his former labours, he now ſaw himſelf forc'd, unleſs he would renounce the new Laurels that waited for him, to prefer all the inconveniencies and troubles of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts of <hi>Cipribit,</hi> to the pleaſures and delights of <hi>Quinſay</hi>; that he was nevertheleſs reſolv'd to quit his firſt intentions. <hi>Alhacent</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſtorian declares, that he hath often heard <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> confeſs, that at this inſtant <hi>Odmar</hi> ſeem'd not to ſpeak to him as a mortal Man, but as a Meſſenger of God, whom he had ſent, to divert from him a miſchief that would have perhaps fallen upon him, and to give him an opportunity to increaſe his Glory.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the news of the Princes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to viſit the Emperour his Uncle ſpread every where, to the great ſatisfaction of many, who i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin'd that they ſhould alſo go and viſit their Parents and Country. But the next day he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the General Muſters of the whole Army, and ſpoke to his Souldiers in this manner.</p>

                           <p>WE had ſometimes ſince an intent, brave Souldiers, to go and aſſault the King of <hi>China,</hi> to oblige him to reſtore what he hath taken from the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> and recover the Lands beyond the Mountains which he hath uſurped upon us, to the great ſhame of our Nation, whoſe Glory we purpos'd to reſtore; but to our grief we have been hindered by the ſawcineſs of <hi>Calix,</hi> who forced us to return back to puniſh his inſolency. With the aſſiſtance of your Arms, and Invincible Courages, we have quenched the flames of the Rebellion that he had kindled with his blood, and with that of his Companions; I could have wiſh'd that this Victory had been rather upon Strangers, and a Foreign Nation, than upon our own unfaithful and rebellious ſubjects. In ſuch a caſe I had been as joyful, as when at my firſt appearance in Arms with you, we overcame the proud <hi>Muſcovites</hi>: I muſt confeſs I am more oblig'd to you for this, than for that, becauſe your courages and valour appeared more viſibly in this Civil War; for you were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with ſome as brave as your ſelves, you were to encounter with <hi>Tartarians,</hi> who had forgot what they were, their Allegiance to their Prince. I cannot call to mind this mournful paſſage without tears, I could willingly bury in Oblivion this unhappy Victory, though I have gain'd by it much honour; I mind you of it at preſent, only to make you underſtand, that I can never forget your faithfulneſs and ſervices, expreſſed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently in this occaſion. But we muſt not ſtop here, we muſt turn our Arms next againſt thoſe that think that we are loſt for ever; whereas we are victorious,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40153:33"/>
we muſt go to our Companions that wait for us, who have delayed the execution of their deſigns till they hear of our ſucceſſes, and victory; we muſt go and ſpend the Winter with them. All our Ammunitions are there, doubtleſs the ſleeping Enemy expects us not in this ſeaſon of the year; they reſt with confidence upon the weakneſs of our Troops, whoſe intent they i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine is only to defend themſelves, as not in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to aſſault them. You ſhall have double Pay to buy Cloaths, and arm your ſelves againſt the Cold; and I hope that with theſe new Garments we ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to our ſelves new honour and glory.</p>

               <p>As ſoon as his Diſcourſe was ended, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers cryed out with a loud voice, <hi>One God in Heaven, and one Emperour upon Earth.</hi> At the ſame time they bowed their Heads to him, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their reverence; and declared, that they would perform whatſoever the Prince ſhould command them. After this, every one went ſtrait to his Tent. The Army abode in the ſame place eight days without ſtirring, only <hi>Zamay</hi> was ſent with five and twenty thouſand Horſe, and fifty thouſand Foot to <hi>Zagatay,</hi> to ſecure that Kingdom. He ſent alſo an Expreſs to the Emperour his Uncle, to inform him of all his Reſolutions, and to intreat him in the Spring to ſend him fifty thouſand men, or thereabouts, to recruit his Army, with Money to pay his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and Ammunition of War, with proviſions for the Belly.</p>
               <p>Thus when he had given all neceſſary Orders, and caus'd publick Prayers to be made, according to Cuſtom, he commanded the Army to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Mountains.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Tamerlan<hi>'s</hi> Expedition againſt the King of <hi>China.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Provinces of <hi>Leaotum</hi> and of <hi>Pekin,</hi> which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> had taken from the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,</hi> were the Cauſes of that anger and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure which they could not diſſemble. They found themſelves by this means, and by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Wall of a vaſt length, built in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Mountains, deprived of the benefit of that Prey which they were wont to make in that Kingdom by their frequent Inroads. They always brought back Herds of Cattel, with which <hi>China</hi> abounds above all other places, becauſe of its good temperature, being neither too cold nor too hot. This Conſideration, together with that of their honour, engag'd in the recovery of the Provinces which the Emperour of the <hi>Tartarians</hi> eſteemed and valued at a high rate, obliged <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> to proſecute this Enterpriſe, to pleaſe his Uncle and new Subjects, and ſatisfie his own Paſſion.</p>
               <p>The Army march'd ſoftly to avoid weariſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in thirty Days got as far as <hi>Cipribit,</hi> where news came to them of <hi>Calibes,</hi> who was in his way to meet the Prince that entertain'd him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kindly. He told him of all his happy Succeſſes, and then, taking him aſide, he diſcover'd to him his deſign, and <hi>Calibes</hi> gave him an account of all that he had done againſt the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The next day the Prince took Horſe, and rid as far as <hi>Pazanfu,</hi> where <hi>Calibes</hi> Army was quarter'd:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40153:34"/>
They had often encounter'd with the <hi>Chineſes</hi> in Skirmiſhes, and ſmall Parties, and by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they had got, they judg'd themſelves better Souldiers than their Enemies in Courage and Skill. He cauſed them all to appear upon the <hi>Parade,</hi> going from one Rank to another he took notice of every Souldiers Countenance and Behaviour; he cauſed them to muſter next and receive their Pay; they return'd him Thanks, Acclamations, and Wiſhes for his health. When <hi>Calibes</hi> left his Army to go and meet <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> he had left the chief Command with the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who thought himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by this opportunity to give ſome Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Zeal and Courage. He went out with a ſmall party, and met with four thouſand Horſe, commanded by the Kings Brother of <hi>China.</hi> He drew them cunningly to the Fight, and charg'd them ſo vigorouſly and ſucceſsfully, that he broke their Order and put them to flight. The Night favour'd their Retreat; they left behind five or ſix hundred dead to pay for their Companions, and witneſs the Victory and Courage of the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> who return'd from this Encounter with many Horſes and other Spoils taken from theſe <hi>Barbarians. Tamerlan</hi> receiv'd him kindly, and careſs'd him in that obliging manner that his late generous Action had deſerved, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for he ſcarce ſuffered them to breathe. He was the Son of one of <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Siſters. His no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualities, as well as his Birth, gain'd him the Love and Reſpects of all men: He was yet but young, but he had already done great Services to his Prince, chiefly in that famous Battel againſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40153:35"/>
the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> where he commanded the Reer, for he was a good and experienced Commander. The Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> as we have repreſented him, out of an earneſt deſire of Glory, let ſlip no occaſion to manifeſt his Courage and Skill in Arms: As he was neareſt to the Enemy, he had an opportunity to diſcover in what places the Wall that ſtopt the <hi>Tartarians</hi> Inroads might be aſſaulted. He had ſent ſome Spies into <hi>China</hi> by ſecret and by-ways in the Mountains that are at the paſſage: From them he underſtood all that happened there; but his prudence had ſucceeded chiefly in winning, by his inſinuations, one of the greateſt Lords of the Mountains, named, <hi>The Lord of</hi> Vauchefu. This Lord was diſpleas'd with the paſſages of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> and <hi>Tartarians</hi> over his Ground, or rather he had been won with the picture that the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> had given him of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> and of his obliging diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. This caus'd him to change his Maſter, and make an agreement with the <hi>Tartars.</hi> He went and diſcovered his mind to him who had firſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to him of it, telling him, that he was ready to ſerve the Emperour, and aſſiſt his Army againſt the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> having kept this ſecret from <hi>Calibes,</hi> diſcover'd it firſt to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> who with great joy ſent for this Lord to ſpeak with him. He was mightily pleas'd with this invitation, and appointed a day for this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Enterview. <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> without moving his Army, went to viſit the Quarters of the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> near the River of <hi>Lanquenne</hi>; at the place appointed. The Lord of <hi>Vauchefeu</hi> came to him thither to pay him his reſpects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to offer him his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40153:35"/>
Services, with proteſtations of his faithfulneſs to his intereſt. The Prince, by his Interpreters, told him, that he would protect him againſt all his Enemies, and that he would give him ſuch Teſtimonies of his Love, that he ſhould never have cauſe to repent his kind offer; after this <hi>Vauchefu</hi> diſcover'd to him a ſecret paſſage that he knew, and leads into <hi>China,</hi> by which it was eaſie to go in and ſurpriſe the Souldiers that were to guard the Wall. That which troubled the Prince moſt, was that <hi>Calibes,</hi> an old and tryed Captain, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented this paſſage, after a diligent ſearch, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be won, and that it was kept with fifty thouſand of the beſt Souldiers of <hi>China</hi>; the King was there in perſon, and always on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, to oblige every one to be diligent and ready, and that the Forces he had there were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to guard the Wall againſt all the World, if it ſhould offer to be aſſaulted. The Prince gain'd this Lord by his kindneſs and gifts, which were the richeſt Furs of <hi>Tartary,</hi> many beautiful Horſes, and all the rareſt things that he had; with theſe he purchas'd his Affections, and oblig'd him to diſcover his mind in theſe terms. <hi>Know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, mighty Prince, that you will but trifle away the time, if you believe it poſſible by force of Arms alone to force and win the Wall which the</hi> Chineſes <hi>have built to hinder the Inroads of your Subjects; let your Courages be never ſo great; let them be heightened by your example, and the remembrance of your former Victories, and of the people that you have overcome; let them be never ſo obedient to your orders, which have obliged them to contemn the greateſt dangers, and death it ſelf: In a word, all the skill of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40153:36"/>
theſe worthy men, whom you alone are worthy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; all theſe advantages will not prevail againſt the Wall of the</hi> Chineſes, <hi>which is guarded by fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men of the beſt Souldiers, and which at the leaſt notice ſhall be aſſiſted by fifty thouſand more, commanded by</hi> Xianxi; <hi>and when you ſhall be engag'd in fight with them, weary and tyred out, the King himſelf will come with two hundred thouſand Horſe, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Foot to aſſault you. Suppoſe you ſhould beat him alſo, this cannot be without much Blood-ſhed on your ſide, and then it will not advantage you much. But to ſhew you, great Prince, that I am wholly yours, and that the Civilities and Reſpects of your People have won my heart, I will diſcover to you a way for fifty thouſand men whom I will lead into</hi> China <hi>my ſelf. They ſhall fall upon thoſe that guard the Wall before they are aware. In the mean whiles you ſhall with your Army aſſault a place that I will appoint, that your Souldiers may become Maſters of a Mountain over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Enemy, which will gall them, for when the</hi> Chineſes <hi>ſhall ſee that they are aſſaulted behind and before, they will no longer guard the Wall, but will ſuffer you to enter and aſſiſt thoſe that I ſhall lead in; and for your ſecurity, and my fidelity which I promiſe, I will give you my only Son in hoſtage, together with two young Daughters, and my Wife; and for my Brother, I am perſwaded he will follow my directions, and ſerve you every where as affectionately as my ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this Lord had ended his diſcourſe, the Prince was wonderfully ſatisfied, and began to hope that his deſign would take effect, but he deſired that the buſineſs ſhould be managed ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, that he ſuffered not the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> to know by what means the Lord of <hi>Vauchefeu</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:40153:36"/>
would give an entry into <hi>China</hi> to his men; none was admitted to his Conference but only an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter.</p>
               <p>This Lord went away very well contented with his gifts, and <hi>Tamerlan's</hi> Kindneſs and reſpects to him. The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> had orders to conduct and guard him with all poſſible honour and civility. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> likewiſe return'd to his head Quarters. The next day he diſcover'd all the Plot to <hi>Odmar,</hi> but before he would venture upon the Execution, he deſired to underſtand from <hi>Calibes</hi> what he had learned concerning the intentions and preparations of the <hi>Chineſes</hi>; in obedience to his Command he ſpoke to him in this manner. <hi>Worthy Prince, I am ready to put in execution, without examining, all your Commands, as your moſt obedient ſlave; if therefore you deſire from me to know what I have underſtood concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of</hi> China, <hi>having had ſufficient time to learn, during ſix Months that I commanded your Armies upon the Borders, to defend them againſt the Inroads of the Enemies, I muſt tell you, that the King of</hi> China, <hi>that reigns now, is a Prince of a great reputation, gain'd by his inlarging the limits of his Empire, more than any of his Predeceſſors before him; He is proud and inſolent, for he names himſelf</hi> The Lord of the World, <hi>but all his ſtrength conſiſts in the defence and guarding of this famous Wall which ſtops us here. I confeſs 'tis great, and is as I judge guarded by fifty or threeſcore thouſand men in Garriſon along theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. They are the beſt Souldiers of the Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that I judge it not poſſible to force away through, without endangering your whole Army; I have heard that about the Lake of</hi> Hogeen <hi>there is an eaſie
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40153:37"/>
way to go into that Kingdom, but we muſt march ſeven or eight days to it, and go through ſtrait paſſages long and tedious for ſo numerous an Army as yours is; ſo that the King of</hi> China <hi>would have time to provide for his defence. He thinks at preſent that none oppoſes him but I alone; and that I am here but only to defend the Country, by your orders; for my part I think that it is the beſt for you to direct your courſe that way; it is doubtleſs the moſt ſecure for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of Proviſions, the ſtrength of War, and of an Army, without which there is no marching to a Fight with Courage: This, noble Prince, is my judgment of that you deſire to know of me, I cannot diſcourſe of the Country till we enter into it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince, who knew more, liſtened with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and diſcovered nothing to him, nor any body elſe about him, of that which he had diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Lord of <hi>Vauchefu.</hi> When every one had ſpoken his mind, he anſwer'd, That the great God whoſe Glory he maintain'd againſt ſuch wicked Idolaters, would aſſiſt his good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtrengthen the Courages of his Souldiers, and would facilitate that which they look'd upon to be difficult or impoſſible. In this manner the Prince diſcover'd his deſigns, and the ſtrength of his Army, which conſiſted more in cunning than in courage, more in the Foxes Taile than in the Lions Skin.</p>
               <p>Thus the Emperour craftily concealed the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured means that he had to open a paſſage to his Enemies, that being ignorant of the facility to overcome them, they might aſcribe the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to his conduct alone; and by that means that his Reputation might be more increas'd, and his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40153:37"/>
Wiſdom, Skill and Courage more eſteem'd. But before he attempted this great deſign he gave rich preſents to the Kings, Princes, and Lords that were there with him, to win them; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed next the Rendezvous of his Army.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as it was together in one Body, he drew out fifty thouſand men of his beſt Troops, making the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> their Captain, and gave him for Aſſiſtant <hi>Axalla,</hi> the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Commander, faithful and courageous for his intereſt, he deſired the Prince to act no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without his advice, and to believe him in every thing.</p>
               <p>At the Day of the departure, the Lord of <hi>Vauchefu</hi> came with his Brother to meet the Emperour; they aſſur'd him that the ſucceſs would anſwer his expectation; for they had been to viſit the way which was to be forc'd, and that led into the Kingdom of <hi>China</hi>; they had found it as unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided as they expected. The Prince, after a ſhort Conference upon the place, reſolved to march in perſon with all his Army and draw near to this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Wall over againſt <hi>Quaquifou,</hi> whiles the fifty thouſand choſen men, commanded by the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> and <hi>Axalla,</hi> ſhould gain the paſſage into the Country in that order that he had preſcribed to them; which was, that <hi>Axalla</hi> ſhould lead twenty thouſand men in the <hi>Van,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> ſhould follow in the Reer with thirty thouſand, and that each Party ſhould have with them one of the Lords of <hi>China</hi> to guide them, that the Enterpriſe might be the eaſier. After this, they left the Prince and march'd ten Leagues to the paſſage, which they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40153:38"/>
took without reſiſtance; a little while they ſtopt there to reſt themſelves, and then went on ten Leagues farther, to the place where the <hi>Chineſes</hi> were to guard the Wall. They never dream'd of any ſuch ſurpriſe, but minded only thoſe that were commanded by <hi>Tamerlan</hi>; they hop'd well that the great advantages which they had would enable them to repell all the aſſaults of <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army. They found themſelves deceived and at a loſs, for no ſooner did the Prince's Army draw near to their Walls, but they ſaw at the ſame time <hi>Axalla</hi> coming to them by another way, with twenty thouſand men, ſeconded by the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> with another Body. They went directly to aſſault them, but the <hi>Chineſes</hi> in that urgent occaſion, divided their Army, and unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Wall, which gave an opportunity to <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> to win it with his Infantry which he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that day; he made ſuch ſpeed, that the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes</hi> found themſelves on a ſudden encompaſſed about with two Armies, when <hi>Axalla</hi> begun the onſet. The Battel was Bloody, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> were totally routed by this noble Chriſtian, before the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> with his Troops could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, ſo weak was the Enemies reſiſtance. This Victory enrich'd all the Souldiers of <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>'s Army, for they found much Gold about them, upon their Clothes, Arms, and Horſes; one of the King of <hi>China</hi>'s Kinſmen, who was ſtiled King, was taken Priſoner, with the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders that were ſaved from the furious ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which was made amongſt them.</p>
               <p>The ſadneſs of this overthrow ſpread every where, and ſoon came to the Ears of the King
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40153:38"/>
of <hi>China,</hi> who was then at <hi>Quanton.</hi> It filled all his Court with Sorrow, Diſpleaſure and Fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every one wept for his Friend, or his Relation; but this Prince, who had always till then thought himſelf the happieſt of all men, was inwardly ſurpris'd, without diſcovering himſelf to any of his Court, as a man that commanded himſelf and his paſſions; he gave orders to gather his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from all Parts, and ſent for his Prieſts that kept his holy things, commanding them, as their Lord, in a paſſionate manner, to offer Sacrifices for him to the Gods, and chiefly to the Sun, the greateſt of the Gods, whom they think to be immortal, impaſſible, the Cauſe and Author of their Beings, that appears to men only for their benefit; he ſent likewiſe his orders round about the Neighbouring Provinces of his Empire, to call together all that were able to bear Arms, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing them their Rendezvous at <hi>Pekin</hi>: He imagined that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> would direct his courſe that way, for it was the next City to his Camp; and the great Lord of <hi>China,</hi> called the <hi>Xianxi,</hi> fail'd not to be ready with his fifty thouſand Men to ſtrengthen ſuch as were to guard the Wall. He haſted to oppoſe <hi>Tamerlan</hi> in his March into the Country, and as his Men were all Horſe, well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the By-ways and narrow Paſſages, they were a continual plague to <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army. This wiſe Prince, to ſecure his retreat, caus'd the Wall, and all the Forts that were there builded to be demoliſhed, that the paſſages might be open, for the Garriſons they had all ſubmitted themſelves to the Conquerour after the Victory. He treated the people of the Mountains ſo lovingly, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40153:39"/>
he caus'd them almoſt to forget that they were under a new Lord.</p>
               <p>He rewarded well the Lord <hi>Vauchefu,</hi> by giving a little County wherein were ſeven good Towns, as <hi>Archii, Ymulii, Faliſq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>iem, Fulii, Cohenſin, Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alii, Pulii</hi> and <hi>Quiamlu,</hi> all which were adjoining to this Lords former Territories; ſo that the Inhabitants were ſo much the more willing to obey him. He made him alſo Governour of the Province next to that of the <hi>Xianxi,</hi> and declared to him, by his liberality, that he was a Prince of his word; his Brother he intended afterwards to gratifie.</p>
               <p>This kind dealing of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to him, in making way for his ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conqueſts; for he that will ſubdue Kingdoms and Lands with eaſe, muſt firſt conquer the hearts of the Inhabitants. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> are great admirers of thoſe vertues that are not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by them, as of Love, Affability, Kindneſs and Mercy, which <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Souldiers were ordered to expreſs to them, and which is contrary to that cruel dealing with which they uſe to treat their Enemies that fall into their hands; this Cuſtom they borrow from the <hi>Indians</hi> their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>When therefore they ſaw that this Prince handled them in a manner contrary to theirs, and that he expreſſed ſo much affection for them, they began to admire and honour him.</p>
               <p>After the deſtruction of the Forts, <hi>Tamerlan</hi> took advice which way he ſhould march with his Army: He had heard that the King of <hi>China</hi> had furniſhed his ſtrong places, and that with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men as he could gather together he was in his way to meet and fight him. This news caus'd him to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40153:39"/>
be not well reſolved what courſe to take; firſt whether he ſhould aſſault a Town in ſight of ſo powerful an Army, or whether he ſhould leave behind him places unconquer'd, which might cut off all his Proviſions, and march directly to fight the King of <hi>China</hi>'s numerous Army. In this ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolution he deſired to know his Officers minds; He called them together, and propos'd to them the buſineſs, which could not be quickly reſolved, becauſe of the diverſity of opinions; but at laſt this advice prevailed above the reſt, that no Town was to be left behind; that they were to make ſpeed and take it before the Battel, that the Army might draw from thence Comfort, Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Proviſions, and that in caſe the Enemy would be ſo bold as to offer to relieve it, that then they would hazard a Battel; for this is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary practice of a Conquerour and Aſſailant, to venture a fight with the Enemy, as it is the wiſdom of the aſſaulted to decline it, and never to yield to it but in neceſſity; for by delays and light skirmiſhes, and without engaging in a whole Body, the Conquerour and Aſſailant is weaken'd and tyred out; and by this means Fortune is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes forc'd to declare for him, and ſide with the aſſaulted.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>China</hi> ought in reaſon to have taken this courſe, if he had been well adviſed, but his ill fortune ſuffered him not, as we ſhall ſee by the following Relation.</p>
               <p>This deſign to march forward being reſolved upon in a Council of War, the Army went ſtreight to <hi>Pekin</hi> to lay ſiege to it. This is a great, rich, and populous Town, well walled, and adorned
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40153:40"/>
with many ſtately Structures. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> thought that the King of <hi>China</hi> would rather venture a Battel than loſe this City out of his hands. He flatter'd himſelf with the hopes of winning it, and the victory at once; for the wonderful riches that were in it encouraged the greedy Souldiers to venture their lives boldly, chiefly the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> who are unſatiable for Prey and Plunder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Odmar</hi> was order'd to march forward with fourteen thouſand Horſe to ſurround it, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the importation of Proviſions, that they might be uſeful to their own Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> was appointed to follow him with all the Infantry, amounting to one hundred and fifty thouſand Men, which he commanded as chief Collonel. This Office, given to him as a reward of his former ſervices, caus'd him to be look'd upon both in the Army and in the Court. <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> followed next with all his Horſe, and with his Engines, his Artillery and Ammunitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Odmar</hi> went the firſt day twenty Leagues; ſo that when he came to the Walls of <hi>Pekin,</hi> the Citizens expected their King before the <hi>Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> He took into his cuſtody all the Beaſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and ſeated himſelf in a convenient place, to wait for the coming of the whole Army, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City between himſelf and them.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, to affright the Enemy and learn news, he ſent many Parties abroad; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three or four days after the Infantry, led by <hi>Axalla,</hi> came to him: They ſent then their Summons into the Town, to command them to yield; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, That the Citizens ſhould otherwiſe ſuffer all the Calamities that uſually happen in caſes of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40153:40"/>
reſiſtance, when they are overcome. They return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this anſwer, <hi>That they would live and dye faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects to their Prince.</hi> This ſtrong reſolution proceeded from a new Colony that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> had ſetled there of their own people, after they had driven away the ancient Inhabitants, who forty years before had been conquered by the Father of the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and were his Subjects; ſo that in the City there was no remembrance of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Empire, but in the Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout they had a love for their old Maſters; for the Deputies of the little Towns came to ſubmit themſelves to <hi>Tamerlan.</hi> This caus'd his Army to be full of all manner of Proviſions, and in ſuch plenty, that in the Province of <hi>Catay</hi> they could not have more; this gave him great hopes and aſſurance of the ſucceſs of his Enterpriſe; for without doubt the want of Proviſions and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is the ruine of the greateſt Armies, and that which diſappoints their moſt likely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
               <p>Thus the large and proud City of <hi>Pekin</hi> was regularly beſieged, and our Infantry commanded to draw near the Walls round about within a Muſquet ſhot. This dreadful ſight of ſo many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies affrighted neither the Citizens nor the Garriſon: <hi>Tamerlan</hi> left nothing unattempted to reduce them, and they uſed their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to defend themſelves, as much as could be expected from brave and reſolute men.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Axalla</hi> went to view a Suburb encompaſſed about with a Wall about half a League round; when he had ſeen it, he wiſely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that the keeping of it would not be eaſie for

the Inhabitants, who would hazard too much in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it; he reſolved therefore to aſſault it in the Night, when he had firſt told the Prince: All his men were ready at the firſt Watch, with their Ladders and needful Weapons: When the time was come, the Aſſault was made in ſeveral places, and the <hi>Tartars</hi> were beaten of; but at laſt <hi>Axalla</hi> enter'd the Suburbs, and cut in pieces all that were found in Arms, about eight thouſand men; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Souldiers were killed, before the Walls, in the place where they expected them moſt likely to enter, but in that which they won ſcarce any body was killed on their ſide. The Plunder was rich, and given to the Souldiers. This loſs, together with the Courages of our men, terrified the Inhabitants of the City, and ſurpriſed them ſtrangely; ſo that then they began to deſpair of their ſafety, of which they doubted not before. They found themſelves diſappointed in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the coming of their Prince, who had promis'd to be with them in fifteen days, which were expired. They ſaw this dreadful Army gaining every day Ground upon them, and in a Poſt that commanded their City, and from whence with the Artillery they intended and were preparing to batter it. Theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations funk deep into many timerous Souls of the chief of the Town, who deſired more to gain the favour of the Conquerour, by yielding in time, than to deſerve his diſpleaſure by a long, a fruitleſs, and too obſtinate a reſiſtance. But the Governour, a great Lord of the Country, well reſpected by his Prince, aſſur'd them that the King was at hand, that he would not fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40153:42"/>
and ſuccour them in due time; that they were not yet in any great danger; that the City was yet theirs; that the loſs of one of its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs was their advantage rather than a loſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe the keeping of it was difficult and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; that now all their Forces were together to defend themſelves, and beat off the Enemy; that for his part he was fully reſolved to hazard his Eſtate and Life, and give his Prince all the ſigns that he could deſire of his Courage and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe coming from ſuch a noble and worthy perſon, who acted himſelf what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from them, made a great impreſſion upon the minds of the people, and obliged them all to return to defend their Walls, with a reſolution to bury themſelves in the ruines of their City, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to yield baſely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pekin</hi> is a large Town, of a difficult acceſs, ſcituate in a plain, ſurrounded with Mountains at a conſiderable diſtance: There is only a Hill on the North-ſide which is nigh the Walls; a River runs at the Foot of this Hill, and near to it are the Suburbs that were ſtorm'd; ſo that on that ſide it was not eaſie to relieve the City, or put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it any ſuccours, becauſe the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army commanded all the paſſages of the Mountains, which were of old the Borders of <hi>China,</hi> when <hi>Pekin</hi> belong'd to <hi>Tartary,</hi> and ſerv'd as a Bridle to ſtop the Inroads of the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> They had no other way to ſuccour the Town but along the River, over which the <hi>Tartars</hi> had built many Bridges, for the conveniency of their Army, that kept the paſſages of the Mountains; ſo that it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40153:43"/>
was impoſſible for the <hi>Chineſes</hi> to relieve the Town, without the hazard of a Battel, which <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> deſired, and which ſhould be the aim of all Conquerours in his Power and Condition. In this poſture, the Army being paſſed before the City, <hi>Odmar, Calibes</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> were often ſent out with Parties into the Country, to learn and underſtand ſomething of the Enemy, and to cauſe the Cavalry to ſubſiſt the better, and keep the Proviſions in the Camp for a greater neceſſity: Beſides, the Souldiers were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to provide themſelves before-hand with great ſtores of Victuals, that they might be better able to ſubſiſt, and not be obliged to raiſe the ſiege for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny want, in caſe the Enemy did offer to beſet them. This caus'd them to plunder ſeveral ſmall Towns that would not bring them in Proviſions; ſo that though the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army was numerous they had plenty of all things.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the <hi>Chineſes</hi> were more in number and ſtronger, advancing towards us by little and little. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> intended to meet them himſelf with his Cavalry, and to leave the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of his Infantry before the City, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the ſiege, which he proſecuted vigorouſly; but the Inhabitants reſiſted and fought with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. But to trie once more to win the Walls, he commanded to plant againſt it all his Engines of War, and to make a breach, that his Souldiers might come to a handy-fight, and aſſault the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with more eaſe. This proceeding waken'd the reſolutions of the beſieged, and terrified them wonderfully; chiefly a Mount which was raiſed upon ſome ruines about a Bow-ſhot from the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40153:43"/>
Walls, upon an high place: From thence the <hi>Tartars</hi> ſaw and diſcover'd the Guards within, and ſhot into the City, ſo that by day none dar'd appear upon the Walls. This inconveniency ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd them to watch and work more carefully in their own preſervation. For that purpoſe they began to retrench themſelves, to ſecure their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by a Wall that was to be two and twenty Foot high, as many broad, and fifty Foot in length: As ſoon as the Beſiegers perceived it, they thought it not convenient to ſtay till this work ſhould be finiſhed, but rather to try Fortune, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by an aſſault to win the Walls.</p>
               <p>In proſecution of this deſign and reſolution, the Prince ſent for <hi>Axalla</hi> into his own Quarters, becauſe it concern'd him moſt, in regard of his Office, and becauſe during this ſiege he had been moſt active, he told him his intentions, deſiring him to prepare himſelf and his men for the next morning. As ſoon as <hi>Axalla</hi> had drawn out his Souldiers, he aſſaulted the Wall, which was ſtoutly defended by the beſieged; but at laſt this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Valour, aſſiſted by twenty thouſand of his Men, took it by force, and fortified himſelf there. He could ſcarce keep back his Souldiers in their heat and fury from breaking in further; according to the commands of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> which he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to give, for two reaſons: Firſt, becauſe he did not deſire that the City ſhould be won by aſſault, for it was rich and full of all good things; he was therefore afraid that the Enemies Army ſhould come at that Inſtant when his Souldiers were buſie in plundering the houſes, which would have cauſed their utter overthrow; for rich Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40153:44"/>
who have much to loſe, can never fight well: Secondly he ſtopt his men from taking the City by aſſault, becauſe he intended to make of it a Magazine to furniſh his Army, and carry on his deſigns with greater ſecurity.</p>
               <p>The loſs of the Wall abated not the Courages of the beſieged; they defended themſelves as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately and bravely as before, in hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſpeedily ſome ſuccours from their King, who was near at hand as they were rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. But in their greateſt expectations, the accident of a ſhot caſt from one of the Engines, which ſtruck down a piece of Wood and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Governour dangerouſly, caus'd them to loſe their Courages. This worthy perſon, ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate to his Prince and Country, died of this Wound a few hours after, leaving his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers without heart or reſolution; for this brave Commander, by his example and perſwaſions, obliged them to hold out ſo long. This unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected accident forc'd them to conſent to a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Emperour, before he ſhould hear any news of their misfortune, and of the loſs of the numbers of men who had been killed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Wall. They expected better and more honourable Articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> began to be weary with the long ſiege, eight days were ſpent ſince the laſt aſſault, and he ſaw no change in the Citizens reſolutions, and underſtood not that the King of <hi>China</hi> made any haſte to fight him; but when the King heard the Governour of <hi>Pekin</hi> was kill'd, he was afraid of the conſequence; this made him draw towards the Beſiegers with more ſpeed with his Army in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40153:44"/>
Battel. <hi>Axalla,</hi> who lodged upon the Wall, perceived the Enemy firſt: he went therefore to inform the Prince, he rejoyced to hear ſuch good news, but his joy was much more increaſed when he ſaw the Deputies of the City, who came to yield themſelves and their City into his hands. The Emperour receiv'd them with his wonted kindneſs, promiſing the Inhabitants his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they would continue to him faithful, but he threatned them with ſevere puniſhments, if they offer'd to revolt.</p>
               <p>The Articles were agreed to, the Garriſon, in number about eighteen thouſand men, went out, they were the remainder of thirty thouſand in the beginning of the ſiege, which laſted two full Months. The Citizens were confirmed in all their priviledges, and were mightily taken and enamoured with the ſweet and loving diſpoſition of their new Lord.</p>
               <p>At this ſame time the King of <hi>China,</hi> who was at hand with all his Army, underſtood that the City was delivered up by the Garriſon that he met in his way. The Lieutenant Governour he commanded to be executed, with many Captains, for their Cowardice, but he pardonned the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who were not ſo guilty. He commanded all his Army to ſtop their march in the very place where he received the news of this Cities ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, thinking more convenient to wait for <hi>Tamerlan</hi> there in a Ground that lay well for his Forces to draw up. The <hi>Tartars</hi> ſpent eight days in repairing the breaches, and furniſhing the Town with all neceſſaries fit to abide a ſiege, whatever happened. The Emperour alſo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40153:45"/>
his whole Army, paid off his Souldiers, increaſed their Wages, and rewarded every man according to his deſervings: he aſcribed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this Conqueſt, ſo conſiderable, to the cares and wiſe conduct of <hi>Axalla,</hi> therefore he offer'd him the Government over this City and the Country which he had already conquered; but he very fairly refuſed it, deſiring the Prince to beſtow it upon ſome other Body, becauſe he deſired no other reward but to bear a ſhare in the labours of his Maſter, whoſe Glory ſhould be his chief aim and deſire. This anſwer pleaſed the Prince, for he had offer'd it to him, only becauſe he had well deſerved it, but he was not willing that he ſhould take it; for he was deſirous to have him always nigh his perſon, knowing that he was courageous, faithful and ingenious, and well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the Affairs of War: When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd it, the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> accepted it, with the Title of <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> having ſet all things in good order, and diſpatched ſome Meſſengers to the Emperour his Uncle, and all his Friends to inform them of his happy ſucceſſes, and ſatisfied his Souldiers, who were ten thouſand men leſs than before, he caus'd Prayers ſolemnly to be offer'd up to the God of Hoſts during a whole day. After this he march'd to find the Enemy, who was with all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of his Subjects and Allies at <hi>Sinteh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> As ſoon as the King of <hi>China</hi> had underſtood that our Army was paſſed over the River of <hi>Culifu,</hi> he caus'd it to be proclaimed all over his Camp, that every one ſhould be ready to fight, for he did not deſire to ſee the <hi>Tartarians</hi> farther in his Country,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40153:45"/>
to eat it up and deſtroy it. But there was no Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in that reſolution, for it caus'd him to loſe his own advantages, and run head-long into the miſchief that was at hand; for had he lengthened the War as he ought, the many and ſtrong Towns, which were to be beſieged one after another, would have undermined <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army, and render'd it unable to ſtand againſt his freſh Troops; and for the <hi>Tartars,</hi> they could not in reaſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſo far as to leave behind them any one Town, which might have cut off their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. Reaſon and Juſtice obliges Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of an Army to deal in this manner, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they may ſoon deſtroy the moſt flouriſhing Army.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Emperour could not but ſay, privately to ſome about him, not in a boaſting manner, for he never us'd to boaſt of the greateſt advantages that he hath had over his Enemies, <hi>That the King of</hi> China <hi>was ill adviſed to deſire a Battel; that he would doubtleſs have cauſe to repent of this folly at his leiſure, becauſe his Souldiers were not to be compared to his Men in Strength and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the King of <hi>China</hi> underſtood that the <hi>Tartars</hi> were marching towards him, he advanc'd with his Army to meet them, in ſuch a glorious manner, as if he had intended only to ſhew them his Grandeur and Riches. Nothing appear'd to the Eye but Gold and Silver in his Army, and the Chariot, upon which he was mounted, was ſo beſet with Diamonds, Rubies and Pearls, that it was not poſſible ſtedfaſtly to fix the Eye upon it in the Sun.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:40153:46"/>This Prince, of about thirty three years old, had been brought up from his infancy in the delights and pleaſures of the Court, and not in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the War, which requires a Body inur'd to pains, and hardened againſt the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Seaſons. He was in his diſcourſes inſolent, from his Mouth drop'd nothing but Threatnings, Words of Contempt and Defiance, complaining that he had been ſurpris'd by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and engag'd in a War without notice given, as it is the Cuſtom of his people: Three or four of his Neighbouring Kings accompanied him in the ſame State and Splendour; ſo that the hopes of ſuch rich Spoils as were to be gotten with the Victory, ſtrangely encouraged the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Souldiers to behave themſelves like men.</p>
               <p>Whiles the two Armies were drawing nearer together, <hi>Tamerlan</hi> took the Town of <hi>Thiauchevoi</hi> in his march, which happened to be very uſeful to his Army, in regard of its good ſcituation in the midſt of Waters and Paſture Grounds for Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, ſo that when <hi>Tamerlan</hi> ſaw it firſt, he reſolved to pitch there his Tents, and ſee whether the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy would have ſo much boldneſs to attempt upon him in that place that would prove diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to him. To engage the <hi>Chineſes</hi> the ſooner to a Battel he ſent them a defiance, and at the ſame time laid ſiege to <hi>Panihu,</hi> which was a little behind him. This Town was ſtrong and well furniſhed with a ſtout Garriſon; <hi>Panihu</hi> was diſtant from <hi>Thiachevoi</hi> about ten Leagues, ſo that it had not been convenient for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to return and aſſault it himſelf, for then he had been forc'd to turn his Back to the Enemy;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40153:46"/>
he judg'd it therefore more fit for him to beſet it with his Troops of Horſe, for theſe two Reaſons; Firſt, to hinder the Enemy from breaking in upon his Army; and next, that he might with more eaſe approach nearer to the King of <hi>China</hi> But this Precaution was not needful, nor the Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that happen'd thereupon; for when <hi>Odmar</hi> was return'd, he aſſur'd him, that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> were within a Days March, and that in all likely-hood the Battel would be the Day following.</p>
               <p>At this news the Prince ſends for <hi>Calibes,</hi> who was with ten thouſand Horſe before <hi>Panihu,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to come to him with ſpeed. In the mean while he was careful to provide all things needful, and to ſeek his advantages to win the Victory.</p>
               <p>The Army advanc'd ſoftly within a League of <hi>Thiauchevoi</hi>; and the next day underſtood for certain, that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> were in their march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. The Emperour, with a merry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as ſoon as he had acquainted <hi>Odmar</hi> with the Order that he intended to obſerve, and drawn up his Men in the Field that he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, look'd upon the Enemy in their march, at the head of ſix thouſand Horſe, with which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd before his Army, having <hi>Calibes</hi> with him. He uſed thus to view the Enemy himſelf, without truſting to other Mens Eyes. He endeavour'd to draw them into the Field, where his Army was ready for the Battel. When he had well conſidered this vaſt Army, he commanded <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi> as ſoon as he ſhould be aſſaulted, to retreat back in good order, and draw the <hi>Chineſes</hi> nearer to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Troops. He returned after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40153:47"/>
to his Army to prepare them for the fight, diſpoſing of his Infantry upon the decline of the Hill with their Artillery to defend them. They were in number ſixſcore thouſand men, armed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Chriſtians faſhion, under ſeveral Captains who obeyed <hi>Axalla</hi> as their Lieutenant-General.</p>
               <p>The Cavalry was drawn up in a plain Ground, having their Enemy at their right hand, and their Infantry at the left to withdraw towards it in caſe of neceſſity. They were in number fourſcore thouſand Horſe. <hi>Cali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>es,</hi> with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> led the Van: He was to command thirty thouſand divided into three Bodies of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand a-piece, who had orders to join to him as ſoon as he ſhould have drawn the Enemy into the Field, according to the Prince's Orders. <hi>Odmar</hi> was commanded to ſecond him with thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more, and <hi>Tamerlan</hi> led the Reer, which he placed near one of the Wings of the Foot, which he look'd upon as the chief ſtrength of his Army.</p>
               <p>His intention was to let thoſe threeſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe begin the Battel, led on by thoſe two great Commanders: He hop'd, when they ſhould have broken the Enemy, or ſhaken them, he would quickly defeat them. He commanded them therefore to advance forward, ſtaying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind with his Infantry, and twenty thouſand choſen Horſe, able to win another Battel, if his Men had been beaten. When theſe things were thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, <hi>Calibes,</hi> by retreating from the Enemy, drew them on forward, but ſometimes he charg'd them home. It was a beautiful ſight to behold
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40153:47"/>
that great Army ſtronger than ours, full of arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chariots, with which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> expected to get a great advantage over <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> were full of Gold and Silver, their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, Horſes and Cloths, were ſo loaden, that the <hi>Tartars</hi> had juſt cauſe to wonder.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Emperour's Eye was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where; he was well pleaſed to ſee <hi>Calibes</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his Orders ſo punctually, and to behold the <hi>Chineſes</hi> draw towards him in good order. He endeavour'd to underſtand in what place their King was; for that purpoſe he had near him the Lord of <hi>Vauchefu,</hi> who was well acquainted with their Rules and Manners. This Lord caus'd the Prince to take notice that they had but one Body which was not divided into Van and Reer, and that the King was in the middle of his Chariots and Infantry. Upon this <hi>Tamerlan</hi> turn'd back to his Men, telling them, <hi>That they muſt ſcatter that Golden Cloud, and that the King of</hi> China <hi>muſt give them a ſhare of his Riches.</hi> As ſoon as he had ſpoken theſe words, he gave not time to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to reſt after a march of a long League, but ſent order to <hi>Calibes</hi> to begin to charge with his Van-guard, and that he ſhould ſend back his ten thouſand wearied Horſe to him. <hi>Calibes</hi> could not prevail upon them to retreat, but they, as ſoon as the ſignal was given, deſired earneſtly to go in the Front, and give the firſt On-ſet, under the Command of a young Lord named <hi>Ziocoatanes.</hi> This Lord charg'd the formoſt of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> Army ſo ſtoutly, that he made them give back. The Battel was Bloody, for every one endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſhew his Courage, and fight for the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40153:48"/>
honour of their Prince, and the ſafety of their Nation. In an hours time it was not known which Party had got the advantage; but at laſt, when <hi>Calibes</hi> had been wounded; and his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons broken, the Enemy for a time ſeem'd to have won the Victory.</p>
               <p>The Prince, who was an Eye-witneſs of this firſt charge, before he withdrew back to his Reer, ſaw this diſhonour without any alteration in his Countenance: His mind was ſo ſetled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in proſperity and adverſity, he only ſaid, That the vaſt numbers of his Enemy, though in a Confuſion, had oppreſs'd the courages of his men.</p>
               <p>Theſe thirty thouſand Horſe already defeated were almoſt all <hi>Tartarians,</hi> that fight not in the ſame manner as the <hi>Parthians,</hi> nor in that good order. Two thouſand of them retreated with their wounded Commander behind the Prince, who cauſed his Wound to be ſearch'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and ordered him to go back behind his Infantry with the other wounded Men, where a great many other <hi>Tartars</hi> rallied.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Calibes</hi> could not perform with the <hi>Tartars, Odmar</hi> did with the <hi>Parthians</hi>; he charg'd and broke into the Enemies with that fury, that he made a way through their whole Army, and afterwards fell upon one of their Wings, forcing them to retreat to their Chariots where the King was in perſon. It had been wiſdom to ſtop there, or turn another way, but his fury made him think nothing impoſſible for his Courage to perform: this perſwaſion caus'd him to aſſault that dreadful Barricade that kept in the King of <hi>China,</hi> who
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40153:48"/>
had march'd forward to help his Cavalry in their Retreat, and obliged them to rally after they had been broken by <hi>Odmar.</hi> But in this Attempt he found a ſtrong reſiſtance, and loſt a great many Men to no purpoſe. This cauſed him to ſtop his Men, and ſend to the Prince for Infantry and Artillery, with which he aſſur'd him that he ſhould gain the Victory. At this news the Prince commanded his Party to ſtand, and ſent him fifty thouſand Foot, with ſome of his Artillery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of <hi>Axalla,</hi> whom he had order'd to force the Barricado of Chariots. This brave Captain with all ſpeed march'd up to <hi>Odmar,</hi> and having put his Artillery in the Front, with which he caus'd ſuch a diſorder amongſt the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots that their Governours oblig'd the King to fight the <hi>Tartars.</hi> He had an hundred and fifty thouſand Men about his Perſon, but <hi>Axalla</hi> was not terrified with this vaſt number of Enemies; he was thereby more encouraged to fight, ſo that he was never obſerv'd to have behaved himſelf more bravely, and with greater ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Odmar</hi> ſlept not, he knew that the Kings Cavalry that he had broken were rallied behind their Body of Foot; he charg'd them again afreſh, ſcatter'd and put them to flight.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time <hi>Tamerlan</hi> came in with a choiſe Body of Horſe, and the reſt of his Infantry which he had commanded to advance to ſuccour <hi>Axalla</hi>; without any delay he charg'd and cut all in pieces that ſtood before him, getting as far as the ſecond Barricado of Chariots, where the King of <hi>China</hi> was with forty thouſand Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40153:49"/>
Here the Fight was cruel for two or three hours, every one ſtriving to overcome; but at laſt the Reſerve of Horſe with which the Prince had charg'd ſo vigorouſly, aſſiſting the Foot in good time, got the Victory, and put the <hi>Chineſes</hi> to flight.</p>
               <p>The Day was won in this manner, after a bloody Fight of eight hours; the Night put a ſtop to the Slaughter, and favour'd the <hi>Chineſes</hi> in their Retreat. Their Camp was taken and plunder'd by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> the King himſelf wounded with an Arrow in the Arm became a Priſoner; two Kings that aſſiſted him loſt their Lives in the Hurly-burly, and two others were taken with him.</p>
               <p>This compleat Victory enrich'd the Souldiers with Plunder. The Spoils were infinite and ineſtimable, nothing but Precious Stones, and Veſſels of Gold and Silver appear'd every where, with ſuch rich and beautiful Chariots that they could not be too much admir'd.</p>
               <p>After this happy ſucceſs the Prince rode round about the Field, as well to hinder more Effuſion of Blood, as to rally his Men and place his Guards; he unburden'd himſelf of the reſt of his cares up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Axalla,</hi> leaving the King of <hi>China</hi> in his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody in the middle of his Infantry. He intended to ſee him the next day, in the mean whiles he gave order to have him cured of his Wound, and well treated.</p>
               <p>There was nothing more beautiful to the Eye than the rich Armour which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> had put on that day, and the many Ornaments with which they had trimmed themſelves; for the diverſity
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40153:49"/>
of colours yielded at a diſtance, the moſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying proſpect in the World. Their Army was more numerous than the <hi>Tartars,</hi> but they had neither the dexterity nor the courage of <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Men. They ſay, that the King had in the Field three hundred and fifty thouſand Horſe, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Foot; but the moſt part of them were unskilful Brutes, who ſuffer'd themſelves to be butcher'd without reſiſtance, and without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of their Numbers; for they had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Art of War, or ſo little that they were not much the better for it. Threeſcore thouſand Men died in this Battle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> gave his orders for the burying of the dead, and for thanks to be given to God for the Victory; afterwards he caus'd all the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be carefully healed, of both Armies. He went to viſit <hi>Calibes,</hi> who was ill with the Infection of the Air, and of a Wound, which hinder'd him not from performing his duty and commanding the Van, as carefully as if he had been in perfect health. The Prince was well pleas'd with him, he look'd upon him as the chief Commander, next to himſelf, amongſt the <hi>Tartarians</hi>; for he was ſo well beloved by them, that he was very well o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> received news, that one of the King of <hi>China</hi>'s Brothers was fled with fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe; he ſent thirty thouſand to purſue him, and commanded <hi>Panihu</hi> at the ſame time to yield. This City readily obeyed, ſending their Keys, which cauſed the Army to advance forward into the Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had been almoſt a day and a night on
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40153:50"/>
Horſeback, from which he lighted about two a Clock in the Morning; they brought to him a Loaf of Bread and Water, for he never drank any Wine; afterwards he laid himſelf down upon a Carpet, diſcourſing with his Officers afterwards till Sun-riſing. <hi>I was,</hi> ſaith Alhacent, <hi>always near him at that time, and could never hear the leaſt word from his Mouth which might diſcover any pride that he took in his good ſucceſs; he only pitied the King of</hi> China <hi>becauſe of his unhapineſs, cauſed by his refuſal of ſurrendring into his Hands what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to him by right. He told</hi> Odmar <hi>that God had led him as it were by the Hand to obtain that day, without the loſs of any of his chief Officers, a great Victory; that he was ſorry for the death of his other Souldiers, but he thought them happy becauſe they had loſt their Lives in the ſervice of their Prince, fighting couragiouſly againſt the Heathens who worſhipped falſe Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day <hi>Tamerlan</hi> cauſed all his rich Tents to be ſpread, and placed his Guards in ſuch a manner as might make his Grandeur to appear the more: the chief Officers of his Army being near his Perſon to wait upon him, he then ſent to <hi>Axalla</hi> that he ſhould bring before hime the King of <hi>China.</hi> As ſoon as he underſtood that he was coming, he went out of his Tent to meet him. This great Prince was not caſt down by his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, he appear'd at this inſtant with the Countenance of a Man of courage. As ſoon as he had enquir'd of <hi>Axalla,</hi> by his Interpreter, which was the Emperour, he ſpoke to him in this ſtately manner; <hi>My Gods have been ſo diſpleas'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Country, and my happineſs, that they have
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40153:50"/>
made me thy Priſoner: And if it be true what Fame ſpeaks of thee, that</hi> Tamerlan <hi>fights for nothing but for the glory of his Nation, this that thou haſt now purchaſed ought to ſatisfie thy mind, to have ſubdued with thy Sword the Off-ſpring of the Sun, and the Lord of the World, who is now in thy power and at thy diſpoſal.</hi> He ſpoke theſe words with a free and bold air, and not as a Supplicant. The Emperour ſaluted him firſt very civilly, and caus'd him to be led into his Tent, where he anſwer'd him by his Interpreter, That an unjuſt cauſe is hateful to every Divinity, whether true or falſe; that for his part, he gave thanks to the immortal and incomprehenſible God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, whom he worſhipped, for the late Victory which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to have receiv'd from his bounty alone; as the King of <hi>China</hi> aſcrib'd the cauſe of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to his miſtaken Divinities: but he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd that he would not abuſe the advantage that he had got upon him, but that he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by all civil and courteous dealing to cauſe him to forget his preſent condition. The King of <hi>China,</hi> ſurpris'd with this unexpected diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, return'd him his thanks. At the cloſe of this diſcourſe <hi>Tamerlan</hi> drew back a little, to obſerve the motions and behaviour of this great Prince, whom he beheld ſtedfaſtly with delight. He ask'd him afterwards, what he thought of the Actions and courage of his Souldiers in the Fight? The King anſwer'd, That when he ſaw ſo feeble an Army, in Compariſon of his, came to him, he was fully perſwaded to get the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but the Gods had otherwiſe order'd it. He enquir'd from <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> whether his Brother
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40153:51"/>
had been killed or a Priſoner. Before the reply was made, one of the Commanders there preſent deſired to know whether he did fight near his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He told them that he commanded in the Battel the Cavalry, and wore as himſelf a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Attire. They anſwer'd him that he was taken; then he fetch'd a deep ſigh, which cauſed ſome to be ſo inquiſitive why he was diſpleaſed, that his Brother ſhould run the ſame hazards as himſelf, and fall into the ſame condition. He replyed, That in his misfortune he had this comfortable perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, That his Brother (<hi>the ſecond expectation of the</hi> Chineſes) would not forſake him, but would attempt every thing to re-eſtabliſh his Affairs, and the reputation of his Countrymen. He lamented pittifully at his miſhap, but praiſed his Courage: But <hi>Tamerlan</hi> knew very well that he was eſcaped and out of his reach, for he had rallied all the broken Troops of Horſe and was fled. <hi>Odmar</hi> had been ſent after him to hinder him from ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together too numerous a Body.</p>
               <p>The chief Priſoners were brought next, they were loaden with ſo much Gold and precious Jewels, that it is not to be conceived. The two Kings, Confederates and Tributary to <hi>China,</hi> appear'd firſt. As ſoon as this Prince ſaw them coming, he aroſe to honour them, and they fell down and worſhip'd him almoſt in their ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he wiſh'd them to riſe from the Ground; <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> ask'd who they were; the King of <hi>China</hi> anſwer'd that they were his Friends; one the King of <hi>Chiampa,</hi> the other the King of <hi>Cochin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine</hi>; and that he was ſorrowful for their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune as much as for his own, which made him
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40153:51"/>
willing to follow them in death. He ſpoke in this manner, imagining that the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Cuſtom was like that of <hi>China,</hi> to kill and deſtroy all their Priſoners of War, and ſometimes, in a ſavage manner, to feed upon their Fleſh. But the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour receiv'd them with expreſſions of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and aſſur'd them, that he would uſe them well and gently.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>China</hi> felt a great ſatisfaction at this unexpected civility and humanity. He was not above thirty years of Age, but had a long Face, great black Eyes, a Noſe of a middle ſize, a long Beard, which he handled often, a grave and lofty Air, like that of a great Prince. His Kingdom contains two hundred thouſand For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, fifteen great Provinces or Governments; in them are to be found many Golden Mines, and ſome Silver, and a certain Herb which we call <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> They reckon that he hath ſeventy Kings wearing Crowns, his Tributaries. This large and wide Country which we call <hi>China,</hi> is named by the Inhabitants <hi>Tame</hi>; and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom we call <hi>Chineſes,</hi> are named by them <hi>Tangis.</hi> This Country is full of Fowl and Fiſh, becauſe of the many Rivers that run through it. Silk is here ſo plentiful, that the Beggars are cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith. Wool is here ſcarce, but this want is remedied with much Cotton and Linnen. The Climate is temperate. The Men have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here to have as many Wives as they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently keep: They wear their Hair long, but the Women have ſhort Perrukes. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a General, or Governour over the whole Kingdom, next to the King, called by them
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40153:52"/>
                  <hi>Tuton.</hi> The Brother of the King of <hi>China</hi> had this Office, which is of ſo great importance, that the Laws command him to be always with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Kingdom. But this man intreated the King his Brother ſo earneſtly, that he might be preſent at the Battel, which he was perſwaded to win, that he yielded to his importunities. He had plac'd in his ſtead a Lord which the King did not truſt. This griev'd the King when he conſider'd that he had been guilty of ſo great a fault, as to ſuffer him to hazard with him his perſon in the ſame fight, and to have left the Government of ſo large an Empire in unfaithful hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> called afterwards together his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-Council, to adviſe what was to be done with the Priſoners, and how they ſhould uſe their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. At that time news was brought, that the King's Brother was ſafely arrived at <hi>Quanton,</hi> a City which he had fortified, that he was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to furniſh it with all manner of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and that he was buſily employed in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together an Army. As ſoon as <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> heard this, he ſent the Priſoners, with two thouſand <hi>Parthian</hi> Horſe to <hi>Pekin,</hi> for his Army had reſted themſelves ſeveral Days: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to ſtop there a little, and carry them over the Mountains to <hi>Burday,</hi> a City that had been always faithful to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and that they ſhould there keep them till they had further or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Malaxan, Axalla</hi>'s Lieutenant General, was to command that Party; by him the Prince writ to the Emperour his Uncle, and to his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of <hi>Sachetay,</hi> to acquaint them with his happy ſucceſs and Victory, where he had loſt but few
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40153:52"/>
of his Men, but the <hi>Chineſes</hi> many. By this means he freed himſelf from a great many Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots and Baggage that incumber'd his Army, ſending them with the Priſoners. He order'd alſo the Recruits to be haſtened, and forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot to be gathered in <hi>Parthia,</hi> and thirty thouſand Horſe in <hi>Tartaria,</hi> that they might come to him before the Forces of the King of <hi>China</hi> could be able to make head to ſtop him. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd what was beſt to be done upon this news, and it was reſolved, That <hi>Quanton</hi> ſhould be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily beſieg'd, and, if it were poſſible, to ſhut up the Kings Brother in the City.</p>
               <p>This place is one of the chiefeſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, very populous, and naturally ſtrong. It was about forty Leagues from the Field where the Battel was fought. <hi>Odmar</hi> took in his way thither many ſmall Towns, without oppoſition, and was march'd as far as the Walls, diſperſing his Troops round about, with an intention not to depart without the Prince's order, to whom he had diſpatch'd a Meſſenger, to underſtand his pleaſure. An univerſal fright had ſeiz'd upon the hearts of all the Inhabitants of the Kingdom, though the Kings Brother endeavour'd to ſettle their minds, and oblige them to take Courage. The Humanity of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> and the Civilities that he had expreſſed to the King of <hi>China,</hi> and to the reſt of his Priſoners, being nois'd abroad in the Country, ſatisfied their minds, and made them bear their misfortune with patience. Every one knew already that the Prince was of a mild and obliging temper; that he took a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſhewing his mercy to ſuch as deſerved or
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40153:53"/>
deſired it, by their behaviour and repentance; and that when he was angry, by an indiſcreet fierceneſs, he was loth to be cruel and rough to any: But in regard his deſign was to bring down the proud, and to raiſe up the humble, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd an equality in his Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to prevent by that means all occaſions and inclinations of miſchief. He had another good quality that caus'd him to be admir'd and cheriſh'd by all the World: he was a religious obſerver of his word, and no Perſon durſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to make him break it, without deſerving his diſpleaſure. The fame of ſo many good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and of ſo rare a Virtue in <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about amongſt the ignorant <hi>Chineſes,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd this good effect; that when once they had obtain'd his word, they depended upon it as if he had put it immediately in execution. This is of an high importance to ſettle the intereſt of a Conquerour amongſt his new Subjects.</p>
               <p>After all theſe orders given, <hi>Tamerlan</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded publick Prayers to be ſaid, to implore the Divine aſſiſtance. He diſtributed Moneys afterwards to the Captains, that they might have a care to heal the wounded, and provide neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for them; and with the reſt of his Army, in good order, march'd towards <hi>Quanton.</hi> He had order'd <hi>Odmar</hi> to Poſt himſelf on the other ſide of the Town, to hinder the Kings Brother from carrying into it his ſuccours, in caſe he ſhould attempt to put any in; willing him to oppoſe himſelf with all his power, and to fight him in caſe of neceſſity; for he inform'd him that he was coming with the Army to beſiege that City.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:40153:53"/>At this ſame time the Kings Brother ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> to Know how the King did, and to deſire leave to viſit him. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was glad of this requeſt, becauſe he feared that he would have Proclaim'd himſelf King of <hi>China,</hi> and by that means have created him much more trouble than his elder Brother. In the mean while, the Prince of <hi>China</hi> having underſtood in what condition the Citizens of <hi>Quanton</hi> were, he reſolved to ſuccour them, and adventure ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Battel; becauſe, as he thought, he had the Troops of his Allies, and his own Army, nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enough to do this buſineſs: for that purpoſe he march'd ſtraight to <hi>Porchio,</hi> ſcituate upon a great River, where he intended to build a Bridge with Boats, having Materials in abundance.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had underſtood his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he caus'd a Ditch to be made at the end of the Bridge that was over the River, with a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to prevent all ſudden attempts; pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing there three or four thouſand of his beſt Souldiers to Guard it. In the mean while, as the Enemy drew near, he ſtood with his Army drawn up on this ſide the River, and took notice of their countenance and motion.</p>
               <p>Both Armies continued in this manner ten or twelve days, without performing any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of notice. At laſt <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had news brought him, that the Kings Brother had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together a great many Boats, and was making of a Bridge, at a narrow place called <hi>Cambin,</hi> about ten Leagues from his Camp. At firſt he took no notice that he knew it, ſtaying in the ſame place with his Troops, without attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40153:54"/>
any thing; but when he underſtood for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Bridge was perfected, he gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to fifteen thouſand Horſe to attack ſuch as were paſſed over the River, commanding his Body of Foot to follow after. He had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him at <hi>Porchio</hi> as many as were needful to ſecure his Camp; the reſt of his Horſe, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Prince, brought up the Reer. He ſtop'd, or advanc'd his Army, according to the news that he received at every foot in his March, of the number and poſture of his Enemies that had paſs'd over the River. About Midnight they left their Camp, and came to their Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous about Noon. <hi>Odmar</hi> was there half an hour before the reſt, but as ſoon as he underſtood that there was no more of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> on his ſide of the River than he was able to beat, he ſtop'd with his Party without medling with them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wiſh'd that more would adventure over, and he ſtaid for <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s coming. He thought fit to ſend ſome Scouts to underſtand how their number increas'd: when he perceived that there were about fifty thouſand paſſed over the River, he ſent news of it to <hi>Tamerlan</hi>; who was at hand, and march'd directly to attack them. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not expected, for they knew nothing of his March: He found them in diſorder, ſo that at the firſt On-ſet he put them to flight. Some of them reſiſted with courage, but not ſo ſtoutly as they might have done in ſo advantageous a Poſt as they were in; for they had the River on the one ſide, and a large Marſh on the other ſide. It is certain, that if they had but known their ſtrength, and the advantage of the place, a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40153:54"/>
ſmall reſiſtance had been able to ſtop the <hi>Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But as ſoon as <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Infantry had got as far as the Rivers ſide, and had pierced through to the Bridge of Boats, they began to break and ſink it. They had a great Ship in the manner of a Fire-ſhip, coming down with the Stream; as ſoon as it was within a convenient diſtance, the <hi>Tartars</hi> ſet it on fire. This flaming Engine, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the ſtrength of the Water, beat with fury againſt the Bridge, broke ſome of the Boats, ſcattered others, and burn'd thoſe that were neareſt. This ſtrange ſight aſtoniſh'd the <hi>Chineſes</hi> that were paſſed over the River, becauſe they ſaw no hopes of ſaving themſelves by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. Twenty thouſand of them were kill'd in the place, and amongſt the reſt the Prince of <hi>Cochinchine,</hi> at the firſt On-ſet, where he behaved himſelf like a Man of courage. The Brother of the King of <hi>China</hi> ſaw his Men deſtroyed and drowned, and himſelf unable to aſſiſt them. Though he had loſt in this Encounter but the third part of his Army, and had yet one hundred thouſand freſh Men, there was no likelihood that he would hazard to fight with them againſt <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan,</hi> who commanded the Head of the Prince of <hi>Cochinchine</hi> to be cut off, and to be ſent to the Inhabitants of <hi>Quanton</hi>; for he was one of the nobleſt Subjects of the Empire: this ſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would be able to make them believe the Victory, that they might not expect any other ſuccours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> beſieged them ſo cloſe, and gave them ſo little time, that though they endeavoured to defend themſelves vigorouſly, and were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40153:55"/>
at handy-blows with his Men, they found themſelves every day weaker, and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies draw by degrees nearer to their Walls. When they found themſelves thus wearied with watching and fighting, and no likelihood of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by an obſtinate reſiſtance, they reſolved to fly to the Conquerours mercy. They ſent word to <hi>Axalla,</hi> that they deſir'd to treat with him. He ſent them word back again, that they had more reaſon to rely upon the Emperours mercy, than their own ſtrength; and that for his part, he would ſo order the buſineſs, that they ſhould have no cauſe to repent of their reſolutions. After a few Meſſages and Diſcourſes of yielding, they deſired eight days to ſend to the Brother of the King of <hi>China,</hi> to acquaint him with their eſtate and condition; and that if within fifteen days they were not relieved, they promiſed to yield up the City; upon condition that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> ſhould maintain their Priviledges, and treat them in the ſame manner as the Kings of <hi>China</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Axalla</hi> returned them this Anſwer; That he had power to treat with them, and receive them favourably when-ever they would fly to the mercy of his Prince: And that though the time they required was long, he would nevertheleſs inform him of their deſires, and write for them. But that immediately, without delays, they ought to give him Hoſtages for his ſecurity; and that upon that condition all Acts of Hoſtility ſhould ceaſe, and that he would grant them a Truce, till he underſtood further of his Princes mind. He ſent therefore to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> to acquaint him with this good news, which he received with much
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40153:55"/>
more joy, than for the late Victory obtained of the Enemy. He granted all that the Inhabitants of <hi>Quanton</hi> had deſired, at the Requeſt of <hi>Axalla,</hi> ſending him a Commiſſion to end this buſineſs as he ſhould judge moſt convenient.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Prince was watching, to obſerve what motion and courſe the Kings Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would take after his late overthrow. He intended, if he did not forſake the Banks of the River, to paſs over and purſue him to the Sea ſide. After three or four days ſtaying, he was advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Captains, to get over the Water only with his Cavalry. His intent was to march three or four Leagues into the Country, to hinder the <hi>Chineſes</hi> from ſeeking a Ford, which they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they might more ſpeedily ſuccour <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> that was beſieged.</p>
               <p>This fear quickly ceaſed, as ſoon as the Prince of <hi>China</hi> had ſeen the <hi>Tartars</hi> on his ſide of the River; for not thinking himſelf ſafe near ſo powerful an Enemy, he retreated with ſpeed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea, ſheltering himſelf amongſt the Mountains; into which the Cavalry could not eaſily approach, and where his Army could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench and fortifie themſelves with eaſe. When he was come to that place, and had reſted his Men, he conſulted with the Grandees of <hi>China</hi> that were about him, what reſolution was beſt to be taken. They advis'd him to ſeek the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt means; and for that purpoſe, that he ſhould ſend to <hi>Tamerlan</hi> Overtures of Peace, to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom the King, and ſave the reſt of the Provinces; telling him, that he ſhould endeavour to purchaſe Peace with Gold or Silver, ſeeing that ſo much
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40153:56"/>
Blood had been ſpilt in vain: That they perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Gods were wroth with their Nation, ſeeing that they had favour'd their Enemies ſo apparently; and therefore they had beſt yield to neceſſity, and to the conditions that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> would impoſe upon them: for that purpoſe, the Kings brother ſent for a ſafe Conduct for ſuch as he ſhould ſend to treat with <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> which was readily granted to as many as he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Quanton</hi> was ſurrender'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Axalla</hi>'s Hands, who cauſed the Garriſon to depart, and received the Inhabitants in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> and all ſuch as were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſtay there without Armour. He march'd into the City amidſt the general applauſe of the People, who were deſirous to ſee their new Prince. They received him very honourably; <hi>Axalla</hi> put thirty thouſand Men there in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, giving them ſome Money to ſupply their neceſſities until the Army could Muſter and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the three Months pay due to them, which amounted to eight hundred thouſand. <hi>Tentins,</hi> which are worth four hundred and fifty thouſand Crowns, or thereabouts. The Inhabitants of <hi>Quanton</hi> readily paid this Money.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were acted, the Emperour ſent <hi>Alhacent</hi> to <hi>Axalla.</hi> He found him treating and feaſting his Captains, in expectation of his Princes commands, which he brought to him; to ſtay at <hi>Quanton,</hi> and ſend him all the Infantry. He took this courſe, to fright and ſtrike a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into his Enemies the ſooner, who might perceive after the taking of that City, when the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40153:56"/>
Army ſhould be all in a Body, that <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was to march further into the Country, and conquer more of the Kingdom. He thought this to be the beſt way to ſucceed in his deſign, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them the ſooner to ſeek an honourable Peace, and ſettle his own intereſt in thoſe Parts. <hi>Alhacent</hi> returned back from <hi>Quanton</hi> to the Prince, being much ſatisfied to have ſeen that beautiful and great City, ſo well fortified and ſo populous, ſtanding in a fruitful Soil, abounding in all manner of good things. The Army was two Months and a half about it, without ſuffering any want of Proviſions; and might have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there three or four Weeks with eaſe and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for there was no lack of any thing in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unleſs it were of Men; for many had been kill'd during the Siege. To ſupply this want, the Kings Brother advanc'd with his Army, to caſt in ſome recruits. Many alſo of the <hi>Tartars</hi> were dead, through the unwholſomneſs of the Air, and the violent Heats unto which their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were not accuſtomed. Therefore they wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and watched the Recruits that were coming in haſte to the Army, before it could advance further into the Kingdom, or aſſault any other place. <hi>Axalla,</hi> who ſtaid in the Town, ſpent his time in making up the Breaches which the Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had made, and win the affections of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. It was a very ſtrange thing, that not one of the Inhabitants went out with the former Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour when he left the place; he led with him thirteen thouſand Men only, which were remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thirty thouſand that he had in the beginning of the Siege; ſome of them were dead and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40153:57"/>
killed in the Aſſaults, ſome ſtaid behind in the Town with the Inhabitants without Armour, willing to obey the Conquerour. This was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Paſſage, which caus'd <hi>Tamerlan</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from thence, that they were but an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant People ſo ſoon to forget their former Lord, who with his Predeceſſors had Commanded them and Govern'd them in peace, above two hundred years. This is a good Leſſon for thoſe that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern Republiques and Empires, not to have too great a confidence in the common People, let their profeſſion of zeal and affection be never ſo great. This conſideration oblig'd <hi>Axalla</hi> to doubt of the future, and to confeſs to <hi>Alhacent,</hi> that he knew not how ſo great a Multitude could be kept in order and commanded, in caſe any loſs or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune ſhould happen to his Party. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him therefore to tell the Prince, that he ſhould not proceed on further in the Conqueſt of the Country, but endeavour to treat with the Enemy before his Army ſhould decreaſe; and that he ſhould conſider, before he left the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, how he ſhould be able to keep under ſuch a Multitude of People in his abſence, which were ſo inclinable to change, and ſo uncon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ant.</p>
               <p>A whole year had been ſpent already in this Expedition, and the Companies that decreas'd daily through the Diſtempers of the <hi>Autumn,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the weakneſs into which they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly fall. The Prince conſidered all theſe things; beſides, he feared that a too long and tedious abſence would cauſe ſome diſturbance in his Empire, as it happens very often: He thought therefore it was as much honour for him to keep,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40153:57"/>
by his wiſdom, what he had gained, as to win and conquer it by his Valour. Therefore it was his mode never to refuſe reaſonable offers of Peace, and to value that more which he obtain'd by that Method, than that which he purchas'd with his Sword. He conſider'd alſo that if he could preſerve all that Country which he had over-run, which made the third part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and receive from the remainder a yearly Tribute, he ſhould be able to bridle in the King of <hi>China,</hi> and hinder him from revolting; and that before he would attempt any ſuch thing, he would think a while upon it: And that he would take ſuch a courſe to ſecure his intereſt againſt the natural inconſtancy of the Nation, that by the puniſhment that he would inflict upon the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, he would ſcare and terrifie all others from a Rebellion.</p>
               <p>He was therefore reſolved to hearken to the firſt reaſonable Propoſals of Agreement, and to bound in that place the Conqueſts of <hi>China</hi>; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that what he had already taken was almoſt the third part of the Kingdom, and he had enough to bridle the King of <hi>China,</hi> and to hinder him from revolting, if he ſhould at any time deſire it.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadours, who were ſome of the chief Lords of the Kingdom, came to <hi>Tamerlan</hi>; who received them as courteouſly as could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, ſhewing to them all the Grandeur and State of his Court, and the ſtrength of his Army, that they might have a ſtronger inclination to be at peace with him. When they had ſaluted <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan,</hi> they told him that the Prince of <hi>China</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:40153:58"/>
had ſent them to treat with him about the Liberty of their King, and the Peace of <hi>China.</hi> That the Fame of his mildneſs and humanity had invited them to try it by experience, before they would again complain of the ungratitude of their Gods. That they were now highly diſpleaſed at their own neglect. That they had not prevented his entrance into their Kingdom, by yielding to him all thoſe things that he requeſted of them with ſo much equity and Juſtice. That now they were come to make him full amends, and receive from him ſuch conditions as he ſhould require. That they were at preſent ſenſible, though too late, that nothing was able to ſtop the progreſs of his Army, and that they were willing to be Examples of this to future Ages.</p>
               <p>The Prince liſtened with attention to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which he cauſed to be interpreted to him, and made this reply: That they had good reaſon to rely upon his humanity and mildneſs, but that they had done wiſer, if they had made trial of it before they had experienced the ſtrength of his Army. In ſuch a caſe their condidion had been better, and they had been more kindly uſed. But as the deſign of War is to make ſuch perſons hearken to Terms of Peace, as were not willing without it; and, in regard they deſired it, he aſſur'd them, That he was willing to yield to Peace, and grant them that which was the firſt Declaration of his mildneſs and humanity to them; but that on their ſide, they ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and make offer of ſuch juſt and reaſonable Conditions, as his Council would yield to after a due examination. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> after theſe words
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40153:58"/>
departed from them, wiſhing them to declare the Conditions in Writing, and that they ſhould have an anſwer. They appeared to be very joyful for the kind expreſſions that the Prince had given them, being in their minds moſt confident of concluding a Peace.</p>
               <p>The Conditions that they offer'd were, That they would yield <hi>Pekin,</hi> with all the Gountry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and the Mountains, with their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes: That they would ſatisfie all the Charges of the War till the Peace was concluded: That they would give two Millions of Gold to redeem their King. The Prince anſwered them. That he was reſolved to keep whatever he had conquer'd, which belonged to him by the right of War: That he was willing that the River where his Army was encamped ſhould be the limits of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as far as <hi>Porchis</hi> and the Sea: That the King of <hi>China</hi> ſhould pay to him and his Succeſſors yearly, as a Tribute, two hundred thouſand Crowns, which he ſhould ſend to <hi>Pekin,</hi> and five hundred thouſand Crowns ready Money for to defray the Expences of the War; and that in conſideration of this ſum, the King ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed and ſent home; that all the other Priſoners ſhould pay to ſuch as had taken them, Ranſoms according to their Qualities; only the Kings ſhould pay down each of them one hundred thouſand Crowns for their releaſement: That no <hi>Chineſe,</hi> within his Territories, ſhould hereafter be kept Priſoner or ſold as a Slave: That there ſhould be a free Trade between both Kingdoms: That the King of <hi>China</hi> ſhould leave as Hoſtages for the performance of the Treaty, his Brother and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40153:59"/>
the two Kings that were Priſoners; and beſides them, twelve other Lords of <hi>China,</hi> who ſhould be exchang'd every year by a like number that ſhould take their rooms, and bring with them the Tribute of two hundred thouſand Crowns.</p>
               <p>Theſe conditions, though hard and grievous, were accepted, becauſe they were not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to refuſe them; for their Armies were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, their ſtrength was weakened, the beſt Men and the flower of their Army kill'd or wounded, and the remainder were affrighted; their King taken, two Battels loſt, the two chief Cities of the Kingdom ſnatch'd out of their hands, and all their chief Paſſages at their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies command. In regard therefore that they were threatened with a general deſolation, and all the Country was full of fears and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they reckon'd that favour was ſhewed to them, to ſpare that which was left of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which would infallibly and totally be ruin'd, if the Peace was not concluded, and their King ſet at liberty. They were well inform'd, that the Emperours Army was to be recruited with other freſh Troops, that were in their march towards the Army. All theſe things conſidered, caus'd them to reſolve and yield to the conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, without any further debate, taking a ſtrong reſolution to bear with patience the Yoke of their Bondage, until ſuch time as they ſhould have a favourable opportunity to aſſert again their own liberties, and free themſelves from the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while the Prince had diſpatch'd two thouſand Horſe, with a Commiſſion to bring
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40153:59"/>
with them the King of <hi>China</hi> from <hi>Burda,</hi> that he might ſwear to the Peace in Freedom. At <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> he took the Oath: <hi>Tamerlan</hi> departed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to <hi>Pekin,</hi> carrying with him all the Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and amongſt the reſt, the Kings eldeſt Son and Brother. The King went into his Kingdom, to appoint all things for the performance of the Articles agreed upon: He was received by his People with ſtrange tranſports of joy, inſomuch that they ſeem'd to adore him. <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy was mindful of every thing that might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his conquered Countries: He look'd upon <hi>Odmar</hi> as the fitteſt Perſon to leave behind him, and govern in his abſence; he made him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Vice-Roy, giving him an abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over all the Country, with thirty thouſand Horſe, and fifty thouſand Foot, well furniſh'd with all needful things: they were to be diſpers'd into all the Garriſons and Strong-holds. He wiſh'd him to make his ordinary abode at <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> to cauſe good and ſtrong Guards to be kept all along the River; and to build a Fort at <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio,</hi> to ſecure that place. He recommended to him the Perſon of the Lord of <hi>Vauchefu,</hi> who had expreſs'd ſo much zeal and affection to him in this War, and ſo much experience in Publick Affairs: for his Brother he was willing to keep him near his own Perſon, and give him an Eſtate in <hi>Sachetay</hi>; where he enrich'd and enobled him. He invited alſo ſeveral of the Inhabitants of <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and of other places, to ſerve him; with an intention to ſettle them in his own Country, and ſend thither <hi>Parthians</hi> in their ſtead; to arm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by that means againſt their inconſtancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:40153:60"/>All things having been thus order'd, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my took the way to <hi>Cambalu</hi>; but before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to march, the Prince ſent to the Emperour, his Uncle, to inform him of his happy ſucceſſes and return. In this Court were ſeveral jealous Heads, that blam'd <hi>Tamerlan</hi> for what he had done, becauſe he had not ſubdued and deſtroyed all <hi>China.</hi> But they underſtood not the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were to be overcome, and that it is not always good to purſue things to the uttermoſt; that turnings of Fortune are too ordinary: that ſuch as would have too much more than they ought, loſe often what they might have kept with honour and ſafety. In trurh, by keeping what he had conquer'd, <hi>Tamerlan</hi> could juſtly name himſelf King of <hi>China.</hi> He had in his Poſſeſſion two of the moſt beautiful, and greateſt Cities of the Kingdom, with an infinite number of leſſer Towns, with an hundred Leagues in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try limited with a great River, which could not hinder him from going over to the Enemies at his pleaſure, and yet ſtop'd them from coming into his Dominions without danger and trouble, in regard of the eaſineſs of the guard and defence of it. The King of <hi>China</hi> could not fail to pay his yearly Tribute, but he muſt at the ſame time draw upon himſelf the inconveniences of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: So that by this Peace <hi>Tamerlan</hi> got more honour, and deſerved more praiſes, than if he had deſtroyed all <hi>China</hi> with Fire and Sword, and ruined a People that had yielded themſelves into his Hands ſo freely to pay him Tribute.</p>
               <p>One thing chiefly ſurpriſed the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and caus'd them to be ſtrangely grieved: It was the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40153:60"/>
Command that the Prince gave <hi>Odmar</hi> before his departure, to break down all the Idols that ſhould be found within his conquer'd Country; for he order'd them all to worſhip but one only God, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> unto whoſe Religion he wiſh'd that they would join and accuſtom themſelves. The People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no ſuch proceedings, but they hoped to enjoy all their ancient liberty in all reſpects; but now they ſaw that they muſt of neceſſity yield to this Order, ſeeing that the Prince had left <hi>Odmar</hi> to Command them, one of the wiſeſt and moſt experienced Captains of his Empire, who had always a care to obſerve and put in execution his Lords Commands. When <hi>Odmar</hi> took his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of the Prince, he humbled himſelf as low as his Feet, according to the Cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but the Prince raiſed him up with a ſmiling Countenance, <hi>I perceive,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that thou art become a</hi> Chineſe, <hi>ſeeing that thou offereſt to worſhip me as they do their King; but the greateſt worſhip that I require of thee, is, that thou ſhouldeſt put my Commands in execution. I intreat thee above all things, to eſtabliſh amongſt my new Subjects the Honour and Service of God, and next my Authority; and remember that all theſe Perſons that I leave at thy command have been ſubdued by the Sword, and not by Love, or their own Inclinations: ſo that they are to be kept in and under by fear, and not to be truſted too far. I recommend my affairs to thy care,</hi> Farewel. The Aſſiſtants took notice at this ſeparation, that the Prince never left any Body with ſo much regret and diſpleaſure, as he did then <hi>Odmar</hi>: But it was abſolutely needful to leave ſuch an one
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40153:61"/>
as he was in this Country, a Man of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary wiſdom, faithfulneſs, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>The Army in their return homewards, carried with them all their ſick People; and after two days March, they met with the new Recruits that were coming to aſſiſt them. The Prince order'd them to proceed on no further, but to return home towards <hi>Cambalu</hi>; whither he intended to go and meet with the Emperour, who intended to ſee him there, and give him a triumphing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, with all the Pomp and Magnificence imaginable.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable, that after <hi>Odmar</hi> was abſent, the Prince loved <hi>Axalla</hi> above all other Perſons; he truſted him more than any other with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of his Army. His reputation and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit was always very great, but it was mightily increas'd by the taking of <hi>Quanton,</hi> which was his doing alone; for <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had left to him the management and carrying on of this Siege; every one remember'd how well he had behaved himſelf, when with the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into <hi>China.</hi> The Correſpondency that he had to advance his Prince's Intereſt, and all his other noble and diſcreet Actions flew abroad, and were known all over the Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calibes</hi> led the Van; <hi>Axalla,</hi> unto whom the Prince had given two hundred thouſand Crowns <hi>per annum,</hi> Commanded the main Body. This <hi>Axalla,</hi> whoſe mind was meditating upon great deſigns, could not ſee his Lord idle. He accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him into his own Country, but it was to perſwade him to undertake ſome noble Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40153:61"/>
which might redound to the glory and quiet of the Chriſtian Common-wealth, for which he had always a great affection; ſo that his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation amongſt People of another Religion could not oblige him to alter his mind.</p>
               <p>After many days Journeys, news came to the Army, that the Emperour was already at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balu.</hi> This cauſed our Prince to ſend his Army to their Winter Quarters, into a good and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Country, and with all expedition to haſten to that City. He made that ſpeed, that in a few days he arrived within four Leagues of <hi>Combalu</hi>; where all the Princes and Grandees of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Court, with ſome of the chief Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, met him, to congratulate his ſafe arrival and return from ſuch a glorious Conqueſt. The Prince embrac'd every one according to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and Quality, with a Countenance full of goodneſs and Majeſty. The Empreſs, his Wife, was then with him, ſhe had always accompanied him, and was likewiſe welcom'd by all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with extraordinary rejoycings. The next day the Emperour himſelf went out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to meet him, with a glorious and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Train. The Prince paid him all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at the firſt interview that could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and preſented him with the richeſt Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, and the moſt beautiful Horſes of <hi>China.</hi> It was obſerv'd, that when the Prince lighted from his Horſe to pay his reſpects to the Emperour, his Uncle, the old Man wept for joy. He offered to go down from his Chariot, but <hi>Tamer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40153:62"/>
to his Lord and Prince, he hindered him from his purpoſe. This old and grave Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, being very deſirous to ſee his Daughter that had been abſent from him ſo long, cauſed her Chariot to be uncovered, and deſired her to come up into his Chariot, that he might diſcourſe with her at his pleaſure. In the mean while the Prince was on Horſeback, drawing upon himſelf the Eyes of all the World, that could not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently admire him. He preſented afterwards <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libes</hi> to the Emperour, praiſing him for his good ſervices and faithfulneſs; which cauſed him to increaſe his Penſion, and give him one hundred thouſand Crowns. <hi>Axalla</hi> came next to him, and in few words he was told of his Valour and noble Deeds; to him he appointed one hundred thouſand <hi>Tartarins</hi> of Gold, to be paid him out of his Exchequer, after a kind reception; and gave him a Principality, to reward his Virtues, and expreſs the eſteem that he had of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. The War of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> againſt <hi>Bajazet,</hi> the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Emperour. His defeat and impriſonment.</head>
               <p>ALL the Winter was ſpent in Sports, Plays, and Divertiſements; but before it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Prince heard that <hi>Bajazet</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, a ſtirring and a warlike Prince, had an intent to conquer the Empire of <hi>Greece</hi>; that he had won a Battel and put the Chriſtians to flight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:40153:62"/>
intending to lay Siege to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the chief City of the Empire. This news, together with the earneſt intreaties of the Embaſſadours ſent to him from the Emperour <hi>Paleologue,</hi> made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to ſend ſome of his Court to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him that the Prince whom he aſſaulted was his Confederate, and therefore he was obliged by that Alliance to intreat him not to attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to his prejudice, but to ſuffer him to live in peace in his Dominions. All this proceeded from the ſollicitation of <hi>Axalla,</hi> who was related to the Family of the <hi>Paleologues,</hi> and had found a means to oblige his Lord to defend and protect him and the Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> in the Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, from the Invaſion of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometaniſm</hi>; for he had been born there of <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Parents. <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Ambaſſadour was roughly treated; <hi>Bajazet</hi> proudly anſwer'd him, That his Lord ſhould meddle with his own buſineſs, and give Laws to his own Subjects; without making any ſuch application to him, who owed him no ſubjection nor reſpect. <hi>Axalla</hi> aggravated this Anſwer with the moſt hainous Circumſtances, and endeavoured to incenſe the Prince againſt the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, thinking himſelf oblig'd to oppoſe its dangerous growth which might prove as deſtructive to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Empire as to their weaker Neighbours. After a due conſultation, the Ambaſſadour of the <hi>Palcologue</hi> was diſmiſs'd with this joyful news to his Maſter, That <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> would not fail to aſſiſt him. <hi>Bajazet</hi> was not then aſleep, he advanc'd every day forward in his conuqeſts, and his happy ſucceſſes had ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted him, that he would not hearken to nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40153:63"/>
the reports of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> ſuccours, but look'd upon them as idle contrivances invented to ſcare him from his deſigns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> ſeem'd to be weary of reſt before the Winter was paſt; the freſh Lawrels of new Victories called him into the Field in the opening of the Spring, to diſ-ingage his word and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his promiſe. <hi>Axalla</hi> never left urging him, until the Prince ſent him into <hi>Sachetay</hi> to gather together his Troops from all Parts, that in the beginning of the Spring he might appear with them in the Field.</p>
               <p>This Army made the more haſte, becauſe news was brought by an expreſs Meſſenger, that there had been a Battel fought between <hi>Bajazet</hi> and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were overthrown in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that their Affairs were utterly loſt without a ſpeedy aſſiſtance; and that they would be forced to yield to the mercy of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> had procur'd from the Emperour, his Uncle, one hundred thouſand Foot, and fourſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, for this glorious expedition. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the ſame number from <hi>Sachetay,</hi> and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that the Princes and great Lords, that would accompany him in this War, would be able to make up fifty thouſand Men more. With theſe Forces he imagin'd that there was ſome likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of obliging the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family to hearken to reaſon, and free the <hi>Grecians</hi> from their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent danger and oppreſſions. <hi>Axalla</hi> ſoon ſent him word that all things were ready, and his Souldiers prepared for a March in <hi>Sachetay.</hi> The Prince at this news took his leave of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, his Uncle, leaving behind the Princeſs his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40153:63"/>
Spouſe to comfort his Father in his decrepit old Age. Theſe <hi>adieux</hi> of the Uncle and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and of the Prince and his Spouſe, were grievous and troubleſome; and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had never forſaken him in all his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and Expeditions. But when the glory of his Empire, the eaſe of his people, and the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Friends were concerned, nothing was able to keep him. He often declar'd, That he had been born for War, and that he ought to take there his delights and pleaſure, and that all other things that he acted out of this Sphere he performed not with any affection. And he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That he was appointed by God to bring down the pride of imperious Tyrants.</p>
               <p>The Night immediately before his departure from <hi>Cambalu,</hi> he had a Dream which we may not paſs over in ſilence. He thought he had ſeen a great Company of grave and old Men ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their Hands to him, intreating him to lend his aſſiſtance to free them from certain proud Tyrants that afflicted them with divers Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He often ſaid, That to his imagination he never beheld a more venerable Company that deſerved a greater reſpect and conſideration; ſome of them ſeem'd to him in his Sleep to be cloathed in white, beautiful Garments; others were attired in Cloth of Gold; ſome of them, as he thought, had Crowns on their Heads. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and compaſſion he had for them, obliged him in his Sleep to reach out his hand to them, and draw them all out of a very low place where they were ſhut up. The Prince diſcover'd this Dream the next day after his departure to many
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40153:64"/>
of his Attendants; but as no perſon then could preſume to tell him the meaning, he never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it afterwards.</p>
               <p>He went from <hi>Cambalu,</hi> conducted through the Town, followed with the Prayers and Wiſhes of all the People, and receiving all the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they could give him of their Love and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty. Several perſons of quality offered him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gifts, in return of his kindneſſes that the City had received from him during his abode there. <hi>Calibes,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> attended upon him. The Prince was made chief Colonel of all the Infantry inſtead of <hi>Axalla,</hi> who had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appointed to be Lieutenant-General of the whole Army, and Chief Commander of the Van. <hi>Calibes</hi> was to bring up the Reer. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> never had more hopeful Troops, nor a more numerous Army. Every day freſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies were coming in from all Parts to join the Army. The Lord of <hi>Vauchefu,</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> earneſtly deſiring to expreſs his thankfulneſs to his Benefactor by ſome noted Action, had leave granted to him by <hi>Odmar</hi> to accompany him in this glorious expedition. He brought with him twenty thouſand of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> who were glad to ſerve their new Lord, and underſtand the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Cuſtoms and Manners in War. <hi>Odmar</hi> was afraid of ſome miſhap during the Prince's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, not ſo much from the unconſtancy of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> as from the unconſtancy of Fortune. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had ſent him word of his deſigns and expedition, unto which <hi>Odmar</hi> advis'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd him, telling him alſo, That he was come on purpoſe to bring down the Proud and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40153:64"/>
raiſe up the Humble. Therefore there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could more diſpleaſe and anger him than the ſight of a proud and haughty mind. He made this inclination of his ſufficiently appear when he was in <hi>China,</hi> for caſting his Eyes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that lofty Nation, he ſaw nothing but an empty vanity in all their proceedings. <hi>I am ſent,</hi> ſaid he to his Officers, <hi>to bring down the unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pride of theſe people, and I hope I ſhall abaſe them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After a few days March <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army got as far as <hi>Ozara,</hi> the General Rendezvous of all his Troops: And, becauſe they were not all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, he went with his Guards to <hi>Samarcande,</hi> the place of his Nativity, from whence he had been abſent about three years. <hi>Zamay</hi> came out to meet him with an infinite Multitude of people, who filled the Air with Acclamations, Applauſes, and Prayers, for his proſperity. All the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Lords of the Country met him alſo to pay him their reſpects; and the whole City did ring with joy for the happy return of their noble Prince whom the people loved intirely. He ſtaid there about a Month; in the mean while <hi>Axalla</hi> came with his Troops to the rendezvous at <hi>Ozara,</hi> where he made all things ready for a March, and waited for his Princes orders. He had ſent him the news of the progreſs of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and of all his proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had ſent word to the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and acquainted them with his intentions to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> requeſting him to ſend him a few Troops. This Prince had heard of the great preparations for War that the <hi>Tartars</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:40153:65"/>
made; he was jealous that they were intended againſt himſelf, but he was eas'd of his fears, and rejoyced to hear that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was marching with his numerous Army againſt the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, whoſe prodigious growth had given him cauſe to be afraid. He ſent therefore his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> to offer him in his expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all the aſſiſtance that he deſired. The Prince intreated him to ſend him fifteen thouſand Horſe with ſome Monies due to him, and a free paſſage over his Country. All this was readily granted by the <hi>Czar,</hi> who continued faithful in his Allyance and League with <hi>Tamerlan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This dreadful Army of the <hi>Tartarians</hi> caus'd all Men to expect the abaſement of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> power, which in a few years was grown dreadful to all the World, and inſupportable to all their Neighbours: for this cauſe, as well as for the Confederacy contracted with the <hi>Paleologues, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> was reſolved to withſtand <hi>Bajazet</hi> with all his might. He choſe rather to aſſault him in his new Conqueſts, than to ſtay to be aſſaulted by him in his own Country amongſt his people to their unſpeakable damage and loſs. This wiſe reſolution of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was intended for theſe two purpoſes; firſt, his Army would live upon the Enemies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>Country, and ſpend of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſecurely; if Fortune ſhould frown upon him there, his own Territories would be never the worſe, and he ſhould loſe none of them thereby, ſo that all the advantage would prove to be on his ſide. Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> was the chief Agent of this Expedition; he govern'd at this time both the Empire and the Emperour. His great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40153:65"/>
being a Chriſtian, gave a jealouſie and diſpleaſure to ſeveral Grandees of the Court; but his diſcreet Behaviour and obliging Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, together with his rare Vertues that appear'd in all the courſe of his life, and the notable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices that he had perform'd, ſtopt the mouths of all envious perſons, and kept him up in his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Station. He was as welcome to the old Emperour as to <hi>Tamerlan</hi> himſelf, unto whom he cunningly gave the honour of all ſucceſſes, though his Wiſdom and diſcreet Conduct had the greateſt ſhare and hand in bringing them to paſs; ſo that if his Power was great, his Worth and Vertues were anſwerable. There was never any perſon more courteous, more affable, more merciful and kind. He incited <hi>Tamerlan</hi> to nothing but to Glorious Actions, to Noble Deſigns full of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and when they were to be executed, he was always the firſt man that would adventure his Life and Perſon, without ſparing himſelf. And though <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had always next to his Perſon many illuſtrious Princes and noble Lords, their Glory was darkened by the Splendour and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of <hi>Axalla,</hi> who exceeded them all in number of Servants, in beautiful Horſes, and in a ſtately and glorious Train. He had a great Soul, adorned with many Vertues, and a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion able to maintain his own intereſt. He never gave any Counſel but he offered himſelf to put it in execution; in which he always was ſo happy that all things ſucceeded to him that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook. His Policy appeared chiefly in liſtening to all perſons that had any Errand to him. He would lend an Ear to the meaneſt with that mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40153:66"/>
and Humanity, that never any Perſon went from him diſſatisfied; but he had the art to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate their affections, and win the hearts of all Men that knew him. One day the Prince check'd him becauſe he was ſo courteous and kind, and ſo eaſily to be ſpoken with; for which he blamed him before <hi>Alhacent:</hi> But <hi>Axalla</hi> reply'd, <hi>It may become you, my Emperour, to be ſtately; but I ought to be humble, as your Slave and Servant: Grandeur agrees with your Place, but Humility is my greateſt Ornament. I am near your Perſon, my noble Lord, for no other purpoſe, but to cauſe you to be honoured; if therefore you be reſpected, it is ſufficient. It mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not how I behave my ſelf, ſo I perform my Duty. If I were ſtately and proud, I ſhould become odious to all the Lords of your Court, and diſoblige them ſo as to think ill of your choice of my Perſon. I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that they may honour me, not for my ſake, but for yours, that your ſervice may be better advanc'd.</hi> This Anſwer gave a great ſatisfaction to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; for he had a particular art to gain the love of every one, and he was reſpected alſo more than he deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have,</hi> ſaith Alhacent, <hi>made this little Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Hiſtory, to give a Deſcription of</hi> Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla; <hi>becauſe without it many things cannot well be underſtood in this Relation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince ſent orders to <hi>Axalla</hi> to come to him to <hi>Samarcande,</hi> to adviſe about the march of his Troops, and till his return, to leave the Command of the Army with the Prince of <hi>Tanais. Axalla</hi> took Poſt, and in obedience to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, went to the Prince: After a ſerious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, it was reſolved in Council, that the whole
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40153:66"/>
Army ſhould march over the Borders of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> ſtraight towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Greece,</hi> whither <hi>Bajazet</hi> with his Army were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apace; for he was in <hi>Aſia Minor. Tamerlan</hi> ſent a Relation of <hi>Axalla,</hi> to inform the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Paleologue</hi> of the coming of his Army; for whoſe ſubſiſtance great ſtores of Proviſions had been laid up in all the conſiderable Cities of the Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> therefore, in purſuance of his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, went from <hi>Samarcande</hi> to <hi>Ozura,</hi> where the Rendezvous was appointed of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. There it was debated again which way to take; that of <hi>Capha,</hi> by the Borders of <hi>Muſcovy</hi>; or the other way, on the other ſide of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, through the Confines of <hi>Perſia.</hi> At laſt it was reſolved that the Army ſhould march to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Trapezuntium,</hi> or <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſonde,</hi> through the Borders of the <hi>Georgians,</hi> and enter that way into the Dominions of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, when Prayers had been ſolemnly offered up to God, to implore his aid and gracious aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, for the Prince did put in him his greateſt confidence, the whole Army went ſtraight to <hi>Maranis</hi>; where it abode three days in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Troops ſent from <hi>Odmar,</hi> who were near at hand, as well as the other Succours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this place the Emperour caus'd a General Muſter and Review of all his Army, which was obliged to march twenty Leagues through a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart Country, where they found no comfort, not ſo much as a little freſh Water. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40153:67"/>
provided beforehand for this inconveniency, for he had ordered all the Ships and Veſſels in the Harbours of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, to attend upon him and the Army, near the Shore. In theſe Ships were Proviſions ſufficient, a great deal of Ammunition, and the moſt part of his Equipage. This foreſight help'd them in ſeaſon, and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Army from meeting with want. In the march the Prince went along the Sea-Coaſt, ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in Hunting, or diſcourſing with his Attendants; he was commonly about ten Leagues from the Army, and none came near him but thoſe that carried Proviſions from the Ships. This Army was ſo numerous, that they ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along twenty Leagues into the Country.</p>
               <p>When it was come to <hi>Mechet,</hi> there the Army went over the River <hi>Edel,</hi> by a Bridge that was there, and two or three more made on purpoſe for a more ſpeedy paſſage. During this time the Prince abode at <hi>Saraſick,</hi> where he underſtood for certain that <hi>Bajazet</hi> was going to beſiege <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> that he had conquered all <hi>Bythinia</hi> and <hi>Burſa,</hi> the chief City of this Kingdom: that he had commanded it to be well fortified, and many other Towns where he had exercis'd his cruelty upon the Inhabitants: That all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Provinces, for fear of him, yielded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance, and became Tributaries to him. The news that diſpleas'd <hi>Tamerlan</hi> moſt, was, that <hi>Capha</hi> a ſtrong City, where <hi>Axalla</hi> was brought up, and received under his protection at <hi>Axalla</hi>'s requeſt, had followed the Example of the reſt, and opened their Gates to the barbarous Enemy. This unworthy contempt of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40153:67"/>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was reſolved to puniſh; he ſent therefore to ſummon them to appear before him, and give an account of their revolt from him. The Citizens were troubled at this Meſſage, they apprehended his juſt indignation, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due for their Rebellion. They ſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome of their Citizens to pacifie his wrath, with many rich Gifts and rare Furs: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd in the name of the reſt, that they would never be guilty of any ſuch Crime for the future, but would endeavour to make amends for it by their future behaviour and faithfulneſs. The Emperour underſtanding of their true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he pardon'd them for <hi>Axalla</hi>'s ſake, unto whom he gave the Soveraignty of the City. <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> went to viſit there his Friends and Relations, and ſettle there a good Order and Government for the ſecurity of the place; giving his Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to underſtand that he loved his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and would ſee to preſerve his Country-men. In his way he took <hi>Tana</hi> which belong'd to the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> he recover'd <hi>Aches</hi> and <hi>Lopeſo,</hi> three conſiderable Towns which the Prince beſtowed upon <hi>Axalla,</hi> willing him to fortifie them and furniſh them with all neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>Some may wonder what moved this <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Prince, who had refus'd the Government of the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> and many conſiderable Towns, to accept now a ſmall Territory with more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and to prefer ſuch narrow Limits to greater Dominions. This diſcovers that ſtrong affection that we have naturally for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where we came firſt into the World. <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> accepted of this Gift the rather, becauſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40153:68"/>
he might hereafter retire himſelf in <hi>Capha</hi> in caſe of neceſſity. Though he held the ſecond place, and was next to the greateſt Monarch of the World, he ſeem'd thereby to confine all his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to this little Territory, and preferr'd a ſmall Portion of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, to a large Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of Ground limited by <hi>Scythia</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and all the Countries conquer'd by his Maſter, though he were well-beloved by the Souldiers, and highly reſpected by all other Perſons.</p>
               <p>The Army continued ſometimes about <hi>Mechet,</hi> to refreſh themſelves: The Prince till that time had employed himſelf in Hunting, having left the whole Command of the Army to <hi>Axalla</hi>; but now he took charge of it himſelf, and cauſed it to march forward towards the holy Mountains; where the <hi>Circaſſians</hi> and <hi>Georgians</hi> ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to him, to offer him their aſſiſtance. Theſe People are numerous, all profeſſing the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith. They have been always Tributaries to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, ſince the time that they were conquer'd by <hi>Pompey</hi>; before that, they were under the Juriſdiction of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> whom this <hi>Roman</hi> General overcame. They were joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to receive <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army, becauſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to free the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family. <hi>Axalla</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a great many of that Country to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Army, for they are noted for their courage and ſtrength. They are a ſort of People, tall, well-ſet Bodies, and very War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; they have often reſiſted the Power of the <hi>Turks,</hi> partly by their ſtoutneſs, and partly by the ſcituation of their Country, which is Craggy
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40153:68"/>
and Mountainous. At the firſt noiſe of War they burn their Houſes, and waſte the Country; ſo that they are able to withſtand by that means the Aſſaults of a powerful Enemy. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was well pleaſed to behold theſe proper Men with their long Hair, and took a delight to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their Warlike Diſpoſitions and Actions. Therefore he gave an expreſs Command, That his Army ſhould not do any injury to that Country. They were at that time part of the Empire of <hi>Trapezuntium,</hi> which belonged to <hi>Greece.</hi> The Prince was received every-where with Honour, and his Army ſupplyed with Proviſions, as much as could be deſired here. It was reported for certain, That <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was beſieged by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet,</hi> who, with a very powerful Army, was ſet down before it, and kept in the Emperour <hi>Paleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>: and that all his Dominions were in a great danger to be loſt. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince could not believe that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> dared oppoſe his Deſigns. Therefore when the fame of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Armies coming ſpread about amongſt his Souldiers, he forbid, by his Proclamation, any perſon ſo much as to mention the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army; ſo highly did his proud mind deſpiſe and contemn it. All the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Country, where this Army paſs'd, prais'd the Souldiery, and wiſh'd them all happineſs, becauſe they were orderly, quiet, peaceable, and juſt in their dealings: If a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier had ſtole but an Apple, he was ſure to dye for it without Mercy.</p>
               <p>This ſeverity was obſerved in all the March, becauſe this expedition was undertaken for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe but to deliver theſe people from the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40153:69"/>
fears and ſlavery of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and force proud <hi>Bajazet</hi> to liſten to ſome reaſon. In this order the Army came to <hi>Bachichich,</hi> where it ſtopt to take ſome refreſhment eight days. There the Embaſſadors of <hi>Guines,</hi> a Man highly eſteem'd for his Holineſs, met the Prince. They offered him, in their Maſters name, all the help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance that he could deſire or want in this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; they brought him ſome beautiful Horſes, and aſſur'd him, in their Maſter's name, that he ſhould ſucceed in his deſigns, for <hi>Guines</hi> was a learned Aſtrologer and a Prophet in thoſe Parts. The Emperour declar'd to them, That he thought himſelf honoured by their coming in Embaſſy from ſuch a Prince, therefore he ſent a rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of rare Furs, and ſome Golden Plate.</p>
               <p>Here at <hi>Bachichich</hi> he muſtered and viewed his Army, and gave them all their Pay, both Horſe and Foot, exhorting them to behave themſelves valiantly. It was his conſtant practice to do ſo at ſuch times. He caus'd them alſo to exerciſe themſelves with feigned Fights, that they might be more expert and keep their order; he was very careful of this, which he recommended always to his Captains. In thoſe days every private ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier had the liberty to behold their Emperour with more confidence than at other times; for the Prince gave them acceſs, and ſeem'd to caſt off the Majeſty and State which at other times hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd their approach, that he might converſe the more familiarly with them, and encourage them to be brave and couragious.</p>
               <p>At the departure of the Army from <hi>Bachichich,</hi> it conſiſted of three hundred thouſand Horſe,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40153:69"/>
and five hundred thouſand Foot of ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had heard how the <hi>Turks</hi> had conquered all <hi>Greece</hi>; he imagined therefore, That as ſoon as <hi>Bajazet</hi> ſhould hear of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach he would depart out of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi> for his ſecurity, as Wiſdom and Reaſon oblig'd him, had he been well-adviſed: but his Pride and Preſumption caus'd him to take a contrary courſe to all the Rules of the Art of War; for as ſoon as <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army was at <hi>Buiſabuich,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Country of the <hi>Georgians, Axalla</hi> left the Van, which he commanded to ride back to the Prince, to acquaint him with Tydings that he knew would pleaſe him, That <hi>Bajazet</hi> had left the ſiege of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and was marching with all diligence to protect the Countries of <hi>Aſia</hi>; That he intended to fight him, and that for that purpoſe he had ſent for all the Troops that were in <hi>Greece,</hi> and gathered all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that he could poſſibly get from all Parts. He did not truſt ſo much to their Numbers, as to the Courages, Boldneſs, Skill and Experience of his <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> who had been train'd up in War, and knew not what it is to flye away. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was joyful at this news, but not inſolent; for he foreſaw the Event of a Battel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, That a ſmall number well-govern'd and bravely led on, is able to carry away the Victory from a more numerous Army.</p>
               <p>Three days he ſtop'd at <hi>Buiſabuich</hi> whiles his Troops were drawing towards <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that they might paſs over that River and live in the Enemies Country, and eaſe that of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates. Here the Prince ſent an Expreſs to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40153:70"/>
the Emperour, his Uncle, to inform him of the raiſing of the ſiege of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and of the reſolution of the <hi>Turks,</hi> to fight him in a pitch'd Battle. He intreated him, not knowing certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hazard of War, to prevent the worſt, and give order that the Borders of the Empire might be well-guarded and ſecured with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: That the Cavalry might be always ready with their Horſes, becauſe the Neighbouring peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are wont to fawn upon the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in his proſperity, change their minds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, and labour to ſpoil them when Fortune begins to frown. Therefore wiſe Princes, when they are ready to adventure their Army in a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Battle, always labour to ſecure the entry of their Dominions, for fear that victorious Enemy, in purſuance of his advantage, ſhould deprive him of the power of recovering his loſs by winning from him his Country. This was <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s conſtant practice in ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: He was more careful to call upon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and adviſe them to provide for their defence, than to ſend them notice of his Victory.</p>
               <p>The Army left <hi>Buiſabuich,</hi> after that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War had been held of the chief Officers and nobleſt Perſons, whom the Prince was wont to call together to propoſe his deſigns, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their advice. By this means he won their Affections, which he knew how to reward: ſuch perſons as were the fartheſt from him did ſometimes receive Teſtimonies and Marks of his goodneſs and of his eſteem, with which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured them, in the places where the Army conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a while, and when it was at a ſtand: But
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40153:70"/>
chiefly the Officers of Forraign Nations and of his Allies did often receive expreſſions of his bounty. He did frequently invite them to eat at his Table, where he did converſe with them in a very obliging manner, ſetting aſide for a while all gravity and incommodious reſervedneſs. Amongſt theſe ſtrangers the Lord of <hi>Vauchefu,</hi> a <hi>Chineſe</hi> was one of the moſt eſteemed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by him: He often ſaid, That the Vertue and Courage of <hi>Axalla,</hi> together with the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this Lord, had made him Maſter of one of the nobleſt Kingdoms of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Therefore to ſhew how thankful he was, the Prince had him often near his perſon, and diſcours'd with him concerning the Cuſtomes and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the People, through whoſe Country they march'd. This Lord brought with him ſome Troops out of <hi>China,</hi> which kept company with the reſt of the Army, and obſerved the ſame Order and Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Thus the Army arrived at <hi>Garga,</hi> where it paſs'd over the River <hi>Euphrates</hi>; the Van having gone over before at <hi>Chinſerig.</hi> The Rendezvous of the whole Army was appointed at <hi>Gianich,</hi> which was ſurrendred at the firſt ſummons. There <hi>Tamerlan</hi> underſtood, That <hi>Bajazet</hi> was within thirty Leagues of that place, which caus'd the <hi>Tartars</hi> to march more warily and more compact together. The greateſt part of the Cities and Towns in the way were yielded up into the Prince's Hands, who treated them very kindly; but thoſe that offered to reſiſt were ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, if the Inhabitants were <hi>Turks</hi>; but the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were commonly pardoned and ſet at liberty, for the ſake of the Emperour <hi>Emanuel
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40153:71"/>
Paleologue,</hi> whom the Prince was reſolved to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie in all things. <hi>Axalla,</hi> according to his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, cauſed them to take an Oath of Allegiance to this Prince, whom he intended to re-eſtabliſh in poſſeſſion of his whole Empire, and puniſh his dreadful Enemy, whoſe ambition carried him to attempt the ruine and deſtruction of the once flouriſhing Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> without minding how much the <hi>Tartars</hi> were obliged to defend it.</p>
               <p>This War undertaken by <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> againſt him who was commonly called the <hi>Thunder-bolt of Heaven,</hi> could not have a more juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ground; for beſides the horrid Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that he committed upon both Sexes, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to take away the Empire from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Prince, under a pretence of pacifying the troubles, and rob one who had never offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. He often flattered him with fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which he never fulfill'd, ſo that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd him to that extremity, that of a large Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, he had only a few ſmall Towns remaining to him about <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> unto which he had laid Siege. This undertaking therefore of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> was very honourable, to free this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour from an apparent Tyranny and Oppreſſion; and to pluck out of the unmerciful Hands of ſo barbarous an Enemy, a flouriſhing Empire, and the moſt Magnificent City of the World. In the proſecution of ſo honourable a deſign, he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with good reaſon, the bleſſing and aſſiſtance of the great God of Hoſts.</p>
               <p>In this little digreſſion, I have thought fit to ſhew the greatneſs of his courage that led, and inclined him naturally to help the feeble, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with unlawful Powers; and to oblige the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40153:71"/>
proud to liſten to reaſon, in imitation of God, unto whom all Soveraigns ſhould endeavour to be like.</p>
               <p>The Army left <hi>Granich</hi> with joy, and aſſurance of ſucceſs. <hi>Axalla,</hi> who Commanded the Van, ſent before <hi>Chianſon,</hi> Prince of <hi>Ciarran,</hi> with four thouſand <hi>Parthian</hi> Horſe, to learn ſome certain news of the Enemy. He commanded to deſtroy all places thereabouts with Fire and Sword, and to bring him word where <hi>Bajazet</hi> was, and what manner of Country was beyond <hi>Sannas.</hi> This Captain, who was highly eſteem'd in the Army, and Commanded in <hi>Axalla</hi>'s abſence the Van-Guard, ſent before his Party five hundred Horſe, Commanded by a <hi>Parthian</hi> Captain, who had not gone above ten Leagues but he had news of the Enemy; for as ſoon as he had ſurpris'd <hi>Sannas,</hi> he was told that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army was at <hi>Taraya,</hi> in their march to meet <hi>Tamerlan. Axalla</hi> ſent notice of this to the Prince, who commanded him to keep the place till the <hi>Turks</hi> were come up, and to let him underſtand every hour all the news that he could learn. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to march any further, becauſe he was already in a large and ſpacious Field, fit for a Battel. He was forc'd to precaution himſelf, and take care of his great buſineſs; becauſe he had to do with a War-like People us'd to fight againſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, a cunning People that want nothing to manage the buſineſs of War. He conſider'd therefore, that though his Army was more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than his Enemies, it was compos'd of many Nations, who were to be govern'd with diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for they were then to fight, not with the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> a delicate and effeminate People; but with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40153:72"/>
true Souldiers, who had no other hopes but in Victory. Therefore the Prince forgot nothing that might be uſeful to him, and help him in his buſineſs; for that purpoſe he ſent <hi>Axalla</hi> to take a view of the Ground unto which he intended to draw <hi>Bajazet,</hi> to have his advice whether it were fit for a Battel. It is ſcituated between the Sea, or the <hi>Pontus Euxinus</hi> and <hi>Gianich,</hi> near <hi>Sannas</hi>: on the one hand it is bounded by a little River that runs into <hi>Euphrates.</hi> He ſent him word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to have a care to keep <hi>Sannas</hi> as long as he could; and that in caſe they could not keep it, they ſhould ſet Fire to the Houſes and burn it, that the Enemy might not ſtop there, but advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Plain where he was reſolved to expect him, becauſe he was ſtronger than <hi>Bajazet</hi> in Horſe.</p>
               <p>At laſt <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s great Army, incourag'd with the hopes of victory and a deſire to engage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to aſſault the <hi>Tartars</hi> in <hi>Sannas</hi>; but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of them were gone, only ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Horſe having kindled the Fire, at the Enemy's approach fled with all ſpeed in ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Ciarcan</hi> having divided his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into two Bodies, and given ſpecial order to the firſt, that as ſoon as they ſhould ſee the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe iſſue out of <hi>Sannas</hi> and fly away, that they ſhould receive them and retreat behind him; for he had Poſted himſelf in a Valley with the other Body of Horſe, near a Wood, from whence he ſaw two thouſand <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſe, the Scouts of their Army, paſs by him. He charg'd them in the Rear, ſo ſpeedily, and with that cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; that when they ſaw themſelves ſo briskly aſſaulted and had not the time to look about,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40153:72"/>
they yielded and fought but faintly; retreating, many of them were killed, and taken Priſoners. This was the firſt Encounter between the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> wherein the Victory fell to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. All the Priſoners were ſent to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> and amongſt them the Baſſa of <hi>Natolia,</hi> their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. The Prince ſpoke to him, and ask'd him what had cauſed <hi>Bajazet</hi> to forget himſelf ſo ſtrangely, as not to regard him, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe his Army; that he hoped that in a few days he ſhould find one that would bring down his pride, and make him more tractable. The Baſſa anſwer'd, that his Lord was the Son of the World, that he could not endure a Partner; and that for his part, he had good cauſe to wonder at <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> for undertaking ſo long and dangerous an Expedition, to ſtop the Progreſs of his Prince's good ſucceſſes, whom Heaven favour'd, and to whom all the World yielded obedience; and that there was no diſcretion in him to withſtand him. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſaid Tamerlan, <hi>I am ſent and appointed by God, to chaſtiſe this proud Man, and to teach him that Inſolency deſerves the vengeance of Heaven; and that God delights as much to abaſe the proud, as to raiſe the humble Souls: That the raiſing of the Siege of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>was a beginning of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt his Maſter. And thou may'ſt,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>though I pity thy misfortune, underſtand what a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between my</hi> Parthian <hi>Horſe, and that of</hi> Bajazet'<hi>s. But, thinkeſt thou that thy Maſter will fight with me?</hi> The Baſſa reply'd, <hi>He deſires nothing more paſſionately.</hi> Afterwards he fell down at <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi>'s Feet, with theſe words; <hi>Noble Prince, I intreat you, ſuffer me, out of your generoſity, to aſſiſt my Prince that day. Tamerlan</hi> ſoon yielding to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40153:73"/>
his Requeſt, anſwered in this manner; <hi>Go and tell thy Maſter that thou haſt ſeen me, and that I ſhall be in Fight in that place where there ſhall be a green Flag hung out.</hi> The Baſſa ſurpriſed with ſuch a noble Grant, promis'd him, when he took his leave, that next to his Lord and Maſter, there was no Perſon in the World that he would ſerve with more affection, and ſooner than him.</p>
               <p>At his return to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army, he told <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> all the diſcourſe that he had with <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> and chiefly he told what he had wiſh'd him to ſay to him. <hi>We ſhall underſtand all theſe things very ſhortly,</hi> reply'd Bajazet, <hi>and before I have done, I will make him repent of his folly.</hi> The Baſſa ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd the favour that he had received from <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> and publiſh'd every-where his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and Goodneſs; extolling highly his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity in giving him a very beautiful Horſe, though he knew that he would uſe him in fighting againſt him. The next day the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army marched two Leagues, to come in ſight of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who were at Even about a League diſtant from it, expecting the day following, in which the great Diſpute was to be. The Night was not very peaceable, the noiſe of Men, and the neighing of Horſes filled the Air, and cauſed every one to deſire the return of the Sun, to give liberty to their courages to act in this Field of <hi>Mars.</hi> The <hi>Scythians,</hi> that love Prey and Plunder, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by their Leaders, to behave themſelves valiantly, in hopes of the rich Spoils which the Victory would deliver into their Hands. The <hi>Parthians,</hi> who were ambitious of the glory and honour of their Nation, were obliged to do their uttermoſt endeavour to overcome the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40153:73"/>
                  <hi>Turks,</hi> who alone were able to diſpute with them for the Empire of <hi>Aſia.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who were very numerous in the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army, for they were near the fourth part, were animated with a hatred againſt their mortal Enemy, whoſe defeat would prove the liberty of <hi>Greece.</hi> In this manner, in the night, the ſeveral Nations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd one another according to their ſeveral diſpoſitions. The Prince walk'd about his Camp in the night, hearkening to their Diſcourſes, which rejoyced his heart becauſe they had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain aſſurance of obtaining the Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alhacent</hi> walk'd along with him: The Prince told him, That the night before his Fight with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> his Camp was full of Songs of Triumph and Rejoycings, and that none of the Souldiers could ſleep, which caus'd him to be perſwaded of the Victory he obtain'd: <hi>I ſee,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the ſame preſage now of the next days hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and ſucceſs.</hi> When he had gone round his Camp he return'd to his Tent, at the end of the ſecond Watch, and laid himſelf down upon a Carpet to take a little reſt, but could not ſleep, for he was impatient to ſee the appearance of the next day. In the mean whiles he commanded <hi>Alhacent</hi> to bring him the Book, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly read, containing the Hiſtories of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Forefathers, and the worthy deeds of the moſt famous men of his Country. He light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in opening of the Book, upon the Relation of a great Battel which his Grand-father loſt, fighting againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> which he thought before to win, and had got it, had he not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked them indiſcreetly, and neglected the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that were offered him, truſting too
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40153:74"/>
much to his own and his peoples Courages. He commanded <hi>Alhacent</hi> to read over that paſſage once more, with this ſaying, <hi>I read often this deſcription of that Battel before I engage in a fight, that I might not truſt ſo much to my Lyons Skin, that I neglect the uſe of the Foxes Tail to cover my head; That this fault of my Grand father, in leaving his advantagious ground, againſt the advice and intreaties of his Servants, to aſſault an Enemy in his Trenches, might cauſe me to be more wary and cautious.</hi> A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after he ask'd whether it were day, and ſent for his great <hi>Chamberlain</hi> to cauſe the Trumpet to ſound, that his Horſes might be made ready: He reſted himſelf a little longer, and ask'd for <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla,</hi> who came to him with ſeveral other Lords and chief Officers of his Army. He advis'd with them what was beſt to obſerve, and took Horſe, ſending them all to their ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Immediately after news came to him, That the <hi>Turks</hi> were drawing near, and entring into the Field. He was very deſirous to ſee them in their march, that he might be better able to order his Army according to that manner. He moved them from the place where he ſtood, ſending before three thouſand Horſe to begin a light skirmiſh, whiles he appointed to every one his Rank and Place.</p>
               <p>In this view of the Enemy he had taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, That the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Infantry, named <hi>Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> kept the middle, having upon each Wing two Bodies of Horſe, amounting to about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand, and that there was another Body that went before and covered all the Foot. This order ſeem'd to him very ſtrong, and not eaſie to be broken. <hi>I was once reſolved,</hi> ſaid he to <hi>Axalla,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40153:74"/>
to fight on foot, but now I ſee I muſt be on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back to encourage my men to break through that great Body of</hi> Janiſaries, <hi>which I ſhall ſuffer, advance as far as they pleaſe. I will have fifty thouſand Foot on each Wing, and forty thouſand Horſe of my beſt Cavalry in the middle; behind them there ſhall be fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Horſe in three Bodies, which you ſhall command, and I will follow and ſecond you with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand Horſe more, where I intend to be in perſon; behind me I will have one hundred thouſand Foot, who ſhall march in two Battalions; the Reer ſhall be compoſed of forty thouſand Horſe, and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, who ſhall not ſtrike a ſtroke till I ſhall want them. The reſerve ſhall be ten thouſand of my ſtouteſt Horſe, whom I will ſend to the places that ſhall have moſt need.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Ciarcan,</hi> a famous Commander of great worth, led the firſt forty thouſand Horſe. The Lord <hi>Synopes,</hi> a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Axalla,</hi> his Lieutenant-General of the Infantry, a Captain of a great Reputation, was at the Head of the firſt Infantry; Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> followed him with fifty thouſand Horſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Army ſeem'd to be very beautiful and numerous, marching towards the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who ſtood to their Ground without ſtirring; only ſome ſingle Troops, <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites</hi> went ſometimes between the two Armies to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh a little; but theſe bold Fellows performed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of conſequence for the winning of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               <p>At that moment a Spy was taken who inform'd <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> That <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who was then on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, encouraging his Men, intended to fight that day amongſt his <hi>Janiſaries</hi> a-foot. Theſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40153:75"/>
                  <hi>Janiſaries</hi> are certain brave and faithful Souldiers, brought up from their Infancy in Feats of Armes, and choſen out of all the Chriſtian Nations; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and ſtrong of Body, and of a good Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are train'd up from their Child-hood together, and are eſteem'd invincible. They fight for their Prince and Lord with a ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, in the form of a Half-Moon about his Perſon: They were then about thirty thouſand in number. <hi>Bajazet</hi> confided moſt in them, not regarding the reſt of his Infantry, which was nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous; for they were People gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from ſeveral places. He had a brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Horſe, about one hundred and forty thouſand, very well experienced in all manner of Fights. He had alſo above thirty thouſand <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meluks,</hi> very good Horſemen; and forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, ſent to him from the Souldan of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> to help him. So that his Army ſeem'd to be as great as <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s, which ſtood cloſer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and march'd in ſeveral Lines; whereas <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi>'s had but one, and appear'd in one Front: It march'd on with a great noiſe, and grievous threatnings; whereas <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army obſerved a great ſilence, in expectation of the Signal.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as publick Prayers were ended, the Emperour appear'd in the Van, to be witneſs of the firſt On-ſet, cauſing <hi>Axalla</hi> to advance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; he himſelf returned to his reſolved Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he had called upon every one to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves well. It is not to be imagin'd how furiouſly the <hi>Turks</hi> aſſaulted the Prince of <hi>Ciarcan,</hi> who had orders not to fight until the Enemy were in their march, and had begun to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack him. The place was a large Plain of a vaſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40153:75"/>
extent, where the advantage was equal for both Parties; only there was a River on <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s left hand, which he look'd upon as a benefit to his Army; ſo that he gave an expreſs and a ſtrict Command, not to ſuffer the <hi>Turks</hi> to take it from them, becauſe of that ſide which he eſteem'd the beſt for his Men to fight. It was always his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in War, to ſuffer his Enemy to begin the Encounter; therefore he ordered the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of his Van-Guard to ſtay till the Enemy did firſt aſſault them. In the mean while the Prince of <hi>Ciarcan,</hi> with his forty thouſand Horſe, was almoſt overthrown. He did all that could have been expected from a great courage, and a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Commander: He broke into the middle of the <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> where <hi>Bajazet</hi> was, and diſorder'd them; but his valour, that overturn'd all things in his way, was ſoon ſtop'd with an Arrow that ſtruck him to the heart. At that time <hi>Axalla</hi> went on with his Men, and charg'd one of the Enemies Wings, where he meeting with no great reſiſtance cut them all to pieces. His Infantry came then up to him, according to appointment, and with it he aſſaulted the <hi>Janiſaries.</hi> The Prince conſidering the difficult Task that <hi>Axalla</hi> was to have, ſent him ten thouſand Horſe out of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; as well to favour the rallying of ſuch as ſhould be diſorder'd, as to charge a Body of Foot which were marching on to help the <hi>Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> who behaved themſelves gallantly for the glory and ſafety of their Prince. The Fight laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a full hour before any Perſon did offer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. The <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Parthians,</hi> with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful obſtinacy, killed one another in heaps: Men and Horſes covered the Ground, in their
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40153:76"/>
Gore-Blood, lying one upon another. Here you might have ſeen ſome falling dead upon thoſe that they had newly kill'd: There you might have beheld ſome breathing out their laſt Gaſp with threatning looks. In every place were heard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, groans, and the cryes of the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dying Souldiers. The Prince beheld this fight patiently, looking for the end; but when he perceived that his Men decreas'd, and ſeem'd to be too weak, he ſent ten thouſand Horſe to ſecond the ten thouſand appointed for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and commanded them to fall on as ſoon as they ſhould ſee that need requir'd. In the mean while the Emperour enter'd into the Battel with his Party, and broke through all that ſtood in his way; and the Infantry, Commanded by the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> advanc'd and aſſaulted the <hi>Janiſaries</hi> where <hi>Bajazet</hi> was yet in Perſon. They found no eaſie work to overthrow them; but when the Emperour had again charged them the ſecond time, and followed by his Reer, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them rather by his number than by valour or courage; for they performed all that could be expected from brave Men: but ſo many On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets one upon the Neck of another, by freſh Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, oppreſs'd them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> forſook this Body of <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> and took Horſe, wounded, but he fell into the Hands of <hi>Axalla</hi>; unto whom he yielded himſelf Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, thinking he had been <hi>Tamerlan.</hi> He was at firſt taken for ſome great Lord of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army. Twenty thouſand of the <hi>Tartars</hi> never acted, but after the Fight in purſuit of the flying Enemy, whom they kill'd by heaps. The Prince had his Horſe run through, and kill'd with a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40153:76"/>
Lance; but he was quickly mounted again. One may juſtly ſay, that his Conduct alone won the Victory; for had his Army ingag'd all at once, they had been in that ſtrange confuſion that might have overthrown them: but his cunning to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the <hi>Turks</hi> in fighting, and recruit his own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties when they were in want, got him the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Threeſcore thouſand Men were kill'd of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and about twenty thouſand <hi>Tartars.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Ciarcan,</hi> and the Captain of the <hi>Georgians</hi> both loſt their Lives, to the great ſorrow of the whole Army. <hi>Calibes,</hi> that brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, who brought up the Reer, was vex'd to meet with ſuch ſmall reſiſtance, and to have had ſo little hand in the Action. The <hi>Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> a Chriſtian, who fought for <hi>Bajazet,</hi> was taken Priſoner; every one prais'd him for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well behaved himſelf that day. The prince received him very kindly, after that he had bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him for ſerving <hi>Bajazet,</hi> againſt him that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended nothing but to aſſiſt and ſet at liberty his Emperour. The <hi>Deſpot</hi> anſwered, That what he had done was not out of Duty, or Inclination for the good of <hi>Bajazet</hi>; but only for fear of loſing his Dominions, which he ſaw were expoſed to the ambition, and at the mercy of him, to whom all the World before ſeem'd to yield obedience. <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> pretty well ſatisfied with this excuſe, gave him his freedom to depart when he thought convenient. The Emperour had a great care to ſecure <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Children, and to cauſe their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be cured of his Wounds; afterwards he commanded him to be brought before him: <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> ſhewed no ſign of humility. The Prince ſeem'd to be diſpleas'd at his proud carriage; he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40153:77"/>
told him therefore, That his Life depended upon his will, and with a word-ſpeaking he could take it from him; <hi>Speak the word, I intreat thee,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd Bajazet; <hi>for it will be my greateſt happineſs. How comeſt thou,</hi> ſaid Tamerlan to him, <hi>to be ſo bold, to take away the Empire from the Prince of</hi> Greece? <hi>The deſire of glory,</hi> anſwer'd Bajazet, <hi>and of enlarging my Kingdom. But wherefore,</hi> ſaid the Prince, <hi>doſt thou commit ſo many Cruelties, and uſe thy conquered Subjects ſo barbarouſly, as to ſpare neither Age nor Sex? I act thus,</hi> anſwered he, <hi>to terrifie mine Enemies the more. For the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> replyd'd the Prince, <hi>thou ſhalt be treated in the ſame manner.</hi> With that he ſent him away, and turned to his Commanders; <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>a proud and haughty Man, that deſerves to be puniſh'd and made an Example, to all ſuch cruel and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous People as he is. I confeſs God hath this day ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and put in my power, a great Enemy; I am bound to return him thanks.</hi> Afterwards he ſent for <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi>'s Children to be brought to him, he ſeem'd to pity their misfortune, and commanded them to be civilly and courteouſly treated, as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of a great Monarch. He commanded next that, to bury the dead. The Body of the Prince of <hi>Ciarcan</hi> was found amongſt the <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> where he was ingag'd; <hi>Tamerlan</hi> expreſs'd a great deal of ſorrow for the loſs of this young Prince, who was his Kinſman, and likely to do him great ſervice. A great number of Captains were killed this day, and almoſt all the Officers of the <hi>Turks,</hi> for the Fight was fierce and bloody, for the Fight continued from ſeven a Clock in the Morning, till four in the Afternoon; and then it was not well known who ſhould win the Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:40153:77"/>On the third day after the Fight the Army march'd away, for the firſt was employed in bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dead, every one render'd that Duty to their Friends and Kindred. The Body of the Prince of <hi>Ciarcan</hi> was Embalmed, and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Guard of two thouſand Horſe to <hi>Samar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cande,</hi> to be there kept till the Emperour's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. The other Corpſes were buried in <hi>Sannas,</hi> with honour. <hi>Axalla</hi> was grieved for the death of his Kinſman, a brave bold and couragious young Man, well beloved of the Prince: His Command was given to his Brother, who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then great ſigns of a noble courage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alhacent</hi> ſaith, That he could not but make that day a Reflexion upon the unconſtancy and vanity of worldly things, ſufficiently repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Battel. At the beginning <hi>Bajazet,</hi> the dreadful Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above all changes of Fortune, having met with nothing on Earth able to withſtand his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but a few hours after he is caſt down, and with a blow his flouriſhing Eſtate overthrown when he leaſt expected it. This cauſed him to confeſs ſince, that he had been deſervedly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for having deſpiſed great Armies, and placed all his confidence in the valour of his Horſemen, and of his <hi>Janiſaries.</hi> He was three days as it were in a deſpairing condition, fretting and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting himſelf; he ſought to kill himſelf, and called for Death to deliver him out of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> who was the mildeſt, the moſt courteous and compaſſionate Prince, yet could he not be perſwaded to pity him; for he dealt with him as with a furious Beaſt, ſo that when he mounted upon his Horſe, upon ſolemn Feſtivals,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40153:78"/>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> was brought to him that his Shoulder might ſerve him as a ſtep to leap upon his Horſe. This he did not out of any Oſtentation, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to humble <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and diſcover to him the folly of Men; who ſeek in themſelves, and not in God, all their greatneſs and confidence.</p>
               <p>The next day the Army marched the way that leads to <hi>Burſa,</hi> whither the ſad remains of <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi>'s Army were fled, under the Command of Baſſa <hi>Muſtapha.</hi> All the Country through which <hi>Tamerlan</hi> paſs'd, ſubmitted. He commanded all the Fortreſſes to be demoliſh'd, and puniſh'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely thoſe that offered to withſtand him and endure a Siege.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had caus'd ſeveral Priſ'ners to be led in Chains after the Body of the Prince of <hi>Ciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> to <hi>Samarcande</hi>: He intended to enlarge that City, and increaſe the Inhabitants; that it might be a Teſtimony of his Glory, and a Monument of his Grandeur to future Ages. For that purpoſe he had caus'd many <hi>Chineſes,</hi> taken in the former Battels, to be carried thither, and ſome he had invited out of <hi>Pekin</hi> and <hi>Quanton.</hi> This famous Battel that overthrew <hi>Bajazet</hi> filled all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with fears, and obliged them to ſubmit to the Conquerour. Nothing was able to reſiſt <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan,</hi> till he arrived with his Army before <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> whither his defeated Troops were fled and ſhut up, with two of his Male Children, very young. In the mean while <hi>Axalla</hi> advanc'd forward, with forty thouſand Horſe, and an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot without any incumbrance, or Baggage: with them he hinder'd the Enemy from rallying, and made a terrible deſtruction of the <hi>Turks</hi>; freeing the <hi>Grecians</hi> from the Tyranny of the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:40153:78"/>
Family. At laſt he came to the Walls of <hi>Burſa,</hi> from whence all that were able <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The two Children of <hi>Bajazet</hi> were ſent to the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, to be Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and brought up. The reſt of the <hi>Turks</hi> were fled to <hi>Gallipoli,</hi> and paſſed over to <hi>Adrianople</hi>; a City which they had taken from the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> he had diſpatch'd to the Emperour his Uncle, and the Empreſs his Wife, one of his moſt truſty Servants, named <hi>Lieban,</hi> who was as the firſt Gentleman of his Chamber, to carry them the joyful news of the Victory, which was far more glorious than any that he had ever gain'd before: He ſent them alſo the Bow and Cymitar of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and the Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of his Horſe, which were valued at above two hundred thouſand Ducats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lieban</hi> was mighty welcome to the old Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the young Empreſs; chiefly when they underſtood that the whole World render'd Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> who nevertheleſs received all theſe advantages from the hand of God, without growing inſolent or proud: When Providence favour'd him moſt, he ſeem'd to be mildeſt and moſt courteous. He was never rough but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before a Battel, that he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deliver his Orders with more State and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. None could deſcribe his temper in an adverſe Fortune, for he had always Proſperity to favour him. But it is commonly ſeen, that thoſe whom good ſucceſſes cannot puff up with pride, are not caſt down in adverſity.</p>
               <p>When he had given theſe needful Orders, he marched to <hi>Burſa,</hi> loaden with the Spoils of his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40153:79"/>
Enemies; which yet increaſed daily, by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of many Towns that were yielded up to him. He treated them all as he had done the Cities of <hi>China,</hi> where the Inhabitants, that brought him their Keys and ſubmitted, were kindly uſed; but thoſe that refuſed to yield were cruelly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd: for it is wiſdom in a Conquerour to treat the People in that manner.</p>
               <p>In the March of the Army, news were brought that <hi>Axalla</hi> had taken <hi>Burſa,</hi> and capitulated with the Citizens in the Emperour's Name; but the Garriſon had been driven out by the Inhabitants, and cut in pieces. <hi>Axalla</hi> ſent the Prince word of the coming of a ſolemn Embaſſie, from <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, of the moſt illuſtrious Perſons of his Court; but that he had hinder'd them from advancing further until <hi>Tamerlan</hi> ſhould ſend him order. He wiſhed them to ſtay where they were, commanding them to be well treated till <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s arrival; which happen'd a few days after. All the Inhabitants went out to meet him with their Heads uncovered, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their ſubmiſſion and ſubjection to him. He was carried in great Pomp and Glory: <hi>Axalla</hi> met him alſo with the Embaſſadours, whom the Prince received very honourably and courteouſly, ſhewing before them his Glory and Magnificence. He led them about his Army, which in a Camp appear'd as a great City. All manner of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were brought into it every day from all Parts; for there was an admirable Order ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>Theſe Embaſſadours had Orders from the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, <hi>Emanuel,</hi> to offer and yield up his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40153:79"/>
and Perſon to the Prince's pleaſure; to hold his Dominions, he and his Poſterity after him, as his Vaſſals and Subjects. The Embaſſadours were alſo Commiſſioned to tell him, That he offer'd him all his good, as due to him, for the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit he had received by the deliverance from the cruelleſt Tyrant of the World; whatſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he would ſend for, he ſhould have. That he was ſo much oblig'd to <hi>Tamerlan</hi> for his pains and great labours in ſo long and tedious an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and for the Blood of ſo many thouſands of his Subjects, that he could not poſſibly requite him, but by yielding himſelf and all his People into his Hands. That he engag'd himſelf, and promis'd to ſerve him and obey him faithfully. That ſo many rare Vertues and excellent Qualities, which had render'd his Name famous to all the World, had won his heart and affections. That he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired earneſtly to ſee him in his chief City, to put it into his power, and yield him up the Empire of <hi>Greece</hi>; where he intreated him that he might continue, only that he might oblige his People to be more obedient to his Orders.</p>
               <p>After this Audience, the Embaſſadours expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing leſs, but that they ſhould fall under a new Maſter. What they had offer'd, ſo great and ſo delicate a thing, to ſuch a Conquerour as <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan,</hi> that it was not to be refuſed. All that they deſired was, that their offers might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted kindly and civilly. But the Prince's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their Meſſage, cauſed them quickly to change their minds and their thoughts of him; for, with a mild and courteous ſpeech, he told them; That he was not come ſo far, and had not
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40153:80"/>
taken that pains, to ſubdue new Kingdoms and Empires: That the advantage to be expected thereby could not make him amends for the greatneſs of his labours and dangers: That the Motive which had oblig'd him to act and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this Enterpriſe, was more noble and more worthy of <hi>Tamerlan</hi>; for he purpoſed to himſelf no other benefit but glory and honour, and to render his Name famous to the ſucceeding Ages all over the World: That he deſir'd them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that he was there only to aſſiſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <hi>Emanuel,</hi> as his Friend and Ally, and at his requeſt; and that his deſigns had ſucceeded well, becauſe God had bleſſed his juſt intentions: that he knew very well, that by the help and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Almighty, rather than by the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his Souldlers, he had overthrown the Power of the cruelleſt Enemy of Mankind: That it was his deſire to re-eſtabliſh the ancient Family of the <hi>Paleologues</hi> in the full and free poſſeſſion of the <hi>Greekiſh</hi> Empire, of all their Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and in a peaceable enjoyment of the City of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>; that he might render thereby his Name the more famous: That he ſcorn'd that any Perſon ſhould ſay of him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that he had falſified his Faith, prejudic'd his Honour; and that under Colour of helping his Friend and Ally, he had taken from him his Empire and Eſtate: That he deſired the Services that he had render'd to the Emperour <hi>Emanuel,</hi> might never be forgotten by his Poſterity, and that they might acknowledge them with thanks: And that for his part, he was fully ſatisfied with the honour and glory of the ſucceſs alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40153:80"/>
any other benefit. He told them alſo, That it concern'd the Emperour <hi>Emanuel</hi> to take ſuch a courſe at preſent, and give ſuch Orders, that his Army's preſence might ſecure his Intereſt for the future, and ſettle his Empire in peace, ſo as that he might have no cauſe to fear a relapſe into the ſame danger as before. That he would commit the two Sons of <hi>Bajazet</hi> into his Hands, to treat them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he ſhould judge moſt convenient; and that he advis'd him to be more circumſpect and careful in the choice of his Miniſters, that he might not be miſ-led; and that he intreated him to value and eſteem his friendſhip, which ſhould never fail him in time of need.</p>
               <p>It is not to be imagin'd how joyful the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours were, to hear this courteous and generous Speech from the Prince's Mouth; to refuſe a large and rich Empire, and the moſt ſtately and magnificent City of the World; few Princes would have had that extraordinary moderation. But it is not to be expected that many <hi>Tamerlans</hi> ſhould live in theſe corrupt Ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> had Orders to treat and feaſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, and to ſhew them all the honour and courteſie poſſible. One of them was ſent with all ſpeed, to carry news to his Maſter of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Embaſſie, which had proved more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous than could have been expected. When therefore the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour had underſtood fully the the truth, the whole City was tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with joy, the Churches were throng'd with Votaries; and there was nothing to be ſeen every where, but Bone-Fires, feaſtings, and a publick rejoycing of all the People, that extoll'd <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>'s
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40153:81"/>
Name, and prais'd him for his wonderful moderation. The <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour called his Council, to conſult whether it were not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him to go and meet <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to him his thanks Perſonally, for all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and labours. It was reſolved that he ſhould, without delay, go in Perſon. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this intent, ſeem'd to be very joyful. He commanded <hi>Axalla</hi> to meet the Emperour, the firſt day of his departure, to aſſure him that <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> would look upon it as a very great honour, and would be mighty glad to ſee him in the City of <hi>Burſa.</hi> When the <hi>Greekiſh</hi> Emperour was near the Gates, the Prince went to meet him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him in great State and Pomp. They were together one whole day, which was ſpent in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of kindneſs, affection, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, which they exchang'd one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The next day the <hi>Greekiſh</hi> Emperour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the City, and the Prince accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him with the ſame obliging and noble manner as he had received him. After his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Tamerlan</hi> diſcover'd an inclination to ſee the famous City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which was then look'd upon as the Wonder of the World; but he deſired to go <hi>incognito,</hi> that he might avoid all jealouſies and fears. <hi>Axalla</hi> mannag'd this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo ſecretly, that the Prince's departure was not known. He was there received by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Emanuel,</hi> without Ceremony, as a private Perſon: But he endeavoured by all poſſible means, to ſatisfie <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s curioſity, and to ſhew him all the Rarities of the City: every day he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him with new delights and ſatisfactions.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40153:81"/>
He was the more pleas'd, becauſe he was known to none but to thoſe unto whom he deſired to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf; for he and all his Train were clothed in <hi>Greekiſh</hi> Habits. Therefore, when he was gone, the Citizens were ſurpris'd to hear that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had been to ſee their City. The <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour had ſhewn him all the pleaſant Gardens, and beautiful Palaces that ſtand near the Sea, about a league or two round the City. They walk'd together as two private Perſons: Thus they ſpent five or ſix days, with much ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction on both ſides. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> did often confeſs ſince, that he had never ſeen a more glorious Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: that it was worthy, in regard of its advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous ſcituation, to command the whole World. He look'd with admiration, upon the rich and ſtately Buildings; the rare Pillars, with all their Ornaments; the wonderful Pyramides of ſuch a prodigious height, which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great had erected, in imitation of thoſe of <hi>Egypt.</hi> He admired all the beautiful Gardens, ſo neat and curious; and declared that he was never ſorry for his Expedition, becauſe he had thereby ſaved from burning and plunder, the nobleſt and moſt beautiful City of the World. He was often heard to praiſe the Emperour <hi>Emanuel,</hi> for his mildneſs and humanity. When he knew that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> delighted in beautiful Horſes, he gave him thirty of ſuch a rare ſhape, ſtrength, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, that they could not be matched in the World. He preſented him alſo with the richeſt Cloaths of Gold and Silk in the Country: and ſent great Gifts to all his Lords and Princes of the Army: And whilſt it continued in that place,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40153:82"/>
he provided all things needful for the Souldiers, in ſuch plenty, that no Perſon had cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of want. At laſt, after fifteen days ſtay at <hi>Burſa,</hi> and a ſtrict Alliance concluded upon between the two Princes; <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his deſign, reſolved to viſit the Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> before his departure to his own Country, to chaſtiſe him, becauſe he had aſſiſted <hi>Bajazet</hi> againſt him; for in all his proceedings he ſhew'd himſelf dreadful to the Enemies that had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and mild and courteous to his Friends.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Tamerlan's</hi> War and Expedition againſt the Sultan of Aegypt.</head>
               <p>THe Army departed very well ſatisfied from <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> which <hi>Tamerlan</hi> delivered to the Greekiſh Emperour, after that he had driven away the Turks from all ſtrong Holds, and recover'd all that they had won, ſince the beginning of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s reign. All his Souldiers were fled, either beyond the Mountains, or over Sea into <hi>Europe.</hi> There was no place in all <hi>Aſia,</hi> that held for him; ſo dreadful had <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Army been to the Turks, that they forſook all their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in <hi>Aſia. Andronicus Palealogus,</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Nephew, accompanied the Army with ten thouſand choſen Horſe, which his Unkle had ſent with him to ſerve in the Wars againſt the Sultan of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with whoſe Army <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had ſeveral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, when they aſſiſted <hi>Bajazet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt all theſe ſucceſſes and proſperities, the Prince received the joyful news of the birth of a Son, of which the Empreſs his Wife was happily delivered: This cauſed the whole Army to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate their Princes happineſs, by publick feaſting, Bone-fires, and all other tokens of an univerſal joy. He underſtood by the ſame expreſs, that all things were in peace in the Empire, that the old Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, his Unkle, was in perfect health, which pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him well; for he was afraid, that he ſhould drop away in his abſence, and that ſome great Perſons,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40153:83"/>
or certain Favourites ſhould cauſe a diſturbance and a diviſion in his abſence amongſt his Subjects, tho the example of the other Rebels, who had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently puniſh'd for their folly, ought to have made them wiſe; and beſides, when a Prince hath his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in his hand, and is become dreadful to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, he need not much fear any rebellious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and practiſes at home amongſt his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. For commonly men, that are the moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, follow him in the War; but when a Prince is ſoft and effeminate, the Souldiers, that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imployment, runs to him, who makes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt complaints, and who commonly vails his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretences with an appearance of a juſt grievance. In ſuch a caſe, before a diſarmed Prince is able to gather together his Troops, and make new levies of Men to compoſe a Body of an Army, the Rebellion may chance to be increas'd, and the Rebels grown ſo numerous, that they may perhaps be too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for their inconſiderate Prince.</p>
               <p>Six months were ſpent ſince <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s leaving of <hi>Samarcand.</hi> This time ſeem'd tedious to ſome, whoſe earneſt deſire to ſee their Country gave them a longing to march that way. This cauſed many of them to murmur in the Camp, becauſe the Prince began to undertake a War in a far Country, which would not ſuddenly end. This report, which might have had a dangerous ſequel, obliged Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> to acquaint the Emperour therewith.</p>
               <p>He preſently called his Army together, as ſoon as they were arrived to a place convenient, and ſpake to them at the general muſter, in ſuch terms as were able to oblige them to undergo all hardſhip for their Princes ſervice.</p>
               <p>

                              <hi>I</hi> Cannot imagine, my dear Companions, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſeeing again your Native Country is ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in you, or that you are weary to purchaſe more Glory to our Nation, ſeeing that all the people of the World adventure all things for that advantage which you have in hand, we have together for many years obtain'd great Victories, which have rais'd the <hi>Parthians</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation above all other Nations, and ſpread their fame round about the World.</p>
                           <p>If you be weary to fight under my Command, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> ſhall accompliſh his glorious deſigns by other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than his own, and the <hi>Parthian,</hi> ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd by the late ſucceſſes obtained upon many people, ſhall ſee themſelves forgotten or miſerably deſpiſed, through the ſhame that you ſhall have brought upon them. I cannot think any ſuch thing of you, fellow Souldiers, whoſe Reputation is ſpread all over the World, I will not, nor ought not to believe it.

You know very well, though they live at a diſtance from us, they have endeavoured to withſtand our ſucceſſes by joyning their forces with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Armies to oppoſe us: Will you ſuffer me to revenge my ſelf upon them without your help?

                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:40153:84"/>As ſoon as the Prince had ended his ſpeech, all the <hi>Parthians</hi> cryed out with a loud voice, that they would die with him; and that, ſaying they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon him in <hi>China,</hi> they would now follow him all over the world; but they intreated him to have compaſſion of their Wounds, of their gray hairs, ſo as at laſt to ſet ſome bounds to their labors, and his Conqueſts. This he promis'd them in ſuch an obliging and mild manner, that they were all very well ſatisfied. The Emperour ſpoke not a word to the others, for they were glad of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they had over the <hi>Parthians,</hi> to have ſeen them ready to disband and forſake the Army. So that, when <hi>Tamerlan</hi> rode before the Scythian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, they all cried with one voice, <hi>Victorious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, what mean you, March on, March on, we will follow all over the World.</hi> Theſe words gave a great contentment to the Prince, for the <hi>Parthians</hi> and Scythians were his beſt Souldiers. He was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore glad of an opportunity to encreaſe their emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To oblige them the more to be faithful to him, the Prince commanded a ſtrict inquiry to be made for all perſons diſeaſed or wounded, and beſides their ordinary ſalary he appointed them and others to receive from the Treaſurer of the Army extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wages.</p>
               <p>Then the Army marched forward with much joy and aſſurance of ſucceſs. The Vanguard, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Axalla,</hi> and <hi>Andronicus,</hi> went before. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had news how that the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> was very active in gathering his men together to defend himſelf and his Country; though he could eaſily gueſſe how difficult a matter it was to ſtop the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and fury of a victorious Army, that had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40153:84"/>
the moſt dreadful Monarch of all <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations made the Mamelucks look about. But the <hi>Sultan</hi> was a young Prince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to that high dignity by his extroardina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courage and rare Vertues, but he had no great inſight in War. But ſince his Election he had not given any proof of his valour and affection to his people. He ſaw himſelf the Lord of a large Continent and of many ſtrong Towers well provided and fortified; therefore out of an high conceit of his own greatneſs, and of the confidence that he had in himſelf, he reſolved to try whether fortune would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him; but rather than to loſe ſo fair an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of declaring his courage, he was willing to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his own ruine. As the wining of a battle was all his hopes, he made for that purpoſe all neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to be ready to fight when ever he ſhould be required; and in caſe the victory ſhould fall to his Enemies ſhare, he had ſo order'd his affairs, that he might fly to ſome ſafe and ſecure place of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, where he might recover his loſs, and be in a Condition to venture a ſecond Battel.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Emperour was well informed of his intention, he adviſed with <hi>Axalla</hi> and <hi>Andronicus</hi> which way he ſhould turn the head of his army, that he might force the Enemy to come the ſooner to a battle. It was reſolved by them, that it ſhould take the way through <hi>Caramania</hi> and march ſtrait to <hi>Gevolach.</hi> This was the firſt frontier Town belonging to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melucks, and neareſt to the Turks dominions, who had conquer'd all the Countrey as far as that place, when the peace had been concluded between theſe two Nations. <hi>Bajazet</hi> had endeavoured to have it, that he may receive ſure ſuccours that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40153:85"/>
way from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and ſtrengthen himſelf the more againſt the powerful enemy, that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt him. Therefore this Town, which was of a ſtrong ſcituation, had been furniſh'd with all neceſſaries by the <hi>Sultan</hi> for a ſtout reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> advancing with his Van-guard ſent a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the Townſmen to yeild ſpeedily, or to expect a ſevere puniſhment for their fooliſh confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and temerity. The Inhabitants return'd this anſwer. That they were obedient Subjects, and had expreſs orders to fight it out, and reſiſt as long as they could, and that they would rather ſuffer death than fail in their duty and fidelity to their Prince and Country.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour heard their obſtinacy he was wrath, that a ſmall Town ſhould be ſo bold as to attempt to ſtop his power, ſeeing that he had met with no place able to reſiſt him ſince his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Samarcand,</hi> for all Cities ſent him their Keys when he was yet at a diſtance from them. But ſeem'd to diſſemble a while his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and commanded <hi>Axalla</hi> to go beyond it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Aleppo,</hi> which willingly was ſurrender'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no other Garriſon there but of the natural Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> being highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd at this great affront of thoſe of <hi>Gevolach,</hi> was reſolved to beſiege it; for that purpoſe he caus'd it to be ſurrounded, and his Infantry to make their approaches by the means of his Engines and Artillery. They gave a furious aſſault, but were driven back with the loſs of about twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> more angry than before at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, cauſed the Town to be aſſaulted the ſecond
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40153:85"/>
time, the Prince was then wounded, but mauger the enemies ſtout reſiſtance, <hi>Tamerlans</hi> men won the Walls, from whence they ſhot continually and killed a great many within. At this ſame time the Prince was informed that the <hi>Sultan</hi> was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening to ſuccour and relieve <hi>Gevolach,</hi> according to his promiſe to the Inhabitants. This news caus'd him to repent, that he had ſuffer'd <hi>Axalla</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſo far before the reſt of the Army. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his fault, he reſolved to go and joyn with him, hoping by this means to ſurprize the Enemy, who doubtleſs would think that <hi>Axalla</hi> was alone, and would not imagine, that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> could be ſo near at hand, for this purpoſe he left the Prince of <hi>Taenais,</hi> with thirty thouſand men, to continue the ſiege, and march'd with the reſt of his Army with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out baggage towards <hi>Borgas.</hi> There he heard that the Sultan was gone over the River at <hi>Confingan,</hi> with about threeſcore and fourteen thouſand horſe, and one hundred thouſand foot. In purſuance of his deſign, he underſtood at <hi>Aleppo</hi> the place where the Enemy was encamp'd, intending to ſurprize him, for that purpoſe he ſent <hi>Axalla</hi> about half a dayes journey before, and followed him with the remainder of the Army. Fourteen or fifteen of the Scouts were cut in pieces before their Comrades could help them, becauſe the wayes were uneven and crooked.</p>
               <p>The Enemy was miſinform'd, they Imagin'd that only the Troops about <hi>Aleppo</hi> were near them which <hi>Axalla</hi> commanded.</p>
               <p>They fell therefore upon him ſooner than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; without delay he gave notice of it to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, at the ſame inſtant intreating him to make all
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40153:86"/>
ſpeed and advance forward, and that he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to dally with the Enemy to give him more time to come up to him, and for that intent he would pitch upon a convenient ground to fight.</p>
               <p>At this news the Prince diſpatch'd away <hi>Calibes</hi> with twenty thouſand horſe, they were ſo happy as to joyn with the reſt in good time, becauſe of a long and narrow paſſage which led into a valley, through which the Enemies were forced to go ſoftly.</p>
               <p>This accident gave time to <hi>Axalla</hi> to ſend <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> word, and to poſt himſelf in the moſt favourable place that the Country afforded; for otherwiſe he had been conſtrain'd to retreat back to the Emperour in the beſt order that he could poſſibly obſerve.</p>
               <p>Having therefore planted himſelf in that place, he aſſaulted the Enemy with ſmall parties as they came down from the Mountain. For at the bottom they intended likewiſe to draw up their men for the fight; in the mean whiles <hi>Cabiles</hi> was come in with his Ten thouſand horſe, which encouraged <hi>Axalla</hi> the more; for before he had but thirty thouſand horſe and Ten thouſand more led by <hi>Andronicus,</hi> but theſe were for the moſt part of <hi>Albania</hi> very good Souldiers. This Prince deſired of <hi>Axalla</hi> to grant him the firſt on-ſet, which he dar'd not to refuſe him for fear of diſpleaſing him. He begun the fight ſo furiouſly that he overthrew and killed a great many Enemies, but he was one of the firſt killed; mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this charge and unhappily killed for want of a timely releif. He was without doubt a Prince of an Heroick Spirit, for in that tender age he ſhewed ſufficiently that he did not degenerate from the Honor and Noble minds of his Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> ſucceeded him with his Body of horſe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40153:86"/>
partly <hi>Parthians,</hi> partly Chriſtians, who were paid by <hi>Tamerlan:</hi> with this Body he prevailed ſo well upon the <hi>Sultans</hi> Troups, that he ſcatter'd them and broke in as far as the Infantry, where he had need of new courage and reſolutions to withſtand the fury of that body of foot. But his party, who had been alwayes uſed to overcome, wherever he led them, ingaged againſt the foot, which ſo much ſucceſs, that they had almoſt defeated them and put them to flight, but <hi>Axalla</hi> recalled them back.</p>
               <p>In the heat of the Battle, a body of five and twenty thouſand of the Enemies horſe, where the <hi>Sultan</hi> was in perſon, charg'd <hi>Calibes</hi> furiouſly, and was received with the ſame gallantry at that inſtant. <hi>Axalla</hi> return'd back from the Infantry, which he had left half overthrown, and ſeeing <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libes</hi> ingaged and worſted, he aſſaulted the <hi>Mame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucks</hi> upon the Flanks and diſorder'd them, but a body of fifteen thouſand horſe, which ſtood behind the infantry, with orders not to fight, but when they ſaw great need, broke in upon <hi>Axalla's</hi> party, in the ſame manner put them in diſorder, kill'd <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allas</hi> horſe, wounded him and took him Priſoner. A cowardly horſe man at that inſtant, without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obſerve what followed, clap'd ſpur to his horſe, and with all ſpeed went to meet the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to tell him this news, which afflicted him to the heart, becauſe he repos'd himſelf much upon <hi>Axalla's</hi> courage, skill and experience. This caus'd him therefore to make the more haſte, he came into the Battle ſo ſeaſonably, that had he not arriv'd as he did the Victory had been loſt, he had ſent before Ten thouſand horſe, and followed with five and twenty thouſand more of his ſtouteſt Souldiers,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40153:87"/>
beſides he had five and twenty thouſand of his Auxillary Troops upon the Wings.</p>
               <p>His coming chang'd the face of the battle, for the <hi>Sultan,</hi> not knowing any thing of this body of men that were going to fall upon him, he being not able to diſcover them at a diſtance, becauſe of a Valley through which they paſſed, he was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpris'd, when he ſaw them firſt appear; at that very time, when the Troops Commanded by <hi>Calibes</hi> and <hi>Axalla</hi> reſiſted in a diſorder. The ten thouſand Horſe ſent before, came in freſh and charg'd the Mamelucks, who thought they had already won the day, the Emperour alſo at that inſtant followed with all his Cavalry and Infantry. So that the <hi>Sultan</hi> was forc'd to ſound a retreat, for he was not able to withſtand ſo great a fury, and ſaw that the whole Army was come againſt him. Then he perceived, but too late, his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unadviſedneſs in that he had not ſent to view his enemies Army. In the mean while <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> had diſingaged himſelf from the Souldier that had taken him priſoner. He was a foot a little while, but being known by one of his men he was mounted again, and they underſtood that he had but a light wound.</p>
               <p>The Emperour, to hinder the <hi>Sultan</hi> from ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying his men, purſued his Victory three full leagues. This unhappy Prince had three Horſes kill'd under him, in the ingagement, where he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the duty both of a Captain and of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldier. But he had committed a fault that was not to be remedied. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was guilty of as great a miſtake, by ſending the Vanguard ſo far before which might have coſt him very dear,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40153:87"/>
had it not been for <hi>Axalla's</hi> ſubtilty in dallying with and keeping off the Enemy with light skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, for otherwiſe the Emperour could not have came in timely enough to ſuccour his oppreſſed and diſordered Troops.</p>
               <p>Thus it happens frequently, the greateſt faults and miſtakes in War are turned by Providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Stratagems of Wars, when it intends to favour the party, as it did <hi>Tamerlan</hi> in this occaſion. His diligence in aſſiſting his men caus'd him to win this notable Victory, which broke the heart of the War, and brought it to a period ſooner than moſt men expected. It was known afterwards that the <hi>Sultan</hi> had been conſelled to lengthen the war, which was a wiſe and a ſafe advice, but his fury and courage could admit of no delayes, he made too much haſte to his ruin.</p>
               <p>This battel was bloody, near Fourſcore thouſand men loſt their lives on both ſides, but no perſon of any note of <hi>Tamerlan's</hi> Army, but <hi>Andronicus</hi> and three <hi>Parthian</hi> Captains of great worth. All the equipage of the <hi>Sultan</hi> was taken the next day, and a great deal of plunder.</p>
               <p>The Prince ſent meſſengers to all his Allies to acquaint them with the Victory, and chiefly he ſent to the Greek Emperour to expreſs his grief, for the Death of Prince <hi>Andronicus,</hi> intreating him to appoint ſome other perſon in his ſtead, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Greeks. He ſent alſo meſſengers to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the News of this great victory in all his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and to give an account of it to his Unkle the Emperour.</p>
               <p>In this place the Army was not able to ſubſiſt long, becauſe it was ſo numerous, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40153:88"/>
between the Mountains narrow and barren in many places; <hi>Tamerlan</hi> therefore ſent his Troops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and cauſed his Army to take a little more Elbow room, but he ſent <hi>Axalla</hi> with all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry of the Vanguard to purſue after the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and not ſuffer him to have any time to reſt. He fled towards <hi>Aegypt</hi> with forty thouſand horſe.</p>
               <p>The happy News of this Victory ſoon came to the Ears of the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> who ſent it to the beſieged within <hi>Gevolach.</hi> They were mightily afflicted when they heard it.</p>
               <p>A while after <hi>Tamerlan</hi> ſent him orders to puniſh them for their folly by deſtroying the City with fire and ſword, and ſparing none, that they might be an example to all other places, and hinder them from reſiſting his power. This command was ſoon after put in Execution; for the Town was won by aſſault, the peoples courages failing them, through the many loſſes they had ſuffered, and the daily watchings and skirmiſhes; for the Prince of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais</hi> gave them no time to breath: After this he came to the Emperour, who was refreſhing himſelf in <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after the <hi>Sultans</hi> retreat into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all his Towns, and ſent for ſupply of men and mony from all his Allies, he placed his Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in all the places needful, and caus'd all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to be ruined and burn'd, through which <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> Army was to paſs in the road to his Country. He ſpared nothing that could be ſerviceable to him, to make him, if it were poſſible, quit the deſire of marching that way; this cauſed ſo great a ſcarcity in this numerous Army, that the Emperour was obliged to review his Companies, and leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40153:88"/>
all uſeleſs perſons; afterwards he divided his Army into three bodies, the firſt he commanded, the ſecond was led by <hi>Axalla,</hi> the third by <hi>Calibes</hi>; the carriages and baggage he left behind guarded by a party of foot. <hi>Calibes</hi> was order'd to take the way towards the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> through that Country which confines upon <hi>Perſia,</hi> to ſubdue it. The Emperour himſelf took the way along the Sea Coaſt. And <hi>Axalla</hi> through <hi>Arabia.</hi> The Prince commanded threeſcore thouſand horſe and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand foot. <hi>Axalla</hi> fifty thouſand foot and forty thouſand horſe, and <hi>Calibes</hi> thirty thouſand horſe and fifty thouſand foot. All that Country ſeem'd to be cover'd over with men; nevertheleſs, there was ſuch an exact diſcipline and a rule ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Army, that proviſions were brought in plentifully, and there was nothing wanting for man or beaſt.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Axalla</hi> purſued after the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and obliged him to make more ſpeed to divide his Army, moſt of his men in his neceſſity forſook him. It was ſaid that he fled into <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> where it was not poſſible for the <hi>Tartars</hi> great Army to follow him; onely with four thouſand horſe, it was poſſible to defend himſelf and vex a more numerous party, becauſe of the ſcarcity of proviſions. In this juncture of affairs, all the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Towns open'd their gates to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> as <hi>Megate, Arnan, Tortoſa, Gibellete, Barnt,</hi> and <hi>Nephtha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim.</hi> But <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where there was a Garriſon of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> oblig'd <hi>Tamerlan</hi> to beſiege it, this was a ſtrong Town, where the <hi>Sultan</hi> had appointed Prince <hi>Zamadren</hi> to be governour. He behaved himſelf well, and made a ſtout reſiſtance, but when
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40153:89"/>
the Artillery had open'd a breach in the Wall, the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> aſſaulted it and won it, only the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel an admirable Caſtle, look'd upon as impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, held out; but the Governour, admitting all that ſought ſhelter there, haſten'd the ſurrender; for when proviſions began to fail, men pin'd away with hunger, which caus'd them to offer to ſurrender it upon compoſition; but the Prince would not grant them any, to puniſh them for their unadviſed reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when neceſſity began to preſs them they yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves at the Conquerours diſcretion, he caus'd ſome to be kill'd with the Sword, and others were made Priſoners of War. This ſeverity nois'd abroad in the Country oblig'd all the Inhabitants, thirty leagues round to bring the keys of their wall'd Towns to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> who cauſed them to be us'd civily and courteouſly, and impos'd no other burden upon them, but to contribute according to their ability to the Armies ſubſiſtance.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Damaſcus</hi> was thus taken <hi>Tamerlan</hi> march'd ſtrait to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from whence the Citizens had driven their Garriſon, as all the Towns of <hi>Judea</hi> had alſo done, they all yielded themſelves to the Emperour, he received them with many expreſſions of his goodneſs, reſtabliſh'd them in the free enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all their priviledges, promiſing to viſit the Sepulcher of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> according to the cuſtome of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, and for his ſake he denied them nothing that they could ask. From thence the Army went to <hi>Corazin,</hi> where a Gariſon of ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men had orders from the <hi>Sultan</hi> to defend themſelves and their Town, which they ſeem'd to be reſolved upon at firſt, but when they ſaw the Army planted round about the walls with an intention to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40153:89"/>
carry them, their hearts failed them; ſo that they choſe rather to implore the Princes favour, who granted it to them freely, than to hazard a reſiſtance without hopes of releif. Some Troops were here left behind to give a check to certain <hi>Mamelucks</hi> of <hi>Naſſavia,</hi> who cut off many about the Army, <hi>Calibes</hi> had orders ſent him to beſiege them and ſcatter the Troops that gathered themſelvs together about that place to incommode and rob the perſons, who brought proviſions to the Army.</p>
               <p>This retreat of the <hi>Sultan</hi> into <hi>Arabia</hi> was but a meer pretence, and a flying report. He was gone into <hi>Aegypt</hi> towards <hi>Cairo,</hi> having left behind ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parties to diſturb and aſſault the Army in their march, and chiefly in the narrow lanes and paſſages. He caus'd a grievous deſtruction to be made in the Country round about to famiſh the Army, but <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi>'s Cavalry followed him ſo cloſſe at the heels, that he had not time to do all the miſchief that he intended. The Inhabitants alſo for their own as well as for the enemies ſake, oppoſed and hindred the full execution of his deſign. When the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was at <hi>Miſerit,</hi> he cauſed a Proclamation to be made, to forbid any to go beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> that he might the better preſerve the Country from whence his Army had their Proviſions. He went as he had Promiſed to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the company of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Favourites, guarded with a party of Horſe, to viſit, as a religious Prince, that Sepulcher, which is honoured by all the Nations of the world, and to preſent his gifts. When he was in the City, where the Inhabitants received him with all poſſible ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, he ſaught for all the Antiquities of the old Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and was led, as the Pilgrims,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40153:90"/>
through all the places where Chriſt had preach'd and wrought Miracles. When he had ended his Prayers at the Sepulcher, he gave large gifts. Two things chiefly gave him great content, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of certain Monks and Religious Men at the Sepulcher, where their Lords Body was? He is, ſaid they, in Heaven at the right hand of God: Then turning to his Mahumetan Train, he ask'd them where they thought that this Prophet was? The Cherif, that ſtood next to him, replyed, that he was a true God, that he was gone before to ſit in the firſt place in Heaven, where he ſhould be received al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. As he came from Heaven ſo he was departed thither again. Then the Prince fell upon his knees, and held his Name in great veneration. And at his return to <hi>Samarcand,</hi> he built him a ſumptuous Temple, taking a great delight to hear men tell of his Miracles, and commanded that ſome ſhould mention them often in his hearing.</p>
               <p>The other thing, that gave him a delight and admiration, was, when in viewing all the places of devotion, he came to that at laſt, where Chriſt leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Diſciples aſcended up into the glories of Heaven. There he left behind the faſhion of his foot, which caus'd him to wonder at it extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily: And when one told him that a Pilgrim had been here raviſh'd in Spirit, he thought him happy. <hi>Axalla</hi> with many other Chriſtians were then with him.</p>
               <p>In this manner, <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> by viſiting the holy places and relicks, gave a great ſatisfaction to all the people, but the Jews could not indure but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd againſt him openly. He had never any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for them, but named them <hi>Wicked Men,</hi> and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40153:90"/>
                  <hi>Curſed of God.</hi> He loved to ſee men ſincere in their piety and devotions, and was glad to have ſeen <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> ſo liberal of his offerings to the holy Sepulcher. In the mean whiles the Army was in their march to <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> towards <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Emperour had notice, that the <hi>Slutan</hi> gathered his Troops togeher from all parts, and was then at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> He himſelf, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the performance of his devotions, followed the Army, and commanded the Van-guard to go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Damietta.</hi> He had been told that it was not to be taken by force.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> had ſecur'd it with a ſtrong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: It was a maritine Town, one of the moſt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſo that it was in great reputation. Many of the Emperours followers labour'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him from attempting it, adviſing him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon ſomething elſe, telling him that it was no diſcreetion to run his numerous army into a narrow peice of Land, but that he ſhould rather march higher into the Country, but all their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons could not perſwade him from going thither, for he judged, that there was nothing that could put a ſtop to his good Fortune. He therefore commanded <hi>Axalla</hi> to block up the Town, and he followed him thither with the remainder of the Army.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Axalla</hi> was there he ſent in a ſummons, commanding them to ſubmit, and declaring to the Chriſtian Inhabitants, who were there very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, what a folly it would be for them to oppoſe his Emperours power. That his mildneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould rather oblige them to free themſelves from the Tyranny of the Moors and Mamelucks, who oppreſſed them beyond meaſure. He told them, that he was a Chriſtian as well as they, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40153:91"/>
therefore ſhould be alwayes very glad to ſerve them. He cauſed alſo ſome of the Greek Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to argue the caſe with them. They dealt ſo effectually, that they perſwaded them to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their lives and endeavour to drive out of their City the Mamelucks, and all thoſe who held for the <hi>Sultan.</hi> They delayed not in the execution of this deſign, but with their weapons in their hands, they got the command of one quarter of the City, and open'd one of the Gates to <hi>Axalla.</hi> All the Mamelucks were either kill'd or taken Pris'ners, and <hi>Damietta</hi> was yeilded to the Prince. This News, which the Emperour received in his march, cauſed him to expect a happy ſucceſs in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of his great deſign. He could not have hoped for ſuch an eaſie accompliſhment of it, if this ſtrong City had been in the Enemies hands, for by its advantageous ſcituation upon one of the branches of <hi>Nilus,</hi> it would have ruin'd his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and cut off all their proviſions. But now, that it was in his power, he could reaſonably expect from all parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> as the Emperour <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> had promis'd him all manner of things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for his Souldiers, which were already coming to him by <hi>Damietta.</hi> He appointed there a ſtrong Garriſon of two thouſand Grecians, with a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to keep for him the City. They took the Oath of fidelity.</p>
               <p>The Prince found this place according to his mind, and ſtronger than he had at firſt imagin'd. The Inhabitants of <hi>Lariſſa</hi> ſubmitted likewiſe, and would not ſtand out againſt his invincible power. Garriſons were placed in all the places ſcituate near he Sea, that proviſions might not be hinder'd to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40153:91"/>
be brought to the Army. This was one of his greateſt cares to provide well for ſo vaſt a multitude, that they might not want.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> ſtopt a few dayes in <hi>Damietta,</hi> but ſent his vanguard towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but immediately after he followed them, and cauſed them to march about towards <hi>Grand Cairo.</hi> The <hi>Sultan,</hi> who had provided himſelf for a ſtout reſiſtance in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> was ſurpris'd to hear of this unexpected charge: he had no time to deliberate, but with all ſpeed made what haſte he could to prevent <hi>Tamerlan.</hi> He enter'd into <hi>Cairo</hi> as the Army was in ſight of it, with a ſtrong reſolution to ſtop the entry of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and preſerve the paſſage of the River that leads to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> It was reported that the <hi>Sultan</hi> gat into <hi>Cairo</hi> with forty thouſand horſe, and threeſcore thouſand foot; but <hi>Tamerlan</hi> could not believe it. However he arriv'd there in very good time to preſerve his intereſt, for the Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Army was at <hi>Buldat,</hi> ſeven leagues from the City, at that time the ſlaves, who are very numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous there, had an intent to revolt and open to us a gate, which they might have done with eaſe, had not the <hi>Sultans</hi> coming hinder'd them. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was a great let to the ſucceſs of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army, and the conſequence of it troubled them not a little; for fear of not being able to get proviſions, which if they had happen'd to fail them, they had been forced to raiſe their ſiege and depart. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Prince, whoſe courage nothing could terrifie, drew near to the City with all his Army, cauſing them to intrench themſelves chiefly to preſerve his Cavalry from ſudden attempts. He cauſed ſeveral attempts to be made upon the City,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40153:92"/>
wherein his men had alwayes the advantage, by theſe aſſaults he had a trial of their courages and reſolutions, and endeavoured to offer an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to the ſlaves to venture out and acquaint him with the poſture of affaires within the City. The Emperour was afraid of what might happen, and of the tediouſneſs of the Siege; therefore for that reaſon as well as to try the diſpoſition of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he might oblige him to venture out, drew up his Army before the City. He hop'd that if he had been ſo bold as to venture out, during that abſence, there might be ſome ſtirring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt in the City amongſt the Inhabitants, weary of the Tyranny of the <hi>Mamelucks,</hi> or amongſt the Slaves, unto whom underhand he had promiſed their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. None dared look out, all the benefit that he reap'd by this action was, but to underſtand more fully the ſituation of <hi>Cairo,</hi> and ſhew the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants the ſtrength and number of his invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army. But at the ſame time he cauſed them to be dealt withal by Slaves of their own Nation, who, flying from us unto the City, caus'd them to underſtand, that the Emperour intended not to ruin them; that he had no intention but to fight with the <hi>Mamelucks</hi> his enemies. This underhand dealing caus'd ſuch an impreſſion in their minds, that they all agreed to free themſelves from the company of theſe troubleſome Gueſts.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour underſtood what ſucceſs of this ſubtil negotiation, he reſolved to draw near with his Infantry, at half a mile from the Town, that his approach might encourage the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens the more; for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y had ſent word, that they would riſe in arms and fight for us againſt our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40153:92"/>
and theirs. Upon this news, he ſent for the Cheiftains of his Army, to open to them his mind, to hear their advice, and give them the neceſſary orders for the carrying on of his deſign with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. He told them, that he was come before that City, imagining that it had been unprovided and without any Garriſon, eaſie to be won, that it had been able, if taken, to have caus'd his Army to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a long time, and procure them great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but that being prevented by the <hi>Mamelucks,</hi> who were got in poſſeſſion of it with all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, there was two great inconveniences, that would attend upon him, if he did continue in the ſiege: the firſt was the difficulty of getting provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for by endeavouring to famiſh the beſieged, he run the hazard of ſtarving his own Army. The ſecond inconveniency was the exceſſive heats of the approaching Seaſon, which would prove ſo much the more dangerous to his men, becauſe they were not us'd to them; and if diſeaſes and diſtempers ſhould enter amongſt them they would ruin him and his deſigns. He told them alſo, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to confine all his deſires to <hi>Cairo</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and to proceed no further in his Conqueſts: That after the ſubduing of theſe two places he would return to <hi>Samarcand</hi> loaden with the Spoils of <hi>Aſia</hi>: That it would be a ſhame to them to flie away from an enemy, whom they had lately bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and who, to avoid the ſight of them, had wandered up and down the Mountains and Deſarts two Months: That they were got into that City, becauſe they truſted more to the ſtrength of its walls and bulworks, than to their weapons and courages. That it did become them to ſhew the vanity of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40153:93"/>
this confidence of the <hi>Mamelucks</hi>; for if they ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd themſelves in ſtrong-Holds and Walls, the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Tartarians</hi> had a more numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my than theirs, and ſtouter courages, more uſed to overcome all difficulties; therefore they were able to render thoſe heaps of ſtones and mortar uſeleſs, for at the firſt aſſault, they would be able to leap over all the walls and barracado's with which the Enemies had fortified the ſtreets of the City; that all theſe things would not be able to ſecure the <hi>Mamelucks</hi> from fear, and from flying before them. That if they would attach their enemies unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly, whiles they thought themſelves ſafe within their Walls, and not to be forced: That the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſurpriſing attempt would half overcome them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is far more honourable</hi> (ſaid he to them) <hi>to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault them than to fly away from them ſhamefully, and and turn our backs to thoſe who have ſeen our faces ſo often to their loſs. This is a ſpecial favour that the great God of hoſts hath granted to us theſe twenty years, that we have been fighting with many Warlike people, that we have never turned them our backs. We muſt therefore diſown the Parthian name, and forget all our former Victories and glory if we forſake this Siege and depart; for it is certain in ſuch a caſe our enemies would never fail to purſue us, and cut ſhort our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and to publiſh abroad, to our eternal ſhame, our flight; this would cauſe many of thoſe that fight for us forſake us in our need, and turn againſt us, and we ſhould ſee thoſe, who have yeilded to us, betray us, and become our enemies.</hi> The Emperour made this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to his Captains to give them to underſtand that there was but two wayes to take, either to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the City and the Seige, or to fight with the Enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:40153:93"/>This ſpeech aſtoniſh'd them with the Novelty and the greatneſs of the enterpriſe; for they had never endeavoured to force an Army retrench'd within ſtrong Walls, and they were afraid of the ſequel of ſuch an attempt. Nevertheleſs their honour and reputation, which they ſaw ingag'd, prevail'd upon them, and caus'd them to contemn all the dangers, and death it ſelf, which they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw as infallible. Whiles every one was thinking upon the enterpriſe, with their heads hanging down with a great ſilence, <hi>Tamerlan</hi> deſired <hi>Axalla</hi> to ſpeak and diſcover his mind; which he did in this manner. <hi>Worthy Prince, wherefore do you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſearch our minds? Do you not yet know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and courages of your Captains and Soldiers? Do you doubt whither they will prefer the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your glory to their own lives? wherefore do you inquire from us our reſolutions? Lead up only, and you ſhall ſee, whether the great affection we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes had for you be now deminiſh'd: do you think that the walls of</hi> Cairo <hi>are ſtrong enough to reſiſt our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and ſtop your Cavalry? The firſt horſe-man, that ſhall put his head within the walls, will open a way to the whole Army.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aſſoon as <hi>Axalla</hi> had ended his ſpeech, all the Captains cried out, and intreated to be led to the fight, proteſting that they were ready to Sacrifice themſelves for the Honour and Glory of their Prince.</p>
               <p>The Emperour was mighty well ſatisfied with their affectionate expreſſions, for which he return'd them his hearty thanks. Therefore at the ſame time he gave Orders for the aſſault, and divided his Infantry into three Bodies. The Lieutenant
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40153:94"/>
General was to lead thirty thouſand men. The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> was to follow him with fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more. <hi>Axalla</hi> was to ſucceed him with a like number of Infantry, with four thouſand Horſe arm'd with Lance and Buckler. The Prince came a little after, with ten thouſand Horſe before him, and he himſelf in the midſt of fifty thouſand Foot, who were followed by the reſt of the Cavalry, whom he commanded in perſon, having given the charge of the Infantry to <hi>Axalla,</hi> in whom he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his chiefeſt truſt.</p>
               <p>The Princes intent was to win one of the Towns of <hi>Cairo,</hi> and there to lodge himſelf, that he might be able to advance by degrees. But it concerns us to know, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> was in the City with all his forces, which amounted to threeſcore thouſand foot, and fifty thouſand horſe, of whom thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were <hi>Mamelucks,</hi> brave Souldiers train'd up in the art of war. The <hi>Tartars</hi> had found what they were by experience. But his Infantry were not ſo skilful, for they were but freſh Souldiers, newly rais'd in <hi>Arabia, Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were but Slaves lately ſet at liberty, for his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ſtanding Foot had been overthrown in the laſt Battles.</p>
               <p>The Prince had diſcovered to none but to <hi>Axalla</hi> the hopes that he had in the riſing of the Slaves and Moors. When therefore all things where readily provided, he cauſed the firſt bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>y of Foot to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to the place that he had appointed to attack the Enemy in the Front, when he ſaw them charge home, and force the <hi>Sultans</hi> men into their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he cauſed them to be followed and ſeconded by the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> with fifty thouſand under his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40153:94"/>
command. Then the fight was moſt cruel and bloody.</p>
               <p>In the mean whiles <hi>Axalla</hi> march'd along cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain palm trees, in a place that he imagin'd was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, to go to the aſſiſtance of his men by another way. He was not miſtaken, he found little or no reſiſtance, ſo that with eaſe he broke into the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; he applied himſelf next to perform <hi>Tamerlans</hi> orders, and fill up with boards and other materials, the holes and ditches, that the Horſe might get over, but as he was buſie in this work, the Enemy came upon him with twenty thouſand men to hinder him. <hi>Axalla</hi> left three thouſand to end the work begun, and make a way with all ſpeed for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, and with the reſt he charg'd the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mamelucks</hi> were coming to him in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. They were too hard for the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> and had ſome advantage upon him, but it laſted not long, for as ſoon as the way was made for the Horſe, the ten thouſand men charg'd the <hi>Mamelucks</hi> in the Rear, where the <hi>Sultan</hi> was in perſon, after theſe, ten thouſand more were ſent by the Prince, who with all his Cavalry followed next. All toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther broke in upon the Enemy without delay, ſo that they had no time but to fly to the ſecond Trenches, which they had made, in the ſecond Town. The fight laſted ſeven whole hours, all this time it was not to be judged, which party ſhould gain the Victory. The Enemies defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtoutly, but when the Prince had driven them from their firſt Trenches, he ſounded a retreat, and was contented to lodge all night in that place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the next day to purſue the Victory.</p>
               <p>One third of the Town was already in <hi>Tamerlans</hi> poſſeſſion, whoſe Infantry were quartered next to the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40153:95"/>
Enemies ſecond Trenches, which gave occaſion to ſeveral ſmall skirmiſhes which hapned moſt times to the advantage of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt couragiouſly.</p>
               <p>That day fifteen or ſixteen thouſand men were killed on the Enemies ſide, and ſeven thouſand of <hi>Tamerlans. Dragnen</hi> Lieutenant General of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry of the <hi>Sultan</hi> died, with many other Officers who were in the heat of the battle.</p>
               <p>It was generally confeſſed that <hi>Axalla</hi>'s experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and good judgement, this day were very uſeful in getting the Victory.</p>
               <p>The ſame night news being brought to the Prince, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> had a deſign to paſs over the River, he gave order to ten thouſand horſe to poſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves along the banks, when the <hi>Sultan</hi> heard of it, he imagin'd that all the Army had been there, therefore he was not ſo bold as to venture his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at the paſſage. At the break of day, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour caus'd the Trenches to be fill'd up, and the fight to begin by the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> of one ſide, and by <hi>Axalla</hi> on the other. But after a ſlight reſiſtance, when the <hi>Sultan</hi> perceived that his Infantry drew back and left their Trenches to their enemies, the fear of the coming of the Cavalry, caus'd him to forſake the Town. He performed this deſign, which he had fail'd of in the night, by drawing up his Army in the void ſpace between the River and the Town, that he might be able to eſcape over into <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while the Prince having taken by force the ſecond Trenches, the Souldiers broke into the City and kill'd every one they met with, none being able to keep them in, when the Emperour was inform'd of the way the <hi>Sultan</hi> took to paſs
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40153:95"/>
over the River, he followed him with all his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry and all the foot, that he could pick up from the plunder and ſpoils of the City, unto which they were furiouſly bent. But the <hi>Sultan</hi> had provided in time, to ſecure his retreat and paſſage, by getting into his power a narrow peice of ground ſecur'd from the Rivers violence with ſtrong ſtakes, there he poſted fifteen thouſand of his beſt Souldiers, whom he called his ſlaves. The ſcituation was ſuch that they were able to defend themſelves, and could not be forced without Infantry. Such as were brought to find them, were loath to leave their companions, to take all the plunder, therefore they march'd but ſlowly and without courage until the Emperour himſelf had promis'd them, to take notice of them and give them rewards. At their firſt coming up they aſſaulted theſe Troops, not without difficulty, and loſs of many men, but the enemies made an honourable retreat, they caſt themſelves into the River, with one hand they ſwum, and with the other held their Weapons. In this manner they eſcaped to the other bank. Part of their Cavalry was cut in peices, another part in the confuſion ventur'd into the River and were drown'd, for they could not get over.</p>
               <p>This was the laſt endeavour of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who beheld with ſorrow this great and Stately City from an high place, when it was pillaging. He told his people to comfort them, that they were not men who had ovecrome them, but a God, who had ſided with his enemies. So much, valour, prudence, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion, he had taken notice of in the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army.</p>
               <p>The next night after the fight, he judged that the <hi>Tartarians</hi> would be buſie in dividing the ſpoyls
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40153:96"/>
and that they would have no time to purſue him. He withdrew himſelf with nine or ten thouſand men, for the reſt were either ſcatter'd abroad or drown'd in the River.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as it was day he took the way of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> after that he had thank'd ſome of his ſlaves, who were a live after they had ſaved their Prince by their ſtout and brave reſiſtance for two hours againſt all the <hi>Tartarians</hi> Army, and their honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and glorious retreat at the end of this Noble action. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> himſelf was ſo great an admirer of them, that he commanded thoſe that were taken to be brought to him, and out of a deſire to uſe them in his ſervice he treated them kindly, and with gifts and other favours endeavoured to win them to himſelf, and though they all refuſed to forſake their former Maſters intereſt he ſent them to the <hi>Sultan.</hi> The Prince was us'd to deal thus in that generous manner with thoſe whom he had overcome. He delighted to expreſs his bounty and clemency next after his valour and courage. There is nothing more proper for a great Prince than to cauſe himſelf to be beloved by his merciful and loving temper, as well as to render himſelf dreadful and reſpected by his power and noble mind.</p>
               <p>After this furious fight the Prince retreated a little back, lodging his men between the River and the City, that he might ſecure and cover the reſt of his Army, which might otherwiſe have eaſily been defeated during the plunder of that rich and wealthy Town.</p>
               <p>This cauſed him to continue all night on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back with ſome of his chief Officers, for with them he rode up and down his Camp viſiting every
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40153:96"/>
corner, and praiſing his Soldiers for their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious aſſaults. As ſoon as it was day he went into the Town to take poſſeſſion of the Caſtle, the ordinary abode of the <hi>Sultans,</hi> where all their riches were treaſured up. There he lodg'd and caus'd all his Army to be quarter'd round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Caſtle, which ſtands at one end of the Town. He commanded by a Proclamation that all plundering ſhould ceaſe, which had laſted four and twenty hours, and every Soldier had orders to return to their colours, and to lodge in their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; the next day he ſent out another Proclamation to declare all the Inhabitants free, commanding that all Priſoners ſhould be releas'd. In the Caſtle he found wonderful Riches and ineſtimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures laid up there by the <hi>Sultans,</hi> many years. There was the more, becauſe they had a law that forbid them to meddle with any thing there but in great neceſſity, when the Kingdome was in want. It was thought that the <hi>Sultan</hi> made the more haſt to get into <hi>Cairo</hi> before <hi>Tamerlan</hi> for fear of loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Treaſures. Some ſay that he took out in the night many jewels. Others ſpeak as if he never enter'd into it, that he diminiſh'd nothing, for fear that his men ſhould imagine that he intended to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, and they ſhould ſuſpect the retreat he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make. Others think that he never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with theſe Treaſures, becauſe he could never dream of being faced in ſuch a City, accompained with ſuch and ſo many faithful Soldiers. And when he ſaw himſelf driven out againſt his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be aſcrib'd the Victory to none but to a Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who had ſo powerfully aſſiſted the <hi>Tartarians</hi> Army againſt his men ſecured in ſuch ſtrong forifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:40153:97"/>The Emperour ſent word to <hi>Calibes</hi> to inform him of his ſucceſſes and progreſs, and to deliver him a Commiſſion to be Governour of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> This happy news was welcome in the numerous Army under his command, which march'd along the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> it increaſed daily by the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of many Towns, which would not oppoſe the Princes happineſs; all <hi>Perſia</hi> trembled at this ſudden alteration, at the fall of the <hi>Sultan.</hi> This Country, was then govern'd by ſeveral petty Princes, ſome of them were <hi>Mehometans,</hi> but others <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> The Emperour had an intent to ſubdue them all.</p>
               <p>In the mean while he gave all neceſſary or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the preſervation of <hi>Cairo,</hi> and caus'd his Army to paſs over the River, that he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat his Victory, for that purpoſe he march'd to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where the <hi>Sultan</hi> had taken ſanctuary. But before the departure of the Van-guard with <hi>Axalla</hi> at the head, he rewarded liberally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Souldier, according to their deſervings, and courages.</p>
               <p>He caus'd the Oath of fidelity to be adminiſter'd to all the Inhabitants of that great City, and of the Towns thereabouts, ſetling every thing in as much peace as he could in ſo ſhort a time; for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he left in Garriſon there ten thouſand men, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away all ſuch perſons as he ſuſpected, and placed others in their ſtead. Therefore he led with him many perſons in his Army to place and ſettle in the conquered Towns, after this, the people came to him from all parts, to ſubmit themſelves, and receive his commands from as far as <hi>Cana.</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors arrived not only from <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> but
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40153:97"/>
alſo from <hi>Africa,</hi> to acknowledge <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; for his Victories had ſtruck a dread into all neighbouring Nations and People at a diſtance. He would not ſettle the affairs of <hi>Aegypt</hi> till his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Cairo</hi> from <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The Rear of his Army he ſent thither with the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> but he and his Houſhold ſervants embark'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> for their pleaſure. It is ſaid, that he took a delight to take notice of the rapidity of this River in ſome places, and its ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in others.</p>
               <p>The News was ſoon carried to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that the Army was in their march to beſiege it, this made the people to riſe up in Arms, the fear of a total ruin caus'd them to ſend to the <hi>Sultan</hi> to intreat him to compaſſionate their weakneſs, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to him, that he could not make the ſame reſiſtance againſt ſo powerful an Army as he had done againſt others before. That it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him to yield to the preſent neceſſity, that he ſhould do well to retire into <hi>Lybia,</hi> whether <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi>'s Army would never follow him, that if he would do ſo, they would keep for him that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs they had ſworn to him. That he need not doubt of their affections for him. That they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to ſave his own perſon, and ſuffer time to perform the reſt. After this meſſage the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> ſaw that all things turn'd againſt him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved therefore to depart, he was in hopes, that if the Army continued any long time about <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as they were likely to do, that there would ſome change happen, which might alter the face of his affairs, and offer him an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to attempt ſomething, with this expectation
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40153:98"/>
he pacified his troubled mind, and with tears in his eyes, he left the City, repeating often theſe Words, <hi>God is angry with our Nation, that the time of the ruin of this flouriſhing Empire was come, that every one ought to ſubmit to the orders of Providence.</hi> That he had done all that could have been expected from him to perform his duty in the defence of his people, and anſwer their great eſteem at his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: that he hoped to gather up more Troops, and return with a ſufficient Army to free them from the ſlavery of a Forreign Prince. Theſe words ſpoken before a great multitude, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>related to <hi>Axalla</hi> firſt, for he went before with the <hi>Van.</hi> He caus'd the Prince to underſtand the News, and ſent him word, that not only out of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> men came to ſubmit themſelves but alſo from fifty leagues round about. The Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced to hear this proſperous march of his Army, becauſe he ſaw a ſpeedy end to all his labours, and a poſſibility of returning to his own Country. He was troubled that he had not got the <hi>Sultan</hi> into his cuſtody, this conſideration hindred him from treating all ſuch as held for him with that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he expreſſed to all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
               <p>When the Princes Army was within one days march of <hi>Alexandria, Axalla</hi> was ſent for to meet him, and to bring with him ſome of the chief Citizens to take their Oaths of Allegiance and Fidelity. After this he made his entry with all his Army, but cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to go out again, and incamp about the Walls, only ſix thouſand horſe and twenty thouſand foot, he kept for his guard, and ſent <hi>Axalla</hi> with his Van-guard to purſue after the <hi>Sultan.</hi> In the mean
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40153:98"/>
while the Emperour continued a long time about <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in expectation of ſome news from <hi>Calibes.</hi> He had ſent <hi>Lochiſtan,</hi> his great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain to ſucceed him, a man of great worth, who had alwayes commanded a party of ten thouſand horſe, and had alwayes been with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calibes</hi> took from his Army the ſame number of horſe-men to accompany him into <hi>Aegypt</hi> with his equipage to wait upon the Prince, whom he had no need to ſolicite, for <hi>Tamerlan</hi> knew ſo well the deſervings of every one, and that which they were able to perform, that in their abſence as well as in their preſence, honours and Governments, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and affaires were conferred upon them without their ſeeking, the Prince was ſo juſt in the diſtribution of his favours. Therefore no body did bribe for the Offices of his Army, for the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his Houſe and State; for they proceeded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes from his free motion.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Axalla</hi> was departed out of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the ſad news was brought that the Emperour his Unkle lay very ſick. He had left with him the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his wife, the Daughter of this old man, whom he knew to be wiſe and prudent, this conſorted him not a little. He knew, that if by chance his Unkle ſhould die, ſhe would take care to keep the Kings and Princes his Vaſſals, and all his other Subjects in peace.

               </p>
               <p>News came to him alſo from <hi>China,</hi> that the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes</hi> had endeavored ſome ſtirs, but <hi>Odmar</hi> had ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh'd them in a bloody battle, where the Kings brother had been kill'd, this had ſecured the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour on that ſide. <hi>Odmar</hi> after the rebellion had inlarg'd and proſecuted the conqueſts of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but the Old Emperour had ſent him orders to appeaſe all things, and to preſerve only what he had conquered beyond the River of <hi>Flezan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Axalla</hi> was departed with the <hi>Van-guard,</hi> he terrified all the Inhabitants of <hi>Africa</hi>; for the people imagin'd that all the Emperours Army fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, ſo that two and twenty petty Kings of that Country ſent to him their Embaſſadors to ſubmit themſelves to his mercy. But the <hi>Sultan</hi> in his flight was forſaken of all men, his Soldiers return'd back in Troops to yield to <hi>Axalla</hi> every day. <hi>Arſambei</hi> alſo his Lieutenant General ſent to have the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ſafe conduct, which was granted to him. He came therefore and intreated him, that ſeeing his Maſter had been driven out of all his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, he would be ſo gracious to him as to admit him in his ſervice; the Princes humanity received him kindly and granted him all that he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Arſambei</hi> ſwore to be faithful to him. But this perfidious Traitor had another deſign in his mind. He had promis'd the <hi>Sultan</hi> to aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Emperour. That he might ſucceed the better in this execution of this Villainy, he had cauſed four thouſand <hi>Mamelucks</hi> to be received in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40153:99"/>
the ſervice of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> in <hi>Alexandria.</hi> They were to aſſiſt him in this wicked attempt in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he was buſily employed in ſetling his conquered Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in peace. The Execution was intended in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Prince, according to his cuſtome, ſhould give publick audience to the complaints that were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually made to him. His guards were ten thouſand men, but then there were not above twelve hundred that waited upon him every day. The Traitor <hi>Arſembei</hi> had made ſeveral of the inhabitants of the Town ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their deſign, they were to riſe up in Armes at the ſame moment of time that the Prince ſhould be kill'd, which they thought to be more feaſable than really it was, the four thouſand Mamelucks were in the Town to act as ſoon as they ſhall have a command. Three weeks more paſs'd after the murder was appointed and reſolved upon before the day appeared for the execution of it, it was but the day before, that the Prince had given him one of the moſt beautiful and ſtouteſt Horſes of his Stables. He had alſo given order to his people to pay him a great reſpect, this Villain therefore drew near to the Emperours perſon in his Tent, which was open to all, that deſired to make their addreſſes to him.</p>
               <p>We muſt take notice, that the City of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> is built in ſuch a manner, that all the Houſes are flat on the Top, ſo that it is poſſible to paſs over them, from one to the other. In this place <hi>Arſembei</hi> had appointed thoſe perſons to be ready, to help him at the ſame moment, that he ſhould have accompliſh'd his wicked purpoſe: at a diſtance the Prince perceived him drawing towards his perſon, he ask'd him what he deſired, for he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to ſee him in this place, which was deſigned
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40153:100"/>
only for ſuch as could not have acceſs at other times to his perſon, as Soldiers and the meaner ſort of people, and not for a man of the quality of <hi>Arſembei.</hi> He could not imagine, what might be the cauſe of this appearance. He obſerv'd him again, and ſaw that his countenance chang'd its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which caus'd him to fix his eyes upon him, and take notice of his motion. <hi>Arſembei</hi> at that inſtant, with his drawn Sword in his hand ran to him, but the Prince drew his likewiſe as ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and leaping back two or three paces to avoid the ſtroak, with a back blow, he cut almoſt in two the Varlets arm, lifted up to aim at him; at that moment every one ran to help, and ſuccour the Prince. The firſt man ſtruck him down with a blow upon the head, the wound was not mortal, the Emperour would not ſuffer him to be kill'd there, that he might learn from him his aſſociates, but this Villain broke out into Lamentation, and complaint at the deſtiny of his good Maſter, becauſe this laſt attempt, an expreſſion of his affection for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>im, had been uſeleſs. The Prince ask'd him, wherefore he had ſpared him in a juſt War, and in the fight, to aſſaſſinate him now in a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous manner, after ſo many proteſtations of his ſervice and love, but he made no other anſwer, but this, <hi>Let me dy, let me dy.</hi> The great Cady or Lord Cheif Juſtice ſeiz'd upon him, who together with the Lords of the privy Council examin'd him. In the mean while the City and Camp were all in Arms. And the Princes Guards were mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Horſeback. All the Guards were doubled, the Haven was ſecured, and the Emperour went home to his Lodgings, glad of ſo narrow an eſcape,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40153:100"/>
without harm from ſo a great danger.</p>
               <p>But the Captains and Souldiers crowded about the Palace with an earneſt deſire to behold him with their eyes, offering to face the Guards, that would not ſuffer them to enter. They ask'd to look upon him with threatning words; for they would have thought him dead had they not ſeen him. The Prince had a mind to reſt himſelf, but at laſt he was forc'd to yield to their impatient deſires. He went out to them, aſſuring them that he was well and in health, but the Army was not ſatisfied, he was conſtrain'd to get on horſeback, and to ride about the Camp. Then the apprehenſions, that had poſſeſſed the Souls of the Officers and Souldiers, vaniſh'd away by the preſence of him, who they loved as tenderly as their lives, and were ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by extraordinary motions of joy, ſo that the Sky was filled with their loud acclamations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of gladneſs.</p>
               <p>The Offender was examined at the rack, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed all the deſign, and required courageouſly that he might be brought to his end: according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they went to ſeek the places where his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates were yet in number about three hundred, they were all bound and carried to priſon, and inquiry was made for all others round about the City. Some of the Inhabitants, who had been acquainted with the buſineſs, and had received Letters from the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> were not ſpared. But the Prince, who was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally an Enemy to all cruelty, ſeeing that there was likely much blood to be ſpill'd, reſolved to depart out of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with an intent not to return to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty again, till all the guilty perſons ſhould be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and puniſh'd.</p>

                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:40153:101"/>This great City appeared with a ſad countenance. In every Corner perſons were taken, and all ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted inhabitants were led to priſon. As ſoon as they were convicted they were executed publickly. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembei</hi> ſuffered firſt. He was ſtrangled, and for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his horrid Treaſon, his head was fixt upon a Pole in the Market place, and his Body quartered. All the Complices were dealt with in the ſame manner, but ſome of the Citizens, that were unſuſpected, were caſt into priſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſold for ſlaves, and tranſported into another Country.</p>
               <p>This was the end of this Tragedy, which was to begin by the Princes life, but the Majeſty of his looks, and his courageous reſiſtance, help'd to ſave him. <hi>I have oftentimes,</hi> ſaith <hi>Alhacent, heard him confeſs, that when</hi> Arſambei <hi>ſtood before him, he imagined, that this Villain had ſome wicked deſign in his mind, and that if he had not been afraid to break his promiſe that he had given him, and injure that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation that he held in the World, he would have cauſed him to have been ſtayed, as ſoon as he ſaw him appear, but he thought it ſufficient to look upon him. He proteſted for his part, that he feared no aſſaſſinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. That he had a good Angel at his Elbows, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his guardian Angel, whom he named</hi> Meaniel, <hi>he ſaid, that he had orders from God to preſerve him from all ambuſhes.</hi> He cauſed his Image to be carried in his colours, and pluck'd down all ſigns of the <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant</hi>; the badge of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, and inſtead thereof, he erected an image of his Guardian Angel.</p>
               <p>All this time <hi>Axalla</hi> was not idle. He had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a great way into <hi>Africa</hi> with the Army, and had ſubdued all the lower part of <hi>Lybia.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40153:101"/>
went thither, and finding it a delicious Country he ſtaid there to refreſh his Army, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd them about, that they might have more conveniency: Onely <hi>Axalla</hi> was with the Body of an Army. So that in expectation of the arrival of <hi>Calibes,</hi> he was buſie in ſetting theſe conquered Countries in peace. The heats at that time were ſo violent, that the Souldiers were much the worſe particularly the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who live in a Country inclinable to cold more than to heat.</p>
               <p>When the Prince underſtood, that all was quiet in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he return'd to the City, where at his firſt arrival, ſeveral Ambaſſadors came to him, from the Lords and Princes of <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Barbary,</hi> to ſubmit to him, and acknowledge him for their Soveraign. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> requir'd Hoſtages from all whoſe Countries where bordering upon <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but he deſired from the reſt nothing but their Faith, and ſome outward expreſſions of their good will. Thus every one yielded homage to this new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and by their ſubmiſſions publiſh'd abroad the largeneſs of his Dominions.</p>
               <p>After all this, the Prince ſeem'd to have a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inclination than ever he had before to return into his own Country. Age and Labour incline us naturally to ſeek for reſt. He often ſaid, that he had heard his Father declare, That when a man is five and forty, if Fortune hath favour'd him till then, he ought, if he be wiſe, to reſt ſatisfied with the favours he hath received, and endeavour only to preſerve what he hath, than to get more. That unconſtant Fortune at that age is apt to change as ſuddenly as our bodies, and that the wrinkles, which appeared upon his face, told him, that his youthful
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40153:102"/>
days began to paſs away, and that this decline made him fear that Fortune would retake from all that ſhe had given him. He was the more earneſt and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate to return home, becauſe he was reſolved to imbelliſh the City of <hi>Samarcand,</hi> and eternize there his name and memory; for that purpoſe he ſaught every where for all skilful Artiſts, and men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and of comely Bodies and Countenances, to carry them to this City, that they might adorn it, and cauſe it to be diſtinguiſh'd from all others. As this had been his Cradle he was reſolved to make it his Tomb, and to reſtore to the ſame ground, that which he had borrowed from it. A certain Heathen, unto whom the Prince had ſhewn the ſtately Sepulcher, that he built for his body, which this man wondred at, and ask'd him, where he would build another for his Soul. The Prince, with his eyes lifted up towards heaven, anſwered him, <hi>That his Soul ſhould return to the place from whence it was taken, ſeeing that it was of a Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may take notice of one remarkable paſſage more, he was reproved by a noted Prieſt of the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Faith, becauſe he forced not all the People that he ſubdued to make profeſſion of the ſame Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>My Friend,</hi> replied <hi>Tamerlan</hi> to him, <hi>I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do that. I cannot but think that God delights in the diverſity of Religions amongſt men. He hates only thoſe that have no Religion, or that deny him, ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I would willingly baniſh out of the World. It is not but that I am fully perſwaded, that the way and method of my worſhipping of him is the moſt pleaſing to him. But I ſhall give liberty to every one in all places of my Empire to adore him as they all believe that he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40153:102"/>
ought to be, in caſe their intent be to honour him alone and not to diſgrace him by irreverence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore he thought that every one ought to continue in the Religion where he was born, and brought up, in caſe one only God was worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. I thought fit to publiſh theſe particulars of <hi>Tamerlans</hi> Religion, for there was no man, that ſpoke of God with more reſpect and dread, which was ſo great, that none could imagine a more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and more extraordinary devotion than that which he expreſſed outwardly.</p>
               <p>To return to the hiſtory. The Emperour received news that <hi>Calibes,</hi> in whole place the great <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> govern'd the Army, was in his way and near <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which report cauſed an univerſal joy all over the Army, for his coming was likely to haſten their departure to their native Country, where they ſhould reſt from their labours and dangers, after the conqueſts of ſo many Nations. <hi>Axalla</hi> was commanded at the ſame time to return with his Army, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were diſperſed abroad had orders ſent them to gather together in one body: the Emperor thought fit to take out of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſeven or eight thouſand Inhabitans, placing other people in their ſtead, and to leave in Garriſon ſix thouſand horſe and ten thouſand foot.</p>
               <p>Whiles theſe things were doing <hi>Calibes</hi> arrived, and was received by the Prince in that kind man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that his ſervices had deſerved, he gave him his Commiſſion and Inſtructions what to do in his abſence, and placed him under him as his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General, in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the Country round about. <hi>Zamolzan</hi> a man of great reputation, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed forty thouſand horſe and fifty thouſand
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40153:103"/>
foot, to remain behind with <hi>Calibes.</hi> Some of them were placed in Garriſons, in the ſtrong Caſtles, and near the Sea-ſide, and the reſt were to be in readineſs together in one body, and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Zamolzan</hi> until <hi>Calibes</hi> ſhould return from <hi>Cairo,</hi> whither the Prince intended to lead him, to take poſſeſſion there of his Government of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and of all the Countries of <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Barbary,</hi> which had ſubmitted to him.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour had thus ſettled all things, and underſtood, that all his new ſubjects were raviſh'd in admiration of his kindneſs, moderation and juſtice, and were not ſorry to be govern'd, and overcome by a Prince ſo worthy to command, becauſe of his rare qualities, and good inclinations, when he had cauſed the Inhabitans of <hi>Cairo, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and of the Country thereabouts, to ſwear to be faithful to him, he cauſed his Army to march homewards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Van</hi> was commanded by <hi>Axalla,</hi> and the body of the Army, by the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi>; he had given his orders to <hi>Calibes,</hi> how he deſired that he ſhould behave himſelf in his Government, and at his departure he embraced him as a friend. From <hi>Cairo</hi> he marched ſtrait to Jeruſalem, whither he returned with few of his followers, he ſtaid there eleven dayes to viſit again the Sepulcher of Jeſus Chriſt the God of Chriſtians, every day he went thither to perform his devotions He cauſed alſo ſome of the Ground of this place to be carried with him to <hi>Samarcand</hi> to honour and ſanctifie, as he ſaid the places there of devotion.</p>
               <p>He viſited again the ruines of the Temple of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> that he might after that model build one like
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40153:103"/>
to it, at <hi>Samarcand.</hi> When he conſidered this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which heretofore was the Royal Palace of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> he lamented to look upon the ruines, becauſe it was not yet in its former ſplendor and glory, which caus'd it to be admired heretofore by all the World. Such was the Love and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he had for things eſteem'd Holy and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. He had a contempt for the Jews and could not endure them, for he expreſſed a deteſtation of their cruelty in murdering him, who came to ſave them. The Emperour therefore out of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> made it a free City without taxes, or ſubſides, or Garriſon. He gave great gifts to the Monaſteries, whom he reſpected while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the great <hi>Chamberlain</hi> was received as General in the Army, which <hi>Calibes</hi> had left him, he went to beſiege <hi>Meleg,</hi> a Town ſcituate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> but when he had batter'd the Walls and reduc'd the Inhabitants to great wants, he was forced to raiſe the Seige, for the City was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived by the Princes of <hi>Quillean</hi> and <hi>Caldar,</hi> and others, who had united together, being thereunto incouraged by a falſe report that the Emperour had been defeated. This news had cauſed all the neighbouring Provinces to riſe up in Arms; before they were afraid to ſtir, but now they gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an Army and march'd againſt the great <hi>Chamberlan</hi> to fight him, he had no orders from <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> to adventure his Army in a battle, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore retreated back and retrench'd himſelf along the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> waiting there for the coming of the Enemies. They attempted ſeveral times in vain, to force him to go out of the Trenches. But he
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40153:104"/>
ſent News to the Emperour of the preſent poſture of his affairs, that he might have ſome ſuccour ſent him, for he thought that the Enemies would not be ſo bold to adventure upon him in his ſtrength. But they were ſo proud to have obliged him to depart from before <hi>Meleg,</hi> that they reſolved to aſſault his Camp, and the rather, becauſe they imagin'd that they had filled his Army with fears and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They thought to ſucceed and to increaſe thereby the Glory of their Souldiers, becauſe the <hi>Chamberlain</hi> was but a young man, whom they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be without experience in War, and fitter for a peaceable Court, where he had been train'd up, than for a Camp and an Army. They had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been ſo bold if <hi>Calibes</hi> had yet command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, for amongſt all the Commanders of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan, Calibes</hi> was look'd upon to be the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced and valiant Captain next to <hi>Axalla.</hi> In a morning therefore they lodg'd their Army near the <hi>Chamberlains</hi> Camp. He had given a ſtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that no Soldier ſhould offer to go out, but to reſiſt ſtoutly if they were aſſaulted. He drew up all his men in order of battle, and with the advice and direction of ſome of his chief Officers placed them in ſuch a manner that he could ſuccour and relieve them in any place, where they might be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, in this poſture they waited for the Enemy, who made to them with fury and great cryes. There was fifty thouſand foot divided into two parties, that they might attack the Camp in two ſeveral places. But the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Camp was ſo ordered that there was a place for the Cavalry to go out and fight under the ſhelter of the Trenches. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies had not minded it, therefore they had ſent
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40153:104"/>
away theirs beyond a ſmall River, whether they imagin'd that the <hi>Tartars</hi> would retreat in haſte, for fear of their foot, and by that means they would purſue and cut them off. In the <hi>Chamberlains</hi> Camp were eighteen thouſand horſe and forty thouſand foot, with a great deal of baggage and many priſoners, whom the great <hi>Chamberlain</hi> had cauſed to work ſo briskly in the Trenches, that they were ſtronger than the Walls of the Town of <hi>Meleg.</hi> The fight laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three hours, the <hi>Tartars</hi> defended themſelves bravely. And ſo many of the Enemies Army were deſtroyed, that the <hi>Chamberlain</hi> imagin'd that he was able to aſſault them in his turn; for that purpoſe, whiles his men dallied with the aſſailours, to keep them in heart, he commanded out his Cavalry by that way mentioned before, which broke in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Enemies infantry, ſo furiouſly, that they killed them at their pleaſure, till they were weary. At that inſtant he underſtood that the Enemies Horſe were coming back over the River to help their foot, which cauſed him to ſound a retreat into the Trenches, for he was not willing to hazard any thing but upon good terms, knowing that this Cavalry was compoſed of thirty thouſand men. The Enemy loſt this day five and twenty thouſand of their beſt Souldiers, not only by the ſally of the Horſe, but alſo at the aſſaulting of the Camp. The General or chief Commander of this expedition, being the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> named <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> loſt his Life in giving great teſtimonies of his courage and valour.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Emperour had received the news ſent to him from the great <hi>Chamberlain</hi> of the riſing of the Princes of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40153:105"/>
of <hi>Meleg,</hi> he diſpatched away <hi>Axallae</hi> with the <hi>Parthians</hi> Cavalry, but he had not marched three dayes journy, but he received the news of their overthrow. He ſent word of it to <hi>Tamerlan</hi> expecting at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> other orders.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Emperour underſtood theſe things he cauſed them to be publiſh'd abroad, and ſent word to <hi>Calibes,</hi> that he might, by diſperſing the news amongſt the Troops, ſatisfy all diſcontented minds, who were perſwaded that the Chamberlains Army was totally defeated, the Emperour expreſſed more joy of this Victory than for all that he ever won in his own perſon, ſome think that it proceeded from a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to have not been miſtaken in the choice he made of the great Chamberlain, to act in an employ that ſeem'd to be beyond the capacity of a young man, for had he miſcarried many would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt the Prince, to have pitched upon him, his wiſe conduct and valour won him the praiſes of every one, and of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> alſo, who could not forbear to commend him. It was then report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Emperour having a great deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>urn to his Kingdome and Patrimony, that he might ſecure it by his preſence; for fear that a longer abſence or ſome other diſgrace, ſhould beget an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in ſome of his people to be troubleſome, was reſolved for the future to govern his Armies by his Lieutenants, and therefore before the Winter he would paſs over the Mountains of <hi>Imaus.</hi> He ſent orders to <hi>Axalla</hi> to return and ſtop in the road, in all ſtrong places of <hi>Judea</hi> he places his Garriſons, and in <hi>Syria.</hi> Of other Cities that he had no mind to guard he pulled down the Walls, ſome people whom he ſuſpected, he carried with him, put others
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40153:105"/>
in their room, and in ſeveral Provinces he made new Collonies, as he had done in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. He ſent home about this time, the ſuccours of the Greek Emperour, he cauſed the meaneſt Souldier to receive his pay, and treated ſo liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Officers of the late Prince <hi>Andronicus,</hi> that they departed wonderfully well ſatisfied, that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was as much to be admired for his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificences: And gratitude, as for his other rare qualities, about this time his Chancellour, whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he followed in many things, moved him in this juncture of time, to ſeize upon the Empire of <hi>Greece</hi> before he returned to <hi>Tartary,</hi> ſhewing him how needful thoſe Countries would be to him, now that he had conquered the Territories of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> that great Princes are not to keep their word and promiſes, no longer than they are uſeful for their Countery. He repreſented to him, that he was the man, whom all the World look'd upon, as their Prince, that many Nations lived peacably under his protection, that he ought not to neglect an advantage which would procure to the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Tartarians</hi> much honour and glory, and that it was needful for him to take that Empire into his hands, that he might make <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the chief ſeat of all the conquered Countries, that he might have nothing but the Sea to limit his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> returned him this anſwer, that he deſired that the Empire of the <hi>Parthians</hi> might have narrower bounds in obſerving the rules of Juſtice, than to inlarge them by the commiſſion of a crime. That the Emperour of <hi>Greece</hi> was his friend, his neighbour and his Ally, that if he did offer to forget himſelf, and break the bonds of aimity
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40153:106"/>
that tied them together, and the faith which had been ſolemnly ſworn, he would make him experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence his power, and that God would doubtleſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him in the proſecution of a juſt cauſe. I think, ſaid he, to him, my friend, I cannot do any thing more honourable, and more glorious, for my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and for the <hi>Parthian</hi> Nation, than to make Poſterity to underſtand, that an Emperour of that Nation came from a far Country on purpoſe to give a check to the boldneſs, and inſolency of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and to free the Nobility of <hi>Greece</hi> from his unmerciful Tyranny, and though I could have taken all their Country into my hand with eaſe, I have abſtained from the ſurpriſal of a Great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and of the moſt beautiful City of the world, ſo that I have neglected all the motions of ambition to follow the rules of Juſtice and equity, I may with reaſon boaſt, that I have not gained a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Victory than this, though I have conquered ſo many Nations and differing people, and that my Armies have alwayes been happy and ſucceſsful. It is an ordinary thing to win battles, and ſubdue Kingdomes, and Empires, many have performed theſe things before me, but few of thoſe Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours are to be found, who have cauſed their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſubmit, and be ruled by their juſtice, they have for the moſt part when power was in their hands for their conveniency, ſeized upon other mens eſtates, and plundered the Provinces belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to other men. I ſhall recommend this example to Poſterity, that equity hath been alwayes the rule of my actions, the faith I keep to my enemies makes them to become my moſt aſſured friends, what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, think you, that it will have upon thoſe who are
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40153:106"/>
already mine, Will not my honourable and juſt proceedings ſecure and increaſe my well wiſhers? Approve therefore my dealing, and perſwade me not for the future to act contrary to it. The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, who was a wiſe man, but inclinable to ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſubmitted to ſuch ſtrong reaſons and departed.</p>
               <p>He told <hi>Alhacent</hi> immediately after all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of this diſcourſe, he hath therefore inſerted it in his Hiſtory, that the World might know the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temper and the noble courage of this Prince. Therefore he, who ſhall ſee in him ſo many rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, will not eaſily aſcribe, to meer chance or blind fortune, which favours wicked men as often as it doth the beſt natures, his great ſucceſſes and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conqueſts: but he will doubtleſs confeſs, that his proſperities were bleſſings of Heaven, and rewards of his Piety and Vertues in this life.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour was at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruined that City, becauſe it had reſiſted him, his Army lodg'd there eight days. <hi>Axalla,</hi> who expected him there, had orders to ſend ſix thouſand horſe to the aſſiſtance of the great Chamberlain: That he might paſs more ſecurely and more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over <hi>Euphrates</hi> to the ſiege of <hi>Meleg,</hi> he took it in three days as well as <hi>Raffan.</hi> All the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try thereabouts ſubmited to the Prince, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Cities upon the River <hi>Euphrates.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> commanded his party to ſtay for him at the paſſage, that he might march with all his forces together towards the Emperour, who embraced him very kindly, and in the preſence of all his chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, extolled his valour and courage. He ſent him afterwards to his Government with order to ſend back the ſix thouſand horſe, which had been ſent to

him, that they might joyn with the Van-guard com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Axalla,</hi> from whence they had been taken The whole Army marched in a line, <hi>Axalla</hi> upon the right hand, the great Chamberlain upon the left, and the Emperour in the middle of the Troops. The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> was with him, I ſhall not buſie my ſelf in reckoning up all the Cavalry and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Infantry in the Army, nor the great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Princes who commanded there, for fear of being too prolix in this narration. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that the Emperour arrived at <hi>Meleg,</hi> where he went over <hi>Euphrates</hi> and ſeparated ten thouſand horſe and fifteen thouſand foot, to ſend back to <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi> that he might uſe them in caſe of need. The Prince of <hi>Aracen</hi> had the command of them.</p>
               <p>He was ordered firſt to march to Babylon and take it.

But for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this Hiſtory, we muſt know that ſince the Chriſtian or Roman Empire, theſe people had

The Prince of <hi>Aracen</hi> was immediately diſpatch'd and ſent towards <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Tamerlan</hi> went himſelf to <hi>Babylon,</hi> to terrifie the more the Inhabitants in caſe they would offer to withſtand him, and to aſſure them of his bounty and mercy in caſe they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it.

               <p>In Eleven dayes <hi>Tamerlan</hi> marched to <hi>Babylon,</hi> which yeilded, as all other places thereabouts.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40153:108"/>
Country, and a remembrance of their Country-men: for this cauſe, was the Prince favourable to them, and look'd not upon their City as a conquered place, but as his own Patrimony newly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Enemy. It was firſt taken by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hali,</hi> one of his Fathers Lieutenant Generals, who had left a good name and eſteem behind him in <hi>Sachetay,</hi> becauſe of his great ſervices that he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to his Country. From this City the Prince made haſte towards <hi>Armenia,</hi> for <hi>Axalla</hi> had ſent him word that a <hi>Perſian</hi> Prince, named <hi>Guines,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make peace with him, and render him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for his Country. This news cauſed him with all ſpeed to march towards him, and out of a reſpect to him to meet him in the way. For <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had a great eſteem for him, becauſe of his reputation of holineſs, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf happy to be acquainted with ſuch a religious and devout perſon. He left the conduct of the Army with the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> to follow him, ſoftly advancing before to the place where <hi>Axalla</hi> waited for <hi>Guines</hi> to receive and welcome him.</p>
               <p>The Emperour had alſo diſpatched the Prince of <hi>Liſeaceau</hi> and his Chancellour, to aſſure him of his affection and joy to ſee him. For he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſhew him all the honour that he could poſſibly expreſs, and to gratifie him in all things. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had news brought him that he was hard by coming to him with a mean attendance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with beaſts of all kinds with which, he ſaid, he inſtructed men. The Emperour went to meet him in great State.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Guines</hi> perceived him at a diſtance, he lifted up his eyes to Heaven, and prayed for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40153:108"/>
greatneſs, and the propagation of his Prophets Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but he excommunicated and curſed the <hi>Turks,</hi> as the Enemies of his Faith. The Emperour was ſurpriſed to ſee him in ſuch a contemptible garb and appearance, but he was ſo far from deſpiſing him for it, that he honoured him the more. And becauſe he was naturally a great admirer of ſuch ſort of people, he gave him a preſent which the other accepted with Joy. He gave him fifteen or ſixteen thouſand Priſoners taken from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, that he might inſtruct them in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his Religion. This gift was ſo much the more grateful to him, becauſe thereby his power increas'd, and he hoped to make theſe men imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his manners and receive his Doctrine. But this ſeeming devotion was not ſo pleaſing to the Courtiers, as it was to the Emperour. For they had good reaſon to blame the proceedings of this <hi>Perſian</hi> Prince, who, under a colour of holineſs and piety, knew how to take from his neighbours their Country and Eſtates.</p>
               <p>They blamed alſo <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> for ſuffering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be cozen'd with his hypocriſies, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by that ſubtil <hi>Bigot.</hi> But when all things are conſidered, that reverence that is due to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and <hi>Tamerlans</hi> charitable thoughts of others anſwerable to his own ſincerity, will cauſe all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ceaſe, for his undeſerved reſpects to this great <hi>Cheat.</hi> I am not of opinion of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a Sovereign Prince might ought not to have ſo much regard to Religion, for it is a thing that never any man had cauſe to complain of.</p>
               <p>It was not without deſign that <hi>Guines</hi> viſited the Emperour with all that outward appearance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40153:109"/>
and devotion. Onely his private bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit cauſed him to take on this Mask. He was not ſtrong enough to maintain a neutrality or ſtop the paſſage of the Army. He deſired therefore to inſinuate himſelf into the favour, and obtain the protection of its chief Commander. And as he found the Prince inclinable to Piety, he thought that the beſt means to ſecure his intereſt would be to make a profeſſion of Vertue and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He ſeldome went from the Emperours Elbows, and declared himſelf to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour of the Nations that confine upon <hi>Perſia,</hi> exhorting them all to imitate his example, and yield obedience to the Emperour. This forced and intereſted humility proved advantageous to him and to his ſucceſſours, for it laid a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his and their future greatneſs, by his means all <hi>Perſia</hi> ſubmitted to him, <hi>Tauris</hi> onely except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is a great rich and powerful City, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great many Towns belonging to it. It was governed by a Commonwealth, and could not ſuffer the riſing greatneſs of <hi>Guines,</hi> whoſe deſigns it labour'd to thwart.</p>
               <p>There was a Captain named <hi>Taliſmahar</hi> choſen by the Inhabitants, for the General of their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia.</hi> And at that juncture of time they had made him their Soveraign to command them in chief. This Captain underſtood how welcome <hi>Guines</hi> had been to the Prince, and that without doubt, he would not fail to ſolicite him, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Tauris,</hi> and alter the Government. But he hoped that <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> very paſſionate for his return, would not inſiſt nor continue obſtinate in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, if he ſhould perceive the people reſolved in a couragious defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:40153:109"/>As ſoon as he had ſetled every thing in his new principality, he diſpatched away Embaſſadours to <hi>Tamerlan</hi> to underſtand his intentions. They had orders to tell him, that <hi>Guines</hi> by a pretence of devotion and reformation in Religion, uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the lands of his neighbours, and by a damnable hypocriſie ſeized upon other mens eſtates and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances. The Emperour ſeem'd to be ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear that which he deſired not to believe concerning <hi>Guines,</hi> and ſent back word to <hi>Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahar,</hi> to come to him in perſon, and accuſe <hi>Guines</hi> of the things he laid to his charge. He ſent him alſo word, that he intended to re-enter into the poſſeſſion of his ancient Rights in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and that he would force all thoſe that would offer to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him or refuſe to render what belong'd to him. He was very attentive to the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours diſcourſe, for by it, he diſcover'd the means to enlarge his Empire through their diviſions. He underſtood likewiſe, <hi>That the Cloak of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is fit to hide many baſe Cheats.</hi> But he would not diſcover his intentions, only he march'd forward with <hi>Guines</hi> in his company, and whereſoever he went, all people and perſons ſubmitted and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience. According to his uſual cuſtome, he put new Colonies into all fortified Towns, which might give him any jealouſie. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Guines</hi> had a great influence upon all the Inhabitants, to oblige them to obey <hi>Tamerlans</hi> Commands.</p>
               <p>But his moſt earneſt deſire was to get <hi>Tauris,</hi> a conſiderable City, for its greatneſs, ſtrength, and power, and the chief of the Country. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to win it by policy, for he ſent thither his
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40153:110"/>
Agents to promiſe <hi>Taliſmahar,</hi> another Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Empire. Which doubtleſs, he would have accepted willingly, had it not been for <hi>Guines,</hi> his mortal Enemy, whom he ſaw ſo welcome to the Prince. The fear therefore of his malice, cauſed him to perſwade the Inhabitants to endure all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries rather than to fall under the command of that falſe Prophet. The Emperour was vexed to underſtand their reſolution, and that <hi>Guines</hi>'s fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with him and company was the greateſt obſtacle to the ſurrending of this great City. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> acquainted him with it very kindly to be ſooner rid of him, for that purpoſe he loaded him with honours and gifts, and obliged him to return to his own Country after fourteen or fifteen days abode with him, <hi>Guines</hi>'s Country ſtretches it ſelf from <hi>Sancauſan,</hi> as far as the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea. <hi>Axalla</hi> was then commanded to go forward with his <hi>Vanguard</hi> into the Territory of <hi>Tauris,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all that ſhould offer to make any reſiſtance with fire and ſword. By this means, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Guines,</hi> he ſubdued the Provinces of <hi>Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Tapereſtan,</hi> which till then reſiſted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and invaſions of the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Taliſmahar</hi> underſtood that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was approaching into his Country, he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to draw towards them with his Cavalry and Infantry to ſtrengthen the places which might ſtop and hold out againſt the Enemy. He had with him thirty thouſand good ſtout horſe able to make reſiſtance, commanded as they were by an experienced General. The Tartarian Army was tired out with their tedious journey and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual march beſides they wanted proviſions in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40153:110"/>
this ſeaſon, in the beginning of the winter not fit for a Camp. But <hi>Taliſmahar</hi> was chiefly troubled at the unconſtancy of the Inhabitants of <hi>Tauris,</hi> who were inclinable, if any miſhap ſhould fall upon his Army, to riſe in armes againſt him and mutiny in the City. This apprehenſion ſtaid him in the place, and cauſed him to ſend againſt the <hi>Tartars</hi> his Cavalry, under the command of his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, named <hi>Camares,</hi> a man of experience and faithful. He order'd him to weary his enemies as much as poſſible, and not to venture to fight, but upon ſurprizals, and in caſes of advantage. For <hi>Taliſmahar</hi> knew for certain, that a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that muſt needs cover over a great compaſs of ground, could not but ſcatter about. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign therefore was to cut off the looſe Troops and the skirts of the Army.</p>
               <p>The Emperour foreſaw his intent, therefore he wiſely commanded <hi>Axalla</hi> to be upon his guard, and to take heed leſt his men ſhould be ſurprized unawares, for he was already in the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Tauris,</hi> and had ſent his ſummons to a Town, named <hi>Cafechion,</hi> which <hi>Camares</hi> had ſtrengthen'd with a party of Souldiers. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour refuſed to yield, which caus'd <hi>Axalla</hi> to block up the place, and with all ſpeed he raiſed a mount on a ſudden, from whence the <hi>Tartars</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their enemies upon the walls, and killed great numbers of them. But this diſadvantage was ſo far from affrighting them, that it ſeem'd to encourage them the more. So that <hi>Axalla</hi> weary of their obſtinacy commanded a general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, which forced them rather by the numbers of the beſiegers, than for want of courage in the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40153:111"/>
beſieged. The <hi>Tartarians</hi> ſpared none within the Walls, but kill'd every man. Whiles they were buſily imployed in plundering the Town, <hi>Cama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> arriv'd with a party of horſe to relieve it, not knowing that it was taken. In his way he met with ten thouſand Horſe ſent to wait in the road. For <hi>Axalla</hi> had imagin'd he would make this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. <hi>Camares</hi> ſent four thouſand of his men to attack them, which they performed ſo couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that they drove them to their body of horſe, where <hi>Axalla</hi> was in perſon: in the mean whiles <hi>Camares</hi> ſtaid with the reſt of his Army in good order, animating and encouraging his men. But when he ſaw what had happen'd, he was afraid of the coming of the whole <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſounded a retreat, and marched ſtill in good order, with an eye upon <hi>Axalla</hi>'s motion not to be ſurprized. This experienced Captain ſoon perceived his intent, therefore he order'd ſix thouſand <hi>Parthian</hi> horſe to follow cloſe after him, and to aſſault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they could, the enemies Cavalry, which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly performed with courage. The fight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was renewed between theſe ſix thouſand <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> and the four thouſand enemies horſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any appearance of victory on either ſide, but they ſtill continued in their retreat obſerving a good order till they came to the paſſage of a River, where <hi>Camares</hi> ſeem'd to intrench himſelf; for that purpoſe he drew up all his men in order of battel, and ſeized upon all the paſſages ſending often his Troops to relieve them that were too hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet by the <hi>Tartarians:</hi> but in the mean while <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> had cauſed his Infantry to advance, and to force one of the paſſages, but they found that <hi>Camares</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:40153:111"/>
with his men were gone a great way, having left behind them a garriſon in <hi>Gorgechin,</hi> a ſmall Town, able to hold out eight or ten dayes; this was the way that he took to weary and tire out the <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Army: beſides he made a deſtruction every where of proviſions and fodder, that his enemies Army might meet with no relief in their march, hoping by this crafty proceeding to lengthen the war. But the Inhabitants of <hi>Gorgechin</hi> had no ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, they had freſh before their eyes the ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a neighbouring Town ſufficiently puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for its obſtinacy in reſiſting the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they were not willing to fall into the ſame calamity, but to improve the folly of their neighbours. This cauſed them to deſire to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate, which was granted, and the Town yielded up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> there underſtood that <hi>Camares</hi> was at <hi>Archiech,</hi> ten leagues off. He detached ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Parthian</hi> Horſe, ſix thouſand <hi>Scythian,</hi> and ten thouſand choſen <hi>Stradiots</hi> to ſee to ſurprize him. The better to compaſs his deſign he ſent a report before, that <hi>Gorgechin</hi> did yet hold out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in expectation of being relieved, only to cauſe <hi>Camares</hi> to ſtay. He advanced ſtill with that choſen party, and gave order to the reſt of his Army to follow ſpeedily after him. By this ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he ſurprized the Enemies unawares in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they lay encamped about a Country Town. In the way he met with a thouſand Horſe, whom he put to flight, and purſued as far as their Camp. Then he drew up his men in battle, in the avenues and wayes thereabouts, that his enemies might not eſcape without fighting. And becauſe they
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40153:112"/>
were ſo pen'd up, that there was but one way for <hi>Camares</hi> to retreat with his Army. <hi>Axalla</hi> placed there all his infantry in the enemies view: when he underſtood that <hi>Camares</hi> had nothing but horſe with him, he cauſed ſeveral Trenches to be drawn to hinder the horſe from getting out. Of all theſe paſſages he had ſent word to the Emperour, who was marching ſpeedily after him, having ſent before in all haſte, the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> with twenty thouſand horſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Camares</hi> thought that the whole Army had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him, ſeeing therefore a neceſſity, either to yield without reſiſtance, or fight with diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, there being but one way for him to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape out, which was alſo ſtrongly guarded, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſave himſelf betimes. For that purpoſe he had made a Trench a long a little hill, under which he drew up his men with a full purpoſe to break through four thouſand <hi>Tartarian</hi> horſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there to guard that paſſage. He thought that he could eaſily cut in pieces ſo ſmall a number, that ſtood in his way, Therefore about midnight, the Moon yielding a great light, as <hi>Axalla</hi> was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding about to viſit his Guards with two thouſand Horſe, he underſtood, that the Enemy was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fires about that Trench. He ſoon perceived their intent, therefore he gave orders to have all his Horſemen ready mounted. This could not be ſo ſoon done, but the enemies were making a way through the Guards at the paſſage. They aſſaulted them at firſt with two thouſand Horſe, who found the <hi>Tartars</hi> for the moſt part a foot and unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo that they eaſily ran over them. But as they were advancing, they met with another
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40153:112"/>
Trench which had been drawn in oppoſition to theirs. This ſtopp'd them a while and gave time and leaſure to the <hi>Tartars</hi> to arm and ſuccour their Companions. Their enemies wanted no courage to reſiſt and aſſault them, for they won the Trenches, which they laboured with the aſſiſtance of ſome foot to level. In this place the hurly burly was great, and the fight bloudy, for the Infantry being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly broken, could not eaſily rally, but were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all cut in peices. But as they advanced fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they ſhould have done they gave an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and time to ſix thouſand of <hi>Axalla's</hi> horſe, who were upon Guard about half a mile diſtant, to come in good time to charge them in diſorder.</p>
               <p>In this manner <hi>Camares</hi> paſſed over the firſt Trenches, and was advancing forward to diſingage his men, when <hi>Axalla</hi> came in ſuddainly to him with two or three thouſand horſe, whom he had found ready, ſeeing therefore the danger of his men he charged without diſpute, the enemy who was looking about for a way to retreat with no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to hazard a battle. Doubtleſs, they had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped through a paſſage, where they thought there had been no body, if they had not met with ſix thouſand men, whom <hi>Axalla</hi> had appointed to ſtop there. <hi>Cameres</hi> attackt them in vain, he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven back with loſs, which cauſed him to try ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place lower with a purpoſe to fight his way through, if he could not break through otherwiſe. When he ſaw himſelf purſued ſo cloſe at the heels by <hi>Axalla,</hi> with ſeven thouſand <hi>Parthian</hi> horſe and <hi>Stradiots,</hi> he faced about with twelve or thirteen thouſand men that he had yet left, and then like a furious beaſt in deſpair, he fell upon <hi>Axalla</hi>'s par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40153:113"/>
In this moment of time he ſhewed his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and courage, and received the enemies charge without loſing much ground. At the ſecond charge <hi>Axalla's</hi> horſe was killed under him with a Lance, but he was as ſoon mounted again, had it not been for the coming in of <hi>Damacen,</hi> whom he expected, and who had orders to follow him with eight or ten thouſand freſh horſe, he had been forced to a retreat. When this party came in they found <hi>Axalla</hi>'s men broken, though they yet obſtinately held out againſt the furious enemy. But the coming of theſe freſh Troops, routed and utterly defeated them. When <hi>Camares</hi> ſaw unto what neceſſity he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he endeavoured to rally all his broken Army, and to make way through his enemies, but in this laſt attempt, he was killed in the fight perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actions worthy of an immortal Name. All this was done in the night by the light of the Moon. The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> was then in the Camp to guard it. The next day the Emperour himſelf arrived, where the battle was fought, when he ſaw the number of the ſlain, he could not ſufficiently praiſe <hi>Axalla</hi> for his wiſdome, care, and carriage, but he would not pardon the unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the negligence, and ſlothfulneſs of thoſe Captains, that were then upon the Guard, who had been ſurprized unawares. He cauſed two to be examin'd and tried, they were found guilty, and puniſhed according to the Law of Arms.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Archiecho</hi> had received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Town, five or ſix thouſand of the ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Army, but when they ſaw the reſt defeated, and <hi>Camares</hi> head they had no courage to withſtand or make reſiſtance, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired therefore Articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:40153:113"/>The Emperour granted them peace upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that thoſe Souldiers, that were within their Walls, ſhould not return to <hi>Tauris,</hi> but to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place whither they deſired to go. They intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leave to march to <hi>Lovain,</hi> and promiſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form whatſoever the Inhabitants of <hi>Tauris</hi> ſhould agree to. This misfortune of <hi>Camares</hi> aſtoniſh'd them all, they could not but wonder that he had ſhut himſelf up. If he had had, as they thought, more diſcretion, he had eaſily found work for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy a while, and doubtleſs in a retreat he might have met with an opportunity to fall upon the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> with advantage. At that inſtant the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour cauſed his Army to decamp, and went to lodge at eight leagues from <hi>Tauris.</hi> The body of the Army was at <hi>Sederva,</hi> and the <hi>Van</hi> at <hi>Chiara.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Axalla</hi> had appeared with his <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard,</hi> before the Walls of <hi>Tauris.</hi> The whole City was full of fears, but much more when <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had ſent in a Trumpeter with a meſſage. They were then in their Town houſe. The faction of <hi>Guines,</hi> though the weakeſt began to lift up their heads, when they ſaw the contrary party troubled, requiring earneſtly that the Emperours commands might be obeyed.

But that we may better underſtand in what trouble theſe people were in, we muſt know that as ſoon as they heard that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was upon their bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they choſe <hi>Taliſmahar</hi> for their Prince, who before had been but their General. They ſwore to

him to die rather a thouſand deaths than to yield to the Empire of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> or to hearken to any accommodation, when they ſaw how all things were changed, they repented of their former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and of the choice they had made ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant are the minds of the common people. They were ſo much the more diſſatisfied with <hi>Taliſmahar,</hi> becauſe before he had declared that he was ſtrong enough, not only to withſtand the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> but alſo to drive them again into their Country. Now all theſe promiſes ſeem'd to be but vain, on the contrary they ſaw the enemies Army victorious and full of many ſorts of people, <hi>Cama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> and his men lately overthrown, and the <hi>Tartars</hi> drawing near their Walls to block them up and puniſh them, if they offered to reſiſt. They knew alſo that the Emperour had ſent them word that if they would ſubmit to him, he would deal with them kindly, and not ſuffer the Army to approach nearer than four leagues of their City. Their Prieſts were the moſt obſtinate to hold out, for fear of being conſtrain'd to ſubmit to the reformation of <hi>Guines.</hi> But his ſuperſtitions began to appear leſs frightful to theſe Inhabitants. They common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to one another: <hi>Shall we for fear of that which may chance never to happen, run headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our certain ruine? Shall we be any longer cozen'd with the promiſes of our new Prince, who hath been defeated? Have we not heard of the plundering of</hi> Cairo, <hi>and of the many Towns which</hi> Tamerlan <hi>hath conquered?

cloak'd with an appearance of Devotion and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Piety? Let us free our ſelves from theſe fears by a bold reſolution. Let us acknowledge him for our Lord, who is the greateſt of all men, and is beſt able to maintain us in Peace and Plenty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe diſcourſes were openly ſpoken amongſt the people, and the chief men were not againſt this reſolution, though they found themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hold out a ſiege of three months and more, but they knew at laſt that they ſhould be forced to yield, for to expect <hi>Tamerlans</hi> Death, a young and luſty Prince, was a folly which they could not entertain. Therefore they concluded that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means to ſave themſelves was to ſubmit to him. <hi>Axalla,</hi> who was the neareſt to the City, was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the things that happen'd there, by his ſpies, he was careful to let the Emperour know all. He thought it not expedient to be too haſty in this juncture, whiles ſo many differing paſſions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd the Inhabitants of <hi>Tanais,</hi> becauſe they would oblige them to ſurrender and yield up their City. When the faction of <hi>Guines</hi> ſaw the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens irreſolution, they ſent Deputies to <hi>Tamerlan</hi> to underſtand his pleaſure, and know what he would grant them. This faction was ſcarce the ſixth part of the Inhabitants, but a body politick, as well as phyſick, cannot be wounded in one of its members, but the whole muſt ſuffer an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diviſion in a politick body is a gangrene, which increaſeth continually and devours the ſoundeſt part. When <hi>Taliſmahar</hi> underſtood of this deputation, which had been without his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, he knew not what remedy to apply to the publick diſtemper.</p>

                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:40153:115"/>He ſaw a powerful enemy at the Gates, a great diviſion in the City, he was loath to increaſe and anger it, and cauſe a general revolt by the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the guilty. He choſe rather with patience to withdraw himſelf, and obſerve at a diſtance how affairs would be tranſacted. It concerned the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Guines</hi> not to ſtop where they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, therefore they concluded with the Emperour, though of themſelves they could not make up above thirty thouſand men in caſe of need, but the Prince had promiſed them all the aſſiſtance that they ſhould want. So that when the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were returned back, they proclaimed every where his mildneſs and goodneſs, that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to do any wrong to the City, and that he deſired but a ſubmiſſion from the Inhabitants, and that the new Prince ſhould be yielded up to him. They ſaid moreover, that tho ſome fantaſtical Fools had elected him, they would not, to pleaſe their humour, loſe and deſtroy ſuch a flouriſhing City, and ſo many brave men. When the tumult increas'd by little and little, the chief Inhabitants were perſwaded in their aſſembly to ſend for the Deputies of the faction of <hi>Guines,</hi> to hear from their mouth, what the Emperour had ſpoken to them. They came with a great Train of their followers, and declared publickly, that the Emperour had aſſured them that he would not injure their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or goods. That he would preſerve their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all its priviledges, in caſe they would own him for their Prince, and forſake him whom they had lately elected, and his party. As ſoon as theſe words were ſpoken every one cried out, <hi>Let the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour live, and let them periſh,</hi> who will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

The tumult increaſed and became ſo violent, that neither the Senators nor the other Magiſtrates, nor the fear of the Souldiers were able to hinder it from ſpreading all over the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Taliſmahar</hi> was fled into his Palace, and had it not been for ſome that deſired him to ſtay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and not meddle with publick buſineſs, he would have imployed his Authority to ſtop the Tumult.

Secondly, they requeſted, that they might be maintained in the enjoyment of all their priviledges, as true Subjects of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, under which they deſired to live and die, and belong to the ſucceſſours of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> and not to the Empire of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The third related to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, which they were willing to pay, but intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Majeſty to moderate the taxes in regard of the continual Wars, which they had maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Guines,</hi> in defence of their own liberties.</p>
               <p>The Emperour after the hearing of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts granted them freely, and his deſign was to prevent all future miſchiefs and diviſions amongſt theſe people, he enacted that every one ſhould enjoy a freedome to embrace what Religion he liked beſt, whither that which was according to <hi>Guines</hi>'s Rule, or the pure Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or according to <hi>Haly</hi>'s interpretation.

               <p>All things being thus ordered, they ſubmitted to the Prince, and the very next day three hundred of the chiefeſt Citizens, in the name of the other Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants took the Oath of Allegiance.</p>
               <p>The Emperour was deſirous to make his Entry into the City, for that purpoſe, he ſent before him <hi>Axalla,</hi> with five thouſand horſe and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot, to provide all things needful. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants

put all the fortifications into his hands, he took poſſeſſion of the Gates of the Town, and cauſed all the Arms of the Citizens to be brought, and that without noiſe, for the people were perſwaded that they ſhould live in peace, under a Prince able to keep them in peace, and defend them againſt all enemies. When all things were ready, the Emperour arrived with much Pomp, and attended upon by all his Courtiers. He was received with great applauſe, and adored by every one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was not a little joyful to have gained ſo great a City to his Empire without bloudſhed, but the next day, the ſad news of his Unkles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe daſh'd all his joyes. The Empreſs ſent him word, that his Death had occaſioned ſome ſtirs in the Empire, but ſhe had cruſh'd them, by the taking and impriſonment of the chief Authors. This loſs afflicted him, but not ſo much as if he had not prepared to receive it. Had it not been for the great care of the Empreſs, the Old-man in his painful and tedious ſickneſs had been carried away by Death long before. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> wiſely ſuppreſſed his grief as well as the news, and would not ſuffer it to fly abroad in his Army for fear of any new motions: But he pitch'd upon Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> in whom he placed his greateſt confidence, to ſend him to the Empreſs to help her with his good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and aſſiſt her as Lieutenant General, with a large Commiſſion and Power, for he was well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by, and had a great Authority with the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. This faithful Servant left the Army and ſet forward with thirty thouſand horſe, publiſhing every where, that the Emperour followed him at the heels. But he ſtaid ſometime behind to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his intereſt there, and fruſtrate as much as

he could the intentions and deſignes of <hi>Guines,</hi> upon that Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla,</hi> who hated all hypocrits, cauſed <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> to be perſwaded, that this devout Knave aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Monarchy of <hi>Perſia.</hi> He wiſhed him therefore to weaken as much as he could that mans faction. The Emperour was alwayes inclinable to believe that <hi>Guines</hi> was a very real and honeſt man, whatever was told him by others, therefore he could never be obliged to ruine or croſs his affairs. This Indulgence and too great credulity, proved hurtful to the Princes Poſterity, for while he was alive, <hi>Guines</hi> kept himſelf within the bounds of moderation, but after his deceaſe, he publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad his ambitious intent. This is an excellent Leſſon for the greateſt Monarchs, who commonly look no farther than the time preſent, and are content with the ſubmiſſions and outward homages which their vertue and reputation draw from ſuch as ſtand in awe of them. They neglect to look into the time to come, and endeavour to ſecure for their poſterity, things that Death is going to take from them. In truth the ruine of this faction of <hi>Guines,</hi> ſetled peace in the Kingdomes of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Tamerlans</hi> ſucceſſours to enjoy it a long while.</p>
               <p>This ſubtil man had won the <hi>Chancellour,</hi> and ſome of the chief of the Emperours Council, by perſwading them, that his manner of ſerving God was the moſt agreeable with the Law of the Prophet. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had no intent to imitate it, but he would not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He ſaw that his abſence could in no caſe injury his affairs, and that the <hi>Tartarians</hi> would furniſh him with wayes and methods to ſucceed in his purpoſes.</p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40153:118"/>
themſelves, as ſo many petty Princes and Kings. He was willing that they ſhould ſee his Court in all its glory, his Pomp and Magnificence, and by his mildneſs and kind dealing, oblige them to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue faithful to his intereſt: this wrought ſo much upon them, that whiles he lived all <hi>Perſia</hi> was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to him, and furniſh'd a great many good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to fight under his banners, and people out of its boſome to ſecure <hi>Syria,</hi> and the <hi>Sultans</hi> Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> therefore having left the Prince of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais</hi> to govern <hi>Perſia</hi> in his abſence, he departed with his Troops towards <hi>Sachetay.</hi> This march of the Army was much like a Triumph: The priſoners went before, and amongſt them was <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> the Turkiſh Emperour, who was chain'd for fear that he ſhould offer violence to himſelf. This was an inſtance of the Worlds unconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but his misfortune had neither made him milder, nor more tractable. In his loweſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he abated nothing of his pride and haughty mind. All the people of the Country, through which <hi>Tamerlan</hi> paſſed, ſung forth his praiſes, and loaded him with Prayers and Bleſſings for his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories. At laſt he arrived at <hi>Samarcand</hi> with all the riches and ſpoils, and was received in a moſt glorious manner. Near two months were ſpent in feaſtings, playes, and all manner of publick rejoycings. The Emperour then called to mind a Vow that he had made, to build a moſt glorious Temple with an Hoſpital. Accordingly he now laid the foundations, and Dedicated it to the <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Immutable and Incomprehenſible GOD.</hi> And for the better carrying on of the work, he had ſent for all the able Artiſts, to employ them in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40153:119"/>
this Temple and Hoſpital, and in other glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtructures for the embelliſhing of this great City, for he had an intent to enlarge <hi>Samarcand</hi> and to render it as big again as it was before, for that purpoſe, he had marked out the ſtreets, and cauſed ground to be given to ſuch as deſired to build, and if perſons, were poor and not able, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd to them out of his Exchequer monies to carry on their work. He gave liberty to all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, that would dwell in the City, and ſettle their abode, and granted large priviledges to all the Citizens. And though he ſpent much time in ordering the affairs of this new City, he neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to manage and preſerve the affections of his Souldiers. He had cauſed all the names of the worthieſt of them, who had behav'd themſelves well, to be recorded, which Records he now called for, and, when they expected no ſuch matter, he gave them gifts and things anſwerable to their behaviour and ſervices, and promoted ſome to employments, ſutable to their Capacities and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents.</p>
               <p>Whiles he ſtaid at <hi>Samarcand,</hi> the Auxilliary Troops of the Moſcovites were refreſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Afterwards he diſmiſſed them with their full Wages, and deſired them to return his thanks to their Prince. <hi>Sinopes,</hi> a Nephew of Prince <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla,</hi> was ordered to conduct them through the Emperours Country, that they might not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and to renew the Alliance with the Great <hi>Duke,</hi> that he might be ſecure of the borders of <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

to be performed in the moſt glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, anſwerable to his Unkles deſervings and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur. He ſpent eight dayes in theſe funeral Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and afterwards left <hi>Bajazet</hi> in the keeping of the Governour of <hi>Sachetay</hi> at <hi>Samarcand,</hi> to go and viſit the Empreſs his Wife. But as his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt deſire was to live in Peace and Union with his Neighbours and Allies, and to preſerve the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that he had conquered, he thought fit for that purpoſe to ſend <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

During his abſence nothing had happened amiſs, but he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Nobazes</hi> to have a ſpecial care, to cauſe order and diſcipline to be obſerved amongſt his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as the beſt means to make them capable of the ſervices he expected from them.</p>
               <p>The Emperour departed for <hi>Quinzay</hi> with all the Court, and his ordinary guard of forty thouſand horſe and threeſcore thouſand foot. After ſeveral days march, he arrived through the acclamations and publick rejoycings of all the people at <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>mba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu,</hi> where he received the news of a battle won by <hi>Odmar,</hi> from one of the Generals of the King of <hi>China.</hi> He gave him an account by letters, that in purſuance of the Victory, he had taken three or four great Cities of that Kingdome. So that the King had been forced to ſue for peace the ſecond time, <hi>Odmar</hi> deſired therefore inſtructions upon what conditions he ſhould grant him peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:40153:120"/>The Emperour ſent him theſe conditions, which he ſhould require. That the King of <hi>China</hi> ſhould pay him all the arrears of the Tribute of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer years, unto which he was engaged by the firſt peace. That he ſhould be obliged to come to him and render him homage, as a vaſſal of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. That whiles he ſhould be in the way the Army ſhould depart. That all the Towns taken in this laſt War ſhould be reſtored, three onely excepted at the Emperours choice. That for all other things, they ſhould be reduced to the ſame condition as they were before this laſt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and that upon this condition, he ſhould pay the Emperours Army ſix moneths with all the charges of this War, which he had kindled of his own accord.</p>
               <p>The Emperour at the ſame time conſidered how to reward <hi>Odmar</hi> for his ſervices, he imagin'd no better way, than to promote him to the honour of his Alliance, by giving him his own Siſter in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. He ſent her therefore with a ſtately equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page and Train. So great a token of his reſpects and love he conceived, would ingage him the more, to be true, faithful, and careful, for his Princes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and perſon, and the good of his Empire. It is not to be imagin'd with what ſtate and in what glory <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was welcomed into <hi>Cambalu</hi>; for the Inhabitants of this great City, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him the remembrance of their former rebellion, endeavoured, beyond all others, to expreſs their zeal and affection for him. The Prince was ſo well pleaſed with them, that he reſtored all their priviledges, which had been taken from them during <hi>Calix</hi>'s revolt. Every where when he
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40153:120"/>
paſſed by, there was nothing heard but Prayers and Bleſſings from all the people, and thankful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from himſelf, for he labour'd to win the hearts of his Subjects of this great Empire, which was fallen into his hands. Not only the Towns and Cities did ring with applauſes, and ſhouts of joy, but alſo the Country round about were glad to ſee him well and ſafely returned, when he paſſed by the <hi>Herds,</hi> theſe are certain Families, that have no ſetled abode, but wander up and down the fields, when they are weary in one place, they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to another, and alwayes ſtop where they meet with moſt graſs for their Cattle.</p>
               <p>The Empreſs came to <hi>Cambalu</hi> to meet the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, having left behind <hi>Axalla</hi> at <hi>Quinzay,</hi> to command in her abſence. And becauſe this great City is neareſt to mount <hi>Althay,</hi> where the Scythian Emperours called Great <hi>Chams,</hi> are uſually interred from this City. The Emperour cauſed the Corps of his deceaſed Unkle to be carried with all the Pomp and State imaginable. He himſelf follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Herſe; and though it is not uſual to ſee women in ſuch occaſions, he deſired (to expreſs more honor to her Father) that the Empreſs ſhould accompany the body with him; they walked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This he did, to give a greater authority to the Empreſs in the Eyes of the World, that in caſe God ſhould take him away, before their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were at Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe might be thought worthy to govern the Empire during their minority, as he himſelf judged her, by all the publick ſigns, that he could give in all occaſions. The Prince was ſo much taken with her behaviour and vertuous carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that he would not love any other women,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40153:121"/>
nor ſuffer his affections to wander up and down upon meaner objects. Here he had fixed his mind, here he had confined his deſires and appetite. He look'd with contempt upon all other, neither their beauty, nor the charms of Wit, nor the amorous inclinations of the female Sex, could prevail upon his inflexible ſoul, and oblige him to that variety of amours, in which men of his Religion and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation commonly indulge themſelves. For as he was naturally very chaſt, he intended no other thing by his Marriage, but to have Children to perpetuate his Name and Family, and ſucceed him in the Empire.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the funeral Ceremonies were over, and the Emperours Corps laid in the Sepulcher of his Anceſtors, he returned to <hi>Cambalu,</hi> ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Winter in Races, in Tilts, and hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all manner of Beaſts. He had pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ched upon that City, as neareſt to <hi>China,</hi> from whence he deſired to hear News often, intending to go thither the following Summer, if neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, for he was reſolved to take care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what he had Conquered there by his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and good Fortune, and to enjoy the fruits of his Labours. He was likewiſe buſie in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the buildings, that he had begun at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marcand,</hi> and in compleating them as ſoon as he could.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, <hi>Axalla</hi> dwelt at <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zay,</hi> well beloved of the Souldiers and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. They had an affection for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Mildneſs, Liberality, Courage, Juſtice, and other admirable qualities. They all knew what credit he had with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40153:121"/>
Therefore they made their addreſs to him, to intreat him, to perſwade the Emperour that they might have the advantage to ſee him in their City, and to chooſe it, for to bring up the Prince his Son. At his requeſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour granted them their deſire, appointing <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> to govern him with all the Country of <hi>Quinzay,</hi> as far as the Sea, beyond <hi>Cambalu,</hi> which contains above four hundred Leagues, and more than three hundred Cities, with an infinite number of Towns and Villages. This was properly the Empire of his deceaſed Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle. He made <hi>Axalla</hi> Lieutenant General un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Prince his Son, and made him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Governour of his perſon, ſo great a Confidence he had in his Virtue, Fidelity, and Abilities. In this manner he rewarded him, for his notable Services, and for the great Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that he had got for him, by his Vertue, Experience, and Courage. He looked upon him therefore as moſt able to teach his Son, the Art of Keeping and Governing thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations, which <hi>Axalla</hi> had helped to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</p>

               <p>WHiles the Emperour was ordering his affairs at <hi>Cambalu,</hi> news was brought him, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> had beſieged <hi>Cairo</hi> three moneths with a powerful Army, and that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that great City, were ſo far from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring his deſigns, that they were very zealous and courageous in their defence for <hi>Tamerlans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. For that purpoſe, he had placed there a great many ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>Without this precaution, doubtleſs in this jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, there had been many Seditions and Plots for the betraying of the City, becauſe <hi>Calibes</hi> had not then forces enough to oblige the <hi>Sultan</hi> to raiſe his Siege without other aſſiſtance. But in regard this buſineſs was of the greateſt conſequence for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires preſervation, he ſent to the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Perſia</hi> to ſend him a party. This Prince was alwayes deſirous to purchaſe glory, and ready to obey his Emperours orders, who had commanded him to aſſiſt his neighbour in time of need. He ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up therefore his diſperſed Troops, old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> to the Number of about one hundred thouſand, who had accompanied the Emperour in all his Battles and Victories. They were deſirous of <hi>Axalla's</hi> preſence, but next to him

they thought none was better able to command them than the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> the Emperours Coſen German, who had been trained up under <hi>Axalla</hi>; for in all the greateſt difficulties and dangers, where <hi>Axalla</hi> had gained ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, this Prince had accompanied and learned from him the uneaſie and hazardous Trade of War. In which he had in the Judgements of all men, profited ſo much, that <hi>Axalla</hi> and he were looked upon, as the two Eyes of the Empire and <hi>Tamerlan</hi> the Head, they were the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>With this conſiderable body of an Army, unto which were added ſome Troops of the great <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,</hi> which were at <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> marched into <hi>Syria</hi> towards <hi>Aleppo,</hi> where he met with <hi>Calibes,</hi> and found that he had got together two hundred thouſand good Souldiers. The <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> was not ignorant, that this Army was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, which had formerly overthrown him, but he conceived ſome hopes, becauſe <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was not there in perſon, nor his good fortune, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies accompanied him; and becauſe he was to fight with a young Prince full of life and courage, whoſe too greedy deſire of honour might oblige him to undertake things too haſtily or unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He reſolved therefore to be wary, and by his late misfortune, to learn not to hazard a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in plain ground, but to wait for his enemies behind his Trenches. For that intent he drew his Trenches along the River of <hi>Nilus</hi>; for onely by that way the City expected to be relieved; for it was not probable that ſo many mouths could be
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40153:123"/>
ſupplied with neceſſaries, by Carts, or Camels, or by any other carriage by Land. Therefore he digg'd his Trenches with eaſe, becauſe the Prince with his Army marched but ſoftly. His moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Commanders adviſed him not to approach too near the Town, till the proviſions were ready to be carried in. For that purpoſe the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> and <hi>Calibes</hi> had ſent Purveyours round about <hi>Syria,</hi> and upon the Sea Coaſt, and about the Iſlands of <hi>Greece,</hi> to make proviſions of Corn, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>In the mean while, the army was coming on, which as ſoon as the enemy perceived upon the banks of <hi>Nilus,</hi> where the <hi>Sultan</hi> lay with his Souldiers on both ſides, with a bridge of Boats ſtretched over the River, he withdrew himſelf into his fortifications. When the Prince was in ſight of <hi>Cairo,</hi> he found that the enemy could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs about all the Walls, that were too large, but left a paſſage free to go in or out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He went therefore in, carrying with him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Carts and Beaſts loaden with proviſions, which he diſtributed by his Commiſſaries into all places that wanted.</p>
               <p>By this he underſtood, that they had all things ſufficient for fifteen dayes. A Council of War was then called, where it was reſolved that they ſhould endeavour to famiſh the <hi>Sultan,</hi> by cutting off his proviſions, which he drew from three or four Towns, which had yielded to him again, and ſollicited him to beſiege <hi>Cairo,</hi> aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that it was to be taken with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine

The chief Engenier went to view this Tower, and offered the Prince of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais</hi> to undermine it in four dayes, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly was performed. When the Tower was down they ſearched the Wall which was found but weak and unable to reſiſt the violence of the Engines, which ſoon caſt a great part to the ground. This encouraged the <hi>Tartars</hi> to aſſault the Town. They won and plundered it, and put all to the Sword, except Women and Children. The other Towns, terrified with this ſpeedy expedition, ſeeing no likelihood of ſuccours to be expected from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> were yeilded up at the firſt Summons and admitted to compoſition. The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> placed in theſe Towns, between two and three thouſand horſe and four thouſand foot. He judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed next, that he was to loſe no time, but with all ſpeed relieve <hi>Cairo,</hi> for fear it ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

for want, or to render his attempts vain. The Governour of the Towns lately taken, might have held out longer, as they were able and had promiſed the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who had furniſhed them with all that they had required.

He ſent for his Commiſſaries of Proviſions to know what he had in ſtore, from them he underſtood that he had enough for thirty days.

This perſwaſion cauſed them to abide ſtill in their Trenches without attempting any thing, for their chiefeſt care was to provide for their own ſecurity near the River. They had a great number of armed boats all over the River to ſtop the coming of any relief to the City. When the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> ſaw that the enemy was ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortified in his Trenches, that it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to force him without running the hazard of a misfortune, he employed his men in making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Trench, and other fortifications for his own Camp, like that of the Enemies. For it is againſt all policy and prudence, to ſtand with a naked Army near and againſt an enemies Army well intrench'd. The <hi>Tartarians</hi> were three times ſtronger than the <hi>Sultan,</hi> both in horſe and foot, but they were obliged for their ſafety to continue, thus incamped near them, becauſe they waited and expected the coming of <hi>Calibes,</hi> who was with the Fleet, with an intention to carry in Proviſions into <hi>Cairo.</hi> And the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> was to aſſiſt him by Land, whiles he ſhould endeavour to make his way by water to the City.</p>
               <p>Every day ſome parties went out to skirmiſh with the Enemies, to oblige them to keep cloſer together in their Camp, and to underſtand the beſt place for to aſſault it, when the time ſhould ſerve. At laſt the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> had news of the coming of <hi>Calibes,</hi> who deſired him to ſend
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40153:125"/>
him twelve thouſand of his Army, and imbark them privately, at a rendevouz unknown to the enemy, for <hi>Calibes</hi> truſted not too much upon the Troops, which he had picked up at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and becauſe he intended to fight in perſon upon the River, to open away for his Ships, or to periſh in the attempt, he was reſolved to have ſuch perſons to aſſiſt him, whom he knew to be brave and reſolute men. The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> could have wiſhed that <hi>Calibes</hi> had yeilded to him the honour of commanding the Fleet, but all his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains repreſented to him, that it belonged to him to chuſe, becauſe he was in his own Government, and that the chiefeſt and fierceſt action was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be at Land. That doubtleſs, the <hi>Sultan</hi> would ſend men aboard his Ships to help them, that in this caſe the Trenches would be leſs guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and more eaſie to be taken; for the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were but two thouſand paces from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And that in all likelihood the day would not paſs without an encounter at Land.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> deſired it with paſſion, as a young <hi>Hero</hi> paſſionate to win honour: But to qualifie this natural heat within him, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had placed near his perſon two great Lords, to keep in his courage and not ſuffer it to run headlong, but to adviſe him and lead on the Souldiers, who were accuſtomed to <hi>Tamerlans</hi> good fortune, and ready to attempt the greateſt difficulties, and overcome the moſt apparent dangers. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>anais</hi> ſent therefore thirteen or fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his ſtouteſt Souldiers to <hi>Calibes,</hi> under the command of <hi>Sinopes, Axalla</hi>'s nephew, Major General of the Infantry, or rather <hi>Axalla</hi>'s Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40153:125"/>
who had that office all over the Empire, and when the Emperour himſelf commanded in chief. <hi>Sinopes</hi> was a man of a great reputation, having much improved himſelf in <hi>Axalla</hi>'s tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> judged that the Fleet was at hand, near the Enemies Bridge for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and ſtrengthened with Chains and Ropes, he cauſed all his horſe to be ready, and drew up his Infantry, ſending forty thouſand men to a place, that he had taken notice of, leſs guarded than the reſt. For the Enemies ſeeing him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd between them and the City, they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that the greateſt aſſault would be there, therefore they provided that ſide accordingly. They had neglected to fortifie a little Hill, which was of a great advantage to the party that ſhould have the command of it. Therefore the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> ſent this day to aſſault and take it. He had employed his men upon the water only to deceive the <hi>Sultan,</hi> for after the taking of the Hill, he marched forward to the ſecond Trenches, as if it had been his deſign to aſſault and force them alſo, but it was onely to cauſe the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> to look that way, for he thought the whole Army had been there, he prepared therefore for to defend himſelf on that ſide.</p>
               <p>Whiles the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army by Land, was thus at handy-blows with the enemy, their Naval forces broke in upon the Boats, after a ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance overthrew them, before they could receive any help. For in the beginning of the diſpute the <hi>Tartars</hi> perceived that there was an Iſland in the River, where the <hi>Sultan</hi> had raiſed a battery to ſhoot againſt them, they aſſaulted and carried
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40153:126"/>
it, forcing their enemies to retreat into their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by this means they loſt the advantage of this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was fit to defend their bridge againſt the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Navy. Next to the Iſland they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the bridge, but at the firſt onſet, <hi>Calibes</hi> was ſunk and drowned, and his party in diſorder and diſcouraged, but <hi>Sinopes,</hi> who commanded under him, growing more deſperate by this loſs, renewed the fight with a greater reſolution, and utterly broke the bridge, ſetting the Fire to it with a Boat full of Wild-Fire. This courage of <hi>Sinopes</hi> forced Victory to declare for him, and opened a paſſage for the Navy to the City in view of the Enemies, who could no longer hinder or ſtop it, for the Fleet lying under the Iſland, and ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines that were placed upon the Land ſhot into the Camp, ſo that they could not lift up nor ſhew their heads.</p>
               <p>This loſs of <hi>Calibes</hi> was much lamented, for he was a man that had rendered great ſervices to the Emperour, who loved him well and truſted him. His body was ſought for amongſt many others that periſhed in the Waters, but none could diſtinguiſh it.</p>
               <p>It was thought that twenty thouſand men died on both ſides that day, for few eſcaped of <hi>Calibes</hi> left Wing. <hi>Sinopes</hi> gain'd much honor and reputation, by his good conduct and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courage. This action gave a beginning to his preferment: It deſerved to be well rewarded, for there was no poſſibility of relieving the City, but by that way, for being in great want and ſo large, many convoys had been required to furniſh it, with Proviſions till the ſucceeding harveſt, unto which there was then three months.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:40153:126"/>Afterwards <hi>Sinopes</hi> incamped in the Iſland with ſome of the Army, to hinder the enemies paſſage over the River. Nevertheleſs, for all his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, the next night being very dark, they paſſed over to the other bank undiſcovered, in order to their retreat, which every one imagin'd would not be by Land, for they had no Towns on that ſide, nor intelligence in <hi>Cairo</hi> nor <hi>Alexandria,</hi> every thing was changed againſt them. So that had they reſolved to go that way, they muſt firſt have overthrown the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army, which was too difficult a Task for them. They were therefore obliged to paſs over the River, and retreat that way, for only on that ſide they had yet a Town that held for them. In the mean while, the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> had alwaies a watchful eye upon the <hi>Sultan</hi> and his deſigns. But he was as much troubled what to do. In caſe the enemies after their paſſage over the River, had obſtinately hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about <hi>Cairo.</hi> He had been then conſtrained to remain there alſo, and ſo numerous an Army had famiſh'd that great City, which had Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but for eight days. It was reſolved in Council, that the Army ſhould decamp, as ſoon as poſſible, ſeeing that the City had been relieved. They thought that the enemies Army being leſs in number, and better provided with Proviſions, would ſtay upon the place a longer time. It was therefore concluded that the Army ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two bodies, and ſhould attend on the further bank, and the hither ſide, and that <hi>Sinopes</hi> ſhould ſtay in the Iſland, to favour all the Convoys and Ships of Proviſion, intended to ſail to <hi>Cairo,</hi> and hinder the enemies attempts upon them. This
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40153:127"/>
reſolution was taken and kept very ſecret. But when the enemies had ſpent all their Proviſions, they ſought to retreat as well as the <hi>Tartars,</hi> which they endeavoured to perform in the night. All the Boats and Ships, which they had near the banks they made ready to go aboard, but the Eve before they ſeem'd to reſolve to march into <hi>Syria,</hi> for that purpoſe, they ſent out of their Trenches ſome parties to aſſault the moſt advanced Guards, as if they had intended to open a paſſage that way, by force of Arms.</p>
               <p>Whiles this is doing, a great part of their Army were ready at the Rivers ſide to go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. In the beginning of the night Fires were diſcovered more than ordinary upon the bank, and moſt part of their Army was carried over. <hi>Sinopes</hi> could never hinder them, for the nights obſcurity helped them in their retreat. The <hi>Sultan</hi> paſſed over firſt, leaving behind him his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General to keep the Camp with all his Infantry.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the day appeared, it was known that a part of their Army was on the other ſide. The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> was willing to attack thoſe that were left behind in the Camp, but the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt experienced Captains were not of his opinion. They ſaid that it was no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to face threeſcore thouſand men in ſtrong Trenches. And that it would be more wiſdome to ſend a ſupply of men and Engines to <hi>Sinopes,</hi> to ſtrengthen him, that he might ſtop the paſſage of ſuch as would afterwards venture to go over. Nevertheleſs, it was reſolved, that when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder ſhould endeavour to follow after their
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40153:127"/>
Companions and their Prince, that then the <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Army ſhould break into their Camp, and charge them in their retreat.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultan,</hi> ſeeing that his paſſage had been ſucceſsful, ſent word to the remainder of his army to adventure over the night following, and that as many as could ſhould get aboard. And to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his men the more and haſten them, he paſſed over again himſelf to them, for he knew nothing of the ſupply of men, which <hi>Sinopes</hi> had received from the Land Army. As ſoon as <hi>Sinopes</hi> ſaw the enemies he charged them deſperately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay. The <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelf was wounded in performing the duty of a great Captain, he paſſed over the water with a great number of his men to joyn with the other party. In this diſpute, the <hi>Sultan</hi> loſt a great many men and ſome Boats were ſunk, only twenty thouſand were remaining behind in their Camp, without any hopes of retreat to their Prince. The <hi>Tartars</hi> aſſaulted and won their next Trenches, but the innermoſt were ſo well fortified and guarded that the Commanders thought it no wiſdome to venture upon them, but rather to ſtay where they were than to hazard all upon an uncertainty. They incamp'd therefore within the Trenches, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of that which they were to have by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the rules of War, ſooner than by force. Which happen'd accordingly, for as ſoon as the enemies ſaw themſelves pen'd up, and not able to look about, by reaſon of the <hi>Tartars</hi> approaches, they ſent to deſire to parl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y with them, which was granted. They ſent to the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> a <hi>Parthian</hi> Officer, who had a long time ſerved
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40153:128"/>
under him, but being left behind ſick and taken by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> he enter'd himſelf in his ſervice. After ſome demonſtrations of his ſtrength, this Prince had made him Major General of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry. He deſired to ſpeak with the Prince of <hi>Tanais.</hi> He told him that he had been ſent with his Comrades from the Troops, which he beſieged, to intreat him to ſhew them mercy, and not to ſpill any more humane blood, but without it to accept of the Victory, which they offered into his hands upon the conditions that he ſhould propoſe. As the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> was viſiting the Trenches he heard the offer of this Collonel with Joy.</p>
               <p>He gave them liberty upon this condition, that, for the time to come, they ſhould be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Slaves to the Emperour, and ſerve him in his Wars whereſoever they ſhould be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. All which they promiſed to perform. Some were commiſſioned by the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> to receive their Oath. Only the Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and ſome other Captains departed in a Ship the night before, to follow after their Maſter.</p>
               <p>This Prince, as we have taken notice, was wounded at the paſſage of the River, which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to retreat with his Cavalry twenty leagues, to a place that belong'd to him yet. As ſoon as he was arrived, he died of his wounds, to the great ſorrow of his followers. The Prince of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais,</hi> who, as ſoon as he could, purſued him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into this place, named <hi>Palema,</hi> a few dayes after his death, and finding that he was not buried, ſhed Tears for his unhappy end, commanding that he ſhould be interred according to his Quality, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40153:128"/>
received very courteouſly all his Servants. He had left behind him a Son, who had carried with him all that would not yield to the Emperour. They fled to the borders of <hi>Lybia,</hi> into certain Towns of a difficult acceſs, becauſe of the Wilderneſs that lies in the way to them. There theſe poor men liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hopes to be revenged of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and one day to reſtore their broken and ruined fortunes.</p>
               <p>In this manner ended this laſt War with the <hi>Mamelu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ks.</hi> The Emperour was ſo troubled at it, that he once reſolved to march thither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himſelf, but the news of the Victory, and of the <hi>Sultans</hi> death hindered him. The Prince of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais</hi> was mightily applauded for his prudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, but <hi>Calibes</hi>'s unhappy death daſht all the Emperours joy. He was ſo worthy a man, that he could not be ſufficiently lamented, chiefly by <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> who loſt in him a faithful ſervant and and a Great Captain.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> had his Offices and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment beſtowed upon him, with order to make his ordinary abode in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to watch and look over them, and keep thoſe Provinces in peace. <hi>Sinopes</hi> was made Major General of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial army, which was commanded to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Perſia,</hi> under the leading of the great <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,</hi> who came to the Army at the cloſe of the War, with a conſiderable body of men. For it was <hi>Tamerlans</hi> cuſtome to cauſe one Army to march after another, towards the places that wanted aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. This happy ſucceſs of his Lieutenants ſhewed how much it concerns a Prince to dwell in the midſt of his Dominions, that he might with more eaſe, and more ſpeedily ſend forth
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40153:129"/>
his ſuccours to defend any part or Corner.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>China</hi> was then at the Emperours Court, to wait upon him, according to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of agreement concluded with him, which he confirmed in the Princes preſence, and ſwore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and did him homage. The Emperour endeavoured to render himſelf dreadful to this Heathen King, who never kept his promiſes, but when he pleaſed by ſhewing him his ſtrong Towns well furniſhed with people. He was aſtoniſhed to ſee ſo many men cloathed ſo ſimply, chiefly the Emperour, that wore nothing but a garment of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Cloath, without any Ornament. He took notice alſo, that all his attendants and Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him look'd as ſo many Kings by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick contenances and behaviour. Whiles he was at the Court, news came of the Victory obtained upon the <hi>Sultan,</hi> he was eye witneſs of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick rejoycings, which laſted eight dayes, ſpent in ſports, feaſting, and other divertiſements, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he returned to his own Country. The Emperour gave order next to diſtribute double pay to his Army, which was returning out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> into <hi>Perſia,</hi> with the Great <hi>Chamberlain</hi> and <hi>Sinopes</hi> Major General. Afterwards he went to <hi>Quinzay,</hi> to ſee his Son, and ſatisfie the impatient wiſhes of this great City, that deſired paſſionately to enjoy him. His preſence was alſo needful to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all affairs, as he had done in other places. <hi>Axalla</hi> had no mind to be too buſie, becauſe he had to do with a numerous people, inclinable to commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He was therefore afraid ſo far to concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as to give <hi>Tamerlan</hi> a diſguſt, or cauſe the people to murmur. Therefore he often ſpoke it,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40153:129"/>
that the ordering of the publick affairs was a great buſineſs, which none was capable of, but the Emperour. For the intent of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was to appoint the ſame Laws every where in his great Empire, to command the uſe of the ſame Weights and Meaſures, that the ſame Tributes ſhould be ſetled in all parts, according to each mans ability, reſolving as ſoon as his Incomes were regulated, that he would make proviſion of Victuals, which ſhould be carried from place to place, according as his Army ſhould need. He was wont to compare an Army with the humane body, ſaying that the Captains were to be look'd upon as the head, the Souldiers as the feet and hands. Mony was the ſtrength and the ſpirits, which keeps this body in motion, and food as the belly from whence it was entertain'd.</p>
               <p>Therefore he ſaid, that when an Army can repreſent a perfect man, in all reſpects, it is invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, becauſe it fights when it pleaſeth, and may chuſe whether it will hazard any thing, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good terms. When an Army miſcarries, this proceeds from ſome imperfection in the body, which may be lame or wounded, or from the ſtarved belly or the diſeaſed head. Therefore when he ſent the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> againſt the <hi>Sultan,</hi> he was afraid of the head, and of the belly of his Army. For the Prince was but young, and his men unfurniſhed with neceſſary proviſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he was wont a year before hand, when he intended to make War, to gather up ſtores of food and fill up his Magazins, now this year they had neglected this piece of policy, his victory therefore he aſcribed to his good fortune, which was loath
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40153:130"/>
to forſake him, rather than to the Wiſdome of his young General.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour was near <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>inzay, Axalla</hi> went out to meet him at two dayes journey from the City, with the greateſt Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and the chief Citizens, whiles the reſt were making ready to welcome him in the moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent manner, that they were able. This City is one of the richeſt in the world, and one of the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, very well ſcituated upon ſmall Iſlands or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, cut from one end to the other, with ſtately buildings, and a great many bridges for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the Inhabitants. It is a place of ſo great Trade, that there comes to it continually all ſorts of Goods, Stuffs, Precious Stones, and chiefly ſpices. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> at his firſt arrival was preſented with the richeſt things of the City: They were valued above two Millions of Gold, to not reckon many other rare things, which were given him, as tokens of their ſubjection to him, and affection for him.</p>
               <p>He ſeem'd to be very deſirous to ſee his Son, who was then but about ſeven years old. He was brought up with much ſtate, and with the care anſwerable to his Quality. When he was firſt brought to him, he took notice that his head was carefully covered, but he commanded that they ſhould keep it uncovered, becauſe as he ſaid, He that is called by his birth to govern Nations ought to uſe himſelf to heat and cold, and to painful exerciſe, and not to indulge himſelf in an effeminate life. Some told him that the Child was but tender, what reply'd the Emperour will you make him a Woman? If he be not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40153:130"/>
the troubles and inconveniencies of War, he is not worthy to ſucceed me, for there muſt be no dainty and ſoft Prince to keep up the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> He had ſent the Empreſs to <hi>Samarcand,</hi> to be there brought to bed, ſhe was received with all the honours due to her Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the affection that the people could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. This was the firſt time of her viſiting of this City.</p>
               <p>A little after, the Emperour had news brought him, that ſhe was ſafely delivered of her ſecond Son, which he publiſh'd abroad and ſeem'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at it, appointing Tilts and magnificent Sports to expreſs his gladneſs for ſeveral dayes. In this time, nothing but feaſtings and publick diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements were ſeen in all parts. The Emperour himſelf took a great delight in ſuch paſtimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it gave him an opportunity to ſhew the agility of his body, and his dexterity to his Court and people, for he was judged the more worthy to command them, the more he excelled in ſuch like exerciſes.</p>
               <p>After a months abode in <hi>Quinzay,</hi> and after he had viſited the maritine Towns near adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he went to <hi>Samarcande</hi> travelling ſoftly, for in the Road he employed himſelf in hunting all ſorts of beaſts, and yet in the mean while took a great care to provide for the ſafety of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, for it was his uſual ſaying, that Pleaſures and Sports were to him, as Wings to lift him up and eaſe him from the Labours, which God had put upon him for the preſervation of his Subjects in peace.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Quinzay</hi> had ſo ſincere a
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40153:131"/>
Love for him, that when he called them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to oblige them to receive and ſubmit to his new Laws, they made no difficulty to yeild to him, but embrac'd them with as much reſpect and devotion, as if they had been commanded by God himſelf, for their reverence and affection for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon made them ſubmit. Whiles he continued in the City, the moſt part of the people were employed in looking upon him, as the chief object of their affections. Some of his Courtiers took notice of it, particularly <hi>Axalla.</hi> Therefore they told him, that this City was worthy of his conſtant abode. Not at all, reply'd the Emperour, if they did alwayes ſee me, they would quickly deſpiſe me, for it is a Maxime of State, that the Soveraign of this great City, muſt not come to it oftner than once in ten years, and then he muſt act as if he were upon a Theatre in view of all the World, he muſt act a ſerious and grave perſon, becauſe the Inhabitants are naturally apt to be diſguſted with their Prince. He ought therefore, if he will be eſteem'd, to ſeek to give them the beſt impreſſion that he can.</p>
               <p>Before his leaving of <hi>Quinzay,</hi> he ſent with all ſpeed Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> towards <hi>China,</hi> with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to examine, and end ſome differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Odmar</hi> and the King of that Countrey, that he might be able by his Wiſdome to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, and give him a juſt account at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: As he had a great affection for his faithful ſervants, he long'd to ſee <hi>Odmar</hi> with him who had been abſent many years. He deſired him to take the time of <hi>Axalla</hi>'s abode in thoſe parts. The Emperour was reſolved not to leave <hi>Camba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu,</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:40153:131"/>
till after <hi>Axalla</hi>'s return from <hi>China.</hi> This was a very pleaſing, and an honourable Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be ſent into thoſe parts, where his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was ſo well known and freſh in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of all the Inhabitants, by his late noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, but he was overjoyed to go thither that he might do ſervice to <hi>Odmar,</hi> his intimate friend: <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had an excellent maxime, but contrary to that of moſt Princes, he laboured to keep all his Servants at Unity, and recommended to them love to one another, and faithfulneſs in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The chief cauſe, that obliged the Emperour to ſend <hi>Axalla</hi> into <hi>China,</hi> was to put a period to a diſpute between that King and <hi>Odmar</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the reſtitution of a place, which had been promiſed to the King. There ſeem'd to be ſome perſonal differences between them. So that <hi>Axalla</hi> was judged as the moſt pleaſing perſon to this King to terminate this affair, becauſe of his mildneſs and courteous behaviour.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Axalla</hi> was upon the borders, he met with Prince <hi>Odmar</hi> waiting for him, who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with great Pomp and State, and feaſted him three dayes.</p>
               <p>After this he gave him an account of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs, and departed to the Court to ſee <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan.</hi> But <hi>Axalla</hi> went to <hi>Pekin,</hi> where he was welcomed by the Governour in that manner, that becomed the ſecond perſon of the Empire. <hi>Axalla</hi> gathered his Souldiers together and with the Army, he marched to <hi>Parchio</hi> upon the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of both Empires, as had been agreed upon before with the King of <hi>China,</hi> but in his way paſſed by <hi>Quanton,</hi> that ſtrong and populous Town,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40153:132"/>
which he had taken in three moneths contrary to the expectation of the whole Army, and of the Emperour himſelf, who judged that it would have held out at leaſt ſix moneths. The Report of his coming cauſed a great multitude of people to meet and welcome him, for every one could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him inſtead of <hi>Odmar,</hi> becauſe his way of dealing was ſo amicable, and his v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rtues ſo much eſteem'd of all the World. The Emperour, one of the wiſeſt Princes of his time, ſaw plainly that <hi>Odmar</hi> was not ſo fit to govern thoſe Provinces, that he was too grave and reſerved, and not flexible, but that <hi>Axalla</hi> was of a contrary diſpoſition, that he had the gift to pleaſe all ſorts of humours, and therefore that he would be more grateful to theſe people. But <hi>Axalla</hi> could not be ſpared from other places, where his preſence were more needful, for he looked upon him as the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Empire, upon whom he could truſt the whole concern of his Kingdomes in caſe any accident or a diſeaſe ſhould diſenable, and take him from the publick management of affairs. From <hi>Quanton Axalla</hi> march'd directly to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed rendevouz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whither the King of <hi>China</hi> was going. When he had advanced about fifty leagues into the Country lately conquer'd by <hi>Odmar,</hi> he thought he ſhould wrong the Majeſty of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, whoſe perſon he did then repreſent, by proceeding any farther to meet this Heatheniſh Prince, and that it did more become him, to oblige him to come to him there, than to advance into the Country, which had been reſtored to this King by the laſt Treaty, and for which he paid <hi>Tamerlan</hi> a conſiderable Tribute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:40153:132"/>When the King was arrived with all his Court to a little Town, at a league diſtant from <hi>Porchio,</hi> he went out into a large Field where <hi>Axalla</hi> met him, with more attendants than he had. He gave place to <hi>Axalla,</hi> and reſpected him as much as if he had been the Emperour. Three times they met to confer together, for the King of <hi>China</hi> inſiſted alwayes upon the rendition of a Town, which the Emperour had granted him, but <hi>Odmar</hi> refuſed to yield it, becauſe it was a ſtrong place of importance. At laſt he ſeem'd to be content with another, farther in his Country, than the former, which ſtood in the midſt of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> dominions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> the judge of this controverſie put him in poſſeſſion of the latter, becauſe he perceived that the King had no ſiniſter deſign, and that all his aim was, but to have a place, where he might divert himſelf and take his pleaſure. But <hi>Odmar,</hi> an old Jealous pate, having been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deceived by this unconſtant Prince, had a contrary opinion of him, for he thought that he deſired that place, but to plot and contrive new deſignes to diſturb the State. He had ſufficiently puniſhed him for the laſt commotion, when the Emperour was in <hi>Perſia,</hi> for by one battle he won from him five and twen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This Town he ſeem'd to like better than the other, for it is ſcituate upon a River, at the entry of a beautiful Lake, which ſurrounds it, and is full of many little Iſlands, where many ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſes were built for the pleaſure of the former Kings of <hi>China,</hi> who after preferr'd this abode to their

glorious Palaces in their great Cities.</p>
               <p>The laſt meeting was under a rich Canopy, which <hi>Axalla</hi> caus'd to be erected: The King of <hi>China</hi> came to him with the chief Officers of his Court. After ſome diſputes, this agreement was concluded; that the King ſhould have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to dwell in <hi>Quinancy,</hi> as often and as long as he pleaſed, but ſhould not put in it any Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or fortifie it, that he ſhould live in it as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon, or a Subject to the Emperour. That he might have three hundred men to guard him, but that he ſhould have no other mark of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, but with the conſent of the Governour for the Emperour. That he ſhould be oblig'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time, that he intended to go to <hi>Quinancy</hi> to give notice of it to the Governour, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſet foot upon any of his Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Lands. That he ſhould nevertheleſs, enjoy all the Lordſhip of the City, without any moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Emperours Officers. This Heathen King accepted theſe offers in ſuch a manner as diſcovered plainly, that all his engagements, promiſes, and oaths, would not hinder him from a rebellion, nor from an endeavour to ſieze upon that pleaſant abode, if an opportunity were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, that he might ſhut himſelf up in that City, the reſt of his dayes, for he had an intent to give over the Kingdome to one of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe he was weary to ſuffer the <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> bondage. In this particular, he ſhewed the ſigns of a noble courage, which deſerves a better name than that of a barbarian or a heathen, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually given to all his people, who are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, lovers of Learning and Civility. As ſoon as
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40153:134"/>
Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> had diſpatched theſe weighty affairs, he ſent news to the Emperour, to underſtand how well he would like his actions, and know when he ſhould return. In expectation of an anſwer he viſited all the places newly Conquered in <hi>China.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlans</hi> cuſtome was to remove often the Governours of Cities and Provinces, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſuch as had well behaved themſelves to better employments, or more honourable and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Governments: <hi>Odmar,</hi> being very old and ſickly, and therefore not fit to be upon the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of an Empire, where the Governour ought to be alwayes in action, he reſolved to keep with him, to aſſiſt him with his good counſels, and the rather, becauſe <hi>Odmar</hi> was not well beloved by the People or the Souldiers. He purpos'd therefore to ſend in his ſtead the Great <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> a young and brave noble man, of a ſtrong and healthy body, more likely to pleaſe his Souldiers, and new Subjects than the other, and better able to undergo all the labours and troubles, which ſuch an employment at ſuch a diſtance would require from him, for theſe reaſons, he would not ſuffer <hi>Odmar</hi> to return thither, but for <hi>Axalla,</hi> he had orders to come back ſpeedily. He was once think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſend thither the Prince of <hi>Vauchefu</hi> in <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi> place, that he might by that means reward him, for all the notable ſervices that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him in ſo many occaſions in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but when he conſidered, that the <hi>Parthians</hi> are not obedient to ſtrangers, and that ſuch a proceeding would give him an abſolute command in his own Country, and expoſe his faithfulneſs
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40153:135"/>
to a ſtrong Temptation, he kept him near his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for ſome other employment.</p>
               <p>He had not forgotten alſo the brother of this Lord, who had been uſeful to him in his Armies, <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had no need of recommendations or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ions, to oblige him to recompence his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants. He alwaies kept in mind every one that had well behaved himſelf in ſome brave action. Many times, when they never thought upon any ſuch matter, he would ſend for them, to place them amongſt his Counſellours, or give them a Government or an Office. No body was ſo bold as to ask theſe things from him, for he knew for certain, that thoſe that bribe theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and advantages, will never behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in them for the Princes good or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Subjects, but onely to gratifie their own Ambition and Covetouſneſs, for this cauſe he was wont to change his Governours often, that their Governments might not become here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary to their Poſterity. Thoſe, whom he thus removed, were not thereby diſpleas'd, nor did they think, that it was a token of the Emperours anger, for it was a rare thing, if when he had thus removed a Governour, he did not beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him another, or ſome employment in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. But when he pitch'd upon a man to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon him, or command in his Armies, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one look'd upon this choice, to be the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honour and promotion, for all over the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that man was obeyed as the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I have, ſaith <hi>Albacent,</hi> ſeen in the beginning of his Reign two Men, choſen in this manner, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards four, at laſt he increaſed them to ſeven,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40153:135"/>
who were as the ſeven Pillars of this large Empire. For the Prince truſted all his greateſt and moſt weighty affairs in their hands. They were obliged to give an account of their actions only to him and at ſuch times only, when they were called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to adviſe about the great affairs of Peace and War. Theſe were the things that could be asked from him, which he would grant without ſcruple, Gold, Silver, Moveables, Houſes, Lands, and other ſuch things, which were not of ſuch concernment, as to belong to the publick manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Empire.</p>
               <p>To end this digreſſion, and return to <hi>Cambalu,</hi> where the Emperour was with <hi>Odmar</hi> and <hi>Axalla,</hi> we muſt know, that the former being grown hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, by the number of his years, and unfit for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whiſper'd to him nothing but Peace, and wiſh'd him to ſettle the affairs of his Empire. But the latter was deſirous of War and Battles, an enemy of reſt. He diſcours'd to him of nothing but of new expeditions and conqueſts. This fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious paſſion made him wiſh heartily, that the Prince would honour him, with an employment ſutable to his temper and inclinations, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon <hi>Odmar</hi> a Government in a peaceable Countrey far from the borders. In regard <hi>Odmar</hi> was related to the Emperour, <hi>Axalla</hi> judged him the fitteſt perſon, becauſe of his Age, Wiſdome, and Experience in all affairs, to be Governour of the young Prince brought up at <hi>Quinzay,</hi> for he would be able to keep the people with eaſe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. But this change could not come but from the Emperours own inclination. No per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was ſo bold, as to preſume to motion it to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:40153:136"/>
him. But providence favour'd <hi>Axalla</hi>'s wiſhes by giving him this opportunity to diſcover his mind.</p>
               <p>The Idleneſs and Wantonneſs, which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace all over the Empire had begot, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome troubles and mutinies in the Army, which was as the ſoul of the Empire, and the terrour of the whole World, for the Cheiftains had been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and negligent to keep the Souldiers in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The irregularity was ſo great, that the ancient diſcipline was ſlighted, and the Souldiers grown inſolent in regard of their late ſervices and victories, refuſed to perform their duties, or mutinied whenſoever they had a deſire. They cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a threatning manner, for the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to command them in perſon.</p>
               <p>When he heard firſt of theſe diſorders, he was not a little troubled. Muſt he to gratifie a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Mutiniers, forſake that reſt and quiet, which he deſires to enjoy for the few years that he hath to live in the World? Muſt he now expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and undergo new labours and pains, which he hath endured ſo long, and by which he hath with the hazard of his Life ſetled the whole World in Peace? In this unquietneſs of his mind, he ſent for <hi>Odmar</hi> and <hi>Axalla</hi> to adviſe with them. <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> without delay endeavoured to perſwade the Emperour to go to his Army, and leave the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of affairs at home to <hi>Odmars</hi> Wiſdome and Conduct. Now <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had begun to reliſh in the Cities a ſweetneſs and pleaſure differing from that life, which men lead in the midſt of Souldiers, and the diſturbances and dangers of War, though the latter had been formerly more pleaſing
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40153:136"/>
to him. This made him loath to ingage himſelf afreſh in ſuch perils and ſuch an unquiet life. He was more deſirous to enjoy in peace the fruits of his Valour and Courage. And the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was then about fifty years of Age: an Age that called upon him to ſee to preſerve and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure what he had purchaſed by his Victories. At laſt he turned himſelf towards <hi>Axalla</hi> with theſe words, <hi>I ſhould be eſteem'd ungrateful to</hi> Odmar <hi>for all his good and faithful Services, if in his Old age, I did not contrive a way to ſettle him in peace the reſt of his dayes. The advice, that you have given me in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, I accept, and ſhall follow it. I conſent therefore, that</hi> Odmar <hi>take the Government of my Son, and of all the Country of</hi> Quinzay <hi>and</hi> Cambalu, <hi>and that he end there his dayes peaceably in my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But I intend to reſide in</hi> Sachetay, <hi>that I might be nearer</hi> Perſia, <hi>where I will have my Army incamp, unto which I ſhall add thirty thouſand horſe more, that it may be able to keep the Country from Rebelling. But for you, I will have you go and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it in perſon, I look upon you as the only man of my Empire beſt able to perform the duties of this Office with credit, not only becauſe the Souldiers have an affection for you, but becauſe I have alwayes ſeen you careful to obſerve the diſcipline of War. I truſt my whole Empire in your hands by truſting you with mine Army, which only is able to keep quiet ſo many large Provinces, and ſo many Nations differing in manners, language, and cuſtomes, which you have help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſubdue. I will take care, that nothing ſhall be wanting to this Army, and that the cleareſt and moſt certain part of my Revenues ſhall be appointed to pay them, and to reward thoſe whom you ſhall judge wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40153:137"/>
I would have you take a great care to oblige the Troops, to obſerve the</hi> Parthian <hi>diſcipline without alteration. Let them lodge alwayes in the Camp in the open Field. You ſhall change this Camp every three moneths. Let them buy all neceſſaries themſelves and pay for them, without wronging any body, and let thoſe that ſhall break theſe orders be puniſh'd ſeverely, I would have alſo my Army be incamp'd in</hi> Perſia, <hi>becauſe the people are there more inclinable to rebellion than elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and not ſo willing to obey, and becauſe</hi> Syria <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>After this diſcourſe to <hi>Axalla,</hi> the Emperour told <hi>Odmar,</hi> that by putting as he did, his Son into his hands, he did put his deareſt treaſure, and the chief of all his Riches, and gave him the command of the two thirds of his Empire. That he could not ſhew him a greater aſſurance of being well ſatisfied with his former ſervices, than by delivering unto him this precious Pawn. That he ſhould command in Chief in his richeſt Provinces, where the people ſhould honour and reſpect him as himſelf. That all things were quiet and in peace, and fit for his weakneſs and years. He ſent alſo for his Chancellour, who was not preſent, when theſe things were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. He commanded him to cauſe two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to be drawn, one for <hi>Odmar</hi> to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of his Eldeſt Son, and his Vice-Roy in all the Country of <hi>Quinzay,</hi> and <hi>Cambalu,</hi> as far as the Sea, and the Mountains bordering upon <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>; and another for <hi>Axalla</hi> to be Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of his Army, with an expreſs command to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40153:137"/>
every Province, where it was to march, to obey him as himſelf.</p>
               <p>The news of this Commiſſion, given to Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> being noiſed abroad every where as far as the Camp, made the Souldiers and Captains re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in an extraordinary manner. Every one was glad of it, not only becauſe of the worth and deſervings of the General, but alſo becauſe of the good turns and expreſſions of his affection, which he had given to every one. Chiefly <hi>Sinopes,</hi> was overjoyed to hear this pleaſing news, becauſe he was related to <hi>Axalla,</hi> and had been promoted by him to the chiefeſt Commands of the Army. <hi>Odmar</hi> was left at <hi>Cambalu,</hi> to prepare for his Journey to <hi>Quinzay,</hi> and was mightily glad of his employment. The Emperour gave him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, how he ſhould behave himſelf in his Government, for the publick good. He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that as ſoon as the Young Prince his Son ſhould attain to ten years of Age, that he ſhould bring him up in buſineſs, and that he ſhould acquaint him with all affairs, that he might learn betimes to do ſervice to his Country; but before that Age, he would not ſuffer him to know any thing of buſineſs, but that he ſhould live as Children of his Age. He was called <hi>Cam Sentrochio</hi> or <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jochien,</hi> which word in the <hi>Parthian</hi> tongue ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>the Love of Men.</hi> This Name had been given him by the Old Emperour his Grand-Father in his Fathers abſence. And this Name was not improper, for he was mighty well beloved, chiefly in the Province of his Nativity, from whence his Father could never take him, to carry him to <hi>Samarcande,</hi> where the Empreſs his Mother lived,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40153:138"/>
for the Inhabitants of <hi>Quinzay</hi> imagin'd that if they loſt the ſight of him they ſhould loſe all. Therefore the Emperour, was willing to gratifie ſo extraordinary an affection, and their earneſt intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to leave him at <hi>Quinzay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had ſetled all his affairs, he took the way to <hi>Samercande,</hi> where he intended to make his conſtant abode, and to enrich and embelliſh this place of his Nativity, that it might be worthy of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, and that there they might conſtantly dwell. The Prince was grown ſolitary, for his inclination to devotion had inclined him to a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly temper. He was ſo much delighted with contemplation, and was weaned ſo much from the diſturbances of Courts and Armies, that ſome think that he would have forſaken the ſociety of men, had not a Principle of honour, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his Family retained him: He was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo far from thinking upon any new expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that all his thoughts were employed how to keep what he had Conquer'd, for he was afraid of the unconſtancy of Fortune, that had alwayes ſmiled upon him. He knew that her frowns are not to be avoided, if men are not contented with the favours that ſhe hath beſtowed upon them, but ſtill preſs her for more, and weary her by their importunities. But we muſt not aſcribe to Fortune alone, all the happineſs and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſucceſſes of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> but to God, to the Great God of Hoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s, for whom he had a great reſpect and reverence. Therefore God favoured all his deſigns, gave victory to his Armies, and defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his enemies.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, <hi>Axalla</hi> was glad of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40153:138"/>
was buſie in reducing the Imperial Army to that poſture that the Emperour deſired. For this purpoſe, he gathered together all the Old Souldiers, who had been disbanded, and who had been too long at reſt in his judgement, with them he formed a new <hi>Militia.</hi> He ſent towards <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi> to take from the Frontiers, ſome Troops of horſe for his own Guard, for he knew their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and courage! He march'd ſome dayes in the way with the Emperour, diſcourſing with him about the concerns of his Army. And to that which he propoſed to the Prince, he either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd or added what he judged convenient, for without flattery one may very ſafely ſay, that no man, was more skilful in affairs of War than <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan. Axalla</hi> was eſteem'd next to him, beſt able to contrive or execute in the ſame manner, and as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually as the Prince was wont to do great deſigns.</p>
               <p>The Emperour in his march was very ſlow, that all his attendants, who were many in number might follow him, and becauſe of a great deal of baggage and carriages. <hi>Axalla</hi> only was weary of this ſlow pace, he long'd to be at <hi>Samarcande,</hi> where he was to enter into his office. So that when the Prince, who loved hunting, becauſe it is an image, of War, and an exerciſe that prepares the body for greater labours, was deſirous to ſtay in any place fit for this ſport, <hi>Axalla</hi> endeavoured to draw him from it as much as he could towards <hi>Samarcand. Tamerlan</hi> arrived thither about the end of the Summer.</p>
               <p>The Empreſs had been brought to bed, and was up again. The whole City for the birth of this young Prince, and for the ſafe arrival of the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40153:139"/>
Emperour was full of ſports, playes, and other divertiſements, which were again renewed at the Childs Circumciſion. But <hi>Axalla</hi> endeavoured to loſe no time, he ſollicited the Emperour and his Miniſters to furniſh him with his Inſtructions, for in the greateſt times of pleaſures the Emperour had his hours, which he ſpent in the publick affairs, from which nothing could take him off. When all things were ready, <hi>Axalla</hi> took his leave of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty, to go to the Camp. He had with him twenty thouſand horſe, moſt young men of the Court, for the Emperour deſired theſe young blades to be brought up rather in the exerciſe of Arms, than in the pleaſures of a Town. It was his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome not to promote any to an employment, till after he had been actually in Arms. Thoſe perſons only excepted, who attended upon him.</p>
               <p>About his time the Emperour received news, from the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> Governour of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that all things were quiet in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which gave him a great content. He took then a delight to embelliſh his City of <hi>Samar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cande,</hi> and chiefly in building a moſt glorious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which he named the <hi>Temple of Solomon</hi>; and appointed it to be his own and his Succeſſours Tomb.</p>
               <p>He cauſed the chief ſpoils, which he had taken from his enemies to be hung up in it, and cauſed the ſeveral battles that he had won, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he had conquered to be ingraven for Poſterity to view. (And as he ſaid) for to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to his great God, the favours that he had received from him. He had with him a great many Chriſtians, skilful in ſeveral Arts and Sciences,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40153:139"/>
whom he had brought from all places, where he had been with his Armies, or who had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him for their skill. For them he built a Temple and called it by the Name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> the Son of God. <hi>Axalla,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the ſame Religion, were the beſt and chiefeſt Souldiers of his Army, for the Prince had confidence in them. He truſted them as much as his natural Subjects, and more than the moſt of the zealous followers of Mahomet. He had given orders, all over his Empire, that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould have free liberty to exerciſe their Religion, and that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Son of God, ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and reverenced by all the World. The Chriſtian devotions were performed every day in the Army, without moleſtation or hindrance. And the Emperour had in his dominions many Countries where the Inhabitants were all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. He gave orders that they ſhould have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to profeſs their own Religion, and be in as much eſteem and favour as thoſe of the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> profeſſion, becauſe, as he ſaid, they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped but one only God, and that they denied all pluralities as well as himſelf. He hated all Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters in ſuch a manner, that wherever he went he pulled down their Idols, he enſlaved their perſons, and commanded them to be eſteem'd ſo. He could not have a greater joy than when any of his own or the Chriſtian Religion diſcourſed to him of holy princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and precepts. When their lives were without vain-glory he eſteem'd them the more. When they were not like certain hypocrites, who had nothing but an outward ſanctity, by which they endeavour'd to ſurpriſe the minds of the people and to get an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40153:140"/>
amongſt men. He wondred moſt at the relation that was given him of men, who of their own accord have forſaken the World, for Jeſus Chriſts ſake, to live only upon dry meats and without taſte, in loan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Deſarts, denying to themſelves all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of life, to embrace that which they judg'd to be moſt pleaſing to God. When he heard of the ſtrange perſecutions, which Chriſtians ſuffered under the Heathen Emperours, he was grieved, and this grief ſtirred up in him an inward affection for thoſe that were of that Religion.</p>
               <p>So that this great Prince had in him two good qualities, which cauſed him to be well beloved by all the World, <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> Three times e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very week, he executed Juſtice to his Subjects in the City of <hi>Samarcande,</hi> ſeating himſelf in his Throne with a Majeſty well becoming the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the greateſt part of the World: But all this glory, in which he appeared, hinder'd him not from valuing the caſe of the poor and deſpicable, more than that of the rich. Other days were deſigned to ſit in Council with his chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to conſider of his weighty affairs of State. In that place no perſon could be ſo bold as to diſguiſe the Truth, or to act or ſpeak paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without hazarding his Princes diſpleaſure. In this occaſion, he ſhewed not that indulgence, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in all other occaſions and actions of his life.</p>
               <p>In this manner, he cauſed himſelf to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and beloved of all his Subjects, and chiefly of his Domeſticks, whom he never put out of their employments, but when he was thereunto forced by ſome ill behaviour or relapſes in wickedneſs, which could not well be pardoned. He never
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40153:140"/>
diſmiſs'd thoſe who had ſerved the Emperour his Unkle, but retain'd them all in his ſervice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their wages, to remove or quallifie in ſome reſpects, the diſpleaſure they had conceived for ſo great a loſs. He beſtowed great gifts upon ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to win their affections, and uſe them in times of need. This wiſe and judicious dealing was not unknown to many great men of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> Court and Council, who were the better every year for the Tribute, which their Maſter ſent in monies to the Emperour. For he ſcarce kept any part of it for himſelf, but gave it to them, that he might oblige them the more to be his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſend him intelligence of any thing that related to his intereſt. He was ſo punctual and exact in his Revenues, that thoſe, who had the management of them, were obliged to give him an account every three months. In an hour he viewed over the Receipts and Expences of his large Empire. He had a great reſpect for his <hi>Super-Intendant</hi> or <hi>Lord Treaſurer,</hi> for he was a man of noted integrity, free from bribes or corruption. He received his orders from the Princes one mouth at every moment. He had orders to pay off the Penſions of the Princes, and chief Officers of the Crown without leaving this buſineſs to under A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents: Such perſons were to ſatisfie meaner Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and pay off the other expences of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But of all theſe payments the chief Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer was to be anſwerable in his own perſon, and of all the miſdemeanours of his underlings.</p>
               <p>Therefore this Employment, was very dangerous in this Empire. Two were put to death by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner, becauſe they had not prefer'd the Princes
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40153:141"/>
intereſt to their own private benefit. Now the Revenues of the Emperour were not certain, for he increaſed or diminiſh'd them according as need required.</p>
               <p>After the death of the laſt Emperour, he cauſed all the currant Coyn to be Stamp'd with his own Image, prohibiting all other of any former impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. When he was at <hi>Samarcande,</hi> he reformed many things in his Incomes. The report went about that he was reſolved to make a great ſtock of monies, but no man knew the cauſe. He was naturally very liberal, which gain'd him the hearts of all the World. When he had paſſed over a day without beſtowing ſome Gift, he commonly ſaid that he had ſpent it in vain. By giving, he ſaid, Men became like God, whoſe Gifts never any body refuſed.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Axalla.</hi> As ſoon as he was in the Army, he cauſed all the Old Orders to be renewed and publiſh'd, which the Emperour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, when he was with them. They had been neglected every where through the Chieftains fault, who, to deſtroy the ancient diſcipline, had brought in forreign cuſtomes not fit to be obſerved by the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Tartarians.</hi> When therefore he had called together all the Chief Commanders and other Officers, he repreſented to them the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders intreating them to endeavour with him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, to bring all things to their firſt State, and re-eſtabliſh the ancient diſcipline, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to be confined within their Camp, and there to cauſe their Souldiers to ſubſiſt, who were grown heavy and idle by their abode in Cities and Garriſons, whereas in the Camp the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40153:141"/>
is uſed to work, every one in his turn to ſtrengthen their fortifications. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, there were alwaies in the Imperial Armies thirty thouſand men appointed. To avoid all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in the receiving of orders, amongſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, he gave an under Officer to every ten Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which Officer was to be governed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was over one hundred men: And he was to be commanded by a Collonel, who had a thouſand, and he by another Superior Officer, who had ten thouſand under him: but all were to be govern'd by the Major General. Amongſt the Cavalry there was this Order, one hundred horſe men were commanded by a Captain, who was under a Collonel that was to be over a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and he to be under a Superior Officer, that commanded ten thouſand. So that orders were to be diſtributed all over the Camp, by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officers from the General. That he might better eſtabliſh this order, he muſter'd all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſetled it in that manner. It contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed threeſcore thouſand foot, commanded by ſix chief Collonels under the General, and forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe with four chief Officers. Amongſt them were a thouſand light horſe named <hi>Stradiots.</hi> Beſides theſe, the General had his particular Guards to wait upon his perſon, they were in number two thouſand horſe and four thouſand foot. This was the condition of the Army ſtyled Imperial, the others had not that name. That which was in <hi>Syria</hi> was compoſed of twenty thouſand horſe and forty thouſand foot. That of <hi>China</hi> had the ſame number, and that about <hi>Cambalu</hi> were as many. There were two others,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40153:142"/>
one upon the borders of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards the <hi>Cherſoneſſus,</hi> each containing the ſame number of men. Theſe inferior Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were not to keep the Field, but when need required, but the Imperial Army was one entire in one Body, governed as we have ſaid before, and able to ſtrengthen the others, and aſſiſt them in caſe of need.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla,</hi> who could by no means endure idleneſs, employed all his care to ſettle in good order the Army under his Command, and endeavoured to find out all the Engines of War, and Artillery uſed by Chriſtians with ſo much ſucceſs, as well to attack as to defend Cities and Towns. In theſe arts he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be skilful, and for that purpoſe, he made uſe of the Jews. For by their Trade in all parts, they brought to him all the new Inventions, that they could meet with in forreign Countries to communicate them to others, to whom they were unknown. That which pleaſed him moſt was the Invention of Guns, which a Grecian brought him, after the death of <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> with Powder, which he tried in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the Army to their great aſtoniſhment, for they could not imagine how it came to paſs, that it ſhould have ſo great a power and ſtrength. The advantages expected from it, cauſed the Emperour to be at a great expence, to purchaſe ſome from <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and to fetch perſons out of <hi>Europe,</hi> that could make Gun-powder and caſt Canon, and other pieces of Artillery. In the Tartarian Army before this they had certain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines able to caſt great ſtones or other ſhot with an incredible ſwiftneſs, but that was not to be
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40153:142"/>
compared to great Guns and Powder. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour commanded that the honour of bringing in this new Invention ſhould be aſcribed to Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> and cauſed it to be recorded in the Hiſtory of his time, for a remembrance of this great ſervice, which he had render'd him by this Invention for the glory and increaſe of his Empire. The Emperour was not ungrateful to him, for he gave him above a million of yearly Rent beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gifts. <hi>Odmar</hi> had almoſt as much. And the Revenues of the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> were very great. I ſhall not mention the penſions of many other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were rewarded beyond their deſervings.</p>
               <p>The meaneſt Souldier, that ſhewed himſelf cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious by ſome noted action, was ſure of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, which encouraged all the reſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves well, and opened a way for him to riſe to the higheſt Dignities of the Empire. In this manner honours and rewards were diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted equally according to every mans merits. This Juſtice which <hi>Tamerlan</hi> religiouſly obſerved was like a Chain, that bound together all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the Empire, ſo that they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by kept from falling aſunder, and united againſt all aſſaults and attempts.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as War was kindled it was ſpeedily extinguiſhed, becauſe every one brought his help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand to ſtop the progreſs. There was an admirable order eſtabliſhed in all the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, that the people could not eaſily rebel. But when any revolt happen'd againſt all expectation and precaution, the ſevere puniſhment of the firſt offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers frighted the reſt into a peaceable compliance.</p>
               <p>By this means, through the courage and wiſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40153:143"/>
conduct of the Prince, this Empire was become the greateſt and moſt flouriſhing of the whole World, and was doubtleſs at its higheſt pitch and growth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was become heavy by the number of his years. His Children were advancing in age, and all men began to adore the riſing Suns, but the Emperours affection for them, hindered him from being Jealous or diſpleaſed for the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reſpects paid to their perſons. He was afraid that after his deceaſe, indiſcretion, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or wicked Counſels, would ſeparate and divide their hearts with the Empire, which he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them in peace. This fear made him often ſigh and wiſh for a third Son, that he might be able to reconcile the two others together, when they ſhall be divided as it happens often in great families.</p>
               <p>This foreſight of the time to come, proved to be well grounded, for in a moment this great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy was overthrown, by the diviſions and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the two brethren, who could never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. About this time news came of a revolt at <hi>Babylon,</hi> but Prince <hi>Axalla</hi>'s ſuddain appearance there ſtifled all commotions in their beginning and returned to his Camp. A little after, he had another occaſion offered him, to expreſs his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; for <hi>Natolia,</hi> began to revolt to the Turks with ſome of the neighbouring Provinces. He ſent to <hi>Tamerlan</hi> to give him information and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his orders to march thither with his Army to pacifie all troubles and ſettle the Country in peace.</p>

This promotion, together with the fair hopes, that he gave of his perſon, had encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to raiſe a powerful Army to retake again <hi>Natolia,</hi> which they judged the eaſier to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, becauſe the diviſions of the <hi>Greek Emperours</hi> family would not ſuffer him to intermedle in the War, for his Brothers were in Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and kept him ſo employed, that he had no leaſure to look abroad to the affairs of <hi>Aſia.</hi> But <hi>Axalla</hi> being informed of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, ſent word to the Emperour to acquaint him with all their proceedings.

               <p>He ſent word alſo to the Emperour that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chibanes</hi> the Governour of <hi>Natolia,</hi> had taken away all his Souldiers out of <hi>Burſa,</hi> pulled down the fortifications, becauſe he was not able to keep it, and that he was retreated with all his Cavalry and Infantry to the foot of the Mountains, which he had ſeiſed with a reſolution there to expect the orders of his Imperial Majeſty with more men, which he wonted, becauſe in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, there was no Town of any ſtrength to make a reſiſtance againſt the enemy. When the Emperour heard all theſe things, he called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Council, where it was reſolved that Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> ſhould without delay with his Army march into <hi>Natolia</hi> to joyn with <hi>Lichibanes.</hi> That <hi>Odmar,</hi> with the forces of <hi>Quinzay</hi> and <hi>Cambalu,</hi> ſhould go thither through the borders of <hi>Moſcovia,</hi> and <hi>Zeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanes</hi> ſhould ſtrengthen his Army with twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe. That an Embaſſadour ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to the Prince of <hi>Moſcovia,</hi> to deſire the ten thouſand horſe, which he was obliged by his Treaty of Peace to ſend in ſuch like occaſions to aſſiſt <hi>Tamerlan.</hi> That the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhould ſecure his Government, and take with him all his horſe to meet the Army at the rendevouz.</p>
               <p>That in the mean while, the Governour of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould raiſe twenty thouſand horſe and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40153:144"/>
fifty thouſand foot in <hi>Perſia,</hi> beſides other levies ſhould be made in all other Provinces. That to haſten him the more, Commiſſions ſhould be ſent him from the Emperour with Commiſſioners to chooſe proper and able men, ſome to bear arms, others for the works and labours of the Camp: Orders were alſo ſent to all the chief Cities of the Empire, commanding the Magiſtrates to make proviſions of victuals and other neceſſaries, and convey them ſafe to the Army, by men appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe. <hi>Zamay</hi> alſo the Governour of <hi>Sachetay</hi> was ordered to go with all ſpeed to <hi>Deriſtan</hi> to receive all the Troops, that ſhould come thither with the proviſions for the belly, and other neceſſaries for Souldiers, and ſend them to the Army. The Emperour cauſed it to be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that he would be himſelf at the Head of his Army, and puniſh the <hi>Turks</hi> for their bold attempts.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the Imperial Army was marching to the borders, increaſing dayly by the acceſſion of new Troops. <hi>Axalla</hi> their General was overjoyed to be employed in this glorious expedition, he had ſecret orders to put a period to this War, and not to expect the Emperours coming, who advanced towards the Army with a ſlow pace, being retarded by the indiſpoſition of his body tormented with a diſeaſe. He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that <hi>Axalla</hi> ſhould put an end to this War; for that purpoſe, he had given him the whole Command over ſo much of his Treaſure as was needful, as well as over the Army.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> who had orders to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Government, and then to joyn with <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla,</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:40153:145"/>
ſent ſeveral parties of horſe before him to the Imperial Army, with ten thouſand foot, which he took out of <hi>Tauris,</hi> and eight thouſand horſe. They were commanded by a Lord named <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> a faithful Servant of the Emperours, and <hi>Axalla</hi>'s real Friend.</p>
               <p>In his way through <hi>Armenia,</hi> he drew out of the Garriſons twenty thouſand horſe to joyn them with the Imperial Army, which conſiſted then of fourſcore thouſand horſe and one hundred thouſand foot. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had as many more gathered out of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> and the province of <hi>Sachetay,</hi> but he could not in ſix months joyn with <hi>Axalla,</hi> for he was ſo diſeaſed, that he could not make more haſte. There were ſome fears amongſt his Courtiers, that his diſtemper would increaſe and grow more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and that it would oblige him to return to <hi>Samarcande,</hi> becauſe the pain, which he felt in his ſide, became every day worſe and worſe, ſo that it tormented his body, and had taken away his ſtomack, by degrees he grew feebler. None but his chief Officers and Domeſticks knew this, they were all afraid of death, which was not to be avoided. A certain Aſtrologer had foretold that immediately before his death, he ſhould win a battle againſt all the Eaſt. Another ſent him word to take heed of the thirteenth day of the Moon and the ninth moneth of the year. Theſe predictions made the Emperour believe, that he ſhould die in a battle and not in his bed, but this thought of leaving the World, did in no wiſe trouble him, but often would ſpeak of his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and of the debt he owed to Nature. He was expecting every day <hi>Odmar,</hi> who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:40153:145"/>
to him with the Young Prince his Son, for as he ſaid; he intended to preſent him to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and to ſhew him thoſe perſons who were to ſerve him, as ſoon as God ſhould take him out of the World. But he was very deſirous to embrace him once more, before he gave up the Ghoſt, and ſend him afterwards to the Empreſs, his Mother, to <hi>Samarcande</hi> with <hi>Odmar.</hi> And though his diſeaſe was very troubleſome, he had taken a reſolution if need required to go over the <hi>Boſphore</hi> of <hi>Thracia,</hi> to <hi>Canſtantinople</hi> and into <hi>Greece,</hi> to encourage his men by his preſence, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cut off, and root out all that dangerous brood of <hi>Turks</hi> and ſecure his intereſt by that means in his new Conqueſts from all future invaſion.</p>
               <p>Whiles the Emperour ſtaid for the Prince his Son with a great longing, <hi>Axalla</hi> was buſie in his Army, ſpur'd on with an earneſt deſire of Glory. He was ſo ſpeedy, that he entered into <hi>Turcomaniae</hi> at the ſame time, as fifteen thouſand <hi>Georgians,</hi> ſtrong and warlike men, overtook his Army. He marched to <hi>Gorga,</hi> where the Governour of the Provinces met him to welcome him and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him, the Orders that <hi>Axalla</hi> had to deliver to him in the Emperours name, but he would not undertake any thing till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> for that purpoſe, he made all ſpeed poſſible with fifteen thouſand horſe and thirty thouſand foot, which he brought with him. As ſoon as he was come up with his party to the Imperial Army, <hi>Axalla</hi> according to <hi>Tamerlans</hi> orders, gave the Prince the command of the Vanguard. The Governour of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had the Rear. He was a perſon well eſteem'd
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:40153:146"/>
by the Emperour, becauſe of his virtuous diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. His Government reached as far as <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that we may better underſtand this part of the Hiſtory, we muſt take notice, that as ſoon as <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had conquered all <hi>Natolia,</hi> he gave a great part of it back to the Greek Emperour upon condition, that he ſhould pay as a Tribute every year four hundred thouſand Ducats of Gold, and eight hundred thouſands Livers of Silver. <hi>Axalla</hi> ſent therefore to this Prince to acquaint him with his coming to <hi>Gorga,</hi> where he gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Troops together, which <hi>Tamerlan</hi> ſent from all parts to make up the body of an Army, which he himſelf was in his march to command to do him the ſame good Offices, which he had formerly done to his Father, therefore he intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to reconcile the differences of his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to prevent a forreign evil, which increaſed viſibly to the eye, and which would caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame inconveniency as his Father was before him, if he did not remedy it betimes. He ſent to adviſe him, that if he did not quench the domeſtick diſſentions and troubles of his family, he would but give an advantage to his mortal enemy, who would become ſtronger through his weakneſs and troubles. This ſeaſonable and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome advice, made no impreſſion upon the minds of this Prince or of his Brothers. They had ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Empire amongſt themſelves, and were at variance about their portions; contrary to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, they help'd to increaſe and enlarge the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Empire, whereof the Prince was likely to ſucceed their Father, without being any wayes
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40153:146"/>
related to him. They were ſo fooliſh as to be Jealous of <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Embaſſadours and angry at the meſſage, for they believed at firſt that the ſuccours that <hi>Axalla</hi> brought, were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ten or twelve thouſand horſe, but when they underſtood from the mouth of the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, an able and a wiſe man, that the Army had ſo many thouſand horſe and foot as to make a dreadful body, inſtead of rejoycing or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their thankfulneſs, they began to fear that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had ſent his men againſt them, as well as againſt <hi>Callepin</hi>: Neither the remembrance of <hi>Tamerlans</hi> former generoſity expreſſed to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Father, nor the Embaſſadours endeavours, to aſſure them of the Emperours good and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere intentions to do them no harm, could not remove theſe ill grounded ſuſpitions out of their minds. They were ſo blind and brutiſh, that they would not admit of a Truce amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo great was their hatred for one another. At the return of this uſeleſs Embaſſie, <hi>Axalla</hi> underſtood where <hi>Callepin</hi> lay with his Army, and how many men he had. Therefore after the general muſters, he marched to ſeek out the Enemy in <hi>Caramania Callepin</hi> was at firſt aſtoniſhed at the dilligent proceedings of the Army, but much more, when at the return of the ſcouts, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood its order, diſcipline and number of men; for he had imagined that it would not be above ten or twelve thouſand men. When he had learned the truth, he called together his Council. All the Commanders adviſed that <hi>Callepin,</hi> who was the only perſon alive of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> family, ſhould not hazard his perſon in the battle, that he was
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:40153:147"/>
to be deſired to ſtay at a diſtance, and ſee the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and end of the fight. That though his Army was ſtrong and powerful, becauſe the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Mamelucks,</hi> two warlike Nations, made up the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of it: It was to be feared if things ſuccceded not well with them, they would conclude a peace to the prejudice of the <hi>Turks</hi> with the victorious enemy. When <hi>Callepin</hi> underſtood that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in perſon, was advancing after <hi>Axalla</hi> with another Army, as numerous and as brave as the former, he began to repent that he had awakened the drowſie Lyon. The Greek Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour alſo imagining, that all this Army was deſigned to take from him his Country, as well as to drive away the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſent to conclude a league with <hi>Callepin,</hi> which after it was agreed too the <hi>Turk</hi> deſired ſome ſuccours, to help him againſt <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> Army, which was there purpoſely to defend the <hi>Greek</hi> from the <hi>Turk</hi> the common enemy of both. He alleadged theſe reaſons to ſtrengthen his ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous fancy: That in all appearance the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour would not be content, with ſuch narrow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to his Empire as the <hi>Egean</hi> Sea, but would enlarge it beyond <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> That they ought to joyn together, for the ſecurity of their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and repulſe that ambitious Prince into his own Neſt in <hi>Tartary.</hi> That he could not approve his Fathers proceedings, nor would follow his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, for after his Fathers deceaſe, he had refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give any encouragement to <hi>Tamerlans</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour in <hi>Natolia</hi>: That his Army had advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into that Province without his knowledge and conſent, and therefore he ſhould endeavo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>r to beat him out. He laboured to make the <hi>Turk</hi>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:40153:147"/>
ſenſible of theſe things, that he might conclude a confederacy with him to his own ruin; but the <hi>Tartars</hi> were ſo advanced, that tho they had both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> deſire to joyn, they could not have then the means; for the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army could not give back without deſtroying themſelves. There was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for them to fight. The greateſt part were <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Mamelucks,</hi> and baniſh'd men driven but of their Country, becauſe they would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>Tamerlan.</hi> It was therefore very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for them to delay the battle, or to retreat.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who commanded in the Turkiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, had fifteen thouſand Perſian Horſe, good figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men, and thirty thouſand.

The grand <hi>Baſſa</hi> was an experienced Warriour, and a brave Commander. With theſe Troops he imagin'd himſelf able to overthrow the enemies Army. And was the more encouraged to fight, becauſe, he ſuppoſed, that the greateſt part of the Tartarian Forces were no cordial Friends of the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>arthians,</hi> nor well wiſhers to their Empire. This
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40153:148"/>
                  <hi>Baſſa</hi> was the ſame who had been taken the day before the great Battle, where <hi>Bajazet</hi> was made Priſoner, unto whom <hi>Tamerlan</hi> gave his freedom and a ſtately horſe. He boaſted amongſt his own men, that he was acquainted with the <hi>Tartarians</hi> manner of fighting, and that the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which they had obtained was by the taking of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> but that more had been killed on their ſide than on the <hi>Turks,</hi> which was very true. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Counſel of affairs, which <hi>Callepin</hi> had called together, this was his advice, that they ſhould not ſuffer their Prince to be in the Army the day of the fight, for fear that he ſhould fall into the ſame misfortune as his Father before him.</p>
               <p>Now in the Survey and Muſtering of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Army, <hi>Axalla</hi> found that it had fourſcore thouſand Horſe, and one hundred and threeſcore thouſand Foot. Threeſcore thouſand were old Troops kept in pay by <hi>Tamerlan</hi>; brave Souldiers accuſtomed to fight. <hi>Sinopes,</hi> an excellent and a skillful Commander, led fourſcore thouſand Foot, choſen men, of a ſtout reſolution.</p>
               <p>As ſoon therefore as the enemy drew ſo near, that <hi>Axalla</hi> had notice of their march, he called a Council of War, and cauſed his Army to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſoftly towards them. He knew that <hi>Goualach,</hi> about thirty leagues off from the place where he was with his men, was an advantageous p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſt to him, who ſhould firſt recover it; he cauſed therefore all his Army, very deſirous of a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to march thither. The Turks went ſlowly and would not forſake the Sea-ſide, that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with plenty of all manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40153:148"/>
In the Tartarian Army there was no ſuch abundance, for want began to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> commanded a <hi>Parthian</hi> Captain, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Stucan,</hi> a Collonel of the light horſe, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards the <hi>Turks,</hi> and to obſerve their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he might not be ſurprized unawares. This Officer, a man fit for a great undertaking, very active and ingenious, had under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a Soldier of that Country, where the <hi>Turks</hi> were then incamp'd, who, underſtanding the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the place, and being faithful to his Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was able to do him ſervice, in a deſign that he had thought upon, and imagin'd to be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſable. But before he would attempt it he took adviſe with Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> who approved of it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him to accompliſh it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For that purpoſe <hi>Stucan</hi> with three thouſand Horſe advances before his Army ten leagues, as far as <hi>Regeni,</hi> where he met with ſome <hi>Turks,</hi> whom he made Priſoners, and by them he underſtood, that the Van of the <hi>Turks</hi> Army was in ſight. He went out upon a high ground to take notice of it, and reſolved in the dark to enter into their Camp by the means of this Souldier, that knew the language, and ſhould pretend, that he had been ſent to ſhew the way to two thouſand <hi>Perſian</hi> Horſe, which he brought with him, and at the ſame moment <hi>Stucan</hi> with his followers ſhould enter in amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſurpriſe them in diſorder. All this happened according to the project and their expectation; for two hundred men going before with this Souldier, they entered in amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed by <hi>Stucan</hi> and his party, that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:40153:149"/>
above three thouſand of the Van-guard. The reſt were afraid to ſtir, for though all the Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mounted at the firſt Alarm, they were not ſo bold as to purſue after <hi>Stucan</hi> in his retreat, but ſtood to their ground, imagining that the whole Army was at hand. They choſe rather to loſe a few fore-runners and looſe Troops, than to indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger their whole body. When day began to break the <hi>Turks</hi> Baſſa wondered at his miſtake, and to underſtand that onely three thouſand Horſe had done that execution and diſorder'd his Army, for he learn'd that the <hi>Tartarians</hi> were yet about ten leagues from his Camp. He was highly incenſed at this affront: When therefore he underſtood, by ſome Runawayes, that proviſions were but ſcarce in the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army, he reſolved to wait for it, in the place where he was and to fortifie himſelf in ſuch a manner, that he might not be forced to fight againſt his will. For by that delay, he hoped to waſte all <hi>Axalla</hi>'s proviſions and ſo to weary him, as to oblige him to retreat back again. Now <hi>Axalla</hi> imagin'd not that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was ſo well informed of the condition of his Army, but to prevent that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he purpoſed to lay a ſnare for him, and cauſe him to fall into it. A little after his Army marched within five leagues of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Whiles the Trenches were making, <hi>Axalla</hi> drew up his men in order of battle, and advanced with them, within two leagues of the Turks Army in a plain ground, from whence he went in perſon to take notice, how they lay intrenched in their Camp, from whence they had their proviſions, and what road their Convoys of victuals and their Purveyours kept. When he had well obſerved all particulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:40153:149"/>
reſolved either to force the enemies to fight him, or to lodge between them and the Sea, ſo to cut off their proviſions: For that purpoſe, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with his Army to their Trenches, as if he had an intent to aſſault them. In the mean while, without noiſe, he had employed ſome to fortifie a Camp and prepare lodgings for his Army, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> would not look out of his Camp, therefore he knew not what was preparing. He had taken notice, that the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Army had faced him eight hours in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of battle, and expected to be aſſaulted in his Trenches, which he earneſtly deſired, but when inſtead of that, news came to him that they were incamp'd near his fortifications, between him and the Sea, in a place where they would intercept all his proviſions, and that he ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to recover any without great danger and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, he was ſtrangely ſurpriſed and aſtoniſhed, which cauſed him to call together the Officers of his Army, to adviſe what to do in this juncture. It was there reſolved, that if they underſtood that the <hi>Tartars</hi> would hinder them from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency with the Sea, that then they muſt fight, but before it was reſolved to endeavour by ſtrong Guards and parties to draw proviſions into the Camp; according to this advice the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> as ſoon as day appeared, ſent out ſix thouſand Horſe of his beſt Souldiers, towards the Sea, with orders if they met with any oppoſition that then they ſhould return into the Camp. They hapned to light upon the <hi>Tartarian</hi> main Guard, that charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſo vigorouſly that they were beaten back, and forced to return faſter than they came
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40153:150"/>
on. When the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſaw what had happen'd he underſtood the <hi>Tartars</hi> deſign, and that there was a neceſſity for him to hazard a fight. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next night he drew out ſome of his Army to take poſſeſſion of a Hill, which was nearer to him than to his enemies, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to annoy them with his Artillery, which he cauſed to be planted there, as likewiſe to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Axalla</hi> from placing any Troops upon it, becauſe it was able to do a kindneſs to him that ſhould have it firſt. As ſoon as it was day <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> had news that there was a ſtirring in the <hi>Turks</hi> Camp more than ordinary, as if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to decamp. To underſtand the truth, he put himſelf at the head of twenty thouſand Horſe, and with them he advanced to obſerve their motion, reſolved to fight them if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to retreat. But when he took notice nearer of their Actions, he perceived their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he called therefore the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> and <hi>Sinopes,</hi> telling them that he was not willing that the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould intrench themſelves upon the Hill which he ſhewed them, becauſe it would be prejudicial to his Army, and that therefore it was requiſite to drive them from thence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were there well ſetled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sinopes</hi> had immediately orders to aſſault them with twenty thouſand of the ſtouteſt Infantry of the Army. <hi>Axalla</hi> doubted not of the Victory, if he could but ſucceed in this attempt upon thoſe that were upon the Hill, which was ſcituate in ſuch a place, that the Horſe were not able to get near it, becauſe of a moriſh ground lying round about, near a league from the Hill. But the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40153:150"/>
foot could march up with eaſe. <hi>Axalla</hi> had great hopes of ſucceſs, becauſe he knew the courages of his Infantry that he employed, which was the ſtouteſt in the World, and the noble and brave ſoul of <hi>Sinopes</hi> their Captain who led them on, and would do all that could be expected from a skilful and reſolute Commander.</p>
               <p>The Tartarian Army ſtood in order of battle over againſt the Turks. The Infantry was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to advance, that it might back <hi>Sino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi> and be ready at his motion to aſſiſt him. He was reſolved, if the Enemy was obſtinate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this Hill to fight on foot, and to employ all his might and force to drive him from thence. The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> was at the Head of his Cavalry over againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> Horſe. Neither of them was able to do any good to thoſe that were to fight for the poſſeſſion of the Hill. <hi>Sinopes</hi> by <hi>Axalla</hi>'s advice, had taken a Compaſs round under a high piece of ground, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the enemies from receiving his motion, whiles he ſtood ready to aſſiſt them.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Sinopes</hi> broke in upon them with his twenty thouſand foot and diſordered them, before they were aware. An Enemy ſurpriſed, is half over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The Turks, aſtoniſhed with this ſuddain on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, knew not whither all the Infantry or but a part, had aſſaulted them. This conceit filled them with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. At that time the reſt of the Army ſtood in order of battle at one end of the Marſh, and both Armies were in ſight of one another very ſilent, but when the <hi>Turks</hi> perceived what was acted upon the Hill, they made all haſte to help their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades and reſſiſt the <hi>Tartars.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> being a
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:40153:151"/>
very skiful Commander, ſent away all his Infantry to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ccour his men, who had been broken at the firſt charge of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> foot, and had left them the poſſeſſion of the Top of the Hill. By this means, they got the advantage of the ground, ſo that they encountered the <hi>Turks</hi> with more eaſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Turks</hi> ſtood upon a ſhelving ground, which hindered them from uſing their Weapons with that advantage as the others could. But the great companies of <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> who were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the aſſiſtance of their companions, had doubtleſs overpowr'd the <hi>Tartarian</hi> foot, in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Mountain, if <hi>Axalla,</hi> upon ſight of their approach, had not diſpatch'd away at the ſame moment, twenty thouſand more to renew the fight, and keep up his mens courages againſt the <hi>Janiſaries.</hi> And after them he provided five and twenty thouſand more, that he might march himſelf at their Head, as ſoon as he ſhould ſee any more advancing the Hill from the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army; for that purpoſe, he alighted off from his Horſe to command them in perſon. When the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> underſtood his intent, that he would hazard his perſon in the battle upon the Hill, he ſent to intreat him to leave that to one of his Collonels of the foot, and to ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind to give his orders; telling him, That the whole Army made him the ſame requeſt. <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> reply'd, that the buſineſs then in action was of a high concernment, and that if the Hill were once gain'd, the Victory would follow with eaſe. And that he was reſolved to obey his orders that day and become his Souldier. At that inſtant the reſt of the <hi>Turks</hi> foot was obſerved to move.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:40153:151"/>
Theſe were moſt of them <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> they gave a furious aſſault to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> foot, but when <hi>Axalla</hi> came in with a choſen party, he beat them back and won all the Hill. Before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, he cauſed Trenches to be drawn on that ſide which look'd towards the <hi>Turks</hi> Army, and left there to command <hi>Sinopes,</hi> who had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed to himſelf much honour and glory, by his brave conduct.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tartarians</hi> loſt in the ſeveral aſſaults be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween fifteen and ſixteen thouſand men, but the <hi>Turks</hi> near thirty thouſand. The fight laſted from eight a Clock in the morning till night. The Cavalry all that while ſtood ſtill without acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on looking upon the paſſages upon the Hill, for they could not advance to it, becauſe of the deep Marſh.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> diſcouraged with this loſs depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the next night, marching back ten long leagues before they ſtop'd. The Prince of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais, Stucan</hi> and the light Horſe followed them cloſe at the heels, and <hi>Axalla</hi> with the reſt of his Army made after them, and incamped near the Sea, about two leagues diſtant from the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were drawing towards <hi>Caramania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> had recollected his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and was returned to himſelf, he reſolved to incamp and intrench his Army. But the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> angry that he had not been concerned in the Glory of the day before, would not give him the leaſure to fortifie himſelf. Therefore he advanced forward to fight him, ſo far and with ſuch indiſcretion, that when the reſt of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my behind were about to fix their Tents, news
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:40153:152"/>
came to them, that the Prince was ingaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and that unleſs he was ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily relieved, he would be cut off with his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This Report caus'd <hi>Axalla</hi> to ſound a march and with his Cavalry to advance before, when he was come to the banks of a ſmall River in his way, he ſaw the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi>'s miſtake in venturing over, before he had ſent to ſee what enemies were on the other ſide, for the crafty <hi>Turks</hi> had ordered ten thouſand <hi>Perſian</hi> Horſe to ſtop the Princes party, by skirmiſhing with them. They behaved themſelves ſo brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had not ſent away more to relieve the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Tartarians</hi> had cut them all in pieces. But as his intent was but to keep them buſie and employed, and to hinder them from all poſſibilities of a retreat, he diſpatched away twenty thouſand Horſe more, to ſecond the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who ſeem'd to be almoſt all brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Then the <hi>Tartars</hi> were forced to give back with great loſs, if the Lord <hi>D' Halicen</hi> had not come in with a freſh party, to aſſiſt the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> they had been routed, for the Prince loſt two Horſes under him, and was mounted upon the third. <hi>Stucan</hi> was kill'd, and all his light Horſemen overthrown. When <hi>Axalla</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the fault of the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> he was in diſpair to ſee ſo glorious a Victory, which God had given him uſeleſs or loſt through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens miſcarriage, and folly. Turning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to his men in haſte. <hi>Now my dear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades,</hi> Cryed he, <hi>we muſt fight not ſo much for the glory of the</hi> Parthians, <hi>as for their lives and ſafety, and for the preſervation of the whole Army,

Go,</hi> ſaid he, to a body of ten thouſand Horſe, which he commanded to ride forward, <hi>Go</hi> and keep <hi>up the fight, I will follow to relieve you or dye with you, that our enemies may ſee that we will not part with the Victory out of our hands, at ſo cheap a rate.</hi> A few minutes after, he advanced at the Head of forty thouſand Horſe, divided into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And with them he charged the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were already grown inſolent and proud of their ſucceſs. For ſince the firſt onſet of the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> they had alwaies had an advantage upon him, and overthrown him in the third charge, this poor Prince was caſt to the ground and left as dead, ſo that his fall had left them the Victory, had not the ten thouſand Horſe ſent by <hi>Axalla</hi> given a furious onſet and beaten the enemies back. By this means <hi>Axalla</hi> had time to advance, He was deſirous to revenge the <hi>Parthians</hi> loſſes and ſnatch the Victory out of the <hi>Turks</hi> hands, and becauſe it was then within two hours of night, the ſhortneſs of the time required them to make haſte. He marched therefore ſtrait to the Enemy with an intent to oblige him to fight.</p>
               <p>At that time the <hi>Baſſa</hi> having yet had no hand in the action, wondered to ſee his men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of driving before the ten thouſand Horſe led by the Lord of <hi>Halicen,</hi> give back and retreat. He advanced therefore with fifteen thouſand freſh Horſe, with a reſolution to end the difference and gain the Victory. His firſt charge cauſed the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Parthians</hi> to give back, but <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> entered into the fight in that moment, with

A Governour of <hi>Natolia</hi> named <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauen,</hi> who commanded a reſerve of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, coming up to <hi>Axalla</hi> to joyn with him, adventured againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> but to his loſs, for he had been broken and his men diſorder'd. The greateſt part of them rallied near <hi>Axalla</hi>'s perſon, and charged with him to be reveng'd. They drove back the <hi>Turks</hi> Cavalry with that ſucceſs that they made them run in upon their Infantry, and forſook them immediately afterwards. Fear had ſo great a power upon their minds, and infuſed a ſwiftneſs into their heels. The <hi>Tartarian</hi> Horſe, ſeeing all out of order amongſt the <hi>Turks</hi> foot, dallied not with them, but broke in amongſt the thickeſt; had it not been for the dark night they would have killed every man of them. Above twenty thouſand, moſt part <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> retreated in good order, they got over a River and hindered by that means, the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Horſe from obtaining ſo compleat a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory as they deſired.</p>
               <p>The next day, as ſoon as it appeared, <hi>Axalla</hi> ſent a party of Horſe with the Governour of <hi>Natolia</hi> to purſue after the flying <hi>Turks,</hi> and to hinder them from rallying together in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It was a difficult matter to overtake them, for they had marched all night, without ſtopping and that in good Order, commanded by the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:40153:154"/>
Captain of the <hi>Janiſaries</hi> named the <hi>Aga.</hi> They complained of their Horſemen, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken them baſely, when they were couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reſolved to die for the Service of their Prince, rather than to yield or give ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla,</hi> remaining ſtill behind upon the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy field, caus'd all the dead to be put into the ground, the wounded to be taken care of, and ſent the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> into a ſecure place to be healed of a dangerous wound in his Leg, received by an Arrow. He marched next after the <hi>Turks,</hi> for he had heard that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had got together near fourteen thouſand Horſe. And that he might be able to follow them with more ſpeed, he left behind him all his bag and baggage. And to ſeparate them from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> he took a nearer way to them that he might get in with them, before they were joyned together.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Janiſaries</hi> alſo marching a great pace got as far as the Sea ſide. <hi>Axalla</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ten thouſand Horſe to follow them, and all his foot, that had not yet been ingaged to purſue and hinder them from eſcaping if it were poſſible. They had marched a great way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and fruſtrated all the ſpeed that could be made after them, at <hi>Gallipoli</hi> they took Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and ſailed over into <hi>Europe</hi> to ſeek for <hi>Callepin,</hi> who was mightily incenſed againſt the <hi>Baſſa</hi>; for he accuſed him, for having forſaken his Army by a ſhameful ſlight, becauſe he had not choſen an Honourable death to the ſafety of his Life.</p>
               <p>In this laſt ingagement, the <hi>Turks</hi> loſt above
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40153:155"/>
five and forty thouſand men, and <hi>Axalla</hi> about twenty thouſand. In both, his courage and prudent acting met with great ſucceſs and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Much was aſcribed to chance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. <hi>Stucan</hi> was found dead under his Horſe and his Buckler over his Face. His death was much lamented all over the Army, though his furiouſneſs and indiſcretion was likely to have ruined them all. They rejoyced all for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> who had been as it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> congratulated him for his deliverance; but afterwards with mild and yet ſignificant words, ſhewed him his unadviſedneſs, in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to fight as he did, and obliged him to purchaſe the Victory at a very dear Rate, with the loſs of twenty thouſand men, whereas they might have gained it without any danger or ſpilling of blood with a little patience. The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> laid the fault upon <hi>Stucan</hi> and his light Horſe, who were advanced too far, and proteſted that he imagined not the body of the enemies Army ſo near him as it was. Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> told him that the fear of what might happen, had obliged him to draw with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as near to the River as he could.</p>
               <p>All theſe great ſucceſſes and Victories, which were able to puff up the minds of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, raiſed in him no ſign of joy, his Soul was rather drooping in a great ſadneſs, which proceeded from the news of the Emperours ſickneſs, of which the Phyſicians had no good opinion. The great fear of the miſchiefs that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40153:155"/>
were likely to follow, and the notable altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Empire, made him wiſh that his employment would have ſuffered him to have gone and paid his reſpects to his dear Maſter and Lord, and taken of him his laſt farewel. But his Duty could not permit him to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at that time, he was forced to put off his departure till another opportunity. He onely writ to his Majeſty to acquaint him with the Victories that he had won. He cauſed his Letters to be Read in the Council aſſembled for that and other purpoſes.</p>
               <p>But to hinder the enemies retreat into the Mountains, he ſent after them many Troops of Horſe, and followed them himſelf with the reſt of the Army, for he wiſhed he could ſpeedily put an end to this War.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> came in every day by Troops, to ſubmit themſelves, and deſire the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Mercy and Pardon for their Revolt. They ſaid, that they had been earneſtly ſollicited by their Prince, who was killed in the laſt ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But that which ſurpriſed and rejoyced the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army moſt was the Head of the Grand <hi>Baſſa,</hi> which was brought into the Camp by a Souldier, who had killed him as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to fly away, after that the <hi>Perſians</hi> had left him. This was the ſame man, who had been <hi>Tamerlans</hi> pris'ner before <hi>Bajazet</hi> was taken, whom the Emperour ſent back ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly. <hi>Axalla</hi> was alwayes in purſuit of the flying Troops of the Turkiſh Army, all the <hi>Mamelucks,</hi> he killed and allowed them no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe moſt of them had deſerted the Prince
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:40153:156"/>
of <hi>Tanais</hi> and forſaken him ſhamefully. But all the reſt were ſo well treated that in fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dayes the whole Army was broken and ſcattered, and all the Maritine Towns taken without much reſiſtance; for they heard no news of <hi>Callepin,</hi> who was gone into <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all this ſucceſsful proceeding, the ſeaſon of the year drawing towards Winter, made the Army ask for their Wages. It was thought fit to pleaſe the Souldiers, to ſend them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Gevolach</hi> there to paſs the Winter, in a fat and plentiful Country, where they might live with eaſe and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> fearing leaſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ſickneſs ſhould cauſe an alteration in mens minds, and troubles in his Government, reſolved, after he had diſcourſed with <hi>Axalla,</hi> to depart with his Troops into <hi>Perſia.</hi> Theſe two Princes ingaged themſelves one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an Oath to ſeek to promote and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour one anothers intereſts. <hi>Axalla</hi> delayed the attempt upon the Empire of <hi>Greece</hi> till the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Spring. He intended then to deſtroy it, becauſe he was reſolved to diſable that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour from helping the <hi>Turks,</hi> he having been ſo indiſcreet, as to ſide with them againſt his beſt Benefactor. He ſoon recovered all the Towns that he had taken from the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> was not advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty Leagues from the Army, when the news of the Emperours death was brought to <hi>Axalla.</hi> He had been long in expectation of a change, he was deſirous of news, and yet afraid to hear what would grieve him to the heart.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:40153:156"/>
He underſtood by the meſſenger, that this great Prince was dead two dayes after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Axalla</hi>'s Letters of the Victory, which he had won. They cauſed him to rejoyce, for he had a ſound judgement, till the laſt moment of his Life, and gave orders for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Empire, with as much care as he had ever done before.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Axalla</hi> received firſt this ſad news, which he expected, he withdrew himſelf aſide to give way to his tears and violent grief: but he would not ſuffer the Army to know what they had loſt for ſome dayes, he ſuffered not therefore his ſorrow to appear before them, but ſent ſpeedily after the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> to acquaint him with the news, and intreat him to appoint him a place, where he might meet and ſpeak with him, that they together might conſult about their private concerns. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſire they met at a rendevouz.</p>
               <p>The diſpatch that <hi>Axalla</hi> received was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Sentrochio</hi> the new Emperour, who ſent him orders to leave, with the Governour of the borders, forty thouſand men, and to return with the reſt of the Army through <hi>Perſia.</hi> This meſſenger was followed by a favourite of the new Emperour, who had orders to aſſure <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> of the Emperours affection, that he ſhould have as great an intereſt in him as in the Old Emperour deceaſed, and that he would ever acknowledge the ſervices that <hi>Axalla</hi> had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him, and thoſe which he yet expected from him. This Complement proceeded from
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40153:157"/>
his deſire to win and prevent him, and his fear of his power; for to ſpeak Truth, he was as it were the Commander of all the forces of the Empire, he had an authority over them, and was highly eſteem'd, becauſe of his noble behaviour and late Victories over the <hi>Turks,</hi> which all the Army acknowledged to be due to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and reſolution. But <hi>Sentrochi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> knew him not well, for <hi>Axalla</hi> was a juſt and a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man, unable to commit a baſe action, which might blemiſh his reputation or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his duty. Therefore he aſſured his new Lord, that he would be true and faithful to him.</p>
               <p>Whiles the Army refreſhed themſelves, <hi>Axalla</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> had an enterview at the place appointed. They promiſed to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, with an Oath, to be true and faithful to their ſeveral intereſts, and to make no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their concerns, whether they related to their governments, offices, or penſions. They thought it convenient to conceal ſome few days the Emperours death, but when <hi>Axalla</hi> was returned to his Army, the news was ſpread all about, as commonly ill news is known before good. He called therefore the Army together, and declared to them, <hi>That the Emperuor was dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this was ſpoken, it was a lamentable thing to hear the Cryes and the Sighs that were all over the Camp. All wept, Captains and Souldiers, all lamented for the loſs of ſo good a Maſter and Benefactor. When ſilence was made, he ask'd them whether they would
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40153:157"/>
not have for the Young Prince his Son, the ſame affection as for the Father, and promiſe the ſame fidility. They anſwered all, <hi>That they would.</hi> The General afterwards cauſed the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army to ingage themſelves by an a new Oath, all the Colours to be covered with black, and the Army to be paid off. He exhorted them again, to honour the memory of <hi>Tamerlan the Great,</hi> who was not dead ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he ſurvived in the perſon of his Son, which he left behind him for their good. He told them, that this Young Prince ought to be dear to them and eſteem'd, becauſe of his vertues and good qualities. That for the time to come they ſhould all fight under his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and receive from his bounty the rewards due to their ſervices and labours. That therefore they ought to go to be known to him; and that for him he would never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, whiles breath was in his body, he would aſſiſt and recommend them to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>After this diſcourſe <hi>Axalla</hi> choſe the Souldiers whom he intended to leave with the Governour of the Province to keep the Country in awe, and hinder the enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions: after ſome other Orders given, he marched away with the reſt of the Army, and advanc'd two great days journey towards <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whiles <hi>Axalla</hi> is in the way, let us take notice of ſome particulars of the death of this great Prince, who left not behind him his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

vain for help from the skill of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Phyſitians, but when he ſaw, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their endeavours, that his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per increaſed more and more, and that he could not avoid the payment of the ordinary tribute of Nature. He called for <hi>Sentrochio</hi> his eldeſt Son, to whom he ſpake in the preſence of <hi>Odmar,</hi> and of the chief of his Council. He gave him an account of all the actions of his life beginning by the retreat of his Father the Prince of <hi>Sachetay,</hi> from all worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to employ himſelf in divine contemplation and Prayers. He told him, that when he left him the Soveraignity of his Dominions, he gave him three great men to aſſiſt him to bear part of his burden, and adviſe him for the beſt. That onely <hi>Odmar,</hi> the youngeſt of the three, was then alive. That he had been willing to ſubmit to their good Counſels in things relating to Peace and War, and had never any cauſe to repent of it. That the great credit and reputation that he had gain'd, when he was very young, by the famous Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over the Moſcovites, who were become ſo dreadful to all <hi>Aſia,</hi> was the effect of their wiſe counſels, rather than the work of hazard or fortune. He told him, that the bringing down of the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> whom he had made to be tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to him, and the luſire of ſome vertues that ſhined in him, had obliged his neighbours and his kindred to ſeek his acquaintance and affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the greateſt Lords of his Court, whom he loved beſt before; but then he rejoyced to prefer to them the Conquerour of the common enemy of their Nation, and a Nephew for whom nature and the nearneſs of blood pleaded in his heart. That it was this that had raiſed him to the Empire of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> that gave him the Emperours Daughter in marriage, becauſe he hoped that he would eaſe him of his burden in his old age, by manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him his publick affairs and ſcattering away all diviſions and parties through the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and dread of his forces. He told him, that the Emperours expectation had not been diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that whiles he lived he honoured and loved him as his Lord and Father. That he had behaved himſelf ſo uprightly as well towards his Father as towards his Subjects, that when the Emperour died he ſucceeded to the Throne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any contradiction or commotion, for all ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves willing to obey. So that he ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well to the affections of the people, as to the authority over them. That ſince twenty years that he had enjoyed this vaſt Empire, he had been alwayes faithfully ſerved. That he gave God thanks that the promiſes; which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour his Unkle had made of the rewards, which were due to his Subjects for their ſervices, he had had opportunity and means to diſcharge; for the happineſs of his Armies had inabled him to pay all his Unkles and his own obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and debts. He continued to him his diſcourſe in this manner. <hi>I leave thee, my Son, theſe for

thy Servants, who deſerve all of them to be Kings. Honour them and reign amongſt them.

               <p>After this, taking <hi>Odmar</hi> by the hand, he removed him from the place where he ſat to make him go to the right ſide of his bed, and then caſting once more his eyes upon his Son on the left ſide, he ſpoke to him thus again. <hi>This ſide ſhall be kept for</hi> Axalla, <hi>who is abſent.

That he left it to him to command it, becauſe he was his Son, though there was
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40153:159"/>
no other deſerveing in him, but the hopes that he gave of his perſon. Afterwards <hi>he reached</hi> out his hand to all the Princes and Lords about his bed, with theſe words directed to his Son. <hi>In theſe perſons cheifly your Empire and happineſs will conſiſt.</hi> Then he beckned to his Chancellour to draw near, and ask'd from him his Seal, which he delivered to the young Prince, and cauſed the Prince to reſtore it again to the Chancellour. He was afterwards a while without ſpeaking, but preſently he began again, <hi>my Son,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Love juſtice, ſhew it to the poor as well as to the rich; to the mean man as well as to the great; it is your Office, your Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour will ſometimes help you: Remember that the ſword that you bear is only to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Whiles he was talking thus to the Prince, the Chancellour being near his perſon, a great noiſe was heard in the next Chamber. The Emperour enquired what might be the cauſe. A Lord at that inſtant coming in, ſent from <hi>Axalla,</hi> brought with him tydings of two great Victories, which his Army in <hi>Natolia</hi> had obtained againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> This meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger gave him an account of all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the two ingagements, which had been manag'd with Wiſdome and valour by his brave General; he told the Emperour at laſt that his Valliant Soldiers were in hopes to ſee his Majeſty amongſt them aſſoon as the

ſeaſon of the year would permit, to ſubdue the Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> which would be eaſily accompliſhed, becauſe the enemies were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and in a great fear. But the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who was then no longer deſirous of earthly honours, anſwered with a ſmiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he had never queſtioned the affections that his Soldiers had to promote his glory, but that he knew himſelf called by a greater Lord than himſelf to a happyer conqueſt and to a higher place, unto which he was going. Tell, ſaid he, to that Lord, <hi>Tell</hi> Axalla, <hi>that I deſire him, for the time to come, to obey my Son.</hi> Then taking from his finger a Ring of a great value, he delivered it to him with this order. <hi>Carry this token of my Love to your General, and let him take it as an aſſurance, that I am well ſatisfied with his ſervices and fidelity.</hi> He inquired after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whether all the Officers, that were known to him in his Army were in health, and recommended every one of them to his Son according to his quality and deſervings. Then the Prince of <hi>Tanais</hi> came again into his mind. He deſired his Son to love him as his Kinſman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to maintain him in the Offices and Governments, which he had given him, becauſe he was worthy of them; for he aſſured him, that the Prince would be faithful to him. Then with a louder voice than before he told <hi>Sentrochio.</hi> That if ever he had a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

it in any other perſons hands but <hi>Azalla.</hi> But he adviſed him to command it himſelf as often as he could, for it was dangerous to truſt it in other hands, and it was the duty of the <hi>Parthian</hi> Emperours to dwell with their Souldiers in the Army, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amongſt his Children. He told him by the practice of this leſſon he ſhould be able to keep the great Empire that he left him, and render himſelf by his vertue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſucceed him. At laſt he adviſed him to be mild, courteous to his friends, dreadful to his enemies, but <hi>when they ſhall ſue for Peace refuſe them not, forgive your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate wrongs, but puniſh ſeverely the wickedneſs committed againſt the ſtate of your Subjects.</hi> All this while the young Prince wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, but <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> when he held this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, had a greater Majeſty and beauty upon his countenance than ordinary. He ſent away afterwards his Son to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Mother to endeavour to comfort her by his preſence.</p>
               <p>When the young Prince was gone he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for <hi>Odmar,</hi> and recommended to his care his young Son, intreating him to Love him, and to be faithful to him. He told him alſo, that it was his will that his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son ſhould be brought up and taught to obey his Elder Brother. <hi>I know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the peace and preſervation of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire depends upon the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Love of the Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:40153:161"/>He ſent for them both a while after to give them his laſt bleſſing, when they were before him he commanded the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be obedient to his elder Brother, and both, he commanded to honour the Empreſs their Mother; when he gave them his bleſſing it was obſerved that he touch'd the head, of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trochio,</hi> and put it down lower with his hand, but he lifted up the head of the younger by hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This was look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a preſage, that <hi>Letrochio</hi> the youngeſt ſhould riſe to the Empire, and overthrow the power of his brother, as it happened afterwards, when they quarrelled, by their variance they ruined the Empire of <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour paſſed the next night very quietly, about break of day, according to his cuſtome he called for thoſe perſons who had any buſineſs with him. The Letters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that were to be ſent to <hi>Axalla,</hi> concerning the victories that he had got, were brought to him, which he ſigned without pain or without diſcovering any alteration in his countenance. But a few minutes after, when ſleep began to ceaſe upon his ſenſes, they that were about him perceived that his ſoul was departing to another world. They ſent to call for the young Emperour, who came in good time to cloſe his eye lids, ſhedding a fountain of tears as well as the reſt of his Servants.</p>
               <p>Two hours after <hi>Sentrochio</hi> was proclam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Emperour, and Letters were diſpatched to all the Governours of the Provinces, ſigned with his hand: After this the Army was called together by his orders, to the Souldiers he gave mony and great gifts, to his Fathers old Servants entertaining them with a ſpeech. But would not offer to change any thing in the Army, till he had ſeen Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> and bin with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Army. When this young Prince came to be Emperour he was not above nineteen years of age. He was beautiful and much like his Father. Every one judged that he would be able, with the aſſiſtance of his wiſe Conſellours, to maintain with Honour his large Empire. But the too great affection of the Empreſs for <hi>Letrochio</hi> cauſed a jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſie in the eldeſt Brother, which ſet them at a diſtance, and divided them and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. In this particular, They became like their fore-fathers, and imitated their follies, for they ruined, by the diviſions and hatred of Brothers, the Empire of their predeceſſors, which <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had recovered and raiſed up by his vertue and courage, and render'd the moſt glorious and moſt flouriſhing Empire of the world.</p>
