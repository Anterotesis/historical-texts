            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The aduertiſement was written from <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Tymothy,</hi> and at that time when princes were both infidels and Idolators:</p>

               <p>The church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath prayed for thoſe princes that were heretickes, &amp; that in the middeſt of their impietie and hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt tyrany: <hi>Conſtantius</hi> for one that was an <hi>Arian,</hi> and yet was prayed for by the decree of a common Counſell.</p>

               <p>So he may ſell the ſheepe to the Butcher if he bee fat, but what is that to your Pope, woulde you haue him to doe the like by princes! I hope you vnderſtand Syr <hi>Tady,</hi> that all ſimilitudes be no ſylogiſmes.</p>

               <p>For all this I cannot thinke it any treaſon to defende that the pope may lawfully depoſe any prince, for tyrany or hereſie.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>The time hath beene when Princes might in no wiſe med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with eccleſiaſticall perſons, and I warrant you the Pope will neuer giue his conſent that any prince of them all ſhoulde haue lawfull authoritie to puniſh a prieſt.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>God be thanked of a good amendment, Princes are bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to be more wiſe, and I thinke you haue heard of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtore of your trayterous prieſtes that haue already hopped as far as from <hi>Tyber</hi> to <hi>Tyburne,</hi> and there is ſome hope that ſhortly more will follow.</p>

               <p>I haue hearde of ſome that ſuffered martyrdome, but I know you will ſay they were executed for treaſon, when in truth it was but for the teſtimony of their conſciences.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>And if it be a matter of conſcience for prieſts and Ieſuites to vndermine a princes eſtate, and to ſtirre vp their ſubiectes to rebell, to goe about to plucke the crowne from their heades and to wreſt the ſcepter out of their handes, then you ſay truth, they ſuffered for their conſciences, but if your prieſtes and Ieſuytes, were ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Pioners</hi> to make ready the way for the Popes <hi>Bull,</hi> that ſhould haue diſinherited the Prince, and giuen his crowne to another, as was apparantly proued and confeſſed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, I wonder with what faces papiſtes can excuſe thoſe iuſtly condemned traytors, and to intitle them for martyrs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ta.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell what was proued againſt them, but I am ſure they were cruelly executed, but what ſhould I neede to ſpeake of matters that were done ſo many yeares paſt, when we haue exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples here at home, that be yet bleeding new, of two holy martyrs that were executed at <hi>Dublyne,</hi> but vpon Candlemas eaue nowe laſt paſt, the one a reuerend and a learned By ſhop, inueſted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares ſithens to the Biſhopricke of <hi>Downe</hi> by the Popes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, the other a holy <hi>Catholicke</hi> prieſt, that did both together ſuffer martyrdome in a moſt conſtant manner onely for their conſciences, and for the teſtimonie of the <hi>Catholicke</hi> faith.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Now fye of the diuell, and out vppon popery, is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any papiſt ſhould be found ſo fooliſh to bring this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into queſtion, vnleſſe to ſhame himſelfe, or to make his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ridiculous? but doe you call him a reuererid and a learned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

hee ſhewed it in the manner of his life, but neuer more manifeſt then at the houre of his death.</p>
               <p>It is truth, he had his inueſtment by the Pope, for thoſe <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite Idyotes,</hi> be fit inſtruments to ſpread the Popes doctrine, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the poore people are ſo infected with this Locuſt <hi>vermine</hi> of prieſts and fryars, that they will ſooner be leeue an <hi>Aſſe</hi> that comes from <hi>Rome</hi> with a Popes <hi>Bull,</hi> then an Angell of heauen, that ſhoulde bee ſent with the light of Gods word.</p>
               <p>Now for your holy prieſt that accompanied your learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, me thinkes our papiſtes of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould make interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our <hi>Lady,</hi> that his name might neuer more be hadde in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that at the time of his death, did ſhewe himſelfe to be the very diſgrace of popery, and an vtter reproch to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he profeſſed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ta.</speaker>
               <p>Why <hi>Patricke</hi> although the prieſt did ſhew himſelfe to be in ſome little aſtoniſhment with the terrour of the death hee was to indure, yet he died conſtantly without revolting from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Byſhop and hee together indured their martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with patience enough.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>I wonder with what ſhameles faces papiſts can auow thoſe to be martyrs, and to die for the teſtimony of their conſciences, that were both of them euycted of high treaſon, and no matter of religion inforced againſt them: was not your Byſhop indited of ſixteene ſeuerall articles of treaſon, all of them openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by himſelfe, and he condemned by his owne confeſſion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ta.</speaker>
               <p>And yet I hope you will not deny, but that all his articles, which you ſay were ſo many treaſons, tended all to the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the holy church of <hi>Rome:</hi> which euery honeſt man is bound in conſcience to doe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>If all our prieſtes in <hi>Ireland</hi> that doe teach that doctrine to the poore ſilly people of that country, were drawne hanged &amp; quartered as your Byſhop was, the kings maieſty would be both better beloued, and more dutifully ſerued in <hi>Ireland</hi> then nowe he is.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Then I perceiue you do ſtil thirſt after bloud: is not your inſatiate deſire yet glutted enough, with the death of thoſe two worthy martyrs, eſpecially of that reuerend Biſhop, who was ſo

               <p>I will deny him nothing that was his due, his learning was fit to concurre with that authority the Pope had giuen him, that was to ſtirre vp the people to treaſon, and rebellion, for anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther litterature, if ought were in him, it might haue beene begged for a concealment, for he neuer ſhewed it.</p>

               <p>The 28. day of Ianuary now laſt paſt, the Biſhop with his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion the prieſt, being brought to an araignment at the Kings bench barre at <hi>Dublyne,</hi> were there condemned of treaſon, and adiudged to be executed the next ſaturday following, which was the firſt of February being Candlemas eue: which day being come, in the morning ſomething timely, by a Catholicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, a prieſt or two of the Popes broode, were ſent with holy water and other like holy ſtuffe, to ſanctifie and hallow the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes where they ſhould be hanged.</p>
               <p>Loe here the pietie that is in popery, I haue many times heard ſpeaking of hallowed bread, of hallowed water, of hallowed aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, of hallowed beades, and of ſuch other like hallowed traſh, but I neuer heard of a payre of gallowes that were hallowed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but theſe gallowes being thus ſanctified, and made holy afore hand, about 2. of the clocke in the afternoone, the traytors were deliuered to the Sheryues of <hi>Dublyne</hi> that were to ſee execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who placing them in a ſmall carre, and being aſſiſted with a conuenient guarde, as they paſſed along through the ſtreetes of <hi>Dublyne,</hi> diuerſe citizens (whereof ſome that were of good ſort and faſhion) as the Biſhop paſſed by, fell downe vppon their knees in the durt and mire, crauing his fatherly bleſſing &amp; bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but the poore regardles wretch, ſitting ſtill like a blocke woulde neither vouchſafe them worde, nor ſo much as to turne his head aſide to looke at them, or once to lift vp his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or to make ſhew eyther of deuotion or of anie religion at all, what was in him, ſo that he might haue bin a Papiſt a Turke or a Iew, for any thing that could haue bin diſcerned by him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his wordes or by his ſhowe: And now being come to the
<pb facs="tcp:16376:8"/>
place of execution, it is truth he was followed with troopes of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, both men and women, and not of the inferior ſort alone, but of the better, &amp; amongſt the women, of the beſt mens wiues within the cittie of <hi>Dublyne:</hi> that kept ſuch a ſcriking, ſuch a how<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling, and ſuch a hallowing, as if Saint <hi>Patricke</hi> himſelfe had bin going to the gallowes, they could not haue made greater ſignes and ſhowes of griefe and ſorrowe: but when they ſaw him turned from of the gallowes, they raiſed the <hi>Who bub,</hi> with ſuch a maine cry, as if the rebels had beene approched to robbe and rifell their cittie.</p>
               <p>Now to anſwere to your queſtion, if I ſhould ſay that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring of a traytor, with ſuch ſignes and ſhowes of ſorrowe, did argue but little loue to his maieſtie, perhaps I might offende a great number of papiſtes, but this I dare bouldly affirme, that thoſe fooleries, that were vſed both before and after the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, argued but little wit; and I thinke the recitall of it woulde make the papiſtes themſelues to laugh at the folly of popery, for marke what followed.</p>
               <p>The executioner had no ſooner taken of the Biſhops heade, but that the townes men of <hi>Dublyne,</hi> began to flocke about him: ſome taking vp the head with pitious aſpect, accompanied with ſobs and ſighes, that of my conſcience were breathed out from their verie ſoule.</p>
               <p>Some kiſſed it with as religious an appetite as euer they kiſſed the <hi>Paxe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some cut away all the haire from the head, which louſie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, they religiouſly reſerued, for a louſie relique.</p>
               <p>Some others were practiſing to ſteale the heade away, the which beeing eſpyed by the executioner, hee gaue notice of the matter to the Sheryues of <hi>Dublyne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when he began to quarter the body, the women thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged about him as faſt, and happy was ſhee that coulde gett but her handkercheife dipped in the bloud of the traytor: And the body being once diſſeuered into foure quarters, they neither left finger nor toe, but they cut them off, and carried them away: And to ſhew their Catholike zeale, they tare his garments into tatters, and ſome others that could get no holy monumentes that appertayned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to his perſon, with their kniues they ſhaued
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16376:8"/>
of chippes from the hallowed gallowes: neyther would they ſo much as omitt the halter wherewith he was hanged, but it was gathered vp to be reſerued for holy vſes.</p>
               <p>I might ſpeake heere of the Biſhops breeches that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner ſould for fiue ſhillings to a fellow that carrying them into the towne, and tearing them into fitters made as good a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of them amongſt the Catholikes of <hi>Dublin,</hi> as if they hadd beene pardons newe come from Rome: the poore hangman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine who but laying his cloake a little apart whilſt hee was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his office, it was ſtolne away from him, and could not be heard on till within two or three dayes, and then it was knowne to be cut into ſhreadds, and ſo ſold amongſt the Papiſtes for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reliques at a very deare rate, thinking it had beene ſome veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belonging to the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry for my country-men that are ſo blind and blockiſh but ſee what followed: the ſame night after the execution was done, they flocke together afreſh both men and women, with holy water, holy candle: and congregating themſelues at the holy gallowes, in the place of execution, they ſpent the fore part of the night in heatheniſh howling, and performing many po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ceremonies, and after midnight, beeing then Candelmas day in the morning, hauing there prieſts in a readines they had Maſſe, and as ſome ſay Maſſe after Maſſe: day light beeing come they departed to their owne houſes, all of them made as holy towardes God, as they had ſhewed themſelues dutifull to the King.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe you now to heare me to render you the like reaſon, our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> was crucified and dyed at <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> for the ſinnes of the worlde, and therefore in the worke of our redemption, his power is more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ull and ample at the citie of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> then it is in any other place where he hadde formerly taught and preached.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>You ſay <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are blinded, but if papiſteswere not both blind and out of their wits beſides, they would neuer gather ſuch concluſions whereby to vpholde the pride of their pope, that be cauſe <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſeate: but how hangeth this together, where <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the 23. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> tolde his <hi>Diſciples</hi> that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes</hi> did ſit on <hi>Moſes</hi> Chayre, what was ment by <hi>Moſes</hi> chayre in this place? it could not be meant by the citie of <hi>Ieraſalem,</hi> as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes would haue <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Seate of <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe (as they ſurmiſe) <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi> was neuer at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> neither in the <hi>Temple,</hi> nor in any part of the country that was neare about it: why then the Chayre of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> here ſpake of, was nothing elſe but the doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which hee hadde formerly taught and left vnto them, and which <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this place willed his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to heare, and likewiſe to followe what the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes</hi> ſayd and taught but not to doe as they did, to followe their ſayinges, but not their doinges: euen ſo likewiſe, <hi>Peters</hi> Seate, <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes, and <hi>Peters</hi> doctrine, are all one and the ſelfe ſame thing: but this doctrine of the preaching of the Goſpell, your Pope hath aboliſhed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the place thereof hee hath ſet vp the preaching of his owne lawes, of his owne decrees, and of his owne traditions: and therefore he ſitteth not on the ſeat of <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16376:11"/>
but in the <hi>Seate</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in the <hi>Chayre</hi> of peſtilence, and for <hi>Peters</hi> comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> it can doe your Pope no good at all, he may well bragge a little of the matter: but it will not ſerue his turne.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ta.</speaker>
               <p>Thus you would conclude that Saint <hi>Peters ſeate,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in nothing more then in the preaching of the Goſpell. And by this you woulde depriue him not onely of his <hi>Patrimony,</hi> but alſo of his <hi>Dignity:</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is little beholding to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> for of him that was called the Prince of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> they would make him to be but <hi>Minimus Apoſtolorum,</hi> but if to preach the Goſpell, be to ſit in <hi>Peters Seate,</hi> was it not <hi>Peter</hi> to whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> eſpecially recommended the feeding of his flocke? And what is meant by the feeding of the ſheepe, but the preaching of the word, and miniſtring of the ſacraments, which as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to <hi>Peter</hi> eſpecially, ſo it remaineth a precept for euer to the Popes that are his ſucceſſors? And was it not to <hi>Peter</hi> againe to whom Chriſt ſayd I haue prayd for thee <hi>Peter</hi> that thy faith might not fayle? what malitious impietie then in <hi>Proteſtantes,</hi> to ſpurne againſt that Principality, that Chriſt himſelfe hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, not onely to <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe, but to the reſt that bee his ſucceſſors in the holy ſea of Rome.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Firſt for this prioritie that papiſtes would ſo faine aſcribe to <hi>Peter</hi> aboue the reſt of the Apoſtles, I ſay our Sauiour Chriſt hath long ſithens determined, when in the 10. of Saint <hi>Markes</hi> Goſpell, hee told them that there ſhoulde bee no precedencie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, nor the one to bee accounted more worthy then the other, and therefore flatly decreed betweene them that hee that would aſpire to be greateſt, the ſame ſhould be leaſt: now for Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> eſteeme him as you pleaſe, chooſe how you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him to be either <hi>Maximus</hi> or <hi>Minimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what blockiſhnes is in papiſts to thinke that becauſe Chriſt commanded <hi>Peter</hi> to feede his flocke, that this precept therefore was giuen but to <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe, as though that commandement to feede the flocke of Chriſt did not belong as farre foorth to all the Apoſtles, as it did to <hi>Peter.</hi> I will tell you Syr <hi>Tady,</hi> there is not ſo ſimple a miniſter in the Church of God (that hath cure of ſoules,) but according to his meaſure, is as ſtraightly tyed to the feeding of Chriſtes flocke, as euer was any Pope of Rome: or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16376:11"/>
as <hi>Peter,</hi> or as <hi>Paul,</hi> or as any other of the twelue Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And now for your Popes, that you ſay are ſucceſſours vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> if wee ſhoulde looke into the foode, what it is they haue diſtributed, and conſider of the diligence they haue vſed in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this precept thus left vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> we ſhould find that in feeding the ſheepe, they haue poyſoned the paſture: they haue infected &amp; corrupted it with the venemous leauen of their owne lawes and traditions, and in ſtead of giuing foode, they haue flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the flocke, they haue made a ſhambles of the ſheepe, &amp; haue murthered and maſſacred the innocent lambes: ſuch hauocke your Popes haue kept amongſt the Saintes of God, and yet they would be accounted to be <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors: but what a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit <hi>Hypocrite</hi> is your Pope, that vnder a ſhew of humility will pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſe himſelfe to be <hi>Seruus ſeruorum,</hi> and yet will take vpon him to controule, and dominere ouer Emperours and Kinges: and becauſe Chriſt hath ſayd, I haue prayd for thee <hi>Peter</hi> that thy faith ſhoulde not fayle, therefore (ſay the papiſtes) the Pope cannot erre, thus they doe wreſt and wrythe holy ſcriptures, to ſerue their fleſhly appetites, and as for Saint Peters <hi>Patrimonie,</hi> Saint Peters <hi>Seate,</hi> Saint Peters <hi>Keyes,</hi> Saint Peters <hi>Power,</hi> Saint Peters <hi>Authoritie,</hi> yea and Saint Peter himſelfe, they are all made props and ſupporters to vphold the Popes pride.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ta.</speaker>
               <p>Why how now <hi>Patricke,</hi> what art thou out of thy wittes, wilt thou impugne ſaint <hi>Peters</hi> authority, or wilt thou denie that he hath abſolute power, both to bind and to looſe, either in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or in earth, as Chriſt himſelfe hath giuen and warranted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>I denie him nothing, but that he had full power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by the preaching of the Goſpel, both to bind &amp; to looſe, to open and to ſhut, and to doe all thinges in as large and ample maner as eyther <hi>Iames,</hi> or <hi>Iohn, Philip,</hi> or <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Apoſtles, whom our Sauiour himſelfe after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, armed with equall authority, when in the 20. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> he ſent them into the world, to preach to all nations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ta.</speaker>
               <p>Thus I perceiue you can be contented that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhoulde march with the reſt of the Apoſtles in equall ranke, but you will not admit him any ſupreame authority.</p>

               <p>What malicious deſpight is this to depriue Saint <hi>Peter</hi> of his principalitie: giue him ſome preheminence for ſhame, if it be but becauſe he was the firſt amongſt the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that confeſſed <hi>Christ</hi> to be the ſonne of <hi>God.</hi>

               <p>It is truth, <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt amongſt the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that confeſſed <hi>Christ</hi> to be the ſonne of God, and ſo he was the firſt againe that denyed his maſter, neither doe wee ſeeke to depryue that bleſſed <hi>Apostle</hi> of any pryoritie that the word of God doth allowe him, but rather to curtall your Idolatrous Pope, who by magnifiyng of <hi>Peter</hi> woulde thereby exalt himſelfe, <hi>Peters</hi> name is vſed but to vpholde his pride: but if you haue no better proofes then theſe to confirme <hi>Peters</hi> greatneſſe, heare what I can ſay in the negatiue, to proue that <hi>Peter</hi> was no greater then the reſt of the <hi>Apostles.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Why then to open the eyes of blind popiſh <hi>Catholikes,</hi> let them looke firſt into the Actes of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> Chap. 8. where the <hi>Apostles</hi> that were at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> vnderſtanding that the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> had receiued the Goſpell of <hi>Christ</hi> by the preaching of <hi>Philip,</hi> they immediately ſent both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confirmation of the <hi>Samaritans:</hi> this argueth that <hi>Peter</hi> had no ſuch iuriſdiction ouer the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> as our papiſtes doe dreame of, for then he could not haue beene ſent, but <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:16376:12"/>
and <hi>Iohn</hi> were ſent, as other priuate perſons, to preach and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the <hi>Samaritans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the eleuenth of the Actes, when <hi>Peter</hi> hadde beene warned by a viſion to goe to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the reſt of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion called him to an account, and after a ſort rebuked <hi>Peter</hi> for entring the houſe of an vncircumciſed perſon, and <hi>Peter</hi> was dri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen in his owne excuſe to recapitulate vnto them the whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the viſion how it appeared vnto him, and was warranted by the ſpirit of God: by this it doth appeare that <hi>Peter</hi> had no ſuperioritie aboue the reſt, but rather argueth an inferiority, then any place of principalitie: we reade how <hi>Paul</hi> againe not onely controled <hi>Peter</hi> about matters of circumciſion, but alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode him to his face, in ſuch ſort as he that ſhould reade ouer the ſecond to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> would thinke that if there were any ſuperioritie amongſt the <hi>Apostles,</hi> it rather belongeth to <hi>Paul</hi> then to <hi>Peter:</hi> but there was no dominering amongſt them, nor one greater then another, but as I haue ſayde beefore, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched all in one equalitie, both in power and authoritie.</p>
               <p>True it is that <hi>Peter</hi> did ſtill ſhew himſelfe to be of a more ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and liuely ſpirit then the reſt, and was more apt and readie both in propounding of queſtions, &amp; in anſwering of demandes, which proceeded ſomtimes of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as when he dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of his maſter, whether it might not ſuffice to forgiue his enemie 7. times, thinking that to forgiue eyght had beene too much.</p>
               <p>Sometimes his readineſſe in anſwering was inſpired by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>God,</hi> as when <hi>Christ</hi> demanded of his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> whom they thought him to be, <hi>Peter</hi> immediately made anſwere, <hi>I ſay thou art the ſonne of the liuing God:</hi> ſometimes againe ouer much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of himſelfe, made him to be ſomewhat too forwarde in his proteſtations, as in the 26. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> where <hi>Christ</hi> expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating with his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> tolde them that this night they ſhoulde all be offended by him, but <hi>Peter</hi> led partly by zeale, and partly by preſumption anſwered, <hi>If all the world be offeded with thee, yet wil not I be offended with thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and yet the very ſame night he denyed him to a poore maid: and in the 16. chap. before, when <hi>Christ</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to his <hi>Diſciples</hi> that he muſt goe vp to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> there to ſuffer many things, <hi>Peter</hi> raſhly aduiſed him to ſhun the place, &amp; not to goe thether at all.</p>
               <p>By theſe and other like places it doth appeare, that as <hi>Peter</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:16376:13"/>
of a more quicke and liuely ſpirite then the reſt of the Apoſtles, ſo he was more foreward then the reſt, eyther to ſpeake or to do any thing as time and place did ſerue, or as he was fitted by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: And as the infirmities not onely of <hi>Peter,</hi> but alſo of many holy men beſides, are regiſtred in the holy ſcriptures, and left vnto vs for our example, ſo wee doe not cite theſe places of any ſpite or malice whereby to impugne Saint Peters <hi>Authoritie,</hi> but rather to make knowne the Popes tyrany, that hath a long time iuggled with the ſcriptures, and hath not onely made Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> a couerture to his pompe and pride: but alſo many times abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the name of the liuing God himſelfe, for where hee begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with this preamble: <hi>In the name of God,</hi> then commonly he contriueth ſome ſeruice to the Deuill.</p>
               <p>To winde vpp all therefore I ſay, that if that bleſſed Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> would arrogate but halfe ſo much to himſelfe as our groſſeheaded papiſtes will attribute to their Pope, hell fire were fitter for him then ſo great glory in the kingdome of heauen.</p>

               <p>For the certainety of them there is none will doubt but heretickes: and now if I ſhould ſpeake but of halfe the <hi>Myracles</hi> that are expreſſed in our <hi>Catholicke</hi> hyſtories, I might eaſely find matter wherewith to begin, but neuer finde time when to make an ende: I will therefore ouerpaſſe our Golden <hi>Legend,</hi> a whole volume of <hi>Miracles</hi> extant in <hi>Folio,</hi> beſides many other that are contained in one holy booke of <hi>Conformities,</hi> where mention is made aſwell of birdes as beaſtes, that came flocking together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> to heare him preach, and howe the <hi>Nighting gales,</hi> and other ſinging birdes, woulde come helpe him to ſing <hi>Maſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but theſe are of an old date, I will therefore come to new matter: what <hi>Myracles</hi> haue beene lately performed by our <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Hall,</hi> ſet downe by <hi>Iustus Lypſius,</hi> a moſt learned Ieſuite, who now but within theſe very few yeares, write two learned Bookes full of <hi>Catholicke</hi> doctrine, in the prayſe of two Images, the one of them called our <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Hall,</hi> the other by the name of our Lady of <hi>Sichem,</hi> both of them the Images of our bleſſed <hi>Lady</hi> the <hi>Virgine Mary:</hi> the which two Images (as <hi>Lypſius</hi> affirmeth) haue performed greater myracles, then the ſcriptures do teſtifie were done by Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>There is mention made of ten ſeuerall perſons that were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in a great extremitie, from the danger of death, but by thinking of our <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Hall.</hi>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:16376:20"/>
Seuen others that were already dead, were reſtored agayne to life, being but layed before her Image: now for curing of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſeaſes, as to make the dumbe to ſpeake, the deafe to heare, the blind to ſee, the lame to goe, they are common things matters of ſmall account, ſhee dooth them with eaſe and great dexterity.</p>
               <p>But amongſt a number of other <hi>Myracles,</hi> I will deliuer one for the comfort of <hi>Falconers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lypſius</hi> confidently reporteth in this foreſaide booke, that an angry diſpoſed <hi>Lord,</hi> would haue hanged his <hi>Falconer</hi> for looſing of his hawke, and when the rope was about his necke, and hee ready to bee executed, hee did but call to his mind our <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Hall,</hi> and at the very inſtant of his thought, the hawke came fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and lighted on his ſhoulders: and ſo ſaued his life.</p>
               <p>I thinke I might weary the wiſeſt man in <hi>Ireland,</hi> if I ſhoulde ſet downe all what <hi>Lypſius</hi> hath reported of theſe two Ladies.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Ta.</speaker>
               <p>This can not bee vnderſtoode of the Image of the true God, for if the Images of Princes may be reuerenced, and no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry committed, much more the Image of God.</p>

               <p>God hath commaunded and that directly that no grauen I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ſhould be made, now if any grauen Image of God might be worſhipped, why might it not bee made, ſince it cannot bee worſhipped before it bee made?</p>

               <p>And ſith without Images we muſt remember the Father that made vs (which cannot be reſembled to any ſimilitude) why ſhould we forget the Sonne that hath redeemed vs, but wee muſt haue an Image at our elbowe, to put vs in remembrance.</p>

               <p>I do aske you Syr <hi>Tady</hi> in the more ceremonious maner, becauſe I haue heard of a madde conceited knight, that was an <hi>Eſſex</hi> man called by the name of Syr <hi>Iohn Raynſforde:</hi> who in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, being in the company of <hi>Edmond Bonner,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who ſuſpecting the knight to be aduerſe to their religion, would needs vrge him to make manifeſt to the world, what hee did beleeue of the bleſſed ſacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: thereby to ſhew himſelfe to be an obedient childe truly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate to the <hi>Catholicke</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>The Knight would giue no other anſwer, but that he beleeued as the Biſhop himſelfe beleeued, and prayed the Biſhop to ſpeak truly what he himſelfe did thinke in the matter.</p>
               <p>To whom the Biſhop anſwered, that he ſhamed not to make free confeſſion of his faith, at all times, and in all places: And to ſatisfie your demande (ſayd the Biſhop) my beleife is that in the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> after the prieſt hath ſpoken the wordes of conſecration, there remayneth no more breade nor wine, but the bleſſed body of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> is there really conteined vnder the formes of bread and wine.</p>
               <p>Very well (ſaid the knight) it is an eaſie matter for a man to be leeue all this: but what elſe what elſe, what doe you thinke more of that bleſſed ſacrament? why (quoth) the Biſhop, what ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:16376:27"/>
I thinke more then I haue already ſayd: I thinke that after the words of conſecration being ſpoken by the prieſt, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth the bleſſed body of <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> fleſh bloud and bone, as he was borne of the virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Knight began in a ceremonious manner to proteſt how his beleife was, that after the prieſt had ſpoken the words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration: <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum,</hi> that vnder the formes of bread and wine, <hi>Christ</hi> was there remaining, in a ſuite of Ruſſet Satine, a velvit Cap, and a feather on his heade: a Spaniſhe <hi>Coape</hi> on his backe, a payre of ſilke ſtockinges, and a gylt Rapyer &amp; Dagger by his ſide.</p>
               <p>How thinke you now Syr <hi>Tady,</hi> by the knights opinion, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you for my parte, I beleeue the Biſhop and him both alike.</p>

               <p>Nay, what an abſurditie is in you to thinke that <hi>Christ</hi> is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and deuoured by the wicked: <hi>Christ</hi> entereth the ſoule, but not the mouth of man: <hi>Eate you, this is my body, Drinke you, this is my bloud:</hi> theſe ſpeeches cannot be religious, except they bee fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue, for this groſſe conceipt of a carnall eating, was it that offended the <hi>Caperniates</hi> in the ſixt of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet that great fauourer of Popery of</hi> England <hi>Syr</hi> Thomas Moore <hi>that</hi> Bellarmine <hi>ſo much extolles for his wit and learning, doth litterally preſſe thoſe wordes of Chriſt againſt</hi> Iohn Fryth <hi>in this manner following:</hi> The very circumstance of the place in the Goſpell in which our Sauiour ſpeaketh of that ſacrament, may well make open the difference of his ſpeeches in this matter and of all the other: and that as he ſpake all thoſe but in an Allegory, ſo ſpake hee this playnely, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he ſpake of his very body and his very bloud, beſides all Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: For when our Lord ſayde he was a very Vine, and when he ſayd he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16376:27"/>
was a doore, there was none that hearde him, that any thing marueyled thereat: And why, for becauſe they perceiued wel that he ment not that he was a materiall Vine or doore indeed, but when he ſayde that his fleſh was very meate, and his bloud very drinke, and that they ſhoulde not be ſaued, but if they did eate his fleſh, and drinke his bloud, then were they all in ſuch a wonder thereof, that they could not abide. And wherefore, but becauſe they perceiued well by his words, and his manner of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake of his very fleſh and his very bloud.</p>
               <p>Nowe if maiſter <hi>Mores</hi> opinion be true, that the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> lighted on the ſame manner of eating that Chriſt propoſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, then they deſerued rather prayſe then blame: but they miſtooke the wordes of Chriſt, who went about to teach them the ſpirituall eating of his fleſh, and drinking of his bloud, for ſo doth he himſelfe expound his owne words afterwards to his <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> teaching them how they ſhould be both faithful partakers of his fleſh, and rightfull interpreters of his ſpeeches: And as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fathers as haue written of that place, haue ſo vnderſtood it, the which our <hi>Ieſuites</hi> knowing well enough, and are driuen to confeſſe that thoſe wordes were ſpiritually meant, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inforced to flie from that place which <hi>Moore</hi> ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently auoweth for that carnall eating and drinking, and will in no wiſe admit thoſe wordes in the 6. of <hi>Iohn</hi> to appertaine to any thing that was ſpoken by Chriſt at his laſt ſupper, but doe only ſtick as cloſe to their <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> as the Cuckoe to her ſonge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pope Innocent,</hi> vnderſtanding that place of the ſixt of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as that great clarke ſpoken of before <hi>Moore</hi> had done: cauſed yong children and infants to receiue the ſacrament; And of this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall minde were many other Biſhops a long time, yet afterwards looking more ſpiritually vppon the matter, they confeſſed their errour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saint</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>giuing a certaine rule how wee ſhould knowe the tropes, figures, allegories, and phraſes of the ſcriptures, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this place of the 6. of</hi> Iohn, <hi>out of all doubt and queſtion: his wordes be theſe:</hi> When ſoeuer the Scripture, or Chriſt ſeemeth to commaund any foule or wicked thing, then muſt that text be taken fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuely: that is as it is a phraſe, allegory, and maner of ſpeaking, and muſt be vnderſtood ſpiritually, and not after the letter. Except (ſayth Christ) you eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his blood, yee
<pb facs="tcp:16376:28"/>
ſhall haue no life in you: hee ſeemeth (ſayth Saint Auguſtine) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund a foule and wicked thing, it is therefore a figure, commaunding vs to be partakers of his paſſion, and ſweetely and profitably, to print in our mind, that his fleſh was crucified, and wounded for vs.</p>

               <p>I will firſt begin with that great and learned Clarke <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus,</hi> who did confidently affirme, that Chriſt is preſent in the ſacrament to the mouth and teeth of the receiuer, but hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth with <hi>Hugo That we must ſeeke no longer for a corporal preſence then whilst wee are achamming of him in our mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So long as he doth remaine, <hi>In viſu, &amp; ſapore,</hi> ſo long we haue him, but theſe two will in no wiſe permit, that hee ſhould be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the ſtomacke: but this is enough, they both of them ac, knowledge a reall preſence to the mouth and teeth: but nowe comes <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> &amp; he affirmeth flatly, that he is no leſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the ſtomacke, then he is in the mouth: marry whether he goes downe to the belly or noe, he ſtands in doubt, becauſe of the diuerſitie of opinions that are holden: and yet he liketh not, <hi>That the body of Christ ſhould go into the belly of a mouſe, or be caſt forth by the drought.</hi> And heere hee ſheweth a Catholicke reaſon why: <hi>Becauſe the eares of well diſpoſed perſons would abhorre that: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, and Infidels would iest at it, and laugh vs to ſcorne that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it:</hi> But <hi>Alexander de Hales,</hi> in deſpight of heretickes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels both, doth confidently affirme that: <hi>if a dogg or a hogg ſhould eate the wholl conſecrated Host, is no cauſe (ſayth he) but the Lordes body ſhould goe there withall into the belly of that dogg or hogg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now amongſt the reſt bleſſed</hi> Thomas Aquinas <hi>that holy Saint, doth ſharpely reproue thoſe that thinke contrary:</hi> Some haue ſayd <hi>(ſayth he)</hi> that as ſoone as the ſacrament is taken of a mouſe, or a dog, straight way the body &amp; blood of Christ doth ceaſe to be there, but this is a derogation to the truth of this Sacrament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>But tell mee truth Syr <hi>Tady</hi> haue you not wronged thoſe Authors, that you haue heere named, haue you cited their words no other wiſe then they themſelues haue ſet them downe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ta.</speaker>
               <p>Now God and our bleſſed Lady defend that I ſhoulde ſo iniurie them, it were a ſhame for mee to belie them, their owne workes are extant and to bee ſeene, and there are a huge ſwarme of others, a wholl ſect of <hi>Thomistes</hi> that doe vphold all theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, enough to make all the proteſtants that be in Ireland to bluſh, but that they are paſt ſhame.</p>
               <p>But amongſt the reſt, and for the better credit to the cauſe: <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Petrus de ṗludo,</hi> ioyned both together affirming that the body of Chriſt, may not onely bee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16376:29"/>
eaten of a mouſe, but alſo it may be vomited vp by the mouth, and purged downe to the draught, theſe bee their owne wordes.</p>
               <p>Therefore the body and bloud of Christ remayne in the belly, or sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, or vomit, or in whatſoeuer courſe of nature: ſo long as the ſhews of bread and wine remaine, &amp; if they be vomitted, or purged before they be altered (as ſometimes with thoſe that are troubled with the flux) euen there is the body of Chriſt.</p>

               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>O peace Syr <hi>Tady</hi> no more for the ſhame of your ſelfe, &amp; of all the papiſtes in the worlde, bee theſe the nuttes you haue to cracke? O loathſome ſtuffe vnfitte to be ſpoken of: mine cares doe glow to heare theſe groſſe and barbarous repetitions: is this the reall preſence that you ſo much ſtriue for? are theſe the learned authorities, which you ſo highly extoll, call you theſe Saintes that doe teach ſuch filthy and loathſome diuinitie? no maruel though you account traytors for <hi>martyrs</hi> when your <hi>Pope</hi> hath ſuch cunning to make Saints of blaſphemers.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ta.</speaker>
               <p>I tell thee true, that ſome of theſe that I haue named are Saints Canonized by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for the diuinitie they haue taught and ſpread, if it were not ſound, religious and holy, doe you thinke it could paſſe as it doth, ratified confirmed and approued by the mother Church, ſo many yeares vncorrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or vncontrould?</p>
               <p>But I cannot blame ye though you bluſh, you may well bee aſhamed to ſee our holy <hi>Maſſe,</hi> that ſo many heretickes doe ſeeke to impugne, howe it is eſtabliſhed vpholden and fortified, by no meane nor ſimple authoritie I warrant yee.</p>
