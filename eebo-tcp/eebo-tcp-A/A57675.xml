            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56335:9"/>
here is accompanied with errour, as the light with shades; therefore I find that this your Work, of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bodies, and of the Soules immortality, hath some passages in it <hi>Heterodoxall,</hi> and not consonant to the principles of Divinity and Philosophy, which have drawne from mee these sudden Observations (for I have here neither time, books, nor opportunitie to enlarge my selfe) in which I promise both brevity and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, suffering no other language to passe from mee, but such as may beseem both your worth, and my ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; for my end is not to wound your reputation, but to vindicate the truth.</p>
               <p>The first mistake I meet with is [<hi>That words expresse</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 1. Pag. 2. cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>things only according to the pictures we make of them in our thoughts, and not as the things are in their proper natures.</hi>] But if our words expresse not the things which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in our minds, as they are in their owne natures, then our conceptions are erroneous, and our words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper or false: and if there be not an <hi>adequation</hi> of our conceptions with the things we conceive, there can be no <hi>metaphysicall</hi> truth in us; which consisteth in the agreement of our thoughts with the things, as <hi>ethicall</hi> truth doth in the consent of our words to our thoughts. Our conceptions are our internall words which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent reall things, and our externall words represent these conceptions, and, by consequence, they expresse things as they are in their natures: So <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise</hi> gave names to the creatures according to their natures, and so have wise men ever since. The <hi>Latines</hi> call the sea <hi>mare, quasi amarum,</hi> from its saltnesse or bitternesse, for it is so in its owne nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, [<hi>You define quantity to be nothing else but the</hi>

When the fire warmes the water, it makes a change in the water, by expelling a positive quality, but when the Sun illuminates the aire, there is no change made in the aire, because no positive quality is expelled; darknesse being a meere privation. 10. The light of the Sun in the <hi>aire</hi> and in the <hi>Sun,</hi> is the same light; but if it be fire in the <hi>aire,</hi> much more must it be fire in the <hi>Sun:</hi> No wonder then if <hi>Icarus</hi> his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xen wings melted, flying so neere the Sun.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56335:19"/>
castles, if these <hi>atomes</hi> did not put to their shoulders. What <hi>Hercules</hi> is able to resist such <hi>Pigmies?</hi> but wee, who have been bred in the <hi>peripatetick</hi> schooles, at the feet of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> find the maine cause of projection to be the qualitie or force of the <hi>projicient</hi> impressed upon the bodie projected; as, the force of the gun-powder-fire impressed in the bullet, carries it thorow the aire: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it more impossible for this impressed force and adventitious qualitie, to carry a bullet <hi>violently,</hi> then for the intrinsecall qualities of gravitie and levitie, to carry bodies to their owne places <hi>naturally.</hi> The <hi>generator</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth a qualitie of gravitie in the stone, to move na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to its owne place: the <hi>projicient</hi> impresseth the qualitie of projection in the same stone, to move violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from its place. If you aske why the stone returnes at last to its owne motion downward, and continues not flying in the aire; the reason is, because the aire makes resistance, which at length weakens the impressed force; so that this, growing weaker then the resistance, yeelds, and the stone falls downe. Neither is it reasonable, that an <hi>extrinsecall</hi> qualitie should have that continuance, as a qualitie that is <hi>naturall,</hi> which cannot receive any muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, except there be a change in the first qualities, whose commixtion, gravitie and levitie naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; but the force of the projicient makes no such change in the first qualities of the bodie projected. Neither doth the stone lose its gravitie whilst it flies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but hath it only suspended, while the projicients impression lasts: when this is spent, downe falls the stone againe, shewing the same gravitie it had before. If any say, that this <hi>impulse</hi> is contrary to the inclination of the bodie impelled, I answer, 'Tis contrary to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to locall motion, but not to any inclination
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56335:20"/>
the stone might have to the active quality of levity, which is not in the stone; levity then expells gravity, but projection doth not. This impulse then is an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall forme, and, in respect of the <hi>impression,</hi> it is in the third species of Quality; but as this impression inclineth the stone to motion, it is a naturall faculty in the second species of Quality; I say naturall; not as being the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall forme, or the property flowing from thence; but because it moves like the naturall forme, though not to the same place; and because the stone in which the impression is made, is a naturall <hi>subject,</hi> and the projici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is a naturall <hi>agent.</hi> You see then that this doctrine of impression is no shift, as you call it; but it is a shift to make <hi>Atomes</hi> carry a Canon bullet so farre in the aire; for as the aire it selfe is passive, having no other motion in projection, but what it receives from the projicient, even so be your Atomes (if any such were) which are dispersed by the wind and force of the bullet.</p>

Thirdly, how it comes that load-stones are found in <hi>Macedonia, Spaine, Bohemia, Germany,</hi> and other Northern places. Did the <hi>atomes</hi> in their Southern progresse stay there, being weary of so long a journie, and plant <hi>colonies</hi> neer home? Or were they sent back by the heat which brought them thence?

pierce so deep into the earth?

disposeth the matter, introduceth the forme: The fire warmes by its heat. What's the reason that you can cut downe a tree with an axe, which a childe cannot doe with a woodden dagger? 'tis because you have the qualities of strength and skill, which the childe wants; and the axe hath the qualities of strength and sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which are wanting in the woodden dagger. Your reasons, by which you prove your assertion, are weak, <hi>viz. [Because a greater load-stone hath more effect then a lesser.]</hi> A greater fire heats more then a lesser; is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heat no qualitie? Or must the same degree of heat be in a little fire that is in a greater? The qualitie encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and decreaseth, according to the quantitie of the subject. Secondly, [<hi>A load-stone giveth lesse force to a long iron then to a short one.</hi>] So the fire warmeth more at a neer, then at a remoter distance: Naturall agents work not <hi>in distans.</hi> Will you deny your facultie of seeing to be a qualitie, because you can see better neer at hand, then at too remote a distance? Thirdly, [<hi>The longer an iron is in touching, the greater vertue it getteth.</hi>] Fourthly, [<hi>An iron or load-stone may lose their vertue, either by long lying, or by fire.</hi>] Will these reasons prove the vertue of the <hi>load-stone</hi> to be a bodie? then vertue, I see, is a body with you, and in the <hi>predicament</hi> of Substance. These your reasons prove the <hi>load-stone</hi> to work by a qualitie, because it hath degrees of more and lesse vertue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may be lost. Is cold no qualitie, because it may be lost in the water? Or is the blacknesse of a mans haire no qualitie, because it may be lost? Or doth the fire consume nothing but bodies?

If odour be a qualitie, it must decay, as the bodie spends in which it is: If odour be a bodie, it cannot continue in its vigour, and be still spending of it selfe; this is a contradiction: Besides, 'its repugnant to sense; for, as the flower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes, so doth the smell: And though there be a power in roots of <hi>vegetables,</hi> to change the advenient juice into their nature, yet there is not the like power in <hi>load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones,</hi> or <hi>salt,</hi> as you will have it, except you will make these also vegetables, and so they must not be called stones and mineralls, but plants rather.

As for the weight of it, which you say encreaseth, I doubt of it: but if it were so as you say, yet that weight is not encreased, by turning the aire into its substance, but rather by the losse and evaporation of the aire, by its long lying: So paper-books grow much heavier, by beating the aire out of the paper.

of the subject in which they are. <hi>Extension</hi> is the essence only of quantitie. If colour then be not a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, but qualitie, how can it be a tactable bodie?

The <hi>organ</hi> is a substance, the <hi>faculty</hi> a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which is properly called <hi>sense,</hi> of which ariseth the

                  <hi>action,</hi> which is properly <hi>sensation.</hi> The forme is the cause of sense, God is the supreme cause of the forme, and consequently of sense too: for, <hi>dans formam, dat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentia ad formam;</hi> and sense is the cause of sensation. And so they hold, that there is in the sense an <hi>action</hi> and a <hi>passion,</hi> but in a different respect; for the passion is in respect of the object, the <hi>species</hi> of which is received by the sense; but <hi>reception</hi> is <hi>passion:</hi> yet in the sense there is an action too, but that's in respect of the soule, working by the sense, its instrument, which it animates, and by it judgeth of those objects which are convenient or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, not only for the bodie, but for the soul too: For the two noblest of the senses were made principally for the soule, that by them she might gaine knowledge; and in the second place for the bodie. Now, out of all that's said, tell us where this <hi>indivisible</hi> power workes upon it selfe; or who holds any such thing. The <hi>power</hi> of the soule in <hi>actuating</hi> the sense, the <hi>power</hi> of the sense in <hi>receiving</hi> the <hi>species,</hi> is not the same power, no more then the power of the soule in moving the hand, and the power of the hand in receiving a blow; the one being an <hi>active,</hi> the other a <hi>passive</hi> power; the one being from the <hi>soule,</hi> the other from the disposition of the matter, whose propertie is to <hi>suffer,</hi> as the formes is to <hi>act:</hi> Therefore wee hold not active and passive parts in the sense, but that the whole sense is passive, in respect of the object; &amp; the whole sense is active, in respect of the soul working in it: So the whole water is <hi>passive,</hi> in regard of the fire which hears it; and it's wholly <hi>active,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the hand which is warmed by it.

I grant, that in every pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion there is some alteration of the naturall motion of the heart; that is, the <hi>systole</hi> and <hi>diastole</hi> is more or lesse: but this alteration is caused by the passion, which is, as I say, the motion of the sensitive appetite, not of the bloud and spirits, but <hi>secondarily</hi> and <hi>accidentally.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, every passion in us is either <hi>morally</hi> good or evill: but the motion of the spirits and bloud about the heart is meerly naturall; and therefore cannot be good or bad <hi>morally.</hi> Fifthly, every passion is not a motion; for <hi>joy,</hi> which is one of the six passions of the <hi>concupiscible</hi> appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, is a rest or acquiescence in the <hi>fruition</hi> of that good, which we desired, but now possesse.

Take away heat, colour, light, levity, and other qualities from the fire in your kitchen, and how shall you know there is fire there? and what will your Cooke say, if you bid him dresse your supper with fire, wanting these qualities? We have no knowledge but by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to which, neither the <hi>forme,</hi> nor the <hi>matter</hi> of things are obvious, but by their qualities, therefore if substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be known to us by their qualities, much more known must the qualities be; according to the old rule, <hi>Propter quod unumquodque est tale,</hi> &amp;c. 2. To bid us prove quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is to bid us prove that fire is hot, and water cold; or to prove that you are a learned Gentleman, a good Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, a wise States-man: and I pray you, are not <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wisedome, goodnesse,</hi> qualities? from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all alterations in the world? do they not from qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities? the substance is still the same. When water which before was cold, is now hot, hath lost neither its matter, nor forme, it is the same water still, onely altered in its quality. Are not you sometimes <hi>angry,</hi> sometimes <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> sometimes <hi>fearefull,</hi> sometimes <hi>bold,</hi> sometimes <hi>sick,</hi> sometimes <hi>healthie?</hi> you are not still <hi>glad,</hi> but sometimes <hi>sad;</hi> what is it in you that is thus altered? not your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor your soule, which are still the same subjects of all these passions: the alterations then are in the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or qualities themselves. I beleeve these entities

are not unknowne to you as you are a man: <hi>Homo es, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani à te nihil alienum puto.</hi> Lastly, if qualities must be proved, then I must prove that there is <hi>motion, action,</hi> and <hi>passion</hi> in the world; but you'l say these need no proofe: so say I, and consequently, neither need we prove, that there are qualities; for if there were not heat in the fire, there could be no calefaction in the water. The perfection of substances consisteth in their <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but take away qualities, you take away all operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by consequence, the <hi>perfection</hi> of substance; nay, you must deny all generation and corruption in nature, if you deny qualities, for by their service the matter is prepared to receive the form, or lose it; and they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable <hi>hand-maids,</hi> waiting on the formes as their <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses,</hi> and ready to performe their commands.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56335:39"/>
                  <hi>Metaphysick;</hi> for you define [<hi>beauty, a composition of parts and colours in due proportion,</hi>] whereas <hi>beauty</hi> is a qualitie, <hi>composition</hi> an action, and <hi>proportion</hi> in the predicament of relation. So when you define [<hi>health a due temper of the humours,</hi>] health is not the temper of humours, but is the <hi>effect</hi> of this temper: For, as sicknesse is an <hi>affection</hi> hurting and hindering our naturall, vitall, and animall actions; so health is an affection, preserving and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining these actions in safetie: but affections are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Neither is [<hi>agility a due proportion of spirits, and strength of sinewes,</hi>] as you define it; for, proportion is a relation, but agilitie a qualitie. Besides, there is in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants a due proportion of spirits, and more strength of sinews then in a Mouse or Weasle, and yet no waies that agilitie. And as bad is your definition of Science, which, you say [<hi>is nothing else but ordered phantasmes,</hi>] whereas I have ordered phantasmes of contingencies, corruptible and individuall things, and yet of these there is no science. Though I have ordered <hi>phantasmes</hi> of the effect, yet, for want of the knowledge of the cause, I have not the science of it; for, <hi>scire est per causas cognoscere.</hi> And, if you take phantasmes for the objects of knowledge, as they are in the phantasie, sure science cannot be phantasmes, no more then the eye can be the colour which it sees: Knowledge or Science, and the thing knowne, are relatives; but these are opposites: therefore not the same. Lastly, <hi>science</hi> is a habit, <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes</hi> are patible qualities, if you speak of the objects in the phantasie; but these are different <hi>species</hi> of qualitie.</p>

absurdities of your owne invention, and of which they never dreamed, and then you laugh at them, comparing them to a boy, that, by adding <hi>Bus,</hi> turned all English words into <hi>Latine.</hi> Thus, <hi>Turnus</hi>-like in the Poet, you fight not against <hi>Aenaeas,</hi> but his Image, or rather your owne imaginations; and you play upon these <hi>Sampsons,</hi> who can easily pull down, with the strength of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, this temple of your large discourse, which you have been so many yeares in building. If you were not a Gentleman, whom, for your good parts, I honour, I could say, that the boy was not so much to blame for <hi>Bus,</hi> as you are for being too <hi>busie</hi> in jeering at such emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men, and at those Maximes which have been so unanimously received by all Universities, and for so many hundred yeares constantly maintained; but your worth and my modestie enjoyne mee silence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine my pen from recrimination.</p>
               <p>But let us see what it is that you so play upon them<note place="margin">Sect. 69.</note> for, [<hi>Because when you aske how a wall is white, they answer, There is an entity, whose essence is whitenesse, in the wall: If you aske againe how whitenesse sticks to the wall, they reply, By meanes of the entity called union. If againe you aske, how one white is like another, they answer, 'Tis done by another entity, whose nature is likenesse.</hi>] Thus you make them very simple and ridiculous, and indeed, no wiser then the boy with his <hi>Bus,</hi> or rather <hi>Bussards</hi> then <hi>Philosophers.</hi> These men (whom you mock) say, that [<hi>praedicare sequitur esse,</hi>] the wall is called white, because it is white; and it is white <hi>in concreto,</hi> because the <hi>Painter</hi> would have it so, by introducing whitenesse the abstract into it. But I will tell you, why whitenesse is in the wall, &amp; other accidents in their subjects; because they cannot <hi>subsist</hi> without them;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56335:40"/>
and they cannot <hi>subsist</hi> without them, because their es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is to <hi>inhere.</hi> If you aske a reason of this their es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, I must leave you, and send you to the Author of nature. If you dislike the terme of entitie to be given to <hi>whitenesse,</hi> and <hi>union,</hi> and <hi>likenesse;</hi> then they must be <hi>non-entities:</hi> for the one or the other they must needs be, seeing there is no <hi>medium</hi> between <hi>entity</hi> and <hi>non-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</hi> But Philosophers are not so childish as you make them, when you will have them say, that whitenesse sticks to the wall by meanes of union; this is to <hi>tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gise,</hi> not to satisfie: they say not then, that union unites whitenesse to the wall, but that <hi>accidents</hi> are united to their <hi>subjects,</hi> as heat to the fire, because without them the substance, whose <hi>ultimate perfection</hi> consists in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, cannot work; nor the accidents, whose <hi>essence</hi> is <hi>inherence,</hi> without their subjects cannot subsist. So wee say, that in mixture the substances are united, not by meanes of union, but of humiditie, which is the <hi>glue</hi> and <hi>cement</hi> in naturall compositions, as drinesse dissolves the union. Againe, one whitenesse is not like another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of likenesse: that's childish; but because nature aimes at unitie, and in similitude there is a kind of unitie. The reason why shee aimes at unitie is, because there is most <hi>entity,</hi> where is most <hi>unity; multiplicity</hi> enclines to <hi>non-entity,</hi> from which nature flies as farre as shee can: and because she aimes at perfection, which consisteth in unitie; therefore she aimes at unitie. And because where there is division, there are parts; now parts being of the whole (which is the same either generically or specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally with the parts) they resemble the whole, and each other in some sort: Or, if you aske mee the reason why two eggs are like each other, I answer, Because they have
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56335:40"/>
the same qualitie. So then the <hi>identity</hi> of the qualitie is the cause or ground of similitude; and so saith <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>

Metaph. cap. 15.</note> qualitie; yet not qualities only, but other entities also are the ground of similitude: The thing generated, and the generator have the same similitude, because they have the same <hi>essentiall forme.</hi> All things that are united in a <hi>specificall</hi> forme, have a specificall similitude; and they have a <hi>genericall</hi> similitude, that have the same <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and so equivocall effects are like their causes. So there is the similitude of <hi>actions, passions, quantities, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, site, &amp;c.</hi> And as the forme, whether <hi>essentiall</hi> or <hi>accidentall,</hi> is the ground of that similitude, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>of participation;</hi> so entitie it selfe is the ground of that which is called the similitude <hi>of proportion.</hi> Thus man is like unto God, because hee is an entitie as God is, but by <hi>participation;</hi> therefore like to him onely by <hi>analogie</hi> and <hi>proportion.</hi> And because the entities of God and of man are not of the same order; therefore God is not like man, no more then you are like your <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> though perhaps your <hi>picture</hi> may be like you. Lastly, [<hi>you will not admit qualities, except we can shew you out of</hi> Aristotle <hi>a</hi> medium <hi>between naturall and logicall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities.</hi>] Then belike you suppose, that wee make qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities neither <hi>naturall</hi> nor <hi>logicall</hi> entities, but some middle between both: but if you were versed in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi> you will find, that <hi>Aristotelians</hi> make qualities <hi>naturall</hi> or reall entities; and therefore place them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in the <hi>predicament,</hi> which is the receptacle of reall entities onely.

Neither indeed is the intellect every way the same as it <hi>apprehends,</hi> and as it's <hi>apprehended:</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends as the <hi>intellect,</hi> it's apprehended as an <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi> object.

Fourthly, Tell us how an horned beast, passing thorow a mans eie, should not hurt it; or a stone thorow a looking-glasse, and not break it: but there must be a breaking of the one, and a hurting of the other, if the very substance of the thing apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is truly and really in the eie or phantasie, or mind of the man apprehending, or in the glasse. Is the very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the seale, or onely the <hi>impression</hi> and <hi>species</hi> of it in the wax?

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56335:42"/>
the received <hi>species,</hi> which of an <hi>abstract</hi> becomes a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,</hi> and which before the reception of the <hi>species</hi> was <hi>intellectus,</hi> but not <hi>informatus,</hi> till they come. Now, if the thing received by the intellect be a substance, then it cannot be one with the intellect, being they are both actuall entities; <hi>Ex duobus in actu non fit unum per se.</hi> Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If the intellect be every thing really which it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands, then by understanding or apprehending a horse, it becomes a horse, and so man must needs be a horse, saith <hi>Scaliger.</hi> Seventhly, If the intellect be essentially<note place="margin">Exerc. 307. 6.</note> the same thing which it apprehends, then the thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended cannot be present or absent without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying of the intellect; but we say accidents may, and therefore the <hi>species</hi> are but accidents, because by their coming and going the intellect is not destroyed. Eightly, There is nothing in the <hi>intellect</hi> which was not before in the <hi>sense;</hi> but if the substance of the fire be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the <hi>chrystalline</hi> humor of your eye, before the <hi>visory spirits</hi> can apprehend, or convey that fire to the <hi>phantasie,</hi> &amp; thence to the <hi>intellect;</hi> either the fire wil burn up the <hi>chrystalline</hi> humour, or the moisture of the humor extinguish the fire, and so the intellect be deprived of its object. Ninthly, Give me the reason why a man seeth that which sometimes he perceiveth not: Our <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> give the reason thus; because, though the <hi>chrystalline</hi> humour suffers in receiving the <hi>species,</hi> yet the <hi>visory spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> act not by apprehending them, because the <hi>phantasie</hi> imployes them about some other object: but this could not be, if the substance of a man or horse be received into the eie; for it were impossible that such a substance could be received into the eye, and not perceived by the spirits in the eye. Lastly, There is a dissimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the thing <hi>apprehended</hi> and the power <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:56335:43"/>
though you deny it: for, if there be no dissimilitude betweene the fire that is in your chimney, and that in your eye, then there must be the same coales, heat, smoak, and quantity, in your eye, that is in the chimney: if it were so, your braines could not avoid conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor your eyes a totall extinction.</p>

                  <hi>but in the apprehension of man: the likenesse that one white hath to another, is onely in man, who, by comparing them, giveth nature and being to respect.</hi>] Then it seems there is no true and reall <hi>respect</hi> or <hi>relation</hi> betweene a father and his son, a master and his servant, a King and his people, but a meere notion in our apprehension; so that if men did not apprehend such notions, there should be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation at all betweene these: So you are no longer a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor can your son be your son, but whilst you are thinking of it; and if you think not of it, nor dreame of it in your sleep, your son hath lost his <hi>filiation,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently his tie of obedience and respect, which he oweth to you. 2. Our Philosophers were unwise men, to place relations in a <hi>predicament,</hi> which is the <hi>series</hi> of <hi>reall entities,</hi> if respects be meere <hi>notions;</hi> and so they ought not to be handled in <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> if they be not reall entities. 3. What think you of that respect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which is betweene the <hi>Creator</hi> and the <hi>creature?</hi> or those relations which are in the persons of the blessed Trinity? are they onely notions, and such as have no subsistence, but in mans apprehension? 4. In relation there is opposition, but opposits differ really. 5. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or relation may be really lost from its subject, and therefore 'tis a reall entity; for when you die, the <hi>relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ceaseth which you now have to your son, or he to you. 6. If all respects be notions, what distinction do
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56335:43"/>
you make betweene those which are called <hi>relata realia,</hi> and <hi>relata rationis?</hi> 7. Relations are so far from being meere notions, that in them there is a two-fold reality: The one, as they are accidentall formes, inherent in their subjects; the other, as they import a respect to another, which is called its <hi>terminus.</hi> Lastly, they are said to be like, which have the same quality; to wit, of white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or such like; but if whitenesse be a reall entity, the likenesse, which is the identity of it, cannot be a noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for <hi>Metaphysick</hi> tels us, that identity is reall: And what will you say of that similitude which <hi>Adam</hi> had with God, or which a regenerated man hath, consisting in righteousnesse and true holinesse? Is this image of God in man, which by us was lost, and now by grace is repaired, a bare notion? then will our happinesse, and joy, and hopes, and religion, consist rather in conceit then in reality:</p>

               <p>[<hi>BEING or a thing (the formall notion of both which is meerly being) is the proper affection of man.</hi>] This <hi>anigma</hi> would trouble <hi>Oedipus,</hi> or <hi>Sphynx</hi> himselfe; for in your margin, by this word <hi>being,</hi> you understand <hi>existence:</hi> But is this the proper affection of man? what becomes of other creatures? have they no <hi>existence?</hi> If they have, then it is not proper to man <hi>quarto modo.</hi> If they have not, then they are but entities in possibility; for <hi>existence</hi> is the actuating and restraining of the <hi>essence</hi> (which in it selfe is indeterminate, and in possibility) to <hi>actuality,</hi> which we call <hi>existence;</hi> therefore existence is not the proper affection of man, but of entity as it is in act, or rather the formality of actuall entity. Besides, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence be the proper affection of man, what shall we say of <hi>Angels,</hi> and other <hi>spirits;</hi> nay, of <hi>God</hi> himselfe?

Is there no <hi>existence</hi> in them?

As likewise that you make [<hi>essence and existence the same</hi>] whereas they are one and the same <hi>in God</hi> onely, but not in the <hi>creatures,</hi> in whom the essence and existence differ: for, whilst a thing is in its <hi>causes,</hi> it hath an <hi>essence;</hi> but no <hi>existence,</hi> till it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by its <hi>causes,</hi> and as it were quit of them.</p>

Being</hi> or existence is the generall affection of entity, so is not the <hi>soule:</hi> the body hath existence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the soule is infused, and when the soule is gone, it hath existence still: the body hath no more existence from the soule, then the soule from the body. 2.

Is creation the end of creation? and the giving of being the end why being is given? what can be more absurd? And wereas <hi>being</hi> is internall and essentiall to the soule,

how can it be the end, which is an externall cause? 3. <hi>Being</hi> is not the patterne or <hi>Idea</hi> of the soule; for <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is intrinsecall to the soule, so is not the patterne or <hi>Idea,</hi> but extrinsecall: As, the <hi>Idea</hi> or patterne of a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is in the mind of the builder, but not in the house which is built: and if <hi>being</hi> is the end of the soule, how can it be the <hi>Idea?</hi> for the end excites the action of the agent, but the <hi>Idea</hi> determinates that action; and these are very different.</p>

Now, the <hi>object</hi> of the <hi>intellect</hi> is finite; for nature acknowledgeth no <hi>infinitum actu.</hi> Infinitenesse by succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion there is, and so she may know infinite things, that is, one thing after another <hi>in infinitum;</hi> for she knoweth not so much, but she may know more: yet she knoweth not infinite things <hi>actually</hi> or <hi>habitually,</hi> because actually

at the same time she knoweth that only which hath one <hi>species;</hi> but infinitenesse hath not one <hi>species.</hi> Hence it is, that shee knoweth in infinitenesse one part after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and so, wee know not God in this life, because there is no <hi>proportion</hi> between his actuall infinitenesse, and our finite understandings.

               <p>You say [<hi>that those Philosophers, who search into nature, are called Mathematicians.</hi>] They are so by you, but by whom else are they so called? They use to be termed <hi>Physici,</hi> naturall <hi>Philosophers;</hi> but for Mathematicians, they consider not nature at all, neither the matter, nor the forme of things, but bare accidents; not as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Philosopher,</hi> (who handles them as <hi>affections</hi> of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodies) but as they are abstracted from all <hi>sensible</hi> matter: So the <hi>Geometrician</hi> considereth continued quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, the <hi>Arithmetician</hi> discrete quantities or numbers, <hi>Astronomers</hi> motions and measures of celestiall bodies, <hi>Opticks</hi> light and shadowes, <hi>Musicians</hi> sounds.</p>

                  <hi>cometh from some other thing without them. The soule can move, without receiving her motion from abroad.</hi>] First, all life consisteth not in motion: for, there is life in <hi>spirits,</hi> without motion; so there is in bodies too: In <hi>Dormise</hi> and other sleeping creatures in Winter, in trees at the same season, in women that are troubled with <hi>histerica passio,</hi> they have life, and yet no motion at all. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>life</hi> consisteth not in <hi>motion;</hi> for it is not the <hi>action,</hi> but the <hi>act</hi> of the soule; not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in <hi>union;</hi> but this is rather rest then motion. Life is not in the categorie of action. From life proceed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers actions: as <hi>understanding, sensation, motion, nutrition, generation;</hi> but <hi>actionis non est actio.</hi> It's true, that life is manifested by motion; but it consisteth not in motion: for the foule, being separated from the bodie, liveth, but moveth not. Thirdly, all motions of bodies come not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56335:47"/>
from without; for the forme is the cause of motion, but the forme is not an <hi>externall</hi> cause. Though your hand, in flinging up a stone, be an externall mover, yet when the stone falls downward, it is moved <hi>internally,</hi> by its owne forme. What externall mover is that which moveth the <hi>heart,</hi> even when it is <hi>separated</hi> from the rest of the bodie? Fourthly, the soule moveth not, but by receiving her motion from abroad: for, as all things have their formes from the first cause; so from the same cause they have their motion, which followes the forme, <hi>dans formam, dat consequentia:</hi> therefore the Apostle tells us, it is in God wee live, and move, and have our being.</p>

The essence of every thing is <hi>indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> but the soule is the essence of the living creature, and the essence of the thing is the <hi>perfection</hi> of it. A <hi>negative imperfection</hi> there is in the <hi>creature,</hi> compared to the <hi>Creator:</hi> so in mens <hi>soules,</hi> compared to <hi>Angels;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have not these <hi>perfections:</hi> nor are they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of them in that estate they are now in, except their <hi>species</hi> be altered; and yet the soules are perfect in their <hi>owne kind:</hi> for, <hi>perfectum est, cui nihil deest.</hi> Thus a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> is a perfect <hi>stone,</hi> though it hath not the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>man.</hi> But a <hi>privative imperfection</hi> is not in any

soule, because there is nothing wanting that ought to be in the soule (I speak here of naturall faculties, not of supernaturall grace) if there be some failing or defect in the <hi>organs,</hi> by which the soule worketh, that imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to no more to be imputed to the soule, then want of skill to an expert <hi>Musician,</hi> because his <hi>Lute</hi> is out of tune. Secondly, when you call [<hi>the soule a knowledge, an art, a rule,</hi>] you make the soule an accident, or a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of accidents; and so, you are more injurious to the soule then <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> who beleeved it to be nothing else but a <hi>celestiall heat.</hi> Thirdly, what you meane by [<hi>an imperfect soule, which</hi> (you say) <hi>is the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of an Idea,</hi>] I know not. Fourthly, neither can I tell [<hi>how some part of our thoughts are corporeall, and some spirituall,</hi>] seeing they are actions, and accidents of the soule. Fifthly, if there be no accidents in the soule, then there be no <hi>habits,</hi> nor <hi>actions,</hi> nor intelligible <hi>species</hi> in her; for these are meere accidents, but such are in every soule, or else you must deny, that there is either know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or wisdome, goodnesse or evill in the soule. 'Tis true, there are not <hi>materiall</hi> accidents in her, because she is free from <hi>materiality;</hi> yet, in that she is not a pure <hi>act,</hi> as God is, there is in her a <hi>potentiality,</hi> whence arise these spirituall and immateriall accidents which be in her.</p>

to the bodie contained: so cannot a bodie be separated from its forme, without its destruction. And if <hi>place</hi> were either matter or forme, there would be no <hi>motion</hi> to a place; for, bodies <hi>move</hi> to their place, because they are not in it; they <hi>move</hi> to enjoy that they want: but bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies having and enjoying already their matter and form, cannot move to <hi>have</hi> or <hi>enjoy</hi> them; therefore place is not a bodie, but the <hi>superficies</hi> of an ambient bodie, or rather the <hi>concavity</hi> of that <hi>superficies.</hi> Secondly, it is no absurditie from the <hi>existence</hi> of a thing, to prove the <hi>ubiety</hi> of it; for whatsoever is, must necessarily be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, except God, whose <hi>centre</hi> is every-where, his <hi>circumference</hi> no-where. And though <hi>spirits</hi> are not in a place, by way of <hi>circumscription,</hi> as bodies are, whose <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities</hi> fill the <hi>vacuity</hi> of the containing <hi>superficies;</hi> yet they are in their <hi>ubi,</hi> by way of definition or designati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that is, whilst they are here, they are not there: whilst the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> is with the <hi>Virgin</hi> in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, hee is not the same time in heaven; and whilst our soules are here present in their bodies, they are absent from the Lord, saith the <hi>Apostle.</hi> And though <hi>Angels</hi> and our soules are in bodies, as in their <hi>ubi,</hi> yet they are not there as in a <hi>place;</hi> for neither is there any <hi>dilatation</hi> nor <hi>condensation</hi> of the bodies upon their entering in, no more then there is of the aire in your chamber upon the shining of the <hi>Sun</hi> beams in it: Or, if they be in a place, they are not there by any <hi>quantitative,</hi> but by a <hi>virtuall</hi> contact. Thirdly, you make it [<hi>the eminent property of a soule to be no-where, and yet every-where.</hi>] But if the soule be no-where, it is <hi>nothing;</hi> and if every-where, it is <hi>God,</hi> whose property it is indeed to be every-where, by his <hi>essence, power,</hi> and <hi>providence:</hi> but how the soule can be every-where, and yet no-where, is one of your <hi>riddles.</hi> I

think you have read that passage in <hi>Seneca, Nusquam est, qui ubique est.</hi> But, indeed, neither are the soules no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, nor are they every-where; not <hi>no-where,</hi> for <hi>ubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> is so necessary to created <hi>entities,</hi> that (like <hi>Hippoer ates</hi> twins) they live and die together: <hi>Tolle spatia corporibus, &amp; nusquam erunt, &amp; qui a nusquam erant, omnino non erant.</hi> What S. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks there of bodies, must be also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood<note place="margin">Epist. 57.</note> of spirits; for, no reason can be given why spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits should have more priviledge to exist without their <hi>Ubi,</hi> then bodies have to exist without their <hi>place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Now, time is the <hi>measure</hi> of motion, but not of <hi>celestiall</hi> motion: for time, being the affection of that motion, must needs be after it; but a

measure is naturally before the thing measured; and the cause is the measure rather of the effect, then the effect can be of the cause, saith <hi>Scaliger:</hi> Therefore, as the<note place="margin">Exerc. 352. 2.</note> first bodie is the <hi>measure</hi> of other bodies, so is the first motion the <hi>measure</hi> of other motions. And nature by <hi>motion</hi> measureth time, because by <hi>motion</hi> shee begets time; but wee make time to measure motion, when wee say, so many degrees of the <hi>equinoctiall</hi> have moved in such a time. Againe, <hi>time</hi> cannot be <hi>motion,</hi> because <hi>time</hi> is the same every-where, but <hi>motion</hi> is not the same: one time is not swifter or slower then another, but one motion is swifter or slower then another motion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it is a received opinion among <hi>Divines,</hi> that the <hi>motion</hi> of heaven shall cease after the <hi>resurrection,</hi> being the motion of the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> is a part of that vanitie, to which the creature is subject; and of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there shall be then no use, either for <hi>distinction</hi> of times and seasons, or for <hi>generation, corruption,</hi> and <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of sublunary bodies: but though this motion shall cease, yet time shall not cease, except it be that which is caused by their <hi>motion,</hi> to wit, <hi>houres, dayes, yeares, &amp;c.</hi> But that time, which consisteth in the <hi>succession</hi> of dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or motion of any other thing, whether it be of our bodies, or of our thoughts, that <hi>time,</hi> I say, shall not cease.

And though in respect of <hi>indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> and permanencie, they will have this their <hi>duration</hi> to be called, not <hi>tempus,</hi> but <hi>aevum;</hi> yet they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be in <hi>discrete</hi> time, in regard of their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive operations; and they admit, that their <hi>aevum</hi> is <hi>virtually</hi> divisible, having its <hi>succession,</hi> as it is co-existent with our time: And therefore the duration of Angels and separated soules is greater this yeare, then it was an <hi>hundred,</hi> or a <hi>thousand</hi> yeares ago, because they have been <hi>co-existent</hi> to a longer time.

Spirits may dwell in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but that bodies should reside in spirits, I have not heard till now. Sixthly, neither doe you tell us a reason why these your little bodies should forsake the soule upon her departure, and goe with the bodie.

Pag. 430. c. 10.</note> you tell us, [<hi>That separated soules doe enjoy their knowledge, without the help of externall objects, phantasmes, instruments, or any other helps, having all things requisite in themselves.</hi>] This is to deifie soules, and to elevate them above the pitch of <hi>created entities.</hi> For the <hi>Angels</hi> themselves have not such an eminent knowledge, in that they stand in need of helps; both <hi>externall,</hi> to wit, that <hi>supreme light,</hi> and cleere looking-glasse of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> in which they see all things; as also of the <hi>innate species</hi> or <hi>idea,</hi> both of <hi>universalities</hi> and of <hi>singularities,</hi> without which they can have no knowledge: therefore <hi>à fortiori,</hi> if <hi>Angels</hi> stand in need of such helps, much more must departed soules. Secondly, memorie remaines in departed soules, but <hi>memory</hi> or recordation is by help of the <hi>species</hi> laid up in the mind, to the understanding of which, when the mind applies it selfe, this is called <hi>recordation.</hi> Thirdly, though the intelligible <hi>species</hi> depend from the senses and phantasie in their <hi>fieri,</hi> or being, yet they have no
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56335:51"/>
dependence from them in their <hi>conservation.</hi> For the sensible <hi>species</hi> in sleepe serve the <hi>phantasie,</hi> though the <hi>common sense,</hi> and all the outward, are bound up, and as it were dead. Fourthly, in <hi>Angels</hi> and departed <hi>soules</hi> there are divers habits both of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> yea, of <hi>tongues</hi> also in respect of entitie, though there be no use nor exercise (but after a spirituall way) of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: now habits are the <hi>causes</hi> of action, and in vaine should they be left in the soule, if she by them did not worke, and actually understand: neither can the effect, to wit, <hi>actuall</hi> understanding, subsist without its cause, which is the <hi>habit;</hi> for this is such an effect as depends in its <hi>conservation</hi> from the cause. Fiftly, understanding, and the manner of understanding accompany the nature of the soule, but the nature of the soule is the same here and hereafter, therefore the manner of understanding must be the same, to wit, by the <hi>species.</hi> Sixtly, Whereas the soules departed do <hi>specifically</hi> differ from the <hi>Angels,</hi> they must have a different manner of understanding, to wit, by <hi>discourse:</hi> but this way needs help, not of the <hi>phantasme</hi> or <hi>senses,</hi> (being all commerce with the body is taken away) but of the <hi>species.</hi> Hence then it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that departed soules stand in need of <hi>helps,</hi> and of <hi>objects</hi> of their understanding, and that they have not all things requisite in themselves: which objects are <hi>externall</hi> in respect of their essence, though the <hi>species</hi> be inherent or adherent to the soules: much more externall are these objects which they see in God, although God himselfe is not intelligible by any <hi>species,</hi> by reason of his <hi>immensity;</hi> neither doth the soule understand it selfe by any <hi>species,</hi> nor doth she know (except by revelation) what is done or doing here on earth; which she must needs know, if she had all things requisite for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

It must then be a spirituall power that must worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a spirit: the passive intellect is <hi>rasa tabula,</hi> like cleane paper, having no innate <hi>species,</hi> or images of objects in it selfe, but what it receiveth from the active intellect; so that the phantasie helps the understanding onely <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positivè,</hi> not <hi>efficienter,</hi> being rather the <hi>materiall</hi> then <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> cause of understanding, furnishing those <hi>species</hi> which the <hi>active intellect</hi> refineth, and impresseth in the <hi>passive.</hi> If you should ask, whether our understanding is an <hi>action,</hi> or a <hi>passion,</hi> I answer, that it consists in both, for not only doth it <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>intelligible species,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>operats</hi> upon them. And this is that action of the soule which you deny: and what do you talke of [<hi>letting our phantasmes beat at our common sense?</hi>] The <hi>phantasmes</hi> will

beat whether you will or no. If you will not beleeve me, beleeve your owne <hi>dreames</hi> in sleep: I suppose your <hi>phantasmes</hi> then beat, when you could be content they would spare their labour, and be quieter. But so long as the spirits do make their intercourse betweene the <hi>phantasie</hi> and the <hi>common sense,</hi> there will be an agitation and beating of the <hi>phantasmes.</hi> But it seemes, you take the soule and common sense for the same thing, when you say, [<hi>that to let the phantasmes beat upon the common sense, is to let them work upon the soule.</hi>] They may beat upon the one, and not work upon the other; for the soul suffers not but by it selfe, and her suffering is <hi>perfective,</hi> not <hi>destructive,</hi> as that of the matter is. But she doth not worke upon, or deduce her selfe out of <hi>possibility</hi> into <hi>act,</hi> considered as the same thing, but in respect of her <hi>divers faculties,</hi> whereof the one is the <hi>efficient,</hi> the other the <hi>patient,</hi> and resembles the matter: and if it were not so, we should never actually understand; for what should excite the <hi>passive intellect</hi> to receive the <hi>species</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purified and cleered from <hi>materiality,</hi> and those acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which neither conduce to the essence, nor to the intellection, if there were not an <hi>active power,</hi> altogether <hi>impatible, immateriall, immortall,</hi> using neither corporeall <hi>organs,</hi> nor being mixed with corporeall <hi>senses,</hi> which we call the <hi>active intellect,</hi> and which irradiats &amp; illuminats <hi>intelligible</hi> things, making them <hi>actually</hi> intelligible, which before were <hi>potentially</hi> only, as the light makes these co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours actually <hi>aspectable,</hi> which in the dark were <hi>invisible?</hi>

               <p>[<hi>In the state of a soule exempted from the body there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther action nor passion: which being so, the soule cannot die; for all corruption comes from the action of another thing.</hi>] This is but a weake argument to prove the soules im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; for actions and passions do neither hinder

In departed soules there remaine <hi>loco-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> actions, for they move from the body to their <hi>ubi,</hi> where they remaine till the resurrection, and then they shall move again to their bodies; so the actions of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and will remaine in them.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56335:56"/>
1. the act of the bodie, and principle of all vitall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: 2. being shee is a spirit, not capable of <hi>physicall</hi> matter and quantitie; for she is all in all, and all in every part of the bodie: 3. being shee is not onely the first act of the <hi>organicall</hi> bodie, but also the very agent or effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the bodies <hi>organisation;</hi> therefore shee cannot be materiall, nor hammered out of the matter. 4. If shee were corporeall, either in her being, or in her extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the world could not be perfect or complete: for, as it is made up of creatures, some meerly <hi>spirituall,</hi> some meerly <hi>corporeall;</hi> so, for the complement and perfection of it, there should be some creatures partly <hi>spirituall;</hi> partly <hi>corporeall;</hi> and these are onely men. 5. The effect cannot <hi>exceed</hi> the cause in perfection and eminencie, but the soule farre exceeds the bodie. 6. Man had not been fit to rule over the corporeall creatures, if hee had not a spirituall soule, which onely is capable of reason and dominion; and not the bodily substance. 7. One <hi>species</hi> cannot beget another; but the soule is a <hi>species</hi> of spirits, far different from bodily <hi>species.</hi> 8. There can be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between the superiour and inferiour creatures, but by certaine <hi>media,</hi> by which nature passeth from one extreme to another: therefore it was fit, that the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and corporeall creatures, which are the <hi>extremes,</hi> should be united in that creature which is partly spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, partly corporeall; and this is onely man. 9. If the soule be not meerly spirituall, she cannot enjoy the <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of, nor <hi>friendship</hi> and <hi>familiarity</hi> with God, who is a spirit; nor can she be capable of any spirituall gifts. The Spirit of God cannot dwell but in a spirit; nor can that which is meerly corporeall be like unto God, or see him as he is. 10. If the soules be materiall, they must be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; for we have no other reason to induce us to beleeve
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56335:57"/>
the soules of beasts to be <hi>mortall,</hi> but because they are <hi>materiall,</hi> and educed out of the possibility of the matter. 11. As Christ proved the <hi>truth</hi> of his body, by feeding upon bodily substances, so we prove the <hi>spirituality</hi> of the soule by her food and delights, which are not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall, but spirituall things; for <hi>knowledge, wisdome, truth, vertue, honesty,</hi> which are incorporeall things, are the soules chiefe delights, next to God, in whom only she rests, and with whom onely she is satisfied. <hi>Fecisti</hi>

                  <hi>nos Domine à te, &amp; inquietum est cor nostrum, nisi requiescat in te.</hi> 12. If the soule be of the parents seed, or <hi>conveyed</hi> with it, the seed must needs be man, and so a reasonable creature, and consequently capable, as being man, of eternall joy or paine. 13. The operations of the soule are spirituall, such as be the actions of <hi>understanding</hi> and <hi>will.</hi> The principall then of these operations, which is the soule, cannot be corporeall; for no operation can in dignity of entity exceed the substance whence it ariseth, or the power and facultie of the soule by which she worketh, and which differs from the soule as the property doth from the subject; for as the <hi>potentia</hi> or facultie receiveth its <hi>specification</hi> from the <hi>act,</hi> so the <hi>act</hi> hath all its dignity from the <hi>faculty:</hi> now, if the faculty be spirituall, the soule which is its subject cannot be corporeall, for no <hi>indivisible</hi> quality can be inherent in a <hi>divisible</hi> subject. And as the faculty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its <hi>specification</hi> from the <hi>act,</hi> so doth the <hi>act</hi> from the <hi>object,</hi> and therefore the act by which we understand spirits, must be spirituall: And, though in the act of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> we may <hi>fancie</hi> spirits to be like bodies, yet in the act of <hi>judgement,</hi> we know them to be immateriall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and of a far other nature or essence then bodies; and this act is elevated above the senses, and <hi>abstracts</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:56335:57"/>
the spirituall object from all <hi>sensible conditions.</hi> 14. The soule knows all bodies <hi>celestiall, terrestriall, simple, mixed,</hi> &amp;c. which she doth by receiving these <hi>intelligible</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: but she could not receive them being corporeall, if she were not free from <hi>corporiety</hi> her selfe; for <hi>Intus existens prohibet contrarium:</hi> and she doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them as the senses doe, to wit, <hi>superficially</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but she pierceth into their inmost natures, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out their causes, properties, and effects, and yet higher she riseth above the senses, by <hi>substract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> bodies from <hi>individuation,</hi> and all sensible acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which the senses cannot do; and so she conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them in their <hi>universalities,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality:</hi> but this she could not do, if she were not spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall her selfe. 15. As the <hi>dissolution</hi> or <hi>corruption</hi> of the body dissolveth not the soule, neither doth the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> or <hi>generation</hi> of the body give being to the soul; for if she hath her being from the body, she must decay with the body. 16. <hi>Liberty</hi> of will proves also the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiality</hi> of the soule; for all <hi>materiat</hi> agents worke either by <hi>necessity,</hi> as the <hi>insensitive;</hi> or are led by <hi>instinct,</hi> as the <hi>animat,</hi> except man, who is master of his owne actions, and can <hi>promote</hi> or <hi>stay, suspend,</hi> and <hi>incline</hi> them which way he likes best: and in this he comes neere to the <hi>Angelicall</hi> nature, for, onely <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> have this prerogative of free-will; inferiour creatures want it, because of their <hi>materiality,</hi> which <hi>determinats</hi> them to one kind of <hi>operation,</hi> and so to a necessary working that way; as, for the fire to heat, for a stone to fall down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But such is the <hi>independency,</hi> and <hi>spirituality</hi> of mans soule, that no creature, neither <hi>Heavens, Stars,</hi> nor <hi>Angels,</hi> have any power to command or force mans
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56335:58"/>
will: whereas all materiall entities are subject to <hi>muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by the <hi>influence</hi> and working of the superiour agents, to wit, the <hi>Angels,</hi> and the <hi>Heavens.</hi> 17. If the intellect or the soule were <hi>corporeall,</hi> she should be hurt and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a vehement object, as the senses are; to wit, the eye with too much <hi>light,</hi> the eare with too violent <hi>sounds:</hi> but no <hi>intelligible</hi> object, be it never so strong and powerfull, hurts the <hi>intellect</hi> at all, but perfects it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 18. If the soule were corporeall, it would grow <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>feeble,</hi> and by degrees <hi>decay,</hi> as the body doth by old age; but we see the contrary, for the soule, even when the body is weakest, is most <hi>active,</hi> and by old age rather <hi>perfected</hi> then <hi>weakned.</hi> 19. If the soule were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall, <hi>entity</hi> in its latitude could not be the <hi>adequat</hi> object of the <hi>intellect;</hi> for the <hi>materiall</hi> and <hi>organicall</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are <hi>determinated</hi> by the matter to some particular objects: onely mans understanding, as likewise that of the <hi>Angels,</hi> have entity as entity for their object; that is, both <hi>uncreated</hi> and <hi>created, spirituall</hi> and <hi>corporeall, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall</hi> and <hi>accidentall</hi> entities: which could not be, if the <hi>intellect</hi> were not <hi>spirituall.</hi> 20. That this hath been the doctrine of the <hi>Church,</hi> of <hi>Fathers,</hi> of <hi>Councels,</hi> of <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Poets,</hi> is manifest to them, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in their writings: even <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe was of this opinion, though a few passages in him have caused some to doubt. And the Scriptures, lastly, are plaine in this case, which we will not forbeare to alledge, though we deale with a <hi>Philosopher: Solomon</hi> tels us, that the<note place="margin">Eccles. 12.</note> Spirit returnes to God that gave it. <hi>Christ</hi> commends<note place="margin">Luke 23.</note>

And the more willingly they used to call the soule <hi>corporeall,</hi> because they would beat downe their <hi>heresie,</hi> which held the soule to be a part of the Divine Essence; such as were <hi>Carpocrates, Cerdon,</hi> the <hi>Gnosticks, Manichees,</hi> and <hi>Priscil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianists;</hi> then which <hi>heresie</hi> none can be more pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for it makes God changeable and divisible, and the soule altogether immutable, all-sufficient, eternall, omnipotent: these then are two dangerous rocks wee must avoid, to wit, <hi>deifying</hi> of the soul with the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> and <hi>incorporating</hi> her with the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> He that holdeth the soule to be <hi>Particula divinae aurae,</hi> is a <hi>Manichee;</hi> and he that beleeves the soule to be a <hi>body,</hi> is a <hi>Sadducee:</hi> the one is injurious to <hi>God,</hi> the other to the <hi>soule;</hi> the one is the scholer of <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> the other of <hi>Cleanthes</hi> or <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> but neither of <hi>Christ.</hi>

Fourthly, the <hi>inferiour Intelligences</hi> do not understand so exactly the nature of the <hi>superiour,</hi> as the superiour doe themselves, therefore their knowledge cannot be so great, as that of the <hi>higher Intelligences.</hi> Fiftly, can the lowest <hi>Intelligence</hi> as well understand the nature of that <hi>orbe,</hi> which the <hi>supreme Intelligence</hi> moveth, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that by his <hi>understanding</hi> moveth it?

else it is not equall: besides, you must grant, there may be two infinits; which cannot be, because there must be something in the one which is not in the other, or else they cannot be discriminated; but there can be no <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude</hi> where there is a <hi>defect.</hi>

And how can these be but deceitfull guides in <hi>supernaturall</hi> things, which faile us even in the causes of things meerly <hi>naturall?</hi> Therefore that saying, <hi>Naturam ducem sequi optimum,</hi> is not true in <hi>supernaturall</hi> things, nor altogether sure, as I said, in <hi>naturall.</hi> The <hi>ship</hi> of mans soule will split against the <hi>rocks</hi> of errour, if shee have no better <hi>helme</hi> to steere by, then the helme of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <hi>Reason</hi> is not the <hi>Starre</hi> that will bring us to <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> nor the <hi>cloud</hi> and <hi>firie-pillar</hi> that will conduct us to <hi>Canaan.</hi> We must <hi>deny</hi> our selves, if we follow <hi>Christ.</hi> And what is that, but to abandon <hi>nature,</hi> and naturall <hi>reason</hi> in the things that concerne <hi>Christ?

               <head>The Conclusion, wherein is asserted the <hi>Soules Immortality,</hi> and Objections answered.</head>
               <p>THus, Sir <hi>Kenelme,</hi> I have briefly run over your <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous</hi> Discourses of the <hi>nature of Bodies,</hi> and of the <hi>Soules immortalitie;</hi> in which, though you have shewed much wit and good language, yet your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and descriptions of the Soule are not of that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and validitie (which I have shewed) as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince our understanding, and to vindicate our beliefe in assenting to all your <hi>dictats</hi> in this your laborious Work: therefore give mee leave, without <hi>prejudice</hi> to your paines, to point briefly at such reasons and arguments, as I conceive will be more evincing and pressing, and more prevalent, both with <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> then those which you have imparted to us.</p>
               <p>1. We will first then begin with divine Testimony, which is of greater <hi>authority</hi> then all humane <hi>capacity.</hi> God tells <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 3. that he is the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> by which words our Saviour proves the soules immortalitie, in affirming, that <hi>God</hi> is not the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>dead,</hi> but of the <hi>living, Matth.</hi> 22. and consequently, that these were not dead, but alive in their soules. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. that the <hi>spirit</hi> returnes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56335:62"/>
to God that gave it. The <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us, that <hi>Samuel</hi>'s soule was alive after her separation, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. which place, though it be controverted, whether it was truly <hi>Samuel</hi>'s soule or not; yet that apparition which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> shewes, that they doubted not of the soules immortalitie. <hi>Christ</hi> tells us of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his soule, that was carried by <hi>Angels</hi> into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and the <hi>rich Gluttons</hi> into hell, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. Hee tells us also of that <hi>rich mans</hi> soule, which, after his barnes were full, was to be taken from him, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. But if she perished with the bodie, how could she be taken away? Hee assures <hi>the good thiefe,</hi> that his soule should be with him that night in <hi>Paradise, Luke</hi> 23. And hee will not have us <hi>feare</hi> them that can destroy the bodie, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not kill the soule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. by which he intimates, that the soule is not liable to death, as the bodie is.</p>
               <p>2. Wee prove it by <hi>arguments</hi> grounded on the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi> as first, The soule of <hi>Christ</hi> was immortall, when it was separated: therefore our soules are so. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence is evident, because <hi>Christ</hi> was like to us in all things, except sin: The antecedent no <hi>Christian</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, except he will deny the <hi>hypostaticall</hi> union of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie and the Humanitie, which was not, nor could not be dissolved by death; for the Divinitie was not sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from <hi>Christs</hi> bodie in death, much lesse from his soule, to which it was <hi>immediately</hi> united. 'Tis true, <hi>Christs</hi> bodie died, because the soule was separated, by which the <hi>Divinity</hi> gave life to the bodie, to wit, <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively,</hi> not <hi>formally;</hi> but God, being united immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and principally to the soule, shee could not die. And though God hath not so united our soules to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as he did <hi>Christs,</hi> yet hee is so neerly united to our spirituall soules, being a spirit himselfe, that they cannot
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56335:63"/>
die, except hee should forsake them, which hee will not doe; for he will not leave our soules, nor forsake them, nor suffer them to see <hi>corruption.</hi> Secondly, man was made to the <hi>image</hi> of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. which image consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth partly in <hi>hyperphysicall</hi> graces, as righteousnesse, and true holinesse; and partly in five <hi>physicall</hi> gifts: 1. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, 2. will, 3. dominion, 4. liberty, 5. immortality. Thirdly, mans soule was not <hi>educed</hi> out of the earth and water, as the soules of other creatures were, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>inspired</hi> by God, <hi>Genes.</hi> 1. by which it is plaine, that the soule of man is of a farre more excellent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nature, then the soules of beasts are; and that shee hath immediate dependence from God, not from the bodie: therefore not <hi>mortall.</hi> Fourthly, if the soule die with the bodie, there can be no <hi>resurrection;</hi> and so<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> our hope and faith are in vaine. Now, there can be no <hi>resurrection</hi> of the bodie, if the soule, its forme, be not pre-existent: For how can the soule be re-united to the bodie, or informe it againe, if it be <hi>extinguished</hi> with the bodie? Fifthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Kingdome of <hi>Christ,</hi> the joyes and<note place="margin">Luke 1. Matth. 25.</note> happinesse of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and the torments of the <hi>wicked</hi> are eternall: therefore the soules of men, which are the subjects of <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdome, and the inheritors of joy or paine, cannot be mortall; for what subjects shall this eternall <hi>King</hi> have, or to what end are the rewards and punishments eternall, if the soules, which are the chiefe subjects, and chiefly interessed in these rewards and paines, perish and die? Sixthly, <hi>Moses</hi> shewes, that the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> of heaven were made for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of man, <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 4. which argueth, that man is of a more excellent nature then they. Now, this could not be, if he were not spirituall and immortall in his soule; for in his bodie hee is inferiour to them, in regard
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56335:63"/>
they are incorruptible, and unchangeable substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>3. We prove that the soule is not onely immortall by <hi>Divine</hi> power, but also of her owne <hi>nature.</hi> First, she is made to the <hi>image</hi> of God, but this image, as I have shewed, consisteth not onely in <hi>supernaturall graces,</hi> but also in <hi>naturall powers</hi> and faculties of the soule. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the soule is a <hi>spirit</hi> of her owne <hi>nature,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of her owne nature immortall; for spirits are free from the <hi>prime qualities,</hi> which are the causes of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thirdly, the soule is a <hi>simple uncompounded sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> therefore cannot be corruptible; for, how can that be dissolved which was never compounded? And though <hi>Tertullian</hi> held the materiality, yet he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth<note place="margin">De resur. c. 34.</note> the soules immortality to be <hi>naturall</hi> to her, <hi>Salva erit anima natura sua per immortalitatem.</hi> Fourthly, if the soule were not in her selfe immortall, how should the <hi>Heathen Philosophers</hi> who knew not God, nor the Scriptures, dispute so accurately as they do in defence of her <hi>incorruptibility?</hi> But when I say that the soule is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall by <hi>nature,</hi> my meaning is not that she is the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause</hi> of her owne immortality, or that she is not mortall and dissoluble by <hi>externall power,</hi> for so God is onely immortall, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> sheweth, and as the <hi>sixt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tim. 6. <hi>Sess.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Synod</hi> hath defined, and some <hi>Fathers</hi> have proved; so that the <hi>Angels</hi> in this respect are not immortall: but my meaning is, that the soule is not a subject capable as bodies are, neither hath she in her selfe any <hi>passive power</hi> or possibility of dissolution.</p>
               <p>4. The soules immortality is proved by naturall and morall reasons, thus: 1. If the soule perish, it must be either by <hi>annihilation,</hi> or <hi>dissolution:</hi> not by the first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56335:64"/>
for nothing of its owne <hi>nature</hi> can be annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: God indeed by his <hi>omnipotency</hi> may <hi>annihilate</hi> what he made of nothing, but there is no entity of it selfe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of non-entity, nor any action tending to it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: Neither by the second, for nothing is <hi>dissolved</hi> but what had parts, (<hi>dissolution</hi> being nothing else but the <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> of one part from another) but what is not <hi>compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> hath no parts, and such is the soule, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For she is <hi>independent,</hi> as she is a substance, from any <hi>subject:</hi> as she is a spirit, from any <hi>created substance;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dieth not when the body dieth: for neither is she compounded of essentiall parts, which we call <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme;</hi> nor of <hi>integrall,</hi> which we call <hi>members</hi> or <hi>limbs:</hi> And hence it appeares, that though the soules of beasts may be free from such <hi>compositions,</hi> yet they are not from <hi>dependence</hi> on the body, of which they came, and with which they decay. 2. The soule is a <hi>quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> and of a more excellent nature then the foure <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are; and therefore as she is not of their nature and substance, she cannot be capable of their <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>properties:</hi> but the maine quality and property of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is to be the subjects of generation and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 3. Such as the <hi>operation</hi> of a thing is, such is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whence the operation proceeds, for <hi>operations</hi> are <hi>emanations</hi> of the substance, and flow from thence: but the chiefe operation of the soule, which is <hi>understanding,</hi> is spirituall; therefore the soule cannot be corporeall: for, if the soul were compounded of the elements, these <hi>operations</hi> of the soule must be in the elements; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is in the <hi>compound,</hi> was before in its <hi>principles,</hi> these being their acts, whose principles they are: but <hi>understanding</hi> and <hi>will</hi> were never in the <hi>elements,</hi> nor are
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56335:64"/>
they capable of such operations: and so the soule is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall as she is incorporeall. 4. If the soule may be <hi>annihilated</hi> naturally, then naturally she was <hi>produced</hi> of nothing; but such a <hi>production</hi> is repugnant to the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick</hi> tenents, and so, by consequence, must such an <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation</hi> be. 5. Whatsoever is corruptible, is corrupted or destroyed by a <hi>contrary agent,</hi> for without <hi>contrariety</hi> there can be neither generation nor corruption: But in mans soule there are no <hi>contrarieties,</hi> for she can receive <hi>contrarieties</hi> without <hi>contrariety,</hi> because she receives not contrary formes as they are in their <hi>naturall,</hi> but as they are in their <hi>intentionall</hi> being: Hence it is that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, though they be <hi>compounded,</hi> are not <hi>corruptible,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not subject to <hi>contrarieties.</hi> 6. The <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> by the glimmering light of <hi>Nature,</hi> knew there were some supreme <hi>entities,</hi> by which the <hi>world</hi> was guided, the <hi>wicked</hi> punished, and the <hi>innocent</hi> rewarded; which the Poet acknowledgeth:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Si genus humanum, &amp; mortalia temnitis arma;</l>
                  <l>At sperate deos memores fandi atque nefandi.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But they saw, that for the most part, <hi>wicked men</hi> enjoyed most outward happinesse here, and <hi>good men</hi> were most wronged and oppressed; therefore they beleeved the <hi>soules immortality,</hi> that wicked men might receive their due <hi>punishment,</hi> and good men their <hi>reward,</hi> or else they must confesse that their gods were <hi>unjust.</hi> And as this reason did strongly move them, so it must us also, to beleeve the soules immortality: for it is a <hi>righteous</hi> thing with God, to render vengeance to the <hi>wicked,</hi> and<note place="margin">1 Thes. 1.</note> to you that are <hi>afflicted</hi> peace with us, saith the <hi>Apostle.</hi> 7. It is an undeniable <hi>Maxime, that God and Nature made nothing in vaine;</hi> but if there should be in mans soule
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56335:65"/>
such a <hi>desire,</hi> and so earnest an <hi>affection</hi> to immortality, and yet not enjoy it, that desire which God hath given to her had been in vaine. 8. From what proceeds the <hi>horrour</hi> of <hi>conscience</hi> in wicked men, their <hi>trembling</hi> at the report, and serious thoughts of future judgement? on the other side, the unspeakable <hi>joyes</hi> of good men, their <hi>cheerefulnesse, comforts,</hi> and <hi>alacrity,</hi> even in their paines and afflictions, if they did not <hi>beleeve</hi> the soules immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and that after this life all <hi>teares</hi> should be wiped from their eyes? 9. God made man for some <hi>end,</hi> and that was to enjoy eternall <hi>beatitude,</hi> which consisteth in the enjoyment of himselfe: but if the soule be mortall, man cannot attaine to his <hi>end,</hi> and so God made him to <hi>no end.</hi> 10. In <hi>extasies</hi> and <hi>raptures,</hi> though the body be without sense and motion, and seemes as it were dead; yet the soule is not, but remaines <hi>unperished,</hi> or <hi>unextin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished:</hi> which doth argue her immortality. 11. If the soule were mortall as the body is, she would grow <hi>aged, feeble,</hi> and would <hi>decay,</hi> as the body doth; but we see the quite contrary, for then she is most <hi>active</hi> and <hi>vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> when the body is most <hi>weake</hi> and <hi>decrepit.</hi> 12. If the soule be <hi>corruptible,</hi> she may be separated from her <hi>existence</hi> and being: now this cannot be done, but by the worke of an <hi>externall</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> agent, which is more powerfull then the soule; but no contrary agent <hi>abolisheth</hi> one forme, but by <hi>introducing</hi> another; nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away one existence, but by giving another: for no action tends to a <hi>negative,</hi> but to some thing that is <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> 13. The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by the light of nature, <hi>beleeved</hi> the immortality of the soule; hence sprung the doctrine of <hi>transanimation</hi> among the Pythagoreans, of the <hi>Elysian fields,</hi> and places of torment among the Poets,</p>

Animal. c. 3.</note> to doubt, yet in other places plainly asserts this doctrine so <hi>universally beleeved,</hi> that the soules can subsist by themselves, because they have distinct <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> from the body, and the understanding or <hi>intellect</hi> enters from without into the body; it is void of <hi>passibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and is some <hi>divine thing;</hi> and that the actions of the mind are not <hi>one</hi> with those of the body; and so in the ninth and tenth Chapters of his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> we may see how he affirmes the immortality of the soule, by her desire of <hi>beatitude.</hi> And whereas some think that he held the soule mortall, because he saith, she depends on the <hi>phantasie</hi> in her operation; they are mistaken, for he speaks of the soule as she is united to the body, and so she depends on the <hi>Phantasie;</hi> but yet onely <hi>objectively, instrumentally,</hi> and <hi>occasionally,</hi> as the <hi>Philosophers</hi> speake, and not <hi>efficiently</hi> or <hi>formally;</hi> for it is true, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect receives its <hi>species</hi> from the <hi>phantasie,</hi> and therefore in the body depends <hi>antecedently</hi> from the <hi>phantasie:</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:56335:66"/>
otherwise the Intellect is meerly <hi>inorganicall,</hi> and no waies depending on the <hi>phantasie,</hi> as a proper mover, and of it self, but onely the <hi>passive</hi> Intellect thus depends on the <hi>active,</hi> and the <hi>act</hi> of understanding is altogether <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent:</hi> And so when he sayes, that the <hi>passive</hi> Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect is corruptible, he meanes nothing else but the <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie</hi> or <hi>cogitative faculty,</hi> which, because it is in some sort capable of reason, he cals the <hi>Intellect,</hi> as he cals the <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Intellect</hi> sometimes by the name of <hi>phantasie,</hi> because it is moved by the <hi>superiour</hi> Intellect. And so when he sayes, that <hi>remembrance</hi> and <hi>love</hi> perish in the soule, he meanes that their dependence, the one from the <hi>phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi> the other from the <hi>appetite,</hi> perisheth, because these are corporeall faculties, and perish with the body; but otherwise <hi>recordation</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> in respect of their <hi>entity,</hi> remaine in the soule as in their subject. So likewise when he saith, that the Intellect is in the <hi>possibility</hi> of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he meanes that it is in the possibility of the matter in respect of <hi>introduction,</hi> not of <hi>eduction;</hi> as the matter is capable to receive it, when by a superiour power it is thither <hi>induced.</hi> The soule then is in the <hi>possibility</hi> of the matter by way of <hi>reception,</hi> but not by way of <hi>extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> So likewise, when he sayes, that the <hi>dead</hi> are not <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi> he meanes the <hi>happinesse</hi> of this life, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in <hi>operations</hi> flowing from the <hi>compositum,</hi> of which the soule is not capable. And lastly, when he sayes, that all have <hi>ending</hi> which had <hi>beginning,</hi> he meanes of those things which had beginning by <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> and so it is true: but the soules originall is by <hi>creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of all then that wee have said, it is apparent to any man, who is not a wilfull <hi>Saducee</hi> or <hi>Arabian,</hi> that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56335:66"/>
the soule is every way <hi>incorruptible,</hi> both in respect of <hi>grace,</hi> and in respect of <hi>nature;</hi> both in respect of <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> and <hi>internall</hi> agents, both in respect of <hi>annihilation</hi> and <hi>dissolution.</hi> There is onely an <hi>obedientiall</hi> power of dissolution in the soule, as there is in <hi>Angels,</hi> and in the <hi>heavenly bodies,</hi> by the infinite power of the <hi>Almighty;</hi> and that rather by the <hi>negative act</hi> of his influx, then any <hi>positive act</hi> of resolving that into nothing, which he made of nothing: so that the soule hath no <hi>parts, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> or <hi>causes</hi> in her selfe of <hi>corruption,</hi> nor of <hi>annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Such reasons and arguments I take to be more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, then these far-fetched notions of Sir <hi>Kenelm</hi>'s, which he hath clothed with too many words; whereas <hi>Philosophicall</hi> arguments sort not well with <hi>Rhetoricall</hi> flourishes, and <hi>Tullian</hi> pigments.</p>
               <p>Now let us see what hath of old been, or can of late be objected against this knowne and generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged truth, by the impugners thereof.<note place="margin">Sect 6. Object. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First they say, that the soule is immortall by <hi>grace,</hi> not by <hi>nature:</hi> To which I answer, that shee is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall by both; by <hi>grace,</hi> in that the soule hath her <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> from God, the first and sole <hi>independent</hi> entitie, of whom, and by whom she is what she is, and so by that entitie, as I said, shee may be deprived of that <hi>being,</hi> which of his <hi>bounty</hi> she obtained: for, though she be free from <hi>subject</hi> and <hi>termination,</hi> yet she is not free from the <hi>causality</hi> of the <hi>first agent.</hi> Shee is also immortall by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> in that there is nothing either in her owne, or in the universall created <hi>nature,</hi> that can destroy or dissolve her. Our bodies are destroyed either by <hi>externall</hi> agents, or by <hi>internall;</hi> the <hi>naturall heat</hi> wasting our <hi>radicall moisture,</hi> as a candle that is either wasted by the wind, or by its
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56335:67"/>
owne heat: but in the soule, which is a spirit, there is no such thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they alledge <hi>Solomons</hi> words for them, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 7. Object. 2.</note> 3. 19. where hee saith, There is one end of man and beasts; as man dieth, so doe they. <hi>Answ.</hi> Here is no comparison between mans soule, and that of beasts; but between the <hi>death</hi> of the one, and of the other: so that both are lyable to death and corruption, and to outward <hi>violence,</hi> and inward <hi>distempers,</hi> which procure death in both: and both are so lyable to the law and dominion of death, that from thence there is no redemption or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning by the course of <hi>nature:</hi> So that it's no more possible for man to avoid <hi>death,</hi> or its <hi>dominion,</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, then it is for a beast. Secondly, <hi>Solomon</hi> speakes not this in his owne person, but in the person of the <hi>Atheist,</hi> who will not forgo his earthly pleasures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee beleeves not any heavenly, or any life after this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they would make <hi>Iob</hi> plead for them, when<note place="margin">Sect. 8. Object. 3.</note> he sayes, there is more hope of a tree cut downe, then there is of man, <hi>Iob</hi> 14. <hi>Answ. Iob</hi> speakes not there in his owne person, but in the person of a wicked man. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, though hee did speak this as from himselfe, yet this will not availe our moderne <hi>Saducees;</hi> for, by the course of <hi>nature,</hi> man cannot revive againe, though the tree may sprout again after it is cut: which the Poet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, when he sayes,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Pomifer autumnus fruges effuderit, &amp; mox<note place="margin">Horat. lib. 4. od. 7.</note> Bruma recurret iners:</l>
                  <l>Damna tamen celeres reparant coelestia Lunae. Nos ubi decidimus</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:56335:67"/>Quò pius Aenaeas, quò Tullus dives, &amp; Ancus, Pulvis &amp; umbra sumus.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Thirdly, man shall not returne againe to <hi>live that life,</hi> or to performe those functions which he did in this world, when he lived here: but hence it will not follow, that man shall not be raised by that <hi>power</hi> which gave him being at the first: or, that he shall enjoy no life, because he shall not enjoy this life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they would faine draw in <hi>Austin</hi> to their<note place="margin">Sect. 9. Object. 4.</note> side, because sometimes he doubts of the manner of the soules production, whether it is by <hi>creation</hi> or <hi>traducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Answ.</hi> 'Tis true, that sometimes hee doubted of the <hi>manner</hi> how the soule entered into the bodie, because he doubted of the manner how <hi>originall</hi> sin is propagated: but will this prove, that therefore hee doubted of the soules immortalitie, which hee strongly maintaines throughout all his Workes? And so hee doth also the soules creation and <hi>infusion,</hi> although in a few places he speaks doubtfully of <hi>traduction,</hi> so farre as it hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>originall</hi> fin; which notwithstanding is propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though the soule be <hi>pure</hi> which is infused, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>union</hi> betwixt the soule and the bodie: for ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sin is in the parent, as in the <hi>efficient;</hi> in the seed, as in the <hi>instrument;</hi> in the soule, as in the <hi>subject;</hi> but in the flesh by way of <hi>punishment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or rather indeed the <hi>whole man</hi> is the subject of <hi>originall</hi> sin, which, with the soule, is convayed from the parent to the childe by, and in the seed; but onely <hi>dispositivè,</hi> not <hi>effectivè;</hi> by disposing and preparing the <hi>embryo</hi> to receive the soule, and not by way of <hi>efficiencie,</hi> producing the soule: and so, upon the infusion of a <hi>pure soule</hi> into the prepared and disposed <hi>embryo,</hi> the whole man is made up, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56335:68"/>
the subject of <hi>originall</hi> sin, by reason of the <hi>union</hi> of the soule and corrupted flesh; and in that hee is the <hi>is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue</hi> of such a parent, the <hi>branch</hi> of such a stocke, which hath derived corruption in and by the seed, and fitted or disposed the bodie to receive a soule, though pure in it selfe, yet upon the <hi>union</hi> impure and corrupted, and even in it selfe <hi>actually</hi> void of originall righteousnesse, and <hi>inclinable</hi> or potentially subject to guilt or sin. As a <hi>leprous</hi> father begets a <hi>leprous</hi> son, which <hi>leprosie</hi> is not in the seed <hi>actually,</hi> but <hi>potentially</hi> and <hi>dispositivè;</hi> so the <hi>privation</hi> of righteousness is in the seed <hi>actually,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, or inclination to sin, <hi>dispositivè.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, they tell us, that mans soule cannot conceive<note place="margin">Sect. 10. Object. 5.</note> any thing, yea not a spirit, but under the <hi>notion</hi> of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; therefore shee is corporeall, and consequently <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Answ.</hi> Though shee were <hi>corporeall,</hi> yet is shee not therefore mortall; for, the <hi>Sun, Moone</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> are bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and yet incorruptible. Secondly, though the soul, being in the bodie, understands by the outward <hi>senses</hi> and <hi>phantasie,</hi> yet the act of understanding is <hi>inorgani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> and that not onely when she is <hi>separated,</hi> but while shee is in the bodie: though then in the bodie she stands in need of the <hi>phantasie,</hi> without the bodie shee shall not need it. Thirdly, the soule not onely <hi>understands</hi> bodies under materiall <hi>notions,</hi> but searcheth deeper then any corporeall facultie can do, even into the natures, formes, and abstruse principles of bodies; so that here shee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands the <hi>quiddities</hi> and <hi>essences</hi> of things, which a bodily power cannot doe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, they say, that the soule can suffer, to wit, by<note place="margin">Sect. 11. Object. 6.</note> griefe, paine, &amp;c. therefore shee is corruptible. <hi>Answ.</hi> As the soule is a spirit, so her sufferings are <hi>spirituall:</hi> all
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56335:68"/>
                  <hi>suffering</hi> supposeth not <hi>corruptibilitie,</hi> except it be caused by the prime <hi>elementary qualities,</hi> of which the soule is not capable. Secondly, there are some sufferings so far from being <hi>destructive,</hi> that they are rather <hi>conservative</hi> and <hi>perfective;</hi> such are the motions of the heavens. Thirdly, the soule suffers not, but by her selfe in griefe: for by her owne <hi>agencie</hi> she makes her selfe a <hi>patient;</hi> by her <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>knowledge</hi> of griefe and sorrowes shee grieves and sorrowes, and so becomes a <hi>sufferer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, they tell us, that immaterialitie is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument<note place="margin">Sect. 12. Object. 7.</note> of the soules immortalitie; for spirituall graces, which are infused into us, are immateriall, yet corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Answ.</hi> These graces are <hi>accidents;</hi> we speake of the soule, which is a <hi>substance.</hi> Secondly, these graces are not corrupted by us <hi>physically,</hi> but <hi>metaphorically,</hi> or <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> onely.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, the desire of immortalitie, say they, is the<note place="margin">Sect. 13. Object. 8.</note> affection of the whole man, not of the soule alone, and yet man is mortall: therefore they will not have us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the soules immortalitie, from her desire thereof. <hi>Answ.</hi> Though this desire be <hi>subjectively</hi> in the whole man, yet it is <hi>originally</hi> in the soule. Secondly, it is a good argument to prove, that something is <hi>immortall</hi> in man, though not all, because he so earnestly desires <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</hi> Thirdly, this desire is in man onely, and not in beasts; which shewes, that he, not they, hath an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall soule. Fourthly, though the beasts strive to preserve their <hi>naturall being,</hi> yet man onely aimes at a <hi>supernaturall</hi> being, as having a more <hi>divine</hi> knowledge and appetite then other creatures are capable of. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how much man desires immortalitie, is plaine by the many <hi>pyramides, obelisks, triumphant arches, mausolets,</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:56335:69"/>
                  <hi>brasse,</hi> and <hi>marble statues, prodigious palaces, bookes,</hi> and other monuments; for which who would care, if hee thought his soule should perish with the beasts?</p>
               <p>Ninthly, mans understanding perisheth after death;<note place="margin">Sect. 14. Object. 9.</note> therefore the soule cannot be immortall. <hi>Answ.</hi> Though the <hi>act</hi> of understanding did cease, yet the <hi>power</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, and consequently the soule, the subject of that power. for <hi>actually</hi> wee understand not many things here, by reason of some <hi>defect</hi> in the <hi>organs;</hi> yet the soule ceaseth not therefore to be, nor the <hi>faculty</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to be none. Secondly, the soule doth <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> understand, and more excellently, being separated, then shee did in the bodie; because not onely doth shee retaine the <hi>species</hi> which shee carried out with her, but also shee receiveth an addition of new <hi>species,</hi> by <hi>divine illumination.</hi> Thirdly, though shee understands now by the <hi>phantasie,</hi> yet hereafter, by reason of new illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shee shall need neither <hi>phantasie, externall</hi> object, nor any <hi>corporeall organ.</hi> Fourthly, the knowledge which the soule shall have after death, shall be <hi>naturall</hi> to the soule, though it proceed from God; for he is the author both of naturall and supernaturall light.</p>
               <p>These are the chiefe weapons, by which the <hi>Soules</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Antagonists</hi> strive to wound and kill her; which are of no more <hi>validity</hi> to hurt her, then that dart, which old feeble King <hi>Priamus</hi> flung at <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> was able to hurt him:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>—telum imbelle sine ictu</l>
                  <l>Conjecit, summo quod protinus aere pependit.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>These arguments make a <hi>sound,</hi> but have no <hi>strength:</hi> These <hi>Arabian Pigmies</hi> will never be able with such <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines</hi> to overthrow the soules <hi>immortalitie,</hi> which is the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56335:69"/>
strong Fort and <hi>Citadell</hi> of every good Christian in his afflictions. Let there be but way given to this doctrine of the <hi>Saducees,</hi> wee must bid farewell to <hi>lawes</hi> and <hi>civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> nay, to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Christianity.</hi> We must bid adieu to <hi>vertuous actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and to all <hi>spirituall comforts. Christ</hi> died, the <hi>Apostles</hi> laboured, the <hi>Martyrs</hi> suffered, but all in vaine, if the soule be mortall. Our <hi>faith,</hi> our <hi>hope,</hi> our <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>reading,</hi> our <hi>restraint</hi> from pleasures, our <hi>sorrowing</hi> for sins, our taking up of our <hi>crosse,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of <hi>Christ,</hi> is all in vaine, if the soule be mortall: And, in a word, wee <hi>Christians</hi> are of all men the most miserable, if the soule be mortall. Why did <hi>Abel</hi> offer sacrifice, <hi>Abraham</hi> forsake his countrie, <hi>Ioseph</hi> forbeare his mistresse, <hi>Moses</hi> refuse the pleasures of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court? And why have so many thousands endured <hi>mockings, scourgings, bonds, prisonment, stoning, hewing asunder, murthering</hi> by the sword? Why would they wander up and downe in <hi>sheeps skins</hi> and in <hi>goats skins,</hi> being <hi>destitute, afflicted, tormented,</hi> if the soule be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall? What needs <hi>Cain</hi> feare to kill his brother, <hi>Ioseph</hi> to lye with his mistresse, <hi>Saul</hi> to persecute the Church, and <hi>Felix</hi> to tremble at the mention of a future judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the soule be mortall? Admit but such <hi>Lucreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> doctrine, you may shake hands with heaven and hell.</p>

                  <hi>Pamphlet</hi> by chance, the <hi>Scribler</hi> of which was ashamed
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56335:70"/>
to put to his name, his cause is so bad. He undertakes to prove the soules mortalitie, but so weakly, that I should lose too much time, and spend too much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to answer him according to his <hi>folly:</hi> For there is nothing in it but the <hi>froth</hi> of a luxurious wit, wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abusing <hi>Scripture,</hi> and obtruding a <hi>cloud</hi> in stead of <hi>Iuno, shadowes</hi> of reason in stead of solid argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: As first, when hee will prove the death of the soule out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> hee brings those places that speake of the <hi>metaphoricall</hi> or <hi>spirituall</hi> death of the soule, which is the defiling of her by sinne, and her separation from God; and so hee confounds the life of <hi>nature,</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and of <hi>glory,</hi> as he doth death spirituall and corporall. Secondly, hee abuseth the <hi>Synecdochicall</hi> speeches in <hi>Scripture,</hi> when he will have those phrases which are spoken of <hi>man,</hi> to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>bodie dis-junctively:</hi> And so, when the <hi>Scripture</hi> speakes of mans dissolution and death, hee will have the soule die as well as the bodie; but by this meanes hee must affirme, that the soule <hi>eates, drinkes, playes, sings, weeps,</hi> because these things are spoken of men. What? were the soules of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> drowned in the <hi>red sea,</hi> and the soules of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> burned in the <hi>fiery fornace,</hi> or the soule of the disobedient <hi>Prophet</hi> torne by the <hi>Lion,</hi> because these men died such deaths? Many things are spoken of the <hi>whole man,</hi> but not <hi>wholly:</hi> the totall <hi>compositum</hi> is the subject of such <hi>predicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but not <hi>totally. Christ</hi> died, was buried, was borne, was crucified; and yet his <hi>Divinity</hi> suffered none of these things. Hee is a bad <hi>Divine,</hi> that knowes not, that by the <hi>communication</hi> of <hi>properties,</hi> that is spoken

of the person of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is proper onely to either of his <hi>natures;</hi> and so that is spoken of man, which is proper onely to either of his <hi>essentiall</hi> parts. Thirdly, he confounds the <hi>act</hi> and the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> concluding that the <hi>habit</hi> is lost, because the <hi>act</hi> ceafeth; as that there is no <hi>habit</hi> or faculty of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in a <hi>mad man,</hi> because the <hi>act</hi> of reasoning is hindered: As if you should say, that a <hi>Musician</hi> hath lost his skill in Musick, when he ceaseth to play. Fourthly, some old objections hee hath inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which wee have already sufficiently answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and the rest of the passages in his <hi>Pamphlet</hi> are so <hi>frivolous,</hi> that they are not worth the answering, or reading: for, <hi>Magno conatu, magnas nugas dicit.</hi> And so, he that shall diligently read this former Discourse of ours, and shall make use of these foure <hi>Observations</hi> which now I have set downe, will find that this irreligious <hi>Rapsodie</hi> of his, is but <hi>froth,</hi> a <hi>vapour,</hi> or one of his <hi>dreames,</hi>

and which I thinke will little prevaile with any <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall</hi> man, much lesse with him who is truly <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified</hi> with grace. For he that was led meerely by reason, confessed, that the <hi>fatall houre</hi> of death was the last houre to the <hi>body onely,</hi> not to the soule. <hi>Decretoria illa hora, non est animo suprema sed corpori.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> For, even <hi>reason</hi> will teach us, that the soule, which in her selfe is immortall, (I exclude not here the generall, but the speciall or miraculous concourse
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56335:71"/>
of the Almighty,) may <hi>naturally</hi> subsist by her self after separation; for if her <hi>subsistence</hi> from the body were <hi>violent,</hi> then her returne to the body should be <hi>naturall;</hi> as, if the <hi>holding</hi> of a stone in the aire be violent, the <hi>falling</hi> downe of that stone, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the removing of the impediment, must needs be <hi>naturall:</hi> But her returning to the body, is an <hi>not miraculous,</hi> and of supernaturall power; for though the soule, as she is the <hi>forme</hi> of the body, hath a naturall propensity, or <hi>innate appetite</hi> to a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informing</hi> of, or re-union with the body, yet is she not againe conjoyned with the body, but by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and <hi>supernaturall</hi> worke of God in the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Neither againe must we thinke that the soule subsists after separation, by any <hi>speciall</hi> or <hi>supernaturall</hi> power, for then we shall make the soule so subsisting, of no better <hi>metall</hi> then the <hi>yron</hi> so swimming on the water, both being sustained not by their owne, but by a speciall and miraculous power; and by this meanes the soule of a <hi>dog</hi> may as well subsist after death, as the soule of a <hi>man:</hi> but he that thinks so, that the soule hath no other being after this life, may be in name a <hi>Christian professor,</hi> but is indeed a <hi>Cynick</hi> Philosopher, or <hi>Epicuri de grege porcus,</hi> fitter to dwell in the <hi>Isle of dogs,</hi> then among men. Therefore, as it was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for the childs soule to subsist in the mothers wombe, and it is as naturall for the same soule to subsist without it; so is the <hi>subsistence</hi> of the same soule in and without the body <hi>essentiall</hi> and <hi>naturall</hi> to her, and not <hi>violent</hi> or <hi>supernaturall.</hi>

                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:56335:71"/>But, to leave these men, whose soules are fitter<note place="margin">Sect. 17.</note> to dwell with <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> in a beasts body, then in their owne; I will conclude this Discourse with an acknowledgement and confession of that <hi>solace,</hi> and true comfort which I take in these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall and calamitous times in which we live, from the consideration of my soules immortality; that, however she be now tossed upon the <hi>proud and lofty billowes</hi> of the turbulent <hi>sea of afflictions</hi> in this life, with <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, yet a higher mountaine then those of <hi>Ararat</hi> is prepared for her to rest upon; and however this weary <hi>Dove</hi> flutter upon these <hi>boysterous waters,</hi> that she can find no rest for the soales of her feet, yet she sees a <hi>window</hi> in that <hi>cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall Arke</hi> which is above, ready open to receive her. <hi>Christ</hi> hath not in vaine gone to prepare a place for us; he hath prepared it, that we may enjoy it: and to what end should he shed his blood for our soules, and redeeme them at so <hi>deare a rate,</hi> if they be mortall, and can not enjoy that which they long after, as earnestly as the <hi>Hart</hi> brayeth after the rivers of water? Doth <hi>God</hi> mock us, when by his <hi>Prophet</hi> he tels us of <hi>fulnesse of joy in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and at his right hand pleasures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more?</hi> Is God our <hi>Father,</hi> and Heaven our <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,</hi> and must we be put off from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of either? We are here miserable <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>strangers,</hi> if, after our tedious journey, we have no other home to rest in but a cold and stinking <hi>grave,</hi> and no other companions but <hi>wormes:</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the condition of <hi>beasts,</hi> then of <hi>Christians.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56335:72"/>
the place of our future rest should not be called the <hi>Land of the living,</hi> if our soules there must die. And why should the <hi>Angels</hi> be so carefull of us here, if they must be debarred of our company hereafter? In vaine are our soules fed here with the <hi>Bread that came downe from Heaven,</hi> if they must not enjoy that same bread againe in heaven. Our condition will be far worse then that of the <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi> if we shall be fed with <hi>husks</hi> here, and not have accesse, when we returne by death, to eat bread in our Fathers house, where is such exuberant plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Can <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Bridegroome</hi> of our soules, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himselfe to be perpetually separated from his <hi>Bride,</hi> whom he hath bought with so high a price as his owne blood? Our <hi>life is a warfare,</hi> what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement have we to fight <hi>the good fight,</hi> if we enjoy not the <hi>Crowne of righteousnesse?</hi> Hath Christ no other reward for his souldiers but a <hi>crowne of thornes?</hi> then indeed we fight, as one that <hi>beateth the aire;</hi> and we were better, with <hi>Caligula</hi>'s souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, spend our time in gathering of <hi>shels</hi> and <hi>pebble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones,</hi> then fight under the standard of such a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi> But indeed we need not feare, for he that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the soule of the <hi>penitent thiefe</hi> into <hi>Paradise,</hi> and by the ministery of his <hi>Angels</hi> conveyed the soule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome; and when himselfe gave <hi>up the Ghost,</hi> recommended his soule into the hands of his <hi>Father,</hi> will not leave our <hi>soules</hi> in hell, nor will he suffer his holy ones to see <hi>corruption.</hi> Though the <hi>shell</hi> of our bodies be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the precious <hi>kernell</hi> of our soules shall not be

not be dismaid, though she be carried in this weake and <hi>leaking ship</hi> of an infirme body, on the waves of the <hi>Red sea</hi> of <hi>persecution;</hi> for even from hence she smels by faith the sweet <hi>odours</hi> of <hi>her heavenly Arabia,</hi> though as yet with her bodily eyes she cannot see it. The hot <hi>firy furnace</hi> of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction shall no more consume and annoy her, then the <hi>flame</hi> did consume the <hi>firie bush,</hi> or the firie <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Babylon</hi> did the three <hi>Children.</hi> The <hi>Presteres</hi> live in the fire, and are not <hi>burned; fresh waters</hi> spring out of the salt Sea, and yet are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by infected; nor are the fishes <hi>salt</hi> which live in <hi>salt water:</hi> neither shall our Soule either suffer by <hi>sicknesse</hi> in the body, or <hi>die</hi> with the body; but after she hath fought the <hi>good fight,</hi> like a <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> or <hi>Emperour,</hi> she shall be carried out of this <hi>campus Martius</hi> upon the shoulders, not of <hi>Senators,</hi> but of <hi>Angels.</hi> And as an <hi>Eagle</hi> flew out of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall pile when it was set on fire, leaving the body of the <hi>Emperour</hi> to be consumed; so shall our soules flye up unto their <hi>Maker,</hi> leaving their bodies to be wasted by <hi>time</hi> and <hi>corruption.</hi> For, as it is <hi>impossible</hi> for the body to die till the soule forsake it, which is the life of it; so much more impossible is it for the soule to die, untill <hi>God,</hi> who is her <hi>life,</hi> forsake her: and that will never be, till God himselfe cease to be; for he hath <hi>promised</hi> never to forsake us, <hi>his love</hi> like himselfe is <hi>unchangeable.</hi> A <hi>mother</hi> may forget the <hi>fruit of her wombe, fathers</hi> and <hi>mothers</hi> may, and will forsake us, but the <hi>Lord</hi>

will never forget or forsake us; but when friends, and all leave us, he will then receive us: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let our <hi>soules magnifie</hi> the LORD, and let our spirits rejoyce in God our SAVIOUR.</p>
