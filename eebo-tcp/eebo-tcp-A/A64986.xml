         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Heads of Families.</head>
            <p>THose Catechisms may very well
be esteemed the best, which are
Explanatory of the Creed, ten
Commandments and the Lords
Prayer; because these Summaries or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts
contain the Essentials of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or those choice truths which God
would have us take extraordinary notice of
in our course of reading the holy Scriptures:
And therefore those that begin with Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing,
begin the most easie and profitable
way for any; because the weightier matters
of the Law are not hard to be understood,
and such words being Spirit and Life, and
the very marrow of Christianity, must needs
feed and nourish us up unto eternal life. I
have fixed my thoughts upon the Assemblies
shorter Catechism, because the Principles
in it are mostly agreed upon by all sober intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
<pb facs="tcp:36626:3"/>
unprejudiced Protestant Divines. You
have also something of the nature of the two
Covenants superadded to, or rather enlarged
upon more particularly and expresly than in
the Catechism. And because Catechisms ought
to contain nothing but received truths, you
have mostly the Explication of Antient and
Modern Divines: And therefore, where you
meet with any thing that is not so elaborate
and exact, you may conclude it mine, and
not theirs. Hearing occasionally a Discourse
of a very learned and godly Divine out of
<hi>Deut. 6. 6, 7. [And these words which I
command thee this day, shall be in thy
heart: And thou shalt teach them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
unto thy Children,</hi> &amp;c.] who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to Parents with the greatest ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness
the work of Catechizing; I shall
make bold to transcribe a part of it, and
offer it to publick view. You shall have, 1. His
Reasons to prove that Parents ought diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Catechize or teach their Children [Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
also included.] 2. His Answers to
the Objections against it. And 3. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
he laid down to provoke and stir up all
Parents to this necessary duty.</p>
            <p>10. Reasons for the proof of it.</p>
            <p>1. Every man ought to promote the Glory
of God, to advance the Kingdom of Christ,
<pb facs="tcp:36626:3"/>
and to further the Salvation of others as far
forth as they are able, and have opportunity
to it. And can we effect these any better
way? We pray, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name.
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done:</hi>
Surely the coming of Christs Kingdom into
our hearts is one way of his Kingdom's
coming.</p>
            <p>2. God hath set Parents in Authority
over them, and they cannot improve it to
better purpose. This is the most ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Before there was King or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
there was Parental Government.
This being most ancient, afterwards was the
Priest and Prophet. God hath laid a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
upon Children to obedience in the fifth
Commandment, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 1. Only Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
requires duty; improve your authority
for God, and use it to instruct your House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
in the Word of God. Do not think
you have done, till you have done this.</p>
            <p>3. Even nature it self dictates thus much.
The Birds and Beasts of the field, yea the
Sea-monsters take care of their young ones.
If you do nothing but feed and cloath your
Children, you do no more than Heathens, nay
than brute beasts. 'Tis said of the Ostrich,
<hi>Job</hi> 39. 16. that she is hardened against
her young ones, as though they were not hers:
<pb facs="tcp:36626:4"/>
And what do ignorant Parents less, who are
hardened against their own Children who
are parts of themselves?</p>
            <p>4. Children have Souls to be saved or
damned, therefore some must take care of them,
and the soul that sinneth must die. We see
Children die as well as Aged persons.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10</note> In
Golgatha there are Skulls of all sorts: Yea,
do but look into the Register of a Parish, and
you shall see as many young as old have died
in it. Children may die, and what if they
die without knowledge, in their sins? better
were it with those Children mentioned,
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 23, 24. than these, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 11.
2 Thes. 1. 7, 8. Thus unchastised Children
shall suffer; but the Parents shall not go
Scot-free. If you would have them profit
by the publick Ministry, you must Catechize
them at home. To bring them to the publick
before they be thus Catechized, is setting
before them an hard loaf. You must give
them milk at home, that they may be fit for
higher truths in publick.</p>
            <p>5. Your Children are Children of wrath,
and you have been instruments to conveigh
this to them.<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 1, 5</note> They die, and that proves this.
When your Children are sick, you forthwith
go to the Physitian, and will you take no care of
their Souls, inheriting their spiritual mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb facs="tcp:36626:4"/>
from you? You may say as <hi>David</hi> to
Abiathar, 1 Sam. 22. 22. I have occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the death of all the persons of thy
Fathers house.</p>
            <p>6. What will become of Religion in future
Ages, if Parents neglect this duty at present?
If all Parents were as careless as some, the
Church of God would soon cease on the earth,
<hi>Isa. 38. 19. The Father to the Children
shall make known thy truth,</hi> Psal. 78. 3, 4.
<hi>Which we have heard and known, and our
Fathers have told us; We will not hide
them from their Children, shewing to the
Generation to come the praises of the
Lord.</hi> If we do not teach our Children how
should they teach theirs? It was above two
thousand years before the Scripture was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
how then was piety preserved but by one
Generation teaching another? <hi>Adam</hi> taught
his Children. The sacrificing of <hi>Cain,</hi> and
<hi>Abel</hi>'s piety therein were both the fruit of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s teaching. <hi>Noah</hi> taught his Children
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he taught his houshold.
<hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 9. Except the Lord of Hosts had left
unto us a very small Remnant, we should
have been as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and we should have
been like unto <hi>Gomorrah:</hi> We should have
been as Heathenish, as Paganish as they.</p>
            <p>7. God is highly pleased with piety in younger
<pb facs="tcp:36626:5"/>
ones. The Lord had respect to <hi>Abel</hi> the younger;
and <hi>Enoch</hi> of all the Patriarchs before the
Flood the youngest, is said to please God. How
was God pleased with the piety of <hi>Samuel</hi>
and <hi>Josiah?</hi> And we read of <hi>Jehojachin</hi> that
began very young to Reign; and did that
which was evil in the sight of the Lord,
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24. 8, 9. God takes notice of the
evil as well as the good. Children might sing
<hi>Hosanna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 15.</note> as well as cry bold-head, if they
were taught. Iesus said, <hi>Mat. 19. 14.
Suffer little Children, and forbid them not
to come unto me: for of such is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven.</hi> Of such, not untaught
Children.</p>
            <p>8. You cannot expect the blessings of the
Covenant, except y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u teach them the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God <hi>Ps. 103. 17, 18. Dan.</hi> 9. 4.</p>
            <p>9. Assure your selves, if you neglect this
duty, God will require their blood at your
hands, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 5. with <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 26. It is
here with Parents as with Ministers; if you
do not warn and teach them, God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
their blood at your hands. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But teaching is the work of the
Minister?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not only his, but yours; his
in publick, yours in your Families.</p>
            <p>10. Sin and corruption is so inherent in
<pb facs="tcp:36626:5"/>
Children in their nature, that all the care of
Ministers in publick, and Parents at home
will be little enough to heal this plague of
original corruption.<note place="margin">Levit. 14. 41, &amp;c.</note> This plague is like the
Leprosie. There must be scraping, and if
cleansing will not do, there must be pulling
down. So that you see all is little enough:
without teaching, your Children may perish,
and you smart for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But Children may do well
that are not thus carefully instructed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They may do well as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, they may prosper in the world.
God may cause his Sun to shine upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
and the unthankful. But Parents are
to wish that their Children may do well as to
the inward man, and prosper in their Souls,
as <hi>John</hi> for his friend <hi>Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us, 3 Joh.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>2. They may perish eternally for want of
Knowledge. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
            <p>3. If some Children happen to come to good,
no thanks to such careless graceless Parents
that neglect instruction at home.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But we have known them
that have been taught well enough to
have made bad proof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. This is too sadly true, to be denied;
But the fault may be in one of the Parents
by their bad example: And Children as well
<pb facs="tcp:36626:6"/>
as the conclusion in syllogizing will follow the
worse and weaker part; yet this is blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
in Parents.</p>
            <p>2. Good Parents have severely smarted for
their neglect of strict Discipline in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and their over great fondness in cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring
their Children, as you may read in <hi>Eli</hi>
and <hi>David. 1 Sam. 3. 13. 2 Sam</hi> 13, and
14, and 15. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p>3. But if the Children of good Parents
prove bad, this should make us more diligent.
If a Garden well weeded and kept down prove
thus ill; Is this any encouragement to sloth,
but rather a spur to double diligence?</p>
            <p>Two or three Motives to excite to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Catechizing.</p>
            <p>Let it be remembred that you are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to invade the ministerial office, or to
become of this or that Opinion or Party, but
to fall forthwith upon the practice of a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
yet indispensable Duty.</p>
            <p>1. How doth the love of God dwell in your
hearts, when they are hardened against your
Children? <hi>Simon, lovest thou me? then
feed my Lambs.</hi> They are Gods Children,
and therefore you must bring them up in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ture and admonition of the Lord. The
Children of any in Covenant with God are
called his Children, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15. 21. When the

            <p>We are to look upon this duty as one of the

and most Catechisms; you will soon find that
the former do furnish us rather with sounds
than sense; and that in the latter, upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the truths and the alledged Texts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
there is so wide a distance, that you
will the better perceive the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fficulty of our
present undertaking (notwithstanding all the
forementioned helps) than at first, possibly, you
<pb facs="tcp:36626:8"/>
have imagined. If you find any pertinency of
the Scriptures produced for confirmation of
the truths they refer unto in this Explication,
I know it will be acceptable to you, and it is no
less than what I have endeavoured after. If
you espie many proofs under any Principle of
Religion, it is either because that the truths
there are more weighty, or that the cavils
against them are more than ordinary. If you
expected the Scriptures at large, the numero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of them gives you the reason against that.</p>
            <p>I had once some thoughts of illustrating the
mysterie of the Trinity of Persons, by some apt
Figure or Resemblance, and of placing it in
the Catechism; but for the avoiding of all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of offence to the weak I have affixed it
here: And of all Figures, <hi>Keplers</hi> Circle
seems most artificial and correspondent with
this glorious mystery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36626:8"/>
               <figure/>
            </p>
            <p>IN this Scheme or Figure you have a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and a Circumference, and an Inter
space, and yet but one Circle: So that there
are three Persons, and yet but one God. These
three are not divided; For it is not a Center,
or Interspace, separate from the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
But these are distinguished in their
incommunicable properties in their order, and
in their operation (upon a supposition of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
The Center is the beginning (as is easie
to be observed in drawing the Circle) the
Circumference is a resultance from the Center
alone, the Interspace from the Center and
the Circumference.</p>
            <p>These are Co-equal; the Center and the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
and the Interspace are equidistant
every where, each one from other: And
the Center is no more a Circle without a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
than the Circumference and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terspace
without a Center.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36626:9"/>Consubstantial; The Center is constituent
of the Circle, not a part from but together
with the Circumference and the Interspace.</p>
            <p>Co-eternal; It is no Center without a
Circumference; and no sooner is the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
drawn, but you find the Interspace.</p>
            <p>Doubtless there is Vnity in Trinity in all
things, had we but light and eyes to espy it.</p>

but to the inspiration of God?</p>
            <p>Q. What is the second witness of the

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Wherein is the Image and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. As this Doctrine contains superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
verities, such Divine and wonderful
Truths as could never enter into the heart of

               <hi>A.</hi> It explicates unto us the Nature, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
and high Acts of God, purely and
holily.</p>
            <p>2. It describes the Person of Christ, so
fitly, excellently, and conveniently, that if
the mind of man consider it attentively, it
must acknowledge, it doth exceed the
reach of a finite understanding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:36626:13"/>3. It discovers to us the corruption and
misery of man by nature, the incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Love of God in Iesus Christ towards
man, that happy reconciliation (if we may
so speak) of his Iustice and Mercy by his
infinite wisdom, ordaining Iesus Christ to be
our Mediator.</p>
            <p>4. It unfolds the Covenant of Grace,
which God made with man after his fall;
all which can be drawn from no Fountain
but Divine Revelation<note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 7, 10. Eph. 3. 4, 5. Col. 1. 25, 26.</note>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 2. As the Method of the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the holy Scriptures set together, is
the most admirable and perfect in the world;
beginning with God in unity of essence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
to his Trinity of essential active
Principles, and of Persons, and so to his
Trinity of works, Creation, Redemption
and Regeneration, great things past finding
out, and wonders without number; and all
chiefly with special relation to mankind;

               <hi>A.</hi> 3. As it is spiritual, powerful and
divine; suited to holy ends, and to the

are commonly ignorant and unlearned, and
so more generally useful than any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Angels are pure Spirits, and have no

up the measure of their misery, suffering
together the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>
            <p>Or more briefly, God, Angels and the
souls of men may be thus distinguished.
Angels are created Spirits compleat. As
Angels are created Spirits, they are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished

against the disgraces, slanders and

which never did, nor shall come into the

waies with respect to an higher Tribunal,

            <p>2. We are not without the sight of God;
For,</p>
            <p>1. God is seen in his works<note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note>.</p>
            <p>2. The Fathers have seen him by sundry
visions; and <hi>Moses</hi> saw the similitude of
the Lord, or his back parts: but his face
can no man see. It pleased God to appear
to them of old not as he is, but as he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to manifest himself to them: For if
they had seen him as he is, then all of them
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36626:21"/>
had seen him after one manner because he is
one: And this sight of God was also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</p>
            <p>3. It hath pleased him in more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner to reveal himself to his Saints
by his Word, by which they behold his beauty
in his Temple, and with open face see his
Image as it is represented to them in the
mirror of the Gospel, and are transformed
into the same.</p>
            <p>4. God is seen by inward contemplation,
and this sight is the more excellent than the
rest, because it is more inward.</p>
            <p>5. He is seen by Faith<note n="w" place="margin">Heb. 11. 27.</note>.</p>
            <p>6. The Faithful have the clearest sight of
God in Heaven. Here their Faith is turned
into Vision, and their present sight of God,
if compared with that which is to come, is
not worthy the name of sight, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12.</p>
            <p>7. God is to be seen in the face of Iesus

            <p>Q<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is the Covenant of works, as to its

               <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
            <p>Q. In the chief part restrained, and in

that?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:36626:31"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> We mean, that Believers shall never

and corrective punishment of their
fins<note n="m" place="margin">Lam. 3. 33</note>.</p>
            <p>Q. But because generals are obscure, tell
us particularly, for the clearer understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Mysterie, what obligation the
first Covenant laies on sinful man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A double obligation; first, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to what is past. And secondly,
in reference to the future.</p>
            <p>Q What obligation doth it lay on him,
in reference to what is past?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It requires satisfaction, and repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from him, for his sin in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it<note n="n" place="margin">Ro. 6. 23.</note>.</p>
            <p>Q What, in reference to the future?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It requires perfect conformity still
as at the first, and absolute obedience to
all Gods commands, being the eternal
debt of the reasonable creature to
that God, that made it in his own Image.</p>
            <p>Q. Is it possible for us to satisfie Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
Law for our first breach?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No.</p>
            <p>Q But if we could, might not the Law
come upon us for future exact conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to pay the residue of that eternal

Debt, due to God as our Creator?</p>

            <p>Q. Doth the Covenant of Grace relieve
us as to both these cases, and dispence with
the rigour of the Law?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
            <p>Q. How doth it relieve us as to the first
obligation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It comforts us with the good news
that the Son of God hath satisfied his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Justice; and if we believe but in
him, God will accept of us, as if we had
satisfied in our own persons. [The case the
Law leaves us in, is well expressed,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 14. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 31. But the
relief the Gospel brings us, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
language, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. you have both
together excellently, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 10, 11.]</p>
            <p>Q. How, as to the second?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The New Covenant dispenceth
with the rigour of that too; and justified
and pardoned persons shall not lose all
again upon the least defailance; therefore
the Gospel proclaims pardon of sin upon
Repentance, and acceptance of sincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to obey him.</p>
            <p>Q God gave the Law from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
and the voice of words was so dreadful
there, that they which heard it, intreated
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36626:32"/>
that the Word should not be spoken to them
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ny more: But we are come to Mount
<hi>Sion;</hi> what is Gods language to us now?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Sinners, be but in good earnest, do
but love me heartily and my waies; let
me but see a child-like ingenuity in you,
and I will put down your upright, though
imperfect performances, in the Book of
my remembrance<note n="p" place="margin">Mal. 3. 16.</note>.</p>
            <p>Q. How is it possible our performances
should be recorded in the Book of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
since the best of them are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
and we do daily break the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God in thought, word and
deed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If there be a willing mind, it is
well accepted according to that we have,
and not according to that we have not.
And the Commandments of God may be
reputed as done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when whatsoever is not
done is pardoned. Thus doth the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the Gospel dispence with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of the Law<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 11. 30.</note>.</p>
            <p>Q. But how doth it stand with Gods ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity
and immutability having once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that the soul that sinneth shall die,
to contradict it by declaring, That he that
believeth shall never die, but have Eternal
Life?<note n="r" place="margin">Joh. 11. 26.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:36626:32"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> We must look upon threatenings as
a part of the Law, declaring the dueness
of the punishment, what the offender
hath deserved to suffer; Not as predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the event, any more than Thou
shalt, and Thou shalt not in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
are Predictions: but only are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive
of the dueness of obedience.</p>
            <p>Q. How do the Old and New Covenant
differ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They differ more especially, these
two waies,</p>
            <p>1. In their tenor; the tenor of the
Old is, <hi>Obey</hi> [perfectly] <hi>and live, sin
and die;</hi> The tenor of the New is, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou
shalt be saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The New Covenant admits of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
which the Old doth not.</p>
            <p>Q. But must not a believer acknowledge
perfect obedience to be still his duty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
            <p>Q. Why so?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because this honours the equity of
Gods Commandments.</p>
            <p>Q. And hath the Redeemer then by
making this one of the Conditions of the
Gospel-Covenant, given his Father his Law
back again?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:36626:33"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
            <p>Q. Doth he not repeal it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, it's still the Rule of life, and
every Commandment still obligeth a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
            <p>Q. What hath Christ then done for us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Christ hath only released us from
the condemning power of the Law, not
the commanding power of it.</p>
            <p>Q. How understand you that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We must still press after perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but though we fall short of it, we
shall not die for it: Christ having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
us from the curse of the Law,
being made a curse for us; He leaves us
under the Government and Command of
the Law.</p>
            <p>Q. But have you any Scripture-warrant
for what you say in this matter?</p>
            <p>A. <hi>Yes, the whole matter is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressed,</hi> 1 Ioh. 2. 1. My little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
these things write I unto you, that
you sin not: And if any man sin we have
an advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ
the righteous.</p>
            <p>Q. But generally and more briefly, what
doth God promise to deliver the Elect out of
in the Covenant of Grace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Out of the estate of sin and misery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:36626:33"/>Q. But how doth God perform this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to them, seeing that they also are liable
to the miseries of this life, and to the first
Death as the wages of sin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Although the Old Covenant in part
be executed on them, yet doth not God
leave them in the state of sin and misery;
but hath entred into a New Covenant
with them to bring them out of it:
And what they suffer is for their good,
that being reformed by stripes, they may
be freed from those punishments which
fall on the unreformed to all eternity<note n="s" place="margin">Lam. 3. 39. Mich. 7. 9. Rom. 5. 21. 15. 22. Rom. 8. 1, 2. 1 Cor. 11. 30, 32.</note>.</p>
            <p>Q. And what doth God promise to
bring the Elect into in the Covenant of
Grace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Into an estate of Salvation<note n="t" place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 11, 12. Joh. 3. 16. Heb. 8. 10.</note>.</p>
            <p>Q. Is then the Deliverance of Gods
Elect out of the estate of sin, and his
bringing them into an estate of Salvation,
the sum and the substance of what hath
been said more at large in several particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
concerning the benefits of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
            <p>Q. How doth God promise to do all this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By a Redeemer, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10. When
thou shalt make his soul an offering for
sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36626:34"/>
his daies, and the pleasure of the Lord
shall prosper in his hand, <hi>vers. 11. He
shall see of the Travail of his soul, and shall be
satisfied,</hi> &amp;c. And this by some learned
Divines is called the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
            <p>Q. What do they mean by it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That federal transaction that was
betwixt God the Father and the Son from

            <p>Q. Is not this the same with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This Covenant is a Covenant of
Grace, but 'tis not strictly that Covenant
of Grace, which the Scripture holds out
in opposition to the Covenant of works;
but rather the means to it, or foundation
of it.</p>
            <p>Q. Wherein do these two Covenants
differ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In the Confederates, For in the
Covenant of Redemption, the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates

            <p>Q. 21. Who is the Redeemer of Gods

               <hi>A.</hi> The only Redeemer of Gods Elect
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36626:34"/>

shame of his sin; and hereby the sinner

his tears, acknowledging that his blood

               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the Resurrection here spoken

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The last and general Resurrection
of all the dead that have lived in all
Ages from the beginning of the Creation;
which will be first of the righteous, and
then of the wicked at the last day<note n="n" place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 16 John 5. 28, 29</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q</hi> How do you prove that there shall be
such a general Resurrection?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It may be undeniably proved from
the Scriptures and the power of God.
If God be of infinite power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can raise the dead, and infinitely true,
and in the Scriptures hath revealed that
he will raise all the dead, then there shall
be a general Resurrection; but God is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36626:52"/>
infinite in power, and in the Scriptures
hath revealed that he will raise all the
dead, therefore there shall be a general
Resurrection. The ground of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
errour, who denied the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was their ignorance of these two
great foundations of this Doctrine, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Scriptures and the power of
God<note n="o" place="margin">Mark 12. 24</note>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How do you prove that the Dead shal
be raised with the same Body?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because otherwise it could in no
proper sense be called a Resurrection, but
a new Creation.</p>
            <p>2. Because 'tis fit the same Body that
was an instrument of righteousness, or sin
should share in the like Reward or
Punishment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Will not the Bodies, when they are
raised, differ from what they are now?</p>

they are now in regard of their substance

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For the utmost assurance that the
Apostles had of the Truth of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
was the Testimony of their own

to be relied upon?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Then it plainly follows that no
man (no, not the Apostles themselves)
had more reason to believe Christianity to
be true, than every man hath to believe
Transubstantiation to be false.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But if the case be so plain, a man
would think that at least the Teachers and

of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Why, they are so, and afraid the

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> And are not they certainly mistaken
that adventure all, even all their everlasting

those very things which must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
antecedent to the belief of any such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
As 1. The common sense of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
2. The force of a Divine Law.
And 3. The liberty of Iudgement concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truth and falshood?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, and thereby forfeits its own
authority over men.</p>
            <p>1. It requires things contrary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense; as in the Eucharist, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
all its members to deny what they
see, and handle, and smell, and taste to
be Bread, to be true Bread; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the same individual Body may

be in a thousand places at once, and that
things whose nature it is to be in another,

               </gap> subsist without their proper subject.</p>
            <p>2. It requires things contrary to the
force and reason of a divine Law; as it
hath left out the second Commandment,
and hath made it lawful to give religious
worship to Images, and hath taken away
from the people their share of the Cup in
the Eucharist.</p>
            <p>3. It takes away all liberty of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning truth and falshood in
Religion. For this is a natural right
which every man hath to judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
And they that take this away, may
as well command all men to put out their
eyes, that they may the better follow
their Guides. But the other is so much
worse, because it is an assault upon our
understandings; it is a robbing us of
the greatest Talent God hath committed
to our management, it is a Rape upon
our best faculties, and prostituting them
to the Lusts of spiritual Tyrants; it is
not captivating our understandings to the
obedience of Faith, but enslaving them to
the proud and domineering usurpations of
men; wherein they would do by us as

because God is the only Soveraign<note n="k" place="margin">Ps. 95. 2, 3</note> King

            <p>Q. The Papists have a distinction of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

Doth the Scripture warrant this distinction
of theirs?</p>

us, first, that the curse of God is due to
every one that breaketh the least of Gods
Commandments<note n="k" place="margin">Gal. 3. 10</note>. 2. That the wages
of sin (indiscriminatively, without any
difference) is death. And such a death
that is opposed to eternal life<note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 6. 23</note>. And we
must not distinguish where the Law it
self doth not distinguish. 3. That for
every idle word that men speak, they
shall give an account thereof in the day
of Judgement, and that by such words
(if not repented of) they shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 36, 37. And on the

<hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16.</p>
            <p>Q. 92. What is a Sacrament?</p>
            <p>A. A Sacrament is an holy Ordinance
instituted by Christ, wherein by sensible
signs, Christ and the benefits of the New
Covenant are represented, sealed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to Believers.</p>

signifie in antient times?</p>
            <p>A. It signified an Oath, whereby Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
bound themselves to be true to their
Captain, and he in like manner bound
himself to them.</p>
            <p>Q. What is it now used to signifie?</p>
            <p>A. Now it is used to signifie the seals
of the Covenant whereby the Lord doth
bind himself in Christ Jesus to be merciful
to us; and we bind our selves to be true
unto Christ.</p>
            <p>Q. Is the Sacrament then an holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance?</p>
            <p>A. Yes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:36626:100"/>Q. By whom are our Sacraments insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted?</p>
            <p>A. By Christ. <hi>Mat. 28. 19. 1 Cor.</hi> 11.
23, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>Q. What do you mean by being instituted
by Christ?</p>
            <p>A. Appointed and ordained by him.</p>
            <p>Q. What are the parts of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>A. The sign, and the thing signified.</p>
            <p>Q. What are the outward parts of the
Sacraments?</p>
            <p>A. The sensible signs.</p>
            <p>Q. Do the signs offer themselves to the
Senses?</p>
            <p>A. Yes.</p>
            <p>Q. And offer the things signified to our
Faith?</p>
            <p>A. Yes.</p>
            <p>Q. What are the inward parts of the
Sacraments?</p>
            <p>A. Christ and the benefits of the New
Covenant, as the things signified by the
outward sensible signs.</p>
            <p>Q What is the use and proper work of
the Sacraments?</p>
            <p>A. To represent, seal and apply.</p>
            <p>Q. But are the Sacraments of the New
Testament signs, and seals to all even to unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:36626:101"/>A. Yes.</p>
            <p>Q How do the Sacrameats seal to all
even to unbelievers?</p>
            <p>A. 1. As Circumcision was a Seal of
the righteousness of Faith [or of the
Covenant] as well when <hi>Ishmael</hi> received
it, as when <hi>Abraham</hi> received it<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 4 11 with Gen. 17 Dr. Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot.</note>. God
is everlastingly true; and these are really
Seals whosoever recelves them. Many
persons take the same Physick; the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is not the same, the Physick is the
same. And if we might call the Tree of
Life a Seal, it retains the nature of a sign,
though <hi>Adam</hi> never tasted of it. The
Rain-bow is a Covenant, though there
be thousands in the world that never
knew it was a Covenant. And it is the
use and proper work of our Sacraments
to commemorate and seal.</p>
            <p>2. Sacraments are visible D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctrines,
<hi>Ier. 2. 31. O Generation, see ye the word
of the Lord.</hi> In the Sacraments are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in small Characters, what at large are
found in the works of God. And Faith
acts upon these Symbols upon a doctrinal
notion, as they are teaching Ordinances.
They testifie, as a sign Christs Love, as a
Seal Gods faithfulness. The Word of
God is given us that we may believe,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:36626:101"/>
and that we may be strong in Faith: So
likewise the Sacraments are given us not
only to believe, but for our increase in
Faith. And as the word Jesus Christ is
evidently set forth crucified before our
eyes, so do the Sacraments as the Oracles
of God teach us plainly the mysterie of
Faith, and the way of Salvation.</p>
            <p>3. The Sacraments are not only signs
and Seals, but Sanctions, and such Laws
as we are charged to observe upon pain of

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The nature of a Sacrament agreeth
not to them. 1. Because they are not
all proper to the Church, but common
(as Marriage) to the Heathen. 2. They

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. Because the anointing spoken of
in S. <hi>Iames</hi> was frequently omitted by
the Apostles themselves in their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of cures, and was indifferently ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
used or not used by them. In

without it; and so in the <hi>Acts,</hi> by taking

ways of healing the sick do sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evince that the usage of Oyl as a
bare ceremony, was not instituted by

Christ, or any way commanded to be
continued by the Apostles, or their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
in the Church, even while the
gift of healing did continue among
them.</p>
            <p>2. Because that anointing with Oyl in
the Name of the Lord, was never used
on any other design than to demonstrate

was wrought without any contribution
of natural means; and therefore is not
now of any propriety or fitness for use,

            <p>3. That anointing was designed on
purpose for the recovery of the sick,
whereas Extream Unction (if the coine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the right institution and use of it, what

            <p>2. By acknowledging in the Name of
the Congregation Mans natural pollution,
that we stand in need of spiritual wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
by giving thanks to God the Father
for giving his Son for a propitiation for
our sins, and appointing his blood to be
a Fountain to the House of <hi>Israel</hi> to wash

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:36626:105"/>
Sacrament and Seal of so great a mysterie.</p>
            <p>3. By making profession of Faith in

               </gap>fied by the

               </gap>ptism

            <p>
               <hi>Q</hi> Is the action of diving or dipping
essential to the Sacrament? Or is there any
ground and warrant for sprinkling, which
is mostly used with us in these cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The action of sprinkling water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Face of the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 26.</p>
            <p>2. Because, as in the other Sacrament,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:36626:105"/>
a spoonful of Wine is as significant as a
whole Gallon; so here a handful of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as a whole River.</p>
            <p>3. The action of sprinkling bears fit
resemblance with the inward grace as

the Scripture of truth. Read 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. where is speech of the
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ,
and the blood of sprinkling speaking bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            </p>
            <p>4. It is not unlikely that the Apostles
Baptized as well by sprinkling or pouring
upon, as by diving or dipping into: Since

And secondly, If there were Children in

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Lords Supper is a Sacrament
wherein by giving and receiving Bread
and Wine according to Christs appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
his Death is shewed forth, and the
worthy receivers are not after a corporal
and carnal manner, but by Faith made
partakers of his Body and Blood, with

alwaies at the same time?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, because there is no command
for it, nor is there the same reason for it
now as then; this circumstance of time
not obliging us to do it after Supper any
more than the fashion of lying along
binds us to the using of the same posture;
both of them being upon occasion of the
Paschal Supper then.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because the first Paschal Supper
in <hi>Egypt</hi> was eaten standing; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

               <hi>Q.</hi> But all present at the first Sacrament

may be taken away from the people too,
and so they would have no right to any
part of this Sacrament: And what is this

people of their highest Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</p>
            <p>2. The practice and writings of the
ancient Church in this matter, which is
the best way to explicate any such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in Scripture, is a clear Testimony
that both the Bread and the Wine belong
to all the people, in the Name of the
twelve Disciples at that time.</p>

very good help to us for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the said Texts, to consider
those observations taken from the Jewish
phrases and customs used in this matter,
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the Lamb that was drest
in the Paschal Supper and set upon the
Table, was wont to be called the Body
of the Passover, or the Body of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Lamb; and probably Christ alludes
to this phrase, when he saith, <hi>This is my
Body;</hi> as if he should say, the Paschal
Lamb and the Body of it, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of that on the Table in the
Jewish Feast) that was the memorial of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and type of your
deliverance out of the state of sin and
death, I will now have abrogated; and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:36626:111"/>
do now institute Bread and Wine instead
of that Paschal Lamb, that you may
hereafter retain and continue to posterity
a Memorial and Symbol of me, who am
the Lamb of God which taketh away the
sin of the world, and am now about to
be sacrificed for you. This for the words
[<hi>My Body and my Blood:</hi>) But then
2. For the whole phrase, and form of
speech, [<hi>This is my Body, this is my
Blood.</hi>] It seems to be answerable to
(and substituted instead of) the Paschal
form (<hi>This is the Bread of affliction, which
our Fathers eat in Egypt:</hi> or, <hi>This is the
unleavened Bread,</hi> &amp;c. or, <hi>This is the
Passover.</hi>] And therefore the Bread and
the Wine in the Eucharist are no more the
very Body and Blood of Christ, than that
Bread which the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> eat in
the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was that Identical,
that very Bread of affliction which their

Bread, and drinking this Cup first, as
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:36626:113"/>
the custom at the Paschal Supper was,
and as the Papists generally, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hold, and we deny not, because the
Scripture seems plain for it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 29.
<hi>Hence forth I will not drink of the fruit of the
Vine;</hi> supposing therefore this, How is
it possible or imaginable that he should
eat himself? or how can he sit at Table,
and yet be in the mouths of the Apostles?
Was he at the same time in the Apostles
mouths or stomachs, while he sate and
rose from Table, and discoursed those
three Chapters of <hi>Iohn</hi> 15, 16, 17. Or
while he sweat that bloody sweat in his
Agony in the Garden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A monstrous
impossibility!</p>
            <p>2. It's impossible to make that which
was before existent and in being: Can a
Father beget a Son that is already begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?
Can an Architect build an House
that is already built? Can the Body of
Christ, which is before the Conversion of
the Bread, be made or produced by the
turning of Bread into it? Can he that
was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and
born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> be made by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of four or five words? If ever
delusions were strong, these are; For, to
make that which is made, and to unmake
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:36626:113"/>
that which is made, are equally impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
            <p>3. They say that the substance of
Bread and Wine is avoided, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the accidents remain; so that there is
length and nothing long, breadth and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
broad, thickness and nothing thick,
whiteness and nothing white, moisture
and nothing moist, sweetness and nothing
sweet, that is, a long, broad, thick,
white, moist, sweet nothing. The Priest
pours out nothing but Lines and Colours,
when he pours out the Wine, for these
accidents of Bread and Wine are not in
the Bread, because that is avoided and
vanisht, and they are not in the Body of
Christ, as themselves say, and yet it is
plain this Bread and Wine do nourish the
Body, and is the Body nourished by meer
accidents? Can there be plainer contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions?</p>
            <p>4. Can the same Body at the same time
have his just Dimensions, distance of
parts, symmetry, proportion, as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ hath, and yet not have
these, because all parts? Yea, the whole
Body of Christ, say they, is in one and

            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:36626:114"/>5. Can the Body of Christ, which is

and that as many times as
there are points, crumbs, drops in the
Bread or Wine?</p>
            <p>6. Can the Bread be turned into the
very Body of Christ, and yet not any
thing of that Bread become any thing of
Christ, nor the matter, nor form, nor
accidents of Bread be made either the
matter, or form, or accidents of Christ?</p>
            <p>7. Can the same thing, as Christs true
Body, at the same time be wholly above
it self, and wholly below it self, within
and without it self? Can it be moved,
and yet be still? be carried from one place
to another, and yet not move? be
brought from Heaven to Earth, and yet
not come out of Heaven? Who then can
assure us that when Christ hung upon the
Cross, he was not walking somewhere
else, Crucified and not Crucified, eaten
and not eaten, alive in one and dead in
another place?</p>
            <p>8. What dishonour do these men ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

to be eaten by wicked men, by brute
Creatures, by Mice, by other vermine,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:36626:114"/>
to be cast into some unclean place? For
so long as the form of Bread remains, so
long the Body of Christ is there, though
it be in the Mouth or Belly of a Mouse,
saith <hi>Hales,</hi> and the rest of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who do one where or another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

Absurdities, and go about to heal, and

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> We shall surcease from raking fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the ingrateful sink, whose Name
Transubstantiation is but of yesterday in
comparison, and which dishonours the Body
of Christ, into a Monster, destroyes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Sacrament, and fills the world with
dreadful Contentions and broils: And shall
now consider with our selves what may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
be observed from all this: What
therefore may be observed upon the whole
matter?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We may observe, 1. What grievous
impositions the Romanists lay upon the
Faith of them that are devoted to her
Communion.</p>
            <p>2. What contradictions and absurdities
the common people do ignorantly and

that refuse the simplicity of the truth for
interests and politick ends!</p>
            <p>4. What a Mercy of God it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us from that Tyranny, which leaves
us no other choice, but to swallow and

the Bread and Wine, so truly doth God
give them the Body and Blood of Christ,

not to their teeth, but to their Souls;
and consequently exhibits to them all the

               <hi>A.</hi> It is required of them that would
worthily partake of the Lords Supper,

look after?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Two things especially; 1. That
they have these Graces. 2. That the
said Graces be in readiness for service and
exercise, that is, that they so stir up
these Graces of the Holy Ghost, as they
may be most profitably exerted in this

receive, and sweeten their receiving the

certain Indulgences,<note place="margin">See this Indulgence in the book of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial of Bishops, page 381. of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1606.</note> By the Prayers,
and by the Merits of the holy Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
of <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel, of St. <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,
of the holy Apostles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
and of all the Saints, without any mention
at all of Iesus Christ, or his Merits?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> And is not this egregious horrid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are we therefore to Pray to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Name of Christ, and in his Name
only?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why so?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. Because none but Christ were
ever called to the honour of an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Priest-hood, to appear in the presence
of God for<note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 5. 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 9. 24, 25, 26.</note> us: And it would be sinful
in us to imagine the Saints or Angels to
usurp an Office, and assume to themselves
that honour they were never called unto
by God, as Christ was.</p>
            <p>2. Because he alone is able to save us
to the utmost; and seeing he ever liveth
to make Intercession for us (presenting
himself before God, and that one once
offered perfect Sacrifice for sin for us)
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:36626:119"/>
we should much derogate from the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of Christs undertakings, to suppose
any need of the Intercession of Saint or
Angels.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> And what is the third part of Prayer?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is Thanksgiving?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The thankful acknowledgement of,

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 99. What rule hath God given for
our direction in Prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The whole Word of God is of use
to direct us in Prayer; but the special
rule of Direction is that Form of Prayer
which Christ taught his Disciples, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the Lords Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Explic. Q.</hi> What is generally useful for
our direction in Prayer?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But have we not left us upon Record,

<hi>Luke</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why is that Form recorded in the
Gospels, called the Lords Prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because the Lord Jesus taught it his

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Of what use is the Lords Prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:36626:119"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> To direct us in Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it only of use to direct us in
Prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is not the saying the very words of
the Lords Prayer commended unto us, if not
commanded?</p>
            <p>A. <hi>Yes,</hi> Luke [Chap. 11. 2.] <hi>hath
it,</hi> When ye Pray, say, Our Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. What kind of Forms may our Prayers
be presented in?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Either in set or extemporary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prescribed
Forms.</p>
            <p>Q. Are set Forms of Prayer lawful?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Set Forms of Prayer are lawful,
both as the word [Set] signifies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate
limited Forms, as opposed to
extemporary; and as it signifies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
and for some occasions and uses
commanded.</p>
            <p>Q. How do you prove it lawful to use a
set determinate Form of words, either writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
or fastened in our memory?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is apparent both by the example
of Christ, who in St. <hi>Luke</hi> bids us, when
we pray, say, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. (Not
only pray after this Pattern, as the words
in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> may be interpreted, but
use these very words, <hi>When you pray,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:36626:120"/>
say, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2.) and
of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist, who taught his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to pray in some Form, though we
know not what it is, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1. As also
of the Priests under the Law, by Gods
appointment, that used a Set Form of
blessing the People, <hi>Numb. 6. 24, &amp;c.</hi>
And of our Saviour himself, who used a
a part (if not the whole) of the 22.
<hi>Psalm</hi> upon the Cross, <hi>My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me,</hi> &amp;c. And of
the Church of the Jews, and Christian
Churches through all times, who have
had their Liturgies, as waies and Forms
of serving God publickly, and as means
to preserve the true Religion from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
in Doctrine. And to these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may be aded one more of common
observation, that even when the Minister
(or whosoever is the mouth of the rest)
prayeth, though in a Form of his own
present extemporary effusion, yet at that
time all others present are limited to his
conceptions, and pray in as stinted a Form,
as if what the Minister prays were read
out of a Book, or dictated by his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But how do you prove it lawful to use a
Set (as that signifies a prescribed) Form of
Prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:36626:120"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is apparent, 1. By Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
one, which he would not sure
have done, if it had not been lawful to
have used it being prescribed; and so
also, 2. By the other examples mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which are most of them prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
3. By the no Objection against the
use of them; For sure, if it be lawful to
use them, it is lawful to prescribe them at
some time, and for some uses, (for that
a thing in it self acknowledged, and
proved to be lawful, should by being
commanded by lawful Authority become
unlawful, is very unreasonable, unless
lawful Magistrates be the only unlawful
things) and at other times to use other
liberty is not forbidden, and so hereby
there is not any invasion or Tyranny used
upon our Christian liberty. 4. By the
great benefit that accrues to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
in having discreet well formed
Prayers, and so not subject to the tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and impertinences of the sudden effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
and the same still in constant use,
and so not strange or new to them, but
such as in which they may with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
go along with the Minister, and
by the help of their Memory the most ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
may carry them away for his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:36626:121"/>
use, and generally those that want
such helps, are by this means afforded
them. And lastly, by the consideration
of this one special farther advantage of
them, <hi>viz.</hi> that by means of prescribed
Liturgies the Unity of Faith, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is much preserved.</p>
            <p>Q Well then, supposing these Set Forms
to be lawful in themselves, and lawful to
be prescribed; whether may any other be
used but such?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea doubtless:<note place="margin">See <hi>H's</hi> practical Catechism, <hi>p.</hi> 239.</note> For the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obeyed in the observance of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
Liturgy in publick, permits some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
(and upon special incidental oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
prescribes) other Forms in the
publick Congregation, so it be done pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
and piously, and reverently, and
to Edification; and so also in the Family,
or in visitation of the sick, if the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
condition of one or other do require
it: and in private, in the Closet, it is
not supposed by the Church of <hi>England</hi>
but that every one may ask his own wants
in what form of words he shall think fit;
which that he may do fitly and reverently,
it will not be amiss for him to acquaint
himself with the several addresses to God,
which the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> and other
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:36626:121"/>
parts of holy Writ, and all other helps of
devotion will afford him, either to use as
he finds them fit for the present purpose,
or by those patterns to direct and prepare
himself to do the like.</p>

stand in no need of our Prayers,

receive no good by them, or by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
sacrifice of the Mass.</p>

go to Purgatory?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They tell us that the souls of the
impenitent do not go to Purgatory, but

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They say in Purgatory, the fore-mentioned

               <hi>Q</hi> The Papists profess to believe with us,
That the blood of Iesus Christ purgeth and

If all sins are washed away, and purged by
the blood of Christ, what then remains to be

Purgatory, for (according to the Romish
Doctrine) it serves not to purge, but to
punish souls, and to satisfie Gods Justice;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:36626:123"/>

of finite and mutable Creatures, which
are but of yesterday, should satisfie the

               <hi>Q.</hi> How may it be proved that we are
delivered from the whole punishment of
sin, temporal and Eternal, by the death of
Christ: So that we shall not need to fear
their fear, who through fear of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory-fire,
are all their life-time subject to

to make God any satisfaction for them.
And therefore must we certainly be all
doomed alike to go to Purgatory, that
place of so great pain, that the most
torturing wheels, and the most ardent
fires are nothing in comparison of it, if

which our Adversaries, the learned of them

            <p>2. If the place be taken in a spiritual

a Prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The case hath so much difficulty in
it, that a short answer must not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cted
to so great questions, as are
couched in it; yet we will endeavour to
give an answer thereunto, as briefly as
we can in these following Conclusions:
Some of which will be of use to us as
rules of direction to lead us into the
sound knowledge of these and other
mysteries of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:36626:129"/>1. That in all parts of divine worship,
and so in this of Prayer, the Trinity in
Unity, and Unity in Trinity is to be
worshipped and respected. Or, That
we ought so to think of God in Prayer
as one in Essence, yet three in Persons:
and so as three in Persons, that he is but
one in Essence.</p>
            <p>2. That we ought so to think in Prayer
of some one Person in the Trinity, as
thereby to be led to the other two: The
Father being in the Son, and the Son in
the Father, and the Holy Ghost in them
both<note n="u" place="margin">Joh. 14. 9, 10, 16, 17 and 15. 26 Isa. 48. 16</note>.</p>
            <p>3. That in order, we are first to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
our Prayers to the blessed Father;
yet not as first, or chief in honour and
dignity above the other two, but as first
in order of subsisting: according as the
Scripture in two places, where the order
of the blessed Persons is set down, the
Father is first set down in order of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing,
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 7. and invocation and
worship, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
            <p>4. In singling out any one Person in
the blessed Trinity, we are to pitch most
usually on the Father, as he to whom we
direct our Prayers through the mediation
of Christ, and by the help of the Holy
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:36626:129"/>
Ghost: That is the Rule and method
prescribed by Christ, to ask the Father in
his Name, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 23. and suitable is
and hath been the usual practice of the
Saints: And yet in such directings of
Prayers most what as to the Father in the
general intention of their Spirits, do the
Saints mind and eye the other two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and include them as joyntly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped;
and therefore in their Prefaces
of Prayer they do oftimes mention ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
that blessed God one in Essence,
yet three in Persons, as he to whom they
speak; and in the close they subscribe
glory to the blessed Father, Son and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
three Persons yet one God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. We may single out the Son of God,
the Lord Jesus Christ, as he to whom we
occasionally present some special request,
either by way of Apostrophe, whilst we
are directing our Prayers to the Father,
or in way of Ej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>culation: as did <hi>Stephen,
Acts 7. 59. Lord Iesus receive my Spirit.</hi>
And so in the instance of that short
prayer of the Converted Thief, <hi>Luke</hi>
23. 42. <hi>Lord, remember me when thou
comest into thy Kingdom;</hi> and so in that
short Prayer of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s, <hi>The Angel which
redeemed me from all evil, bless the Lads,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:36626:130"/>
Gen.</hi> 48. 16. this Angel was Christ:
And in more continued and solemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
did <hi>Abraham</hi> pray to that Angel,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 18. To him did <hi>Iacob</hi> pray again,
and make supplication, by the space al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of the whole night, and had power
over him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. from Verse 24. to
the end, compared with <hi>Hos.</hi> 12. 3, 4.
And the Reasons hereof are evident,</p>
            <p>1. Because Prayer is a divine worship
of God as God<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 5. 4</note>; and therefore due to
the Son, and so to the Holy Ghost as well
as to the Father. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>2. We are Baptized into the Name of
the Son, and the Holy Ghost, as well as
into the Name of the Father: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both the Son and the Holy Ghost
may be particularly and personally invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
and worshipped as well as the
Father<note n="x" place="margin">Joh. 14. 1</note>.</p>
            <p>3. We are to believe in the Son, and
so in the Holy Ghost as well as in the
Father, and that personally and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly:
and therefore so are to pray to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
That which the Apostle expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of the Gentiles trusting in Christ,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 12. the Prophet expressed of
their seeking to him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 10. So that
they are inseparably due to one and the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:36626:130"/>
same Christ, upon one and the same
ground; see <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13, 14. before
mentioned. It is supposed that he on
whom men call, he must be believed on,
or else he cannot be called upon by any;
and when the Apostle in the 13. Verse,
mentions the Name of the Lord, as that
which is called upon, he in Verse 14.
expounds it to be meant of the Lord
himself: to call upon the Lords Name,
is to call upon himself.</p>
            <p>4. The Lord Jesus promiseth that he
will do what we ask, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 23, 24.
and therefore he may be sought to do the
same; and indeed he proveth himself to
be equal with the Father by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because Petitions shall not only be
granted in his Name, but by him: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth he make account that this is any
disparagement to the Father, but a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of him, and therefore when he
saith, <hi>Iob. 17. 1. Father glorifie thy Son,</hi>
he immediately adds, <hi>that thy Son also
may glorifie thee.</hi> What is said to prove
that in our Prayers we may single out the
Son of God, may serve to prove the
same may be done to the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Against this which hath been said, it
may be objected, we are to ask all we do ask in
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:36626:131"/>
the Name of Christ; and therefore how can
we be said to ask him, or Pray to him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. The Lord Jesus Christ is asked
or prayed unto in that prayer that is put
up to the Father in his Name, <hi>Iob.</hi> 16 23.
Christ speaking of the time after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
and Ascension, saith, <hi>In that
day ye shall ask me nothing:</hi> or (which
is all one) <hi>Verily, ye shall ask the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nothing in my Name, but be will give
it you.</hi> He is glorified as God, in that
all is done with God in his Name, and
for his Father. For albeit it be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
said, For <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi>'s
sake God will do this or that; yet this
is meant in reference to Gods Covenant
of Grace with them, and so to Christ
properly, in whom that Covenant is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
<hi>Gal. 3. 17. They called on the
Name of the Lord Iesus Christ in every
place,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 2. Yet surely they brake
not that Rule, <hi>Iob.</hi> 16. 23. They called
on the Father in Christs Name, even in
their calling upon God in his Name:
and Christ as God is also called upon,
in that his Father as God is called
upon.</p>
            <p>2. In all external worship of God,
one Person of the Trinity being Named,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:36626:131"/>
the other are understood, and are not to
be excluded: the Trinity being undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in worship.</p>
            <p>3. If Christ be considered as the Son
of God in Essence with the Father, He
is he to whom we come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Coming
in Prayer to the Father: If considered as
Mediator, God incarnate, God and Man,
He is he by whom we come to the Father,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. As the Son
of God, He may be, he must be prayed
to, which is God and Man in one Person;
but is not prayed to as Man, but as
God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. What are those Petitions which
you offer up to God the Father, Son and
Holy Ghost?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are Six: In the three first

            <p>GOD spake all these words, saying,
I am the Lord thy God, which
have brought thee out of the Land of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the House of Bondage.</p>
            <p>1. Thou shalt have no other Gods before
me.</p>
            <p>2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any
graven Image, or any likeness of any
thing that is in Heaven above, or that is
in the Earth beneath, or that is in the Water
under the Earth: Thou shalt not bow down
thy self to them, not serve them: For I
the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting
the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
unto the third and fourth Generation
of them that hate me: and shewing mercy
unto thousands of them that love me and
keep my Commandments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:36626:139"/>3. Thou shalt not take the Name of the
Lord thy God in vain: For the Lord will
not hold him guiltless that taketh his Name
in vain.</p>
            <p>4. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it
holy: Six daies shalt thou labour and do all
thy work: but the seventh day is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt
not do any work, thou, nor thy Son, nor
thy Daughter, thy Man-servant, nor thy
Maid-servant, nor thy Cattle, nor thy
Stranger that is within thy Gates: For
in six daies the Lord made Heaven and
Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and
rested the Seventh day; wherefore the Lord
blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
            <p>5. Honour thy Father and thy Mother,
that thy daies may be long upon the Land
which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</p>
            <p>6. Thou shalt not Kill.</p>
            <p>7. Thou shalt not commit Adultery.</p>
            <p>8. Thou shalt not Steal.</p>
            <p>9. Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy Neighbour.</p>
            <p>10. Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbours
House, thou shalt not covet thy Neighbours
Wife, nor his Man-Servant, nor his Maid-Servant,

Take these few,</p>

<hi>Let's take heed of taking figures literally,
and of wresting the proper sense into fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is to be supposed that some places
of Scripture are true, both in the Type
and Antitype, both in the literal and
mystical sense. And, <hi>Verba sacrae Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae
sunt praegnantia, pariunt gemellos &amp;
sensum geminum admittunt.</hi> The words
of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cred Writ are pregnant with matter,
very fruitful, and sometimes bear twins
and admit a double sense: And 'tis an
unerring Rule in Divinity; Scripture is
alwaies to be expounded in the largest
sense; unless there be in or about the Text
some particular restriction to limit it;
and thus those words,<note place="margin">Psal. 109 8 and Acts 1 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Let another take
his Office,</hi> are true both of <hi>Doeg</hi> and
<hi>Iudas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. It is to be observed, that in Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
some particulars agree to the Type,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:36626:145"/>
and not to the Truth; some to the Truth,
and not to the Type; or to the Type in
one sense, to the Truth in another. Take
this Head because somewhat large in its
particular branches.</p>
               <p>1. Some particulars agree to the Type
and not to the Truth. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 12.</p>
               <p>2. Some to the Truth, and not to the
Type. <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 10. with <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 29.
and 13. 35, 36, 37.</p>
               <p>3. Or to the Type in one sense, and to
the Truth in another. So in those <hi>Psalms</hi>
wherein <hi>David</hi> is a Type of Christ: As
<hi>Psal.</hi> 2. and 16. and 22. and those in
which <hi>Solomon;</hi> as <hi>psal.</hi> 45. and 72.
Some things are spoken that must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
be understood of them in one No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
of Christ in another. Of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s
Daughter espoused to <hi>Solomon;</hi>
and the Church to Christ; the one typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the other, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. the same
may be said. <hi>Gatak.</hi> in <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.</p>
               <p>But how may we know when we are
to interpret in the literal, and when in
the mystical sense?</p>
               <p>These three Rules will in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
direct us.</p>
               <p>1. The first is <hi>Augustines</hi> golden Rule,
<hi>Si praeceptiva locutio est aut flagitium aut
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:36626:145"/>
facinus vetans,</hi> &amp;c. If it be a precept for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
any lewdness, or commanding
something profitable or beneficial, there
is no figure in the words, <hi>Take, eat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 24, 25</note>
                  <hi>this do in remembrance of me. This do ye,
as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</hi>
Indeed, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> &amp;c. cannot be
taken in the literal sense, for the reasons
to be mentioned afterwards; But <hi>take,
eat,</hi> &amp;c. because a preceptive speech,
and commanding a necessary profitable
duty, and I am afraid a much neglected
duty too, we are not to suppose a figure
in the words. If there be sins of<note n="*" place="margin">Plura sunt peccata pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vativa quam posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva.</note> Omission,
as without controversie there are; then
those who have not communicated in this
Ordinance, or not frequently, cannot but
be found guilty of a dangerous sinful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.
Nothing but ignorance and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism
in the most proper and literal
sense can turn this divine precept into an
Allegory. Some are so fond as to think
that this Precept imports no more than
feeding upon Christ out of and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of this Sacrament: Such self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
Gnosticks cannot rationally expect
the Churches welcom, <hi>Eat O Friends,
drink, yea drink abundantly, O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi>
And if ever such Spiritualists
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:36626:146"/>
were really fed by Christ, they were no
doubt better fed than taught. But if
any man seem to be contentious, we
have not so learned Christ, neither the
Churches of God.</p>
               <p>2. When the Text taken properly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
a fit sense, nor doth ought appear
in the Context, or other places collated
that may cross it, it is not safe running
into metaphorical senses. And thus we
understand those Buyers and Sellers,
whom our Saviour cast out of the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 12. in the Letter, and not
in the Allegory; although some Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
of our times, giving way to their
own luxuriant fancies, have turned this,
and all the History of the Gospel into a
mysterie, or rather a groundless conceit
of their own brains.</p>
               <p>3. Indeed when the words taken in
the Letter are absurd and contradictory
to sense and reason, we must of necessity
apply our selves to the figurate sense.
And surely he is bruitish and hath not
the understanding of a man, that will
Interpret against all sense and reason.
Reason doth not contradict sense, nor
Faith reason, but only correct them when
they exercise themselves in great matters,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:36626:146"/>
and in things too high for them, and
beyond their Sphear: And 'tis fit that
sense should give place to reason, and
reason to Faith; as it did in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
case, who, <hi>Rom</hi> 4. 18. [against Hope,
or rather beyond Hope] (as the words
may be better rendred) <hi>i. e.</hi> above all
causes, arguments and appearances of
natural Hope, such as reason and humane
understanding could afford or reach to
[believed in Hope] <hi>i. e.</hi> in Hope ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the truth and power of God.
For although there be in Scripture,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 16</note>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, some things hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
yet there is nothing in it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to right reason. Although in
this life and imperfect state, we see
<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>creditae</hi>) yet there
is alwaies <hi>ratio credendi;</hi> Because infinite
wisdom cannot be deceived, and infinite
goodness will not deceive. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the forementioned Rules, we may
be satisfied against the Papists literal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of that known place, <hi>This
is my Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:36626:147"/>1. Because the letter is contrary and
repugnant to our senses; which the
Scripture it self intimates to be of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
certainty.</p>
               <p>2. It is absurd and contradictive of
right reason.</p>
               <p>3. There appears much in the context
to cross it, nothing at all to countenance
it.</p>
               <p>4. Because other places collated, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
thwart and contradict it.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Rule.</hi> Let the fuller Scripture make
out the shorter. We must compare the
shorter place with the larger, <hi>i. e.</hi> the
place that speaks but briefly of a thing,
with some other that speaks of it more
at large, common observation tells us,
that 'tis not the right method to read ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts
first; because though they be fuller
of matter, they are fuller likewise of
obscurity. And sometimes that of the
learned <hi>Bacon</hi> proves true, That Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
are the corruptions and moths of
Histories. Epitomes give us the substance
of a matter; but full Narratives must
clear it up to us, with all its due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
A compendium gives us the
Quintessence; Vertue, Force and Spirit
of a thing; but the History at large is
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:36626:147"/>
necessary to the right understanding of it.</p>
               <p>3. Let the clearer Scripture clear the
obscurer. We must compare the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurer
with the clearer, <hi>i. e.</hi> if any
place occur which is more obscure, but
elsewhere propounded to us in words
that are more clear; we must have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

must compare <hi>Moses</hi> with the Prophets:
Of all the Prophets <hi>Esaias</hi> speaks most
clearly, who is therefore stiled the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical

with the New: In the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Testament the Book of the Revelations
is deemed (by those Interpreters that
are wise unto sobriety, and not above
what is written) to stand in most need
of interpretation by the other written
Revelations. The Sacred Scriptures are
written very much historically; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
being interspersed with the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Some Eyangelists speak more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than others; some most clearly of
one part of the History of Christ, some
of another; that all of them collated
(without conspiring together by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
design) might give us the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat

History of Christ. That you may
see the usefulness of this Rule, consult
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 16, 17, 18. with 28, 29 <hi>verses</hi>
compared together.</p>
               <p>4. Let that Scripture determine the
point that intends it. You must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
Scripture with Scripture, and you
must compare them aright; compare the
place that speaks, <hi>ex casu,</hi> occasionally

nice the distinctions of Conformity and

either of them will be in attaining Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for us without a reformed life.</p>
               <p>10. We must carefully distinguish of
the Scripture, which speaks of the growth
of the Church, from that which speaks
of the infancy of it. And thus, as for
the Discipline of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
our <hi>English</hi> Reformers considered
what it was in the purest times of the
first good Christ an Emperours, when the
Church was in its growth: For the times
of Persecution in the infancy of the Church
(before temporal Princes embraced the
Christian Faith) as they were most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
times for doctrine and manners;
so very unproper and unfit for a Pattern
or example of outward Government and
Policy. And doubtless, that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is most excellent, both in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
as Christian, and in the special
notion as reformed, that keepeth the
middle way between the Pomp of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:36626:149"/>
Tyranny, and the meanness of
Phanatick Anarchy: And this can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, but a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>l regulated moderate
Episcopacy, according to this Rule.</p>
               <p>11. That which the Scripture holds
forth at all times, must not be prejudiced
by what may take in one particular case:
although, <hi>Necessitas est jus temporis,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
be a Law in its time. This is a
Rule at all times, Borrow and pay again:
This must not be prejudiced by that of
the <hi>Israelites</hi> borrowing of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
This must not determine, <hi>Ehud</hi> destroyed
<hi>Eglon,</hi> therefore thou shalt kill, because 'tis
not safe arguing from particulars to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
duties.</p>
               <p>12. Out of the Tradition and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the truly Catholick Church,
out of the consent of the Fathers; and
of these, either of many or of few of
them when eminent for sanctity or learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
out of the unanimous conspiration
of Doctors and Interpreters, the true
and literal sense of Holy Writ may be
often cleared up unto us.</p>
               <p>By universal Tradition is meant, <hi>Quod
ab omnibus, quod ubique, quod semper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum
fuit.</hi> What all the Churches of
Christ in all places, have ever successively
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:36626:150"/>
received, that is universal Tradition;
and he is no true Catholick that doth
not receive it. Where there is a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
consent and harmony to bear witness
to any Interpretation, and that sense is
universally and solemnly accepted; as it
will seem a wilful errour to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it, and to choose solitary and dangerous
by-paths, where the open road is so free
and safe; so what can be expected in
such singularity, but many absurdities,
and implications, and violences offered to
the word and truth?</p>
               <p>13. We must interpret according to
the Analogy of Faith.<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 6 2 Tim. 1. 13</note> We must <hi>hold
fast the form of sound words.</hi> Examine
the Interpretations of the holy Scriptures
by those three Forms, the Creed, the ten
Commandments, and the Lords Prayer.
Mistake not, you are not to examine the
Scriptures by any thing else, nor the
sense of them neither by any Creed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than it contains it self within the
very terms verbal or real of the holy
Scriptures themselves. But as the Creed
contains it self within such terms, we
are to hold it fast as a form of sound
words. And as by the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we may discern what are the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:36626:150"/>
words of God, and what are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of men; and by the Lords
Prayer, what Petitions we are to put up
to God, and what Prayers we are to say
<hi>Amen</hi> to: so by the Creed we may know
what doctrines are of God, and what
of men: And let what will be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if any man teach otherwise, and

               <p>Suffer the word of Exhortation; You
that are much in reading the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
content not your selves with
bare reading, but in the use of all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:36626:151"/>
means endeavour to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what you read of them.</p>
               <p>To perswade hereunto take these two
Motives.</p>
               <p>1. The bare reading of the holy
Scriptures will be unprofitable to you.
It will be to you as he that speaketh in
an unknown tongue,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 2, 9, 14</note> whom none of
you understandeth; or as he that
speaketh into the air, whose speech
is unfruitful. Indeed the Scripture is
the Water of life, but to you the
fountain is sealed. It is as the Garden
of the Lord; But behold <hi>Cherubims, and
a flaming Sword,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 24</note> 
                  <hi>which turneth every
way, to keep the way of the Tree of
Life.</hi> You are kept out of this Garden,
while you are kept ignorant of the
true sense and meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is as the Soul and Life of
it. It is a Vision, but the Vision be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
to you as the words of a
Book that is Sealed, which men deliver
to one that is learned, saying, Read
this I pray thee; and he saith, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
for it is Sealed. By what hath
in brief been said, you see that the
bare unintelligent reading of the holy
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:36626:152"/>
Scriptures themselves,<note place="margin">Isa. 44. 10</note> is in this like a
a Graven Image which we are sure is
profitable for nothing.</p>
               <p>2. But contrariwise, if you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what you read, the Scripture of
all writings, will be the most profi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto you, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. 'Tis by
way of eminency called The Scripture, as
the Original first writing, as the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
of God.</p>
               <p>It is in <hi>Genere materiae,</hi> sufficient to
save our souls. It is as that Tree menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,<note place="margin">Psal. 19. and 119.</note>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 2. which bare twelve

were for the healing of the Nation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.
There is more weight in one Sentence of
Scripture than in all Orations, Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Poets, Satyrs, and Philosophick
invectives. It was a wise observation of
<hi>Scaliger,</hi> that some passages in <hi>Plato</hi> are
wiser than their Authour, and many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
conceits are recollected from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and <hi>Aristotle</hi> they never dreamed of:
But in the Word of God it is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
for after all the recollections that
have been made by the most acute Sages of
the world; we must say with the Queen
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:36626:152"/>
of <hi>Sheba</hi> in another case, the one half
hath not been told us. I shall therefore
conclude this Exhortation and Discourse
in the words of holy and learned <hi>Baxter,
As you love your Comfort, your Faith,
your Hope, your Safety, your Innocency,
your Souls, your Christ, your Everlasting
Rest; Love, Reverence, Read, Search,
Study, Obey, and stick close to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
