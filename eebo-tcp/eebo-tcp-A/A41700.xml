            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable JAMES, Earl of <hi>ABINGDON,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>My</hi> LORD,</p>
            <p>THIS Play, which I humbly here present to your Lordship, was, at first, only meant as a private Tryal to my self, of what I cou'd do in this kind of Poesie; I had not the least hope of ever seeing it on the Stage. After 'twas finish'd, it lay by me for some time, as a thing forgot and totally neglected; till an Ingenious Gentleman of my Acquaintance, who took the pains to peruse it, gave me incouragement to look it over a little heedfully, as seeing something in it (he was pleas'd to say) that, with Improvement, might make it accepted on the Stage. I took his Council: But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found so much interruption and discouragement from some prejudic'd Gentlemen, who ought to have us'd me better, or, at least, had no reason to use me ill, that I repented I had bestow'd any time upon it, tho' indeed 'twas but little. But they now, however, see the Folly and Arrogance of being positive before hand; and that 'tis not a private Taste, but the general Acceptance that ought to determine in these Matters. In spite of 'em, my Lord, it was kindly receiv'd, and that too, at a time when the Town was never known thinner of Nobility
<pb facs="tcp:97873:4"/>
and Gentry; a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fortune, I neither expected or deserv'd: For I must do my Enemies the Justice to declare, they can't have so mean an Opinion of it as my self. And this Consideration, my Lord, obliges me at once to beg Pardon for making You a Present of such a Trifle, and to reflect on what I am doing; for I have hitherto rather entertain'd your Lordship with an <hi>Advertisement</hi> than a <hi>Dedication:</hi> But, I confess, it was purposely so intended; for your Lordship, I am sensible, had rather hear any thing than your own Praises. Never was so much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty joyn'd with a Temper so Heroick and Noble; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was so engaging a Condescention seen, in One of so great a Fortune and Extraction; Never was there a Zeal for Religion more stedfast and temperate than your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's; or a Charity, ev'n in the Primitive Times of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, more diffusive and impartial; and never, indeed, were our Dedications directed to a more Judicious and Generous Patron, where the Merit of Authors is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly rewarded, and their Failings as certainly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. I cou'd here, methinks, with a great deal of Ardor, go into your Panegyrick: But tho' I my self, in respect to your Lordship, am silent upon that admirable Subject, the many Books laid at your Feet in this Age, will be Testimonies to the succeeding, how much your Lordship is the Delight and Esteem of it: Whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of this Piece, Posterity will there find You, and in more shining and durable Colours than cou'd be laid by the unskilful Pencil of,</p>
            <p>My Lord, Your Lordship's entirely obliged and most humble Servant,</p>

               <l>And <hi>Collin,</hi> fell together by the Ears,</l>

               <l>If't had not pleas'd the Commons,—'twou'd the Peers:</l>
               <l>Or else how Master Justice, and his Spouse,</l>
               <l>Rated their Eldest Daughter, splay foot Blowse,</l>
               <l>With Mutton Fist, broad Face, and sorrel Hair,</l>
               <l>And chuffy Cheeks, red-streak'd like <hi>Kath'rine Pear,</hi>
               </l>

               <l>This now had brought a Harvest to us Players,</l>
               <l>Certain to please you—that ne'er go to Prayers.</l>
               <l>Or did the Play expose some Rattling Squire,</l>

               <l>Who thus Caress'd by her rough bristl'd Dear,</l>
               <l>Dreams of a Hedge-Hog, and turns off for fear.</l>
               <l>Nay, had the Fool but search'd the Hundred thorow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <l>I fear it will prove fatal to the Stage:</l>
               <l>For now of Wit and Gold w'ave such strange store,</l>
               <l>That the excess of it does make us Poor:</l>
               <l>Ev'n in the midst of Plenty we shall fall.</l>
               <l>Criticks and Clippers have undone us all.</l>
               <l>In former Times, when we were at no Charge,</l>
               <l>When Wit was narrow, and Half-Crown was large,</l>
               <l>When Cit in Cloak came pleas'd to see our Whims,</l>
               <l>And brought Queen <hi>Bess</hi>'s Shillings broad as his Hat brims;</l>
               <l>Then was a glorious thriving Time for Players;</l>
               <l>When the dull Crowd, unskill'd in these Affairs,</l>
               <l>To day wou'd laugh with us, to morrow with the Bears:</l>

His Closet's a perfect Apothecary's Shop, furnish'd with all sorts of Drugs, and his Conduct indeed has made it but necessary—He, perhaps, gives the Disease to his House-keeper; she stoops as low as to the Horses heels, and transmits it to the Groom; he conveys it from the Stable to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, and from thence it goes back with the clean Linnen to their Master. So that the Pox in his Family, like the blood in his Veins, is in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Circnlation.</p>
