         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Your Friends may come to you at ſeaſonable times, in the preſence of the Keeper; you ſhall have any thing that is reaſonable, but the Safety of the Government muſt be look'd after. Therefore, Keeper of <hi>Newgate,</hi> take back your Priſoners, and bring them here this day ſevennight at 7 a Clock in the Morning, without any other Order.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>They ſtaid at the Bar about Half an hour, the Judges conſulting among themſelves about the Precept for the Petty Jury upon a late Act of Parliament which has appointed ſix days for the Jury to be ſummon'd before they appear to try any Cauſe, and upon the laſt Act in Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Tryals in Caſes of High-Treaſon; which requires that the Priſoner ſhall have a Copy of the Pannel of the Jury duly return'd, at leaſt two days before his Tryal.</p>
               <p>Then the Priſoners were carried away; and the Grand Jury with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to conſider of the Evidence againſt <hi>Knightley,</hi> and in a Quarter of an Hour came back, and being called over, delivered in a Bill to the Court.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cl. of Arr.</speaker>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you are content the Court ſhall amend Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Form, or Falſe <hi>Latin</hi> in this Indictment, without altering any Matter of Subſtance without your Privity.</p>
               </sp>

               </sp>
               <p>Then the Judges reſumed the Debate among themſelves, and at laſt reſolved that there ſhould go three ſeveral <hi>Venires</hi> for the Petty-Jury, returnable this day ſevennight; one to try between the King and <hi>Robert Lowick,</hi> the ſecond to try between the King and <hi>Ambroſe Rookwood,</hi> and a third between the King and <hi>Charles Cranburn</hi>; becauſe, though the Indictment be againſt them jointly, yet it was a ſeveral Offence in every one of them, and they might ſever in their Challenges, and that would be troubleſome, and therefore it was thought beſt to ſever them in their Tryals; and therefore the Court adjourned for an Hour or ſomething more, while the Precepts for the Jury were preparing, and according to the Adjournment met, and ſigned and ſealed the Precepts, and then Adjourned the Seſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> until this day ſevennight, at ſeven in the Morning.</p>

                  <p>If your Lordſhip pleaſes, We have a Doubt or two to propoſe to your Lordſhip, in reſpect of the Tryal this Day: But before I offer it, we beg your Favour for a Word in behalf of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, We are Aſſigned of Council, in purſuance of an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and we hope that nothing which we ſhall ſay in Defence of our Clients, ſhall be imputed to our ſelves. I thought it would have been a Reflection upon the Government and your Lordſhips Juſtice, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aſſigned we ſhould have refuſed to appear; 'twould have been a Publication to the World, That we diſtruſted your Candour towards us in our future Practiſe upon other Occaſions. But, my Lord, there can be no reaſon for ſuch a Fear, I am ſure I have none; for we muſt acknowledge, we who have been Practiſers at this Bar eſpecially, that there was never a Reign or Government within the memory of Man, wherein ſuch Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſuch eaſineſs of Temper hath been ſhewn from the Court to the Council, as there always hath been. Never was there ſuch freedom and liberty of Debate and Argument allowed to the Bar, and we thank your Lordſhip for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58191:5"/>My Lord, We come not here to countenance the Practiſes for which the Priſoner ſtands Accuſed, nor the Principles upon which ſuch Practiſes may be preſumed to be founded; for we know of none either Religious, or Civil that can Warrant or Excuſe them. But the Act of Parliament having warranted the appearing of Councel for Perſons Accuſed to make De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for them, we hope your Lordſhip will give us leave to make what Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections we can on their behalf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>Look ye, Sir <hi>B. Shower,</hi> go on with your Objections; let us hear what you have to ſay.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, It appears to be a Doubt to us, upon this Act of Parliament, whether this Cauſe can be tryed this Day: And if it be a Doubt, we hope, though it ſhould not have that weight with the Court, that we apprehend it has; yet your Lordſhip will excuſe us, and ſettle it according to your Judgment. The Act requires, That all that ſhall be Accuſed and Indicted for High-Treaſon, whereby any Corruption of Blood may, or ſhall be made to any ſuch Offender or Offenders, or to any the Heir or Heirs of any ſuch Offender or Offenders, or for Miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch Treaſon, ſhall have a true Copy of the whole Indictment; and afterwards ſhall have Copies of the Pannel of the Jurors who are to try them, duely Returned by the Sheriff and delivered unto them. And every of them ſo Accuſed and Indicted reſpectively two Days at the leaſt before he, or they ſhall be Tryed for the ſame. Now if your Lordſhip will pleaſe to caſt your Eye upon this <hi>Venire Facias,</hi> and it will appear to be Returned but this Day, and that is not according to the intent of this Law. And it is impoſſible then, if it be as we apprehend it, and put it, that this Tryal ſhould go on at this time, and that this Conſtruction ſhould be ſo as we ſay; not only the Words, but, as we take it, the Intent and Meaning of the Act of Parliament too are for us, that there ought to have been a Copy of the Pannel after the Return two Days before the Tryal. For in the firſt place, My Lord, the Words are plain; It muſt be a Copy of the Pannel duely Returned by the Sheriff. Now though it be a Copy of the Array of the Pannel which we have delivered to us, ye it is not a Copy of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Jurors Returned; for it is no Return till it come into Court. And the King's Councel muſt admit, that in the Caſe of all Writs Retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, it cannot be ſaid that there is a Return, where there is a Writing upon the back, or a Label annexed, till it be actually Returned into Court. As in the Caſe of a <hi>Fieri Facias,</hi> or a <hi>Mandamus,</hi> an Action for a falſe Return cannot lye, till the Writ be actually Returned. For ſuch Action muſt be brought into the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> where the Court reſides, before whom the Return is made, and not in the County where the Sheriff lived that made the Return; for it is not a Return till filed in Court. Now here the Words of the Act are; <hi>He ſhall have a Copy of the Pannel of the Jurors who are to try him, duely Returned by the Sheriff two Days before the Tryal.</hi> Now we humbly inſiſt that the Words duely Returned muſt be antecedent to the having the Copy, or elſe he cannot be ſaid to have a Copy of the Pannel duely Returned. The Act of Parliament does not ſay which ſhall be duely Returned; and therefore there does ariſe a Doubt, whether your Lordſhip will not direct us to have a Copy after the Return made, which is but this Day.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
                  <p>If your Lordſhip pleaſes to ſpare me a Word of the ſame ſide: We take it, that by this Act of Parliament the Jury muſt be duly returned before the Pannel is delivered to us. Now the Return is the Anſwer that is Indorſed upon the Writ with the Pannel annexed, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58191:5"/>
delivered into Court; for the Return is to the Court, and till it be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into Court, it cannot properly be ſaid to be a Return. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Copy of this Pannel has been delivered unto us two or three Days ago. But the <hi>Venire</hi> being not returned till to Day, we think we have not a Copy of the Pannel within the intent of, and according to the Act of Parliament. And I deſire to put your Lordſhip this Caſe: This Act of Parliament does likewiſe provide, that the Priſoner ſhould have a Copy of his Indictment five Days before his Tryal, to enable him to conſult with his Council how to plead and defend himſelf; ſuppoſe then a Copy of a Bill that is intended to be preſented to the Grand Jury, be delivered to the Perſon accuſed five Days before the Grand Jury are to meet, and they afterwards meet, and find it, and the Party is brought imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and arraign'd upon it: This is a true Copy of the Indictment, yet certainly the intent of the Act of Parliament is not anſwered, for it was not a true Copy of the Indictment at the time it was deliver'd. And I take this Caſe to be under the ſame reaſon. This is not a Pannel duely returned, till now; and therefore by conſequence we have not that Advantage that this Act of Parliament intended to give us; for which reaſon we humbly apprehend we ought not to be tryed to Day; which we ſubmit to your Lordſhip.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>What ſay you to it, Mr. Attorney.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, with ſubmiſſion, this Objection will receive a very plain Anſwer. If I underſtand it aright, they ſay that they ought to have a Copy of the Pannel after it is returned, and that it cannot be ſaid to be duly delivered, according to the Proviſion in this Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, till after the <hi>Venire facias</hi> be duly returned into the Court, and then they are to have it two Days before they are tryed. They ſay the <hi>Venire facias</hi> is returned but to Day, and ſo the Copy delivered to them, is not purſuant to the Act of Parliament; and ſo they cannot be tryed to Day: This I take to be the Objection. But with Submiſſion, <hi>My Lord,</hi> it will be plain both by the Words of the Act, and the Reaſon and Intention of it, that there is no Occaſion at all, nor no Neceſſity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Writ returned before the Copy of the Pannel be delivered. The Words of the Act of Parliament are theſe; <hi>That every Perſon and Perſons who ſhall be accuſed, indicted, and tried for Treaſon, or Miſpriſion of Treaſon, after the</hi> 25<hi>th. of</hi> March, 96, <hi>ſhall have Copies of the Pannel of the Jurors who are to try them, duly returned by the Sheriff, and delivered to them two Days before they be tryed.</hi> Now firſt, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I think it is apparent what the Meaning and Deſign of the Act of Parliament was, that the Priſoner ſhould know two Days before the Tryal, who were the Jury that were to paſs upon him, that he might have an Opportunity to conſider how he ſhould make his Challenges as he thought fit, and time to enquire into the Qualifications of them, that if there were any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ground of Challenge, he might not loſe that Benefit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that if he has a Copy of the Pannel array'd by the Sheriff, which is afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by the Sheriff into Court, and there is no variation of that Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel afterwards; then certainly the End and Intent of the Act is entirely purſued; for by that means the Priſoner has the Names of all the Jury returned, and are afterwards called, and has a full Opportunity of making ſuch Challenges as he thinks fit. And as the Reaſon and Intent of the Act is anſwered by this Conſtruction, ſo the very Words of the Act are anſwered: For it is not ſaid in the Act, that he ſhall have a Copy of the Pannel after it is return'd, but it is ſaid a Copy of the Pannel duely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58191:6"/>
by the Sheriff; that is, when the Sheriff has arrayed a Pannel, then he is to have a Copy of that Pannel; and if afterwards the Sheriff return the ſame Pannel into Court, is not this a Copy of the Pannel du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return'd? With Submiſſion it is, and ſufficient to anſwer both the Words and Intention of the Act of Parliament. It is true, <hi>My Lord,</hi> if the Act of Parliament had ſaid he ſhou'd have a Copy of the Pannel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was return'd, then we cou'd not have ſaid but that the Objection wou'd hold. But when the Words are general, and it is moſt reaſonable to be interpreted that the Copy is be delivered when the Array is made, becauſe that anſwers the Intent and End of the Act of Parliament, which was to enable the Priſoner to make his Challenges, we take that to be ſufficient; and if another Interpretation ſhou'd be made, it wou'd render the Tryal in ſuch Caſes liable to all the Miſchiefs in the World, and make it impracticable that any Perſon ſhou'd be try'd; at leaſt it wou'd introduce a new Method of Proceedings that never was practiſed, nor ought to be introduced, unleſs this Act of Parliament by expreſs Words, had appointed and conſtituted ſuch a new Method; and we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your Lordſhip will never make any ſuch Conſtruction, that the Act intended a new Method, unleſs expreſly declared; for if it were, as they would have it, that the Copy of the Pannel was not to be delivered till after the return of the Writ, then the Priſonner cannot be tryed upon the return of the Writ; for upon the return of the Writ, the Jury muſt be brought to the Bar, the Priſoner muſt be brought to the Bar, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed over to a further time, that in the mean time a Copy may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them. I believe that they can never ſhow any Preſident that there was ſuch an Adjournment of a Jury of Life and Death, over to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Day, for a Perſon to have a Copy of the Pannel, to enable him to his Challenges; and either that muſt be the Conſequence, or elſe the Jury muſt not come upon the return of the <hi>Venire facias,</hi> but there muſt go a <hi>Habeas Corpora,</hi> and the Priſoner tryed upon that <hi>Habeas Corpora:</hi> For firſt there muſt be the return of the Writ, then the Copy of the Pannel delivered, then the <hi>Habeas Corpora</hi> returnable another Day; and upon that the Tryal muſt be had: But I believe there can be no Inſtance given of a Tryal for Treaſon upon a <hi>Habeas Corpora.</hi> Now if the Parliament had intended that they wou'd not have the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the Pannel deliver'd till after the return of the <hi>Venire facias,</hi> they would certainly have expreſt and provided how the Method of Tryal ſhould have been; that is, that either the Jury ſhould have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd over till another Day, or elſe brought to the Bar upon a <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpora</hi>; which is the only way that can be thought of. Indeed, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I do agree, that if the Sheriff ſhould give a Copy of the Pannel, and afterwards ſhould vary that Pannel, tho' but in one Name, that would not anſwer the End of the Act of Parliament, becauſe the Priſoner is deprived of the opportunity of knowing the Name of the Perſon that he ſo altered, in order to his making his Challenges againſt him: But if the Sheriff do return the ſame Perſons that are in that Copy delivered to the Priſoner, then we do to all Intents and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, anſwer the End of the Act of Parliament, and avoid the abſurd Conſtruction that they would make of this Act for the Changing the Method of Tryals, and no body can well tell what Method ſhou'd be purſued: But certainly if the Act of Parliament intended a new Method ſhou'd be purſued, they wou'd have deſcrib'd and ſetled what it ſhou'd be.</p>

                  <p>If your Lordſhip pleaſes to ſpare me a word of the ſame ſide; my Lord this is an Objection that has been foreſeen, and I think has been prevented, for with Submiſſion I take it the Act has been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently anſwered both as to the words, and as to the intent of it in the Priſoners having the Copy of the Pannel before the Jury be returned, there muſt be ſuch a thing as a Pannel array'd before the Jury be ſummon'd, and therefore it is ſufficient that the Priſoner have a Copy of that Pannel ſo many days before his Trial; which was only intended for that particular reaſon, that he might be provided ſufficiently to make his Legal Challenges. Certainly within the Intent of the Act of Parliament it is well enough if he had but a Copy of the Pannel two days before the return of the Writ, provided the Jury was not altered that was array'd, nor any other Names put in but thoſe that he had a Copy of before; now my Lord I think this Act of Parliament muſt be taken according to the intent and meaning of it, or elſe it will bear hard upon the Priſoner, and harder ſure than it was deſigned it ſhould: this Act ſays, he ſhall have a Copy of his Indictment ſo many days before his Trial; now I would fain know whether they would have it conſtrued, that the Copy does not need to be delivered till after Iſſue joyn'd, which muſt be if their Doctrine hold true, that the Act is to be conſtrued according to the ſtrict Letter of it, for Trial is the Trial of the Iſſue; what if the Indictment be delivered five days before the Trial, tho after Iſſue joyn'd, it is well enough according to ſuch an Expoſition, for the arraigning of the Priſoner is no part of the Trial, and yet it was the intent of the Parliament that he ſhould have a Copy of the Indictment 5 days before he was arraigned, and that for this reaſon, becauſe he might have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pleas to plead and Objections to make before he pleaded the General Iſſue; he might have Pleas in abatement, which after Plea pleaded of Not guilty he could not have the advantage of, nor could he afterwards move to quaſh the Indictment, which he might otherwiſe have good reaſon for, if he had the Copy before he was put to plead; ſo that I take it the Act is to be interpreted every where according to the intention of it, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at the Bar according to the intention of the Act, has had a Copy of this Indictment 5 or 6 days before his Arraignment, and therefore we have acted according to the purpoſe and meaning of the Parliament, and likewiſe he has had a Copy of the Pannel of the Jurors that are to try him, which is duly returned by the Sheriff, which is likewiſe according to the Act of Parliament: as for what they ſay that even a Copy of the Indictment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be found would not be good according to this Act; that's true, but the caſe is not the ſame, nor the reaſon of the Caſe alike between that and the Pannel of a Jury, becauſe it is ſufficient in Law to make it a good Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel if it be array'd by the Sheriff before the Jury be ſummoned, for the Sheriff muſt array and compleat his Pannel to let his Bailiff know who muſt be ſummoned, but in the caſe of an Indictment, tho a Bill be firſt form'd by the Clerk, yet it is not look'd upon as a formal Indictment in point of Law till it be found by the Jury as their Verdict and preferred to the Court, and it is not neceſſary that the Indictment ſhould be formed for the Jury before they find it, for they are properly to make their own preſentments themſelves; and the ancient practice was, that they only preſented the Fact, and the Matter was put into form afterwards by the Court, and in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58191:7"/>
many caſes it is ſo at this day, as we have had ſome inſtances lately; but as to the arraying of a Pannel it always was ſo, and always muſt be ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray'd by the Sheriff before the Jury ſummoned, and there's the difference between the giving a Copy of an Indictment and the Copy of a Pannel, the one is taken notice of in point of Law to be neceſſary, the other is not. This giving a Copy of the Pannel, my Lord, we ſay is within the intent of the Act, which was only to enable perſons accuſed to make their juſt Challenges, and that they may as well do when a Copy is delivered after it is array'd by the Sheriff, as when it is return'd by the Sheriff, and being ſo done with ſubmiſſion it is well done within the words, and within the intent of this Act of Parliament.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, the words of this Act of Parliament are, that they ſhall have a Copy of the Pannel of the Jurors who are to try them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned by the Sheriff and delivered to them, and this 2 days before the Trial: My Lord, that this is the Pannel of the Sheriff of the Jurors that are to try them aſſoon as it is array'd has been obſerv'd already, now it would be a forc'd conſtruction to conſtrue theſe words that follow, duly returned by the Sheriff, to be meant, that a Copy ſhould be delivered after the Jury is returned, becauſe that would be a delay of Juſtice, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the Trial longer than was intended by this Act of Parliament, and more than will anſwer the end of this Law, for the end of it was to give the Priſoner all benefit and advantage of Exceptions againſt any of thoſe that were to try him, and if he has this Pannel two days before his Trial, he has that benefit the Law intended him. Now my Lord as to what has been ſaid of an Indictment, which by this Law he is to have a Copy of too, that is plainly quite another caſe, for it is not an Indictment till it be found, and ſo anſwers not the words nor intention of the Act till found by the Grand Jury, till then it is not a Copy of his Charge, and therefore by no conſtruction can it be called a Copy of the Indictment. I think I need not trouble your Lordſhip any further in this matter, becauſe this Objection was foreſeen, and has been already conſidered of by the Court upon the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners arraignment.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, in anſwer to what Mr. Sollicitor has ſaid, that there is as much reaſon to expect that the Copy of the Indictment ſhould not be delivered till after Plea pleaded, as that the Pannel ſhould not be delivered till after the Jury return'd, becauſe in the caſe of the Indictment it is ſaid ſo many days before the Trial, and the Trial cannot be till Iſſue joyn'd, there can be no weight in that Objection at all; for the words of the Act are quite differently penned in the caſe of the Indictment, from what they are in the caſe of the Pannel, for tho it be ſaid it ſhould be done 5 days before the Trial, yet it is added, in order to the adviſing with Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel how to plead, which muſt be before Plea pleaded, and therefore it muſt be abſolutely neceſſary to be done before the arraignment. My Lord, I have propoſed my doubt, it may have conſequences on the one ſide and the other, we ſubmit intirely unto your Lordſhips Judgment, it is a new Law, and never has received any opinion; the words of it are duly return'd by the Sheriff, and the Queſtion is, whether a Copy of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel upon the Array before it be return'd be a Copy of the Pannel duly return'd, tho the ſame Pannel be afterwards duly returned.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, Mr. Attorny General owns, that the Pannel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is arrayed may be amended and altered by the Sheriff, and it was never intended by this Act of Parliament, that any Copy of the Pannel ſhould be delivered to the Priſoner but of thoſe Men that were really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, ſo that we take it we ought to have it two days after the Return and before the Trial, for certainly it muſt be a Copy of the Men returned, which if the Sheriff may alter at any time before the Return, the Intent of the Act of Parliament can never be anſwered by any Copy but what is a true Copy of the Return. Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> would anſwer the Objection that I made about a Copy of the Indictment by this, that it is not an Indictment till it be found by the Jury, but I think it is no Anſwer to our Objection at all, tho it be but a Copy of the Bill intended to be preſented to the Grand Jury, yet if the Grand Jury afterwards find it is as true a Copy of the Indictment, as this is a Copy of the Jury intended to be Returned, and afterwards Returned. As to what they ſay, that this will Introduce a new method of Tryal, contrary to all form or proceedings, that can be no Objection neither; for if it be ſo, we can't tell how to help it, the Parliament have thought fit to have it ſo, and we muſt ſubmit to take it as the Law has made it: If there be a neceſſity for a <hi>Habeas Corpora</hi> upon the proviſion made in this Act, ſo it muſt be, for we muſt take the Law as it is. We ſubmit our Objection to your Lordſhip; we think we have not had the benefit of this Law.</p>

                  <p>Surely, my Lord, what Mr. <hi>Phipps</hi> has now ſaid has no weight in it; that becauſe the Sheriff had it in his power to alter the Pannel before it was Returned, that therefore this is not now a true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the Pannel of the Jurors who are to try the Priſoner, duly returned by the Sheriff; which are the words in the Act. It is true, if the Sheriff had in fact altered the Pannel from what it was, and return'd it ſo altered into Court, no doubt of it the Priſoner would be very well intitled to make this Objection, that he had not a Copy of the Pannel, or the Names of the Jurors that were ſummoned to try him; but now we can aver, that we have purſued this Act of Parliament literally; for in anſwer to their Objection, we may ask this Queſtion of them upon the words of the Act, Have you not had a true Copy of the Names of thoſe that are to try you, and are duly returned by the Sheriff for that purpoſe; and was not that Copy delivered unto you above 2 days ago? They cannot ſay they have not had it ſo, and if they cannot ſay ſo, then both the Words and Meaning of the Act of Parliament are in every reſpect anſwered; if when the Jury come to be called the Priſoner finds the Pannel to be altered, he has reaſon to object, and will have the benefit of the Objection, that he has not that advantage which the Law intended him, but till that prove to be the Fact, we think here is a full Compliance with this Law.</p>

words be before the Trial, we have taken it that he ſhould have a Copy 5 days before his Arraignment, and ſo we have complied with the meaning of the Law in that point, as we have alſo in this, which was, we take it, only to enable the Priſoner to make his Challenges, and if that be done 2 days before his Trial with ſubmiſſion it fully anſwers this Law.</p>

                  <p>Then look you Sir <hi>B. Shower,</hi> as to this point that you now inſiſt upon, we have had it under conſideration heretofore; we were here this day ſeven-night, and then we did conſider in what method we ſhould proceed, ſo that the Priſoner might have the benefit intended him by this Act of Parliament: the Act of Parliament does deſign in the firſt place, that every Priſoner that is to be tried for High Treaſon ſhould have a Copy of his Indictment, at leaſt 5 days before the Trial, that I think was all that the makers of this Act of Parliament intended at the firſt; but then there being ſubſequent words, which ſhew the reaſon why they gave him the Copy ſo long before the Tryal; which is, that he might adviſe with his Councel what to plead; theſe words we conceive has given the Priſoner a further time than what was originally intended, therefore we have thought it neceſſary that the Priſoner ſhould have a Copy of his Indictment 5 days before he be arraigned, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch is 5 days before he was put to plead; and your Client, the Priſoner at the Bar, has had the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this Act in that reſpect before we arraigned him; then after he has pleaded, the Queſtion was, when he was to have a Copy of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel: Now the deſign of this Act of Parliament was, That the Priſoner ſhould have a Copy of the Pannel 2 days before his Tryal in order that he might conſider of the perſons that were to Try him; that he might inform himſelf of their Qualities, Tempers, and Diſpoſitions; that ſo he might make uſe of the benefit the Law gives him of challenging Five and Thirty without ſhewing any cauſe if he did not like the Men, and as many more as he ſhould think he had good cauſe to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge: now in this Caſe the whole deſign of this Act of Parliament is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, for he has had a Copy of the Pannel, as you your ſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, 2 days before the day of his Trial, ſo that he has the full benefit that the Act of Parliament intended; he is by this Copy as well enabled to make his Challenges as the Law deſign'd he ſhould be, and has had the ſame time allowed him that the Act of Parliament meant he ſhould have, then ſuppoſing the deſign of this Act of Parliament be fully anſwered and complied with in the Caſe. The next Queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the words of the Act are ſatisfied, for we would be very loth, in a Caſe of this nature, where an Act of Parliament intends a favour to a Priſoner that ſtands at the Bar for his Life, to abridge him of any part of that favour which the very words of the Act would allow him, tho the Intent of the Act of Parliament were anſwered otherwiſe: now in the firſt place it is obſervable, that the Act of Parliament does not ſay, that the Priſoner ſhall have a Copy of the Return, nor does it ſay, he ſhall have a Copy from the Court, but he ſhall have a Copy of the Pannel of the Jurors duly return'd that are to try him, now if the Sheriff array his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58191:8"/>
Pannel ſeveral days before the Tryal upon the <hi>Venire facias,</hi> and does give him a Copy of that very Pannel, which Pannel is afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in Court. Has not he then a Copy of the Pannel duely returnr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed? Does not this anſwer all the words of the Act? For you you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſay that it is not ſaid in the words of the Act that the Copy ſhall be delivered after the Pannel returned, nor does their need a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the very Return. Surely we muſt not carry it farther than the words if the meaning be complyed with, and we think this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers both words and meaning; It is a Copy of the Pannel, and a Copy of that Pannel that's duely returned. Now to make another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction would indeed not only alter the uſual courſe of Tryals, but be contradictory to the very Proceſs it ſelf. We are by the Courſe of Law to award Proceſs to Summon a Jury to appear at a certain time, to try the Iſſue joyned between the King and the Priſoner; and yet when we have done this, and the Jury thereupon are ſummoned and appear, they may go as they came, for the Iſſue cannot be tryed, becauſe after the Return, the Priſoner muſt have a Copy of the Pannel two days before he can be tryed. I do think the deſign of the Act of Parliament, and the very word of the Act are fully ſatisfied in giving a Copy of the Pannel two days before the Return. We had this matter under our Conſideration before, and upon Debate among our ſelves, we did think fit to award the Precept returnable this day, and reſolved to try the Priſoner this day unleſs better reaſons were offered us to alter our opinion, and we are not ſatisfied that any ſuch better reaſon has been given, but that this Tryal ought to go on, the Priſoner having the full benefit that was deſigned him by this Act of Parliament. And the giving a Copy of the Pannel that is returned, tho before the return ſufficiently ſatisfies the words of the Act, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtruction can be made without great abſurdities: This is my opinion.</p>

or whether it was taken at all, or in what place it was taken; it ſays only <hi>Middleſex</hi> in the Margent, and then <hi>Juratores pro Domino Reges preſentant,</hi> That might be before the Juſtices of the Peace at the Quarter-Seſſions, or it might be at the Monthly-Seſſions at <hi>Hicks</hi>-Hall; or it might be at the Seſſions at the <hi>Old-Baily</hi>; or it might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> as perhaps it really was, but <hi>non Conſtat</hi> where it was taken, nor how it comes hither: It might be before your Lordſhip here as we believe it was, but this Copy not leting us know where and how it was taken, we think we have not the benefit of this Law, for the Party accuſed is by this Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have a Copy to adviſe with Counſel, that he may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to plead: And that is the reaſon why the words of this Act are ſo Pen'd, that he ſhall have a Copy of the whole Indictment, which we cannot plead to unleſs we know where it was taken, if we ſhould have occaſion to plead any Special Matter. And beſides my Lord, there is another reaſon why we ſhould have the whole Indictment to enable us to plead, becauſe if we had the <hi>Caption,</hi> it might perhaps appear that the Indictment was taken before the time of the Fact alledg'd in the Indictment, and then that would make it Vitious; it might be before the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> when this Treaſon is ſaid to be committed, and then we ought not to be brought to Tryal. Now the Deſign of this Act of Parliament, in giving the Priſoner a Copy of the Indictment ſo long before the Tryal, was not only to enable him to make his Defence upon the Tryal, but alſo to adviſe with Counſel to plead, for ſo the words are the better to enable him to plead. Now we ſay to anſwer this end, it is neceſſary we ſhould have a Copy of the whole Indictment, as it ſtands before your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Court. And another reaſon is this, it is no Indictment, unleſs it be preſented by the Jury, as their Inquiſition upon Oath unto ſome Court that has Juriſdiction of the matter: What we have delivered to us is only a Coppy of a Bill, as to be delivered to a Grand Jury, to be found <hi>non Conſtat,</hi> that it is found. Now the intent of the Act of Parliament being to give the Priſoner this adventage to enable him to plead, he may have ſeveral pleas, of which he might take a legal advantage if he had a Copy of the whole, which he knows not how to come at: now and intruth it is very neceſſary, becauſe if he be tryed upon an Indictment found in another Country, then theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions have not a legal authority to try him; and if the Tryal ſhould go on, and he be acquitted, he is ſubject to be Indicted and tryed again, and never can releive himſelf by the acquittal upon ſuch an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctment before perſons that had no authority to try him. I doubt he can never plead the acquital, becauſe he cannot make out that he was duely try'd and acquitted; and for theſe Reaſons we humbly ſubmit it to your Lordſhip, whether we have had the benefit of this Law, in having a Copy of the whole Indictment to enable us to plead: And if we have not, till we have that benefit, we humbly Conceive this Tryal ought not to go on.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, the Queſtion is whether the Stile of the Court, the perſons before whom it was taken, and to whom the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment is made; the time when it was taken, and the place where ought not to appear in the Indictment. This Law requiring that the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58191:9"/>
Priſoner ſhould have a Copy of the whole Indictment to enable him to plead; for if it ſhould happen that the Indictment was taken before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that had no Juriſdiction, then I believe it will not be denyed but that the Priſoner might plead to the Juriſdiction, and there might be ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pleas that he might take advantage of, I would deſire to know of the King's Counſel, whether ever they ſaw a Copy of an Indictment given in Evidence, or pleaded without the <hi>Caption.</hi> It is not a true Copy without it, there ought to be the time, the place, and the ſtile of the Court before whom it was taken.</p>

                  <p>Truly my Lord I think I need ſay no more to this Objection, then that it does not come at a proper time; for with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mition, if the Priſoner will upon this Act ſay he has not had a Copy of his Indictment to enable him to plead, he ought to have taken the advantage of it before he does plead, that is the proper time for him to object this matter to the Court, for if after he has had ſuch a Copy as this Priſoner has had he does ſubmit to plead. With ſubmiſſion it is to late to come at his Tryal and make this objection, he cannot be received to make it after.</p>

                  <p>I think it is my Lord with ſubmition, not that we would wave giving other anſwers to it, if it were in a proper time; but the method of proceeding muſt be, and we think we have no occaſion at this time to ſay any thing more to this objection.</p>

                  <p>No, no, that is a full anſwer in this point, for look ye, you that are of Council for the Priſoner, when once you have pleaded, you admit you have had a Copy, for the Copy was given you to enable you to plead, and when you have pleaded you have paſt by all advantage that you could have from the Copy, as to any Plea that you can make, for its taken for granted ye had a Copy to enable you to plead; and to adviſe with your Counſel about it, ſince you did plead, and do not inſiſt upon it at the time of your Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that you had not ſuch Copy.</p>

                  <p>Look ye, Mr. <hi>Phipps,</hi> your Objection upon the Indictment ſlipt me, and therefore I would ſpeak to it now; You ſaid it might be as well a Copy of the Indictment before it be Found, as well as this a Copy of the Pannel before it be Returned. Now that can't be, for an Indictment is not an Indictment till it be found, it is only a Writing prepared for the eaſe of the Jury, and for Expedition; it is nothing till it is found, for the Jury make it an Indictment by finding it, they may alter what they pleaſe, or refuſe it abſolutely. And if the Jury, upon examining the Witneſſes, would only preſent a Matter of Fact, with Time and Place, the Court might cauſe it to be drawn up into Form, without carrying it to the Jury: Again, There needs no <hi>Billa Vera,</hi> for that is only the Jury's owning that which the Court has prepared and drawn up for them; but a Pannel is a Pannel when it is array'd before it be returned; and a Copy of the Pannel given before it be returned, is a Copy of the Pannel returned, if it be afterwards returned, as it muſt.</p>

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of this Jury, this Indictment that has been read to you does charge the Priſoner with High Treaſon for compaſſing and imagining the Death of the King, for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſubvert the Government, and to ſubject the People of <hi>England</hi> to the Slavery of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, and for this End the Indictment ſets forth, that the Priſoner at the Bar did privately meet with ſeveral falſe Traytors, to conſult how they might compaſs the Death of the King, and commit thoſe other Treaſons; and that the 10th of <hi>February,</hi> at <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> in this County, it was agreed among them, that they ſhould get together 40 Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whereof the Priſoner at the Bar was to be one, and they were to lye in Ambuſh, and ſet upon the King in his Coach upon his return from going abroad; ſome were to attack the Coach, others to attack the Guards, and there were to kill the King in the Coach; and the Indictment does likewiſe charge the Priſoner with gathering together Horſes, and providing Arms for this purpoſe. To this Indictment, Gentlemen, he hath pleaded not Guilty; we ſhall call our witneſſes and prove the Fact, and when we have ſo done, we do not at all doubt but you'll do your Duty.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly, my Lord, I think they are no way regular; for, with ſubmiſſion, I take it, that though this Act of Parliament has indulg'd them in ſeveral things which were not allowable by Law before, yet as to this part they are not allowed to take Exceptions to the Indictment, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than they could before this Act was paſt: Nay, ſo far from that, that if your Lordſhip looks into the Act, you find they are reſtrained in this point from an Advantage that they had before; that is, they ſhall not move any ſuch thing as are there mentioned, after Verdict in Arreſt of Judgment; ſo that this part is reſtrictive to the Priſoner, and takes away ſome Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that he had before; which was, moving in Arreſt of Judgment after Verdict; but it leaves the making Exceptions as to any time before the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, as it was before; which was before Plea pleaded; but not after the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſworn: For it cannot be denied that in point of Practice ſuch a thing as this that is now offered cou'd not have been done before the Act. I wou'd be glad to know whether they can ſhew any Preſident of any ſuch thing as they now contend for. They ſay, the Words of the Act are, Exception muſt be taken before Evidence given; but that muſt be taken at ſuch a time as they might by the Courſe of Law do it before: For when the Jury is ſworn, they muſt give a Verdict, and I do not know how they can be diſcharg'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving a Verdict; therefore unleſs the Act had given Directions for a particular manner of Proceeding in this matter, which it has not done, your Lordſhip will not, I preſume, do it in any other manner than as it was before the Act made, and if there be no preſident to be ſhown of any ſuch thing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58191:12"/>
as this, of taking Exception to an Indictment after the Jury Sworn and charg'd with the Priſoner; then there is no Power in this Act of Parliament, given to them to take Exceptions to the Indictment at this time, we take it the Motion is very Irregular upon all Accounts.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, We firſt ſay, that it is not proper for them to make any ſuch Motion as this upon this Act of Parliament, till they tell us what their Exception is, that we may ſee whether it be within the Words and Meaning of this Act of Parliament. The only thing now that is proper for us to conſider, is the Iſſue Joyned, and the Inquiry whether the Priſoner at the Bar is guilty of the High Treaſon of which he is Indicted, to which Indictment he has pleaded Not Guilty, that's the thing that is now before your Lordſhip to be tried, they have room for Exceptions to the Indictment afterwards, for ſome Exceptions I mean
<stage>(I do not know what their Exceptions are)</stage>
but if they be ſuch as may be taken after the Verdict, then I am ſure they are Irregular now in their Motion, and they can ſhew no Preſident when it was done after Plea pleaded and Iſſue joyn'd, as it is in this Caſe.</p>

                  <p>The Advantage that the Act gives the Priſoner, of having a Copy of his Indictment ſo long before Tryal, is to enable him to plead, or to take Exceptions to Quaſh it; but I never heard a Motion to Quaſh an Indictment after a Jury is charg'd to hear the Evidence. Certainly they ought to do it before Plea pleaded, and not now to come to make a Motion to Quaſh the Indictment, after they have pleaded, and the Jury Sworn: Therefore we ſubmit it, upon the conſtant Practice in like Caſes, to the Judgment of the Court.</p>

I have a great many Exception to the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſay we ſhould name what our Exceptions are, I will acquaint them with them as faſt as I can, if your Lordſhip pleaſe, the Indictment is very Looſe and Uncertain.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir <hi>B. Shower.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, We were afraid we ſhould be excluded from taking theſe Exceptions after the Evidence given.</p>
               </sp>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>So you are by the expreſs words of the Act.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir <hi>B. Shower.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Then certainly we may do it before the Evidence given.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Holt.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>But the Act does not ſay, Ye ſhall do it at any time before the Evidence given, eſpecially in ſuch an Irregular Manner, after Iſſue Joyn'd, and the Jury Sworn. Suppoſe <hi>Mr. Attorney</hi> had given ſome Evidence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir <hi>B. Shower.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Then, my Lord, I agree we had been without the words, therefore I now move it before the Evidence, becauſe the Act of Parliament has given me a Liberty to do it before the Evidence given; for the Law having given this Liberty to the Priſoner, to make ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions within ſuch a time, your Lordſhip will not reſtrain us from making uſe of that Liberty further than the Law has reſtrained, but we may make uſe of our Exceptions before the Evidence given, either to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58191:13"/>
Induce your Lordſhip to Quaſh the Indictment, or the Jury to find us Not Guilty, as we hope your Lordſhip will direct them to do; for what is more common upon Indictments, after the Jury are Sworn, then if Facts appear upon the Record not to be ſufficiently alledged, the Court will direct the Jury to find the Party Not Guilty. We think this Act does give us this Liberty, otherwiſe I know not to what purpoſe it was made, the very meaning ſeems to be, that the Exceptions of the Counſel for the Priſoner might be of Prejudice to the King; and therefore it ſays, After the King's Evidence given, and the Fact diſcovered, no ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception ſhall be made; therefore we muſt make it before the Evidence given, otherwiſe what this Act of Parliament that was deſign'd in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Priſoner, will prove a very great Hardſhip upon him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in caſe of an imperfect Indictment, as we apprehend this is, and he will be in a worſe Condition than ever he was; he muſt take his Exceptions now or not at all: The Act ſays, He is not to take it after Evidence given: And by Conſtruction the King's Counſel would have it, That he ſhould not give it before: And conſequently he has no time at all to give it.</p>

                  <p>Have not you had time to do it before now Sir <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew Shower,</hi> certainly you had? You had time this day Sevenight when you were Arraign'd; you have had your Opportunity if you would have taken it; the Jury are now charg'd, the Indictment is opened, they have been told what they are to inquire of, and now you would break in and take Exceptions to the Indictment.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, This is a new Act of Parliament, it ſays we ſhall take our Exceptions before the Evidence given; which we take, it is any time before Evidence given; and if your Lordſhip will not allow us to do it now, it may be we may loſe the Benefit of it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.</p>

                  <p>It is one Queſtion whether we ſhall allow it or no, and another Queſtion whether you can claim it or no: Certainly it is an Irregular Motion, and the like of it was never offered in any Caſe before, be it Criminal or Civil: For if it be a Criminal Caſe that is not Felony of Treaſon, when the Iſſue comes to Tryal upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, Did you ever know an Exception taken to the Indictment after the Jury were charged? Certainly it is contrary to all Practiſe; and it is not Fair, the Court is not well dealt with, you have had an Opportunity before, and will you now put the Court and the Jury to ſo great deal of Trouble, to ſtay till the Jury be called over, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner called to his Challenges, he has challenged Thirty four, the Jury is Sworn, the Indictment is read to them, the Charge given them, the Counſel have opened the Indictment, and now when the buſineſs is only to try the Iſſue with which the Jury are charg'd, you come to turn us quite round, by taking Exceptions to the Indictment.</p>

                  <p>The Clauſe was made in this Reſpect, to your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, becauſe you ſhould have a Copy of the Indictment, whereby you might have an Opportunity to adviſe with Counſel, that they might Inſtruct you how to Plead, and to take any manner of Exception before Plea pleaded, it ought to be before the Tryal, and now becauſe of this Advantage, it provides that you ſhall take your Exceptions before the Tryal, and not move them in Arreſt of Judgment; that is the meaning of the Act.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, What we preſs, ariſes from the very words of the Act of Parliament, if the meaning of the Law-makers was as the King's Counſel now Contend to have it: they would never have uſed thoſe words before Evidence given in open Court, but have ſaid they ſhould have had no Advantage of the Exception, unleſs it were before Plea pleaded; it does not ſay it ſhall be after the verdict, or before the Verdict; but before the Evidence given: Now if they had meant what theſe Gentlemen ſay, they would have appointed it to be before the Verdict, which would have included the Tryal; becauſe then it had been like the Penning of other Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Statutes of <hi>Jeotailes</hi> and the like, which ſay, That after a Verdict, ſuch and ſuch Exceptions ſhall not Arreſt a Judgment: But if they can ſhew me any Statute that is penn'd like this, they give me an anſwer: All thoſe Statutes are, That no Judgment ſhall be Arreſted or Delay'd upon ſuch or ſuch Exceptions after a Verdict: But here it ſays, They ſhall not Arreſt Judgment, unleſs the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception be taken before Evidence given in open Court. My Lord, We ſubmit it to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we think the Law-makers did intend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what by that particular way of Expreſſion, Different from all other Acts of Parliament; and truly if it be not as we offer to your Lordſhip, we think it can have no meaning at all.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly, my Lord, we think it is very plain what the Parliament meant by this Clauſe in this Act, the Deſign was, to Reſtrain the Priſoner from moving in Arreſt of Judgment for Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpelling, or falſe Latin, or little Matters of Form, if he did not move it in a proper time, having ſuch a Liberty allow'd him, as to have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58191:14"/>
a Copy of the Indictment ſo many days before he was compelled to plead: They inſiſt upon it, that the words are, Before Evidence given; It is ſo: But what can be the meaning of that? It muſt be at ſuch time as the Law allows; it is not making a new Method of Tryal; you ſhall take Exception before the Evidence, that is, before the Tryal, for it can never be intended, that they meant to alter the Courſe, and let the Council break in between the time of the Jury's being Sworn, and the Evidence given, that by no Law could ever have been done before.</p>

               <sp>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Pray, <hi>Mr. Attorney,</hi> when would you have us do it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Regularly before Plea pleaded, at leaſt-wiſe before the Jury be Sworn.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Holt.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Undoubtedly this is not Regular, it is contrary to all the Courſe of Practiſe, it is not fair Dealing with the Court. But then there is another Conſideration in the Caſe, that I would have you think upon: If ſo be this had been at a Tryal by <hi>Niſi Prius,</hi> then the Judge of <hi>Niſi Prius</hi> is only to try the Iſſue; but now here the very Record is before us, and we are Judges of the Record, as well as we are to aſſiſt the Jury in Trying the Iſſue. Now take it in any other Caſe of the like nature, Suppoſe a Tryal at the Bar in any Civil Cauſe, though this be contrary to Practiſe, and the Court not fairly dealt with, yet when we have the Record before us, and find an Error in the Record, cannot we Quaſh the Indictment and Diſcharge the Jury. That is the Queſtion, <hi>Mr. Attorney,</hi> though I muſt confeſs, I do not know that it has been practicable.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>No, my Lord, in a Caſe of Treaſon, where the Jury are once charg'd, they are to give a Verdict, they muſt either Acquit or Convict.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>But I know what has been uſually thought in that Caſe, and I believe they cannot ſhew me another.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Nay, that this is a very Irregular Motion, is very plain.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly, my Lord, you muſt take it as the Law was before this Act, for this Clauſe does nothing for the Priſoner, but is againſt him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Holt.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I know it is not for the Advantage of the Priſoner, therefore I put it as a Caſe in an Action, or an Indictment, as the Law was before, whether this being a Tryal in the ſame Court where the Indictment was found, and we find all Inſufficiency in the Record be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, whether we cannot Quaſh the Indictment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Your Lordſhip mentions Civil Actions, with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, nothing of that kind could be done after once the Cauſe came to Tryal, but in Criminal Cauſes according to the Courſe of Practiſe, which will always be the Law till particularly altered. I believe no body can pretend, that after Iſſue joyn'd, and a Jury charg'd, any one can move to Quaſh the Indictment. I think I have heard it often ſaid in this Court, that in Capital Caſes, as High Treaſon, you may put in a Plea in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58191:14"/>
abatement of, but not a Motion to quaſh an Indictment; I am ſure it was diſallowed where I moved to quaſh an Indictment of Murder, let them but ſhow any preſident of this nature.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>We will ſhow you, tho' this is the firſt Caſe upon this Act of Parliament, therefore to ſhow any practice upon it would be very hard to require of us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>But can you ſhow it before this Clauſe in this Act of Parliament, which, as I told you, is not for your advantage, it does not give you that liberty that you deſire.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>All the Clauſes in this Act of Parliament ſhow'd their intention was this, that the ſence of the Law-makers was, that we ſhould have this Liberty at any time before Evidence given, for if there be ſuch words as ſhow'd they thought it might quaſh'd at any time, tho' they were miſtaken in the practice, yet we ſhall have the Liberty that they intended us, and the wording of this Act ſhows, that the Parliament thought it might be done after the Tryal begun before Evidence given, becauſe they reſtrain us from taking thoſe Exceptions after the Evidence given, and it is no prejudice to the King at all really, it is rather for the advantage of the Proſecution, becauſe there is none of the Evidence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, and therefore if the Indictment ſhould be found faulty, ſtill the Evidence remains undiſcovered upon another Indictment; and I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard it ſaid at this Bar in Caſes of Indictments for Felony or Treaſon, as Murder, or the like; if any one did come as <hi>amicus curiae,</hi> and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Court, that they were going to proceed upon an erroneous Record, or give an erroneous Judgment, or do any other erroneous Act, he ought to be received with kindneſs, becauſe he would prevent a wrong doing.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>That is in the proper time not to interrupt the Tryal when the Jury is once ſworn.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>We are ready to offer our Exceptions, and we hope it is no prejudice at all to the King before the Evidence of the Fact is given.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I perceive that this Clauſe, as they would have it, is intended to prevent us from moving that in Arreſt of Judgment, which we could have moved before, and ties us up to do it before Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given; now I would fain know, if we could not before this Act move in Arreſt of Judgment, for miſ-ſpelling, or falſe Latin, or improper Latin.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>You might, no doubt of it.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
                  <p>They ſay we might, why then, if we could have a time to move it after the Verdict, and that time is a bridg'd by the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which directs that it ſhall be before Evidence given in open Court, ſure we may take any time before the Evidence given, and ſhall not be reſtrain'd further than the Letter of the Law has reſtrain'd us, for this Act was intended for the benefit of the Subject, and ought to be conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much in their favour as the Letter of it will permit.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>No doubt of it, it is to be done before evidence given; but the queſtion is, at what time it muſt be before the Evidence given, whether it muſt not be at ſuch time as by the courſe of practice and uſage of the Law it ſhould have been done before; if you will ſatisfie my Lord and the Court that ever ſuch an Exception was taken, or an Indictment
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58191:15"/>
quaſh'd between the ſwearing of the Jury and the giving the Evidence, ye ſay ſomething, but I believe not one inſtance of that Nature can be given, and therefore it is very irregular for them to do it.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I would only mention one Caſe, and that was of Sir <hi>Richard Manſell,</hi> upon an Indictment of Murder for killing the Apothecary in <hi>Holbourn</hi>; I did my ſelf move to quaſh the Indictment, becauſe it was not expreſt in what year of the King the Fact was done; but the Court was of opinion we cou'd not move to quaſh an Indictment for that or any ſuch notorious crime, till after the Fact determined.</p>

                  <p>No, we were always of that opinion, never to allow Motions to quaſh Indictments for Perjury, Murder or any great offence, but it muſt be moved in Arreſt of Judgment afterwards.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, theſe Gentlemen ſeem to beg the queſtion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Act of Parliament, as if it had appointed this to be the time of making Exceptions to the Indictment, the Act of Parliament does not ſay you ſhall make your Exception immediately before the Evidence given in open Court, as if it had pointed out and directed to them that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular time, that then they ſhould take their Exception and no other time: the Act has only ſet a bound, that they ſhall not do it afterwards, but as to the particular time, it is left as it was before, to the regular Courſe and Method of Proceedings, which is before Plea pleaded.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, they do not anſwer my Objection, it is, it ſeems, a Reſtriction of a Liberty that we had before of moving in Arreſt of Judgment; if ſo, we ought not to be reſtrained further than we are by the words of the Act of Parliament, which ſay, before Evidence given, that is at any time before Evidence given, as well after as before Plea pleaded.</p>

                  <p>My Lord Chief Juſtice has delivered his opinion in this matter, and he thinks fit that we ſhould deliver ours. I think this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Priſoner's Councel to quaſh this Indictment after the Jury ſworn, is irregular and quite out of ſeaſon; the intent of this Clauſe in this Act of Parliament, certainly was not in favour of the Priſoner, it abridgeth him of a Liberty he had before, but gives him nothing: for the Law-makers did think they had given the Priſoner an extraordinary Favour in the foregoing part of the Act, in giving him a Copy of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment five Days before he ſhould plead, and a Copy of the Pannel two Days before he ſhould be tryed, and allowing him Councel, and all theſe advantages were to enable him to quaſh the Indictment, or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs returned, for the Clauſe extends to both; the words are, <hi>That no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment nor Proceſs or Return thereupon, ſhall be quaſh'd on the Motion of the Priſoner or his Cuncel for miſ-writing, miſ-ſpelling, falſe or improper Latin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Exception concerning the ſame be taken and made in the reſpective Court where ſuch Tryal ſhall be by the Priſoner or his Council aſſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d before any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given in open Court upon ſuch Indictment, nor ſhall any ſuch miſ-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>after Conviction be any Cauſe to ſtay Judgment:</hi> therefore they made this extraordinary Proviſion to reſtrain the Priſoner, in part, by this Clauſe; as much as to ſay you have an advantage of the Copy of the Indictment, and you may make uſe of that to quaſh it by Motion, if you think fit, as you may alſo the Proceſs, but it ſhall be <hi>before Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given.</hi> 'Tis true, thoſe are the words, but the uſing that term, <hi>viz. quaſhing</hi> ſuch Indictment or Proceſs, ſhows it muſt be done in ſuch a way and time as is proper for quaſhing: and the very words are, that it ſhall be <hi>upon Motion.</hi> Now we are to expound thoſe words. And I ſay, a <hi>Motion</hi> to <hi>quaſh</hi> an Indictment, muſt be underſtood a Motion in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſon, which I think is before Plea pleaded; but at leaſt before the Jury is ſworn. There were three times when the Priſoner might have had the advantage of a fault in the Indictment before this Act: 1. By Motion to quaſh it before Plea pleaded. 2. Then afterwards in Arreſt of Judgment: and 3. After that by Writ of Error. Now this Clauſe of this Act takes away the Privilege of moving in Arreſt of Judgment for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſaves the advantage upon a Writ of Error, and upon a Motion to quaſh the Indictment. We are to conſider what is a proper time for a Motion to quaſh an Indictment, the Motion is to be made to the Court, and to them alone. It is not to be made to the Court and the Jury. When the Jury is ſworn, all Application is to be made to the Court, as having a Jury preſent which they are to aſſiſt in the Tryal and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the <hi>Fact</hi> only. What uſe then is there of the Jury, when you make this Motion, which conſiſts only in points of <hi>Law?</hi> They muſt ſtand by and be out of Office all the while this Motion is making: and it is not reaſonable, nor certainly ever was intended that after a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is ſworn to try a matter of Fact, they ſhould ſtand idle, while you
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58191:16"/>
move a thing which you ſhould have moved before they came to the Bar, ſuppoſe you ſhould now move ſome Exception to the <hi>Venire,</hi> and the Return thereupon, ſhould we, when we and you alſo have admitted the Jury to be ſworn, quaſh the Proceſs whereby they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd? And yet we may as well do that as this. For, the Act pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides in the very ſame words concerning Quaſhing <hi>Proceſs</hi> and <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> But, when the Jury is ſworn, and ready to receive their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſure, then it is out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> all ſeaſon to make ſuch a Motion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do not think the Parliament intended by this Clauſe
<stage>(which was a kind of Exception to the Favour the Priſoner receiv'd by having the Copy of the Indictment)</stage>
to inſtitute a new Method of Proceedings for Motions to Quaſh Indictments, even when a Jury is at the Barr and ſworn to try the Iſſue, and there is nothing proper to be proceeded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but only to hear the Evidence produc'd for the proof of that Iſſue, till the Jury is diſcharged. But ſtill this I would ſay; this is a new Caſe and upon a new Statute. I am truly of Opinion, that the Motion is altogether Unſeaſonable and Irregular, and it ſhould have been made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and you had a full Opportunity to make it this Day Seven-night before Plea pleaded, and you might likewiſe to Day before the Jury was ſworn; therefore when the Jury are now at the Bar actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into, and imploy'd upon the Service, the Court ought not to be Interrupted by ſuch a Motion. Yet nevertheleſs I would propound this, that, ſeeing it is a new Caſe and upon a new Statute, the Court would forgive the Irregularity
<stage>(for I think it does need Forgiveneſs)</stage>
and if the King's Councel will Conſent to it
<stage>(to prevent any Error or any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Hardſhip upon a new Law)</stage>

                  <p>This Act of Parliament, as it has given a Benefit to the Priſoner that he had not before, in allowing him a Copy of his Indictment in order to his taking Exceptions to it; ſo it has Reſtrained him as to the time of making thoſe Exceptions: That he ſhou'd have a time for it, there is no Doubt; and the time limited for it, as this Act ſays, muſt be before Evidence given, becauſe it might well be thought unreaſonable that there ſhou'd be any Quaſhing of the Indictment at the Priſoner's or his Counſels motion after ſuch time as the King had given any Evidence whatſoever in the Caſe, for that wou'd be a Diſcovery of the King's Evidence, and great Inconveniencies might enſue thereupon; but the Queſtion is at what time this is to be done; Whether it may be at any time before Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given, or no; it was intended ſurely that the Motion to Quaſh the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment and taking Exceptions to it ſhould have their proper time as well as effect, and that muſt be before the Tryal; but it was not the Intent of the Act to alter the Method of Proceedings formerly uſed in Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Caſes, for after the Jury is Sworn it is their proper Office to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Fact; now if before this Act of Parliament (as it hath been ſaid) it never was allow'd to take any ſuch Exception as this after the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſworn, but that the Regular time for ſuch Motions, is before Plea pleaded or Jury ſworn, that is, before Evidence given, as the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament directs; for it is not ſaid, as Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> obſerved, that it ſhou'd
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58191:16"/>
be immediately before the Evidence be given. I do not ſuppoſe this Act alters any thing as to the Method of Proceedings from what it was before, but that this Exception now comes improperly after the Jury ſworn, when it ought to be taken before Plea pleaded, at leaſt before the Jury ſworn. It is a new Act of Parliament, and this is within the words of the Act that it is before Evidence given, as the Counſel for the Priſoner ſay the Act directs. I take it you have loſt the Regular time for making this fort of Exceptions, and you would invert the whole Method of Proceedings upon ſuch Tryals as theſe; for to what purpoſe is it to take Exceptions to quaſh the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when the Jury are once charged with it? If it be an Indictment that ought to be quaſh'd the Jury ought not to be charged, you have had two times, and they are both of them elaps'd for this matter, that is, at the Arraignment and before the Jury ſworn; yet I would propoſe it to the King's Councel as my Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas has done, it being a new Caſe, that it ſhould at this time be conſented to, that the Exceptions, as the Miſ-writing, Miſ-ſpelling, falſe or improper Latin might be made, but that for the future it may be taken notice of that ſuch Exceptions are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before the Jury be ſworn.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, for us to conſent to that in ſuch a Caſe as this, where the Court thinks it not Regular, would be pretty hard to deſire of us if any thing of advantage ſhould happen on the other ſide, I verily think the Councel for the Priſoner will not be ſo ready to conſent to wave any ſuch advantage, nor am I for asking them to do it; this Clauſe goes only to ſome faults in the Indictment; Miſ-ſpelling, Miſ-writing, falſe and improper Latin, that is all that they are Reſtrain'd from moving in arreſt of Judgment, any thing elſe, any Uncertainty or other matter that is not comprehended under theſe Particulars they may take advantage of to move in ſtay of Judgment after a Verdict this Clauſe does only abridge them from moving in Arreſt of Judgment for Miſ-writing, Miſ-ſpelling, falſe or improper Latin, therefore if your Lordſhip ſhould think it reaſonable we ſhould conſent to let them in to make any Exception now, it muſt be confin'd to thoſe particular Objections of falſe and improper Latin, there can be no colour to make the Liberty larger, becauſe for any thing elſe they are not reſtrain'd from moving it in Arreſt of Judgment for there can be no hardſhip in that Caſe as I think they have no reaſon to complain that there has been in any other part of the Caſe, but for thoſe Particulars that there may be no Complaint of Hardſhip, if your Lordſhip thinks it reaſonable we ſhould conſent it may be we may be prevail'd upon to do it, though whatever Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip does happen it is their own fault, and the Priſoner may thank
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58191:17"/>
his own Counſel for that Hardſhip: If we aſſiſt them now to let them in it ought to be taken as a great Kindneſs, and truly, my Lord, I am unwilling to do any thing that your Lordſhip and the Court ſhould think hard upon the Priſoner. Certainly it is the fault of their own Counſel now the Law has allow'd the Priſoner Counſel not to take the proper time and purſue the uſual Methods; and it is a ſtrain beyond what is uſual, that we muſt help their Faults by our Conſent; however if the Court think it Reaſonable I ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, but then I am ſure the Court will take care they ſhall be confin'd to thoſe Particulars that are mentioned in the Act.</p>

I beg the Favour that I may have the Liberty to propoſe my Objections, which I think are worth Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of; it is for the advantage of the King for us to take our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions all together, becauſe, elſe if any of them prove material the trouble of the Tryal will be but miſpence of time.</p>

                  <p>Upon the Statute of <hi>Jeofailes</hi> in a civil cauſe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at a Tryal at Bar, it appears upon the Face of the Declaration, that there is ſuch a miſtake as will be cured by the Verdict; but if the party had demurred, and ſhown it for cauſe, it would have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Do you think when he has wav'd the benefit of Demurrer and pleaded to Iſſue, that you ſhall move this and help your ſelf by ſuch a Motion, becauſe it will be helpt after a Verdict?</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower,</hi> you inſiſt upon part of the words of the Act of Parliament, it ſays, no Indictment or Proceſs ſhall be quaſht upon the Motion of the Priſoner or his Councel, unleſs it be made before any Evidence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, I ſuppoſe, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uſe that Expreſſion, <hi>upon the Motion,</hi> in the ſame ſence as it is uſed in Law, <hi>viz.</hi> for ſuch a one as ſhould be in the time when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for quaſhing the Indictments are properly to be made; now, when is that? it is plain, it was always before the Jury come to the Bar, nay before the Plea of the Party. If that be the proper time to make ſuch a Motion, then that Expreſſion in this Act of a <hi>Motion to quaſh the Indictment</hi> will very well help to conſtrue the other part of the Clauſe that you inſiſt upon: for if the Motion be made before Plea pleaded, it is certainly before the <hi>Evidence given</hi> in your ſenſe. And I conceive, that under that Expreſſion
<stage>[Evidence given]</stage>
which ſignifies the <hi>main</hi> part, the Parliament intended to comprehend the whole proceeding to Tryal, Beginning, if not from the pleading <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> at leaſt, from the <hi>ſwearing</hi> the Jury. <hi>Before Evidence given in Court,</hi> may reaſonably be expounded, <hi>Before the Priſoner hath fully entred into that Conteſtation of the Fact, which is to be determined only</hi> by Evidence in Court. I attended the Court of <hi>King's-Bench</hi> a long time, and I believe that I have heard it ſaid a hundred times, upon Motions to quaſh Indictments of great or odious Offences; no, try it, ſays the Court, we will not quaſh it, plead to it, let the Fact be tryed, you may then move it in Arreſt of Judgment. Thoſe Expreſſions ſhew'd that the proper time for a Motion to quaſh an Indictment was before Plea, tho' they in their Diſcretion would not grant a Motion to quaſh, in Caſes of ſuch great Offences. But ſure they did not think that when a Jury came to the Bar, it was a tolerable time to move to quaſh
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58191:18"/>
an Indictment, there was no expectation of hearing of ſuch a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then. And certainly this clauſe which is made wholly againſt the Priſoner, ſhould not be conſtrued to help him to ſuch a new extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and abſurd Liberty.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, with ſubmiſſion, that practice goes upon another reaſon, the Court would not Quaſh it at all upon a Motion; this Act of Parliament ſuppoſes that you will Quaſh upon a Motion at any time before Evidence given; We never heard of a Motion to Quaſh an Indictment for Felony or Treaſon, but ſtill the Court would always ſay, Demur, or Plead, or move in Arreſt of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by this Law it ſeems the Sence of the Parliament was, that it might be Quaſht upon a Motion.</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>B. Shower</hi> is come to what I ſaid, that in truth there is no ſuch thing as Quaſhing an Indictment for Treaſon or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, as I mention'd. Sir <hi>Rich. Manſel</hi>'s Caſe, and I think the Rule that was given in that Caſe will ſerve now in this Caſe; I am for conſenting if they be kept within the Limits of the Act of Parliament, but I muſt Deſire the Opinion of the Court before we do Conſent.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J. H.</speaker>
                  <p>Aye, aye, go on brother <hi>Nevile.</hi>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>J. Nevile,</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs I cannot but doubt, as this Act is, there were two times that they had liberty of taking theſe Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Indictments; but indeed, in Murder and Treaſon they were ſeldom admitted, till they came to move in Arreſt of Judgment; but ſtill there was always a priviledge, and a time given to the Priſoner, be the Crime what it would, to take that advantage which the Law gave him, to prevent Judgment againſt him. Now I agree, it is irregular and unſeaſonable to offer it now, and quite different from all former practice; you might have done it before, now the Act ſays expreſlly it muſt be done before Evidence; but you might have taken advantage before the Jury was ſworn, nay before you had pleaded, but you have lapſed your time. Yet truly, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding you have lapſed your time, I cannot ſatisfie my ſelf to take away the liberty that the Law has given the Priſoner ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other, to except againſt the Indictment. It is plain, that before this Act, after Verdict he might have moved in Arreſt of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, now he cannot do ſo, whether the fault be in the Councel I cannot tell, but the great prejudice is to the Perſon that is to be Try'd, who will now be wholly precluded from making any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Exceptions he has to the Indictment, becauſe by the Act he cannot move in Arreſt of Judgment. This ſeems a ſtrong Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication that the Parliament intended he muſt have ſome time or other, but before Evidence given, to offer his Exceptions. I ſay this only to thoſe particular things that are mentioned in the Act, Miſwriting, Miſſpelling, Falſe or Improper Latin; as to theſe four particular things which the Party is barr'd from moving in Arreſt of Judgment, I cannot ſatisfie my ſelf but that he ſhould have one time or another to take this advantage before the Evidence given, and therefore I think he ſhould have it now: It is true, it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58191:19"/>
irregular, the Jury being ſworn, and it ought to have been done before; but I hope, if it be admitted now, it will be with ſuch obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that no body will ever offer at it for time to come. As this Caſe is before us, and the Act of Parliament, which perhaps may have led the Councel into that miſtake, that it might be any time before Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given, tho' they knew the proper time, and the regular me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in other Caſes, yet I doubt it is hard to put ſuch a Conſtruction upon this Act on the ſudden quite to debar the Priſoner of the benefit of his Exceptions to the Indictment.</p>

                  <p>I have already declar'd my Opinion, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner has had his proper time for making his Exceptions, but he has elapſed that time; but I am not againſt that Motion in a Caſe of Life, upon an Indictment for ſo great a Crime as Treaſon is, and where the Conſequence is ſo great, if it may conſiſt with the Rules of Law, and it be the Sence of the Court, and the King's Councel conſent to let them be heard, I ſubmit to it, nay I would ſecond or third that Motion that they may be heard.</p>

                  <p>Truly I am of the ſame Opinion, I think we ought not to alter the ancient Courſe of Law by words of Implication, nor go any farther then the Act of Parliament do's expreſs. The Act ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points that a Copy of the Indictment ſhould be delivered to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſo many days before, to enable him to make his Exceptions, and therefore deprives him of the benefit of thoſe Exceptions after Conviction in Arreſt of Judgment. I ſee no words in the Act of Parliament that do alter the Courſe of Proceedings, as to this Matter, from what it was in all Civil and Criminal Cauſes before; Perſons muſt take their advantage of Excepting in their proper time, but when it comes to Iſſue, the next thing to be done is the Tryel; And truly I muſt needs ſay the Councel are to blame, that knew this ſo very well, that if they have any advantage of Excepting, they did not take that advantage ſooner, it is their fault; but ſeeing it is ſo, I am of Opinion, not to forecloſe the Priſoner, as the Caſe ſtands. I would be tender of Life, but at the ſame time I declare my Opinion upon this Act of Parliament as the reſt of my Brothers have done, to prevent the Objection for the time to come; yet ſeeing there is this Misfortune, and there would be a Hardſhip upon the Priſoner by the default and neglect of his Councel in the Caſe of a Man's Life, I would be ſo tender as to indulge them to make their Objections now.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I am the ſame Opinion the Priſoner has lap'ſt his time, for I take it this Clauſe of this Act of Parliament has not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Common Courſe of Proceedings, nay, I take it ſignifies very little in this Caſe, for certainly it was intended to diſable the Priſoner, and not to enable him at all; And therefore, as this Caſe is, I think it very Irregular and Impracticable to introduce ſo great a Novelty, as to admit the Motion for quaſhing the Indictment; When the Jury is Sworn, and when the Fact is the onely ſingle Point to be Determin'd and every thing elſe ought in Legal Courſe to come before or after; but for us to Confound time, one time
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58191:19"/>
for Pleading, another time for Tryal, and another for Arreſt of Judgment, all at once, and to have a Jury attending meerly to hear Councel at the Bar moot Points of Law, which might be Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd either before or after the Tryal, is ſo very Irregular, that it really Introduces nothing but Confuſion, which Courts of Juſtice ought to avoid above all Things, and ought to keep to the proper Seaſons that the Law allows: Therefore, truly I think in ſtrictneſs of Law we ought not to allow it; but it being in a Caſe of Life, and it being a new Caſe upon a new Act of Parliament, if the King's Councel think's fit to Conſent, I ſhall be for it, if not, I think in ſtrictneſs of Law we cannot allow it.</p>

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, The Priſoner at the Bar, <hi>Ambroſe Rookwood,</hi> ſtands In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for High Treaſon, in Compaſſing and Imagining the Death of his Majeſty. Gentlemen, the Overt Acts that are laid in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment to prove this Treaſon, are, that He, together with divers Others, had frequent Meetings and Conſultations, in order to Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinating His Majeſty's Royal Perſon, and did provide Horſes and Arms for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, the Evidence that you will hear, to prove theſe Facts that are thus laid, will be of this nature; you will hear by the Witneſs, That there has been for ſome Years a Deſign carried on to Murder the King's Perſon; That this was Diſcours'd of, and ſeveral Debates and Conſultations were had about it the laſt Year, ſome time before the King went to Flanders; there was ſeveral Meetings, where were Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> and <hi>Chernock</hi> that was Executed, and ſeveral others, and there they did Conſider in what way to take off the King at that time; and you will here they did expect a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to authoriſe it from the late King <hi>James</hi>; but then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion did not come, they had not any ſuch at that time; but they did think fit to put it in Execution without any ſuch Order and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and therefore they endeavoured to have got a Veſſel to have Carri'd them off after they had Executed this Bloody Conſpiracy, but it hapn'd His Majeſty went to <hi>Flanders</hi> ſooner then they thought, and they could not provide themſelves of a Security for a Retreat, and ſo at that time the Deſign was laid aſide.</p>
                  <p>But Gentlemen, you will hear this Conſpiracy was Renewed and, Set on foot this Winter, and in Order to the Accompliſhment of it you will hear, that about Chriſtmaſs laſt there were ſeveral Perſons ſent from <hi>France</hi> by the late King <hi>James,</hi> on purpoſe to put this Horrible Deſign in Execution. Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> was to be at the Head of it, he was a Lieutenant in one of the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Troops of Guards in France, he was ſent over with a Commiſſion, and Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, was a Brigadeer in the Guards there; Theſe came over, and ſeveral other Troopers of the late King <hi>James</hi> Guards, by two or three at a time, that they might not be obſerv'd; particularly you will hear, that when Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> was come over, ſeveral Troopers was ſent to by King <hi>James</hi> himſelf to come to him at Saint <hi>Germains,</hi> and there he told them he had a piece of Service for them to do in <hi>England,</hi> and that they ſhould obſerve Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi>'s Orders and Directions. More particularly there were one <hi>Harris</hi> and <hi>Hare,</hi> two Troopers in the Guards, was ſent for by the late King <hi>James</hi> into the late Queen's Bed-Chamber at Saint <hi>Germains,</hi> where Collonel <hi>Parker</hi> was preſent; they were told by the late King He was ſenſible they had ſerved him faithfully, and He would advance them, and He had now a piece of Service for them to do, which would enable him to do it; He told them, they muſt go
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58191:20"/>
over into <hi>England,</hi> and be ſure to obey Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi>'s directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they were ordered to endeavour to find out Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> when they came into <hi>England</hi>; and were told by him, that they would meet Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> twice a Week in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Square, in the Evening, and the token by which they ſhou'd know him, was, he would were a White Hankerchief out of his Pocket; this they were told by the late King, when he ſent them upon this Errant; Colonel <hi>Parker</hi> was by at the ſame time, and being there he was ordered to go to Mr. <hi>Carol</hi> Secretary to the late Queen, who had order to furniſh them with Mony, to bear the charges of their Journey into <hi>England,</hi> and if they were detained by contrary Winds, they had Letters of Recommendation to Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Latour,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Preſident at <hi>Callis,</hi> to furniſh them with Mony, to bear their charges over into <hi>England,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they went; but being detained at <hi>Callis</hi> for want of a Wind, they were furniſhed by the <hi>French</hi> Preſident; and by the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> they came over.</p>
                  <p>But I omitted one thing, Gentlemen: Before they came over, the late King when they were with him took a Liſt out of his Pocket of Names, and told theſe two, <hi>Harris</hi> and <hi>Hare,</hi> what Names they ſhould go by in <hi>England; Harris</hi> was to go by the Name of <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> and <hi>Hare</hi> by the Name of <hi>Guiny,</hi> and accordingly they came over in a Boat, and landed in <hi>Kent,</hi> and when they came to Town they endeavoured to find out Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi>: The firſt time I think they did not find him; but the ſecond time they did find him; and he Saluted them, and told them he was glad to ſee them come over, and he would furniſh them with Mony, and he ſent Major <hi>Holmes</hi> to them, and accordingly he did come, and give them Subſiſtence Mony.</p>
                  <p>Now Gentlemen, you will hear that Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> being come over with theſe Troopers and many others, to the number of 16, that at ſeveral times were ſent upon this Conſpiracy, I ſay, after they were come, Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> had frequent Meetings and Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with ſeveral other Perſons that were to be engaged in the ſame Deſign; and they met at ſeveral places, ſometimes at Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Porters,</hi> ſometimes at the <hi>Nags-head</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time at the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand</hi>; and you will find by the Evidence, that the Priſoner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at moſt of thoſe Meetings, and there they did Conſult of the beſt ways and methods for putting this Conſpiracy in execution; ſometimes they thought of doing it by an Ambuſh, laid on the other ſide of the Water, by Perſons on foot, in a little Wood there near <hi>Richmond,</hi> where the King was to paſs by, whilſt others on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back were to take notice of their Firing, and then to Attack the Guards. This was propoſed, but there was another Propoſal to do it on this ſide the Water; and therefore to ſettle the matter, one of the Conſpirators, <hi>King,</hi> was ſent to view the Ground on the other ſide of the Water, and he did Glory that he had found a very proper place, and thought it a very Convenient method, but yet they were not all ſatisfied, and at the <hi>Nags-head</hi> Tavern in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi>

they did Debate the matter again, and it was reſolved to have the Ground viewed again, and <hi>Porter,</hi> and <hi>Knightly,</hi> and <hi>King</hi> that was executed went to view the Ground on both ſides the Water, to ſee which was the moſt convenient place; this was about the 12th of <hi>February</hi> they did take an account of the moſt convenient places on either ſide, and when they had done it, they came back in the Evening to give an account what they had done, to ſeveral others of the Conſpirators, who met for that purpoſe, and I think the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> was preſent there at this Meeting; and you will hear, the place agreed upon was the Lane that leads from <hi>Turnham-Green</hi> to <hi>Brentford,</hi> that they thought the moſt convenient place, becauſe there were ſeveral Inns in and about <hi>Turnham-Green,</hi> and <hi>Brentford,</hi> where they might place their Men by two or three in an Inn, that they might not be lyable to obſervation: This was the place that was approved of.</p>
                  <p>Then next, the manner of doing it was to be conſidered and adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and that was thus: That the whole number ſhould be divided into three Parties, one Party to be commanded by Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> to attack the Coach, and Kill the King, and all that were in it, while at the ſame time the two other Parties to be commanded by Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, were to ſet upon the Guards; and the time agreed upon to put it in Execution was the Fifteenth of <hi>February</hi> on <hi>Saturday,</hi> that being the uſual day the King went to <hi>Richmond</hi> a Hunting, and you'll find that on <hi>Saturday</hi> Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they met in ſeveral Parties, not altogether, but under the ſeveral Heads of the Parties in order to be ready, if the King had gone out that Morning, to have Aſſaſſinated him.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I ſay, you will hear of ſeveral Meetings that day; there was one Meeting at Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi>'s, where were preſent Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> and ſeveral others; and another Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you will hear of where the Priſoner at the Barr was preſent, at the Lodgings of one <hi>Counter,</hi> another of King <hi>James</hi>'s Friends, that came over for this purpoſe, and there was Sir <hi>George Berclay,</hi> and there was the Priſoner at the Bar; and thoſe that were to be under Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand met that <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning in order to make ready, in caſe the King had gone abroad, to have attackt him: You will find by the Evidence that the Priſoner was there, and <hi>Harris</hi> that was one of the Troopers ſent over from <hi>France,</hi> was ſent for, and came in and found them in a great Hurry, for <hi>Harris</hi> was not acquainted at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> with the immediate Deſign of Aſſaſſinating the King, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in a great Hurry he askt them what was the matter? And they told him they were to make ready immediately upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. He wonder'd at it, and askt what it was, and then they told him they were to go to Attack the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to Aſſaſſinate him, and <hi>Rookwood</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar told him, if he would go to <hi>Counter</hi> he ſhould have particular Orders and Inſtructions from him what to do. Accordingly <hi>Harris</hi> went to <hi>Counter,</hi> he told him where his Horſe and <hi>Hare</hi>'s Horſe, and <hi>Hungate</hi>'s Horſe were; and their Horſes hapned to be placed in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> in a Stable there recommended by him, to the Care of my Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who were to take care of them, and of two or three more that were placed there, in all, ſix of theſe Conſpirators Horſes by the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58191:21"/>
Recommendation of Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> were lodged in that Stable in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> and lookt after by my Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi>'s Men; and thither <hi>Harris, Hare,</hi> and <hi>Hungate,</hi> were directed by <hi>Counter</hi> to go for their Horſes.</p>
                  <p>But it hapned by very good Providence, that his Majeſty did not go abroad that day; and <hi>Darance,</hi> one of the Orderly Men that Lodged at <hi>Kenſington</hi> to give Intelligence, came from thence and acquainted them, that the King did not go out that Morning, ſo there was nothing more done; but <hi>Harris</hi> was told that he ſhould have his Horſe at that time, and take it away, and in the mean time till they were to go upon their Deſign, they were to Ride out upon their Horſes, as they had opportunity to make them fit for Service, or elſe it would be thought the Riders fault if at the time of the Attack, they did not come up in good time and order to join with the reſt, and it would be thought want of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in the Rider; and accordingly Major <hi>Holmes,</hi> another of thoſe Conſpirators, went with <hi>Harris</hi> and <hi>Hare</hi> to <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> to take away their Horſes, and they carried them to a Stable in <hi>Soho</hi>; but for ſeveral Nights they had been kept at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will find, Gentlemen, that Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar was concerned in all theſe Conſultations and Meetings, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Preparations for the Aſſaſſination they intended, as I ſaid, to do it on the Fifteenth of <hi>February</hi>; but that not taking effect at that day, between that and the <hi>Saturday</hi> following, Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> was frequently in the Company of Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> and others, where they did diſcourſe of this Aſſaſſinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they did think it a very Barbarous Thing, but however they Reſolved they would do it, for they had Orders to Obey Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi>; and this was expreſly declared by <hi>Lowick</hi> and the Priſoner, that they had Directions to Obey Sir <hi>George,</hi> and what he would have them do they would do; they muſt and would Obey Orders; that was their Reſolution even upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of the Hainouſneſs of ſo Bloody and Barbarous a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
                  <p>You will likewiſe hear, Gentlemen, by the Evidence, that the next <hi>Saturday</hi> being the Two and Twentieth of <hi>February,</hi> they Reſolved to put it in Execution again, and accordingly there was a Meeting on the <hi>Friday</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before at the <hi>Sun-Tavern,</hi> where were preſent Sir <hi>George Berclay,</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and others; and there they did Reſolve upon it, though they had at firſt ſome Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion the Thing was Diſcovered, but they were ſoon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied there was no ſuch thing, becauſe they ſaid among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that if it had been ſo they ſhould have been taken up, and not have been permitted to meet there; therefore they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the next day to put it in Execution, and accordingly they met at ſeveral Places, and got ready in the Morning, in caſe the King had gone abroad; the Priſoner met that Morning at <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Lodging, with ſeveral other Troopers, to make ready for the Enterprize, and there the Priſoner at the Bar, did, at that time,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58191:22"/>
give a Liſt of the Names that he was to Command, for he was to have one Party of thoſe that were to Attack the Guards, of whom <hi>Harris</hi> was one, and <hi>Hare</hi> was another, and <hi>Richardſon</hi> was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Blackburne</hi> was another, and his own name was chief, and he ordered <hi>Harris</hi> to go and ſee to get them ready, for they muſt go out that Morning; accordingly <hi>Harris</hi> did go, and got them ready, and came back and gave an account of it. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty did not go abroad that day, as it hapned very Fortunately by reaſon of the happy diſcovery, ſo that news being brought back again, though they had made all things ready, thoſe Preparations were put off, and they did nothing that day, and quickly after the Diſcovery was fully made, and made publick by the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Conſpirators.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you will have this matter fully proved to you by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Witneſſes, that I think there can be no room to doubt the truth of it, that there was ſuch a Conſpiracy, and that the Priſoner was as highly concern'd in it, as thoſe that have ſuffered the juſt puniſhment of the Law: We will call our Witneſſes to prove this, and I believe they will be able to give you an account of the whole Affair, better and more fully than I can do, or can pretend to open it.</p>

                  <p>It was in the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Caſtlemaine</hi> at this Barr; one of my Lords the Judges went to the Court of <hi>Common Pleas</hi> to ask their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and theſe Caſes were put, in caſe a Man be Out-law'd of Felony and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd; in caſe a Man be Convicted of Felony, and had the Benefit of his Clergy, and in caſe a Man were Convicted and not Attainted; but pardon'd upon the ſecond Caſe, they were of Opinion, that the receiving the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Burning in the hand, had purg'd the very Guilt, and did ſet him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right by the Statute of the 15<hi>th.</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they thought it did operate to that purpoſe; but in the caſe of a Pardon of a Man Attainted or Convicted, it was agreed he was not qualified to be a Witneſs; and <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> againſt whom the Objection was made, being burnt in the hand, was received to be a Witneſs; and it was only made uſe of againſt him to take off his Credit. The Record of that Caſe is in this Court, and I look'd upon the Print of the Tryal this day. We ſay that there is a Caſe in firſt <hi>Brownlow</hi> 47. a Man attainted of Felony cannot be of an Inqueſt, tho' par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd; and we think, he that cannot be a Jury-man, ſure cannot be a Witneſs; there is the ſame Exception to his being a Witneſs as there is in the Caſe of a Jury-man, for the one ought to appear as free, and ſtands as clear and unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, in reſpect of his Probity and Verity as the other; as the one is ſworn to Try and Determine upon his Oath, ſo the other is ſworn, and his Oath is to Sway and Determine the Jury, and in conſequence it is all one, and upon theſe Reaſons we hope he is not a good Witneſs.</p>

                  <p>When the King has once pardon'd him he is not an Offender within the meaning of the Act of Parliament, and therefore the Act works no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as to him, and ſo he ſtands as much diſabled from being a Witneſs, as he was before.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe Caſes that have been put, are no Authorities at all in this Matter, for where there is a Conviction of Man-ſlaughter, and the Party is pardon'd, we think that Pardon of the King works in a way of Diſcharge as much as the Burning in the hand. I take it, it is the ſame thing: they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that will Diſcharge him to all Intents and Purpoſes, and ſo we think does this as effectually; for having his Clergy, and being Burnt in the hand, works by way of Statute Pardon; for the Caſe of a Jury-man, I take it not to be the ſame with this Caſe; but yet even in that Caſe, I do not think that the Party convicted, after the King hath pardon'd him, is diſabled from being of a Jury; but ſuppoſing that to be ſo, yet there are many Caſes wherein a Man may be a Witneſs, that cannot be a Jury-man; it is true, the Credit of ſuch a Witneſs is left to the Jury, but it is no Objection againſt his being a Legal Witneſs; and it is a very ſtrange Argument to me, that becauſe he was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd by the King, if that ſhould be deficient that therefore the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſhould have no effect. Truly, that is to ſay, that the King's Pardon works ſo, as to have nothing left for the Parliament Pardon to work upon, and certainly it ſets him ſo right, that to all intents and purpoſes he is as good a Witneſs as ever he was; and if any thing remained to be done, the Act of Parliament has done it and ſupplied the defect, but I think the King's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is ſufficient.</p>

try'd at this Bar for Treaſon, and <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was produced as a Witneſs, and the Priſoner took exception againſt him as no good Witneſs, becauſe he had ſtood in the Pillory, and your Lordſhip and the Court did ſay that the Act of Pardon did reſtore him to all intents and purpoſes, <hi>ad liberum Legem.</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, in anſwer to that Caſe that was put, that after the King's Pardon for one convicted of Felony another Man has not the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to call him Thief, that was an Objection in my Lord <hi>Caſtlemaine</hi>'s Caſe, that may ſtand as good, and our Notion that we contend for, be good top; he cannot be impeach'd, or have Guilt imputed to him, when once the King has forgiven him, and yet that may not reſtore him to his intire Credit as was my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi>'s Diſtinction in the Caſe of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield,</hi> and as to the Caſe of <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> that was very different, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in that Caſe was becauſe the Crime for which Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was Indicted, did not import any ſuch ſcandalous Offence for which his Credit could be impeach'd.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>But in that Caſe, they did not inſiſt upon it, that he had a Pardon antecedant to the Act of Pardon, ſo that he was <hi>ſubjectum Capax,</hi> for the Act to work upon, he was an Offender that needed a Pardon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> being pardon'd before, could not be an Offender needing a Pardon, and conſequently not within the firſt words of the Act of Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, becauſe he was pardon'd by the King before, but he was not by that Pardon, ſay we, reſtor'd to his Credit to make him a good Witneſs, and the Act of Parliament did not affect him, he being not <hi>ſubjectum Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> as not being an Offender.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>As to Mr. Sollicitor's Caſe of <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> we agree the Act of Parliament did reſtore him, becauſe he never was pardon'd before by the King, ſo there remained an Offence for the Parliament Pardon to work upon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Do you agree that, then you may agree the other, for the Act of Parliament pardons none but thoſe the King can Pardon generally.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Phipps.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>It true, my Lord, but we ſay that an Act of Parliament Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, removes thoſe diſabilities which the King's Pardon does not, for every one is in Law a Party to an Act of Parliament, and therefore no Perſon ſhall be permitted to alledge in diſability of another, any Crime which he himſelf hath pardon'd, for that is to aver againſt his own Act, but 'tis otherwiſe in the Caſe of the King's Pardon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Holt.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Why, the Very Parliament Pardon comes from the King; the King has a full Power of Pardoning, and where he does Pardon under the Great Seal, it has the full effect of a Parliament Pardon. A Pardon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Attainder, prevents all corruption of Blood, ſo that tho' a Man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits his Goods by Conviction, yet after a Pardon he is capable of having new Goods, and ſhall hold them without any forfeiture whatſoever, for the Pardon reſtores him to his former Capacity, and prevents any further for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture. Indeed if he had been Attainted whereby his Blood was corrupted,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58191:24"/>
no Pardon, whether it were by the King or by the Parliament, could purge his Blood without Reverſal of the Attainder, by Writ of Error, or Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or expreſs words in the Act to reſtore Blood; but either Pardon makes him a new Creature, gives him new Capacity, and makes him to all intents and purpoſes, from the time of the Pardon to be <hi>probus &amp; legalis Homo,</hi> and a good Witneſs. Indeed this Crime might be objected againſt his Credit, but it is not to be urged againſt the ſufficiency of his Evidence, that is, his being a Witneſs.</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>George Berclay,</hi> and after that we had ſeveral Meetings, at which the Priſoner at the Bar was preſent, particularly at the <hi>Globe-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> where it was conſulted of the beſt ways and means to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinate the King as he came from <hi>Richmond:</hi> ſome were of Opinion that it was beſt to be done on the other ſide of the Water, others were of Opinion that it ſhould be done on this ſide, by a Party of Men on Horſe-back; upon this Difference of Opinion, there were Perſons appointed to go and view both places, I was appointed for one to go with Captain <hi>Knightley,</hi> and Mr. <hi>King</hi> went along with me, and we did view the Ground on both ſides, and when we came back, we gave an Account to Sir <hi>George Berclay,</hi> and thoſe that ſent us, and upon our Report, Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi>'s mind was chang'd, who was for the other ſide of the Water before. And he agreed to do it in the Lane that leads from <hi>Turnham-Green</hi> to <hi>Brentford,</hi> afterwards there was a Meeting at the <hi>Glole-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> and there it was agreed that the King ſhould be Attack'd on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> by Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> and his Party, and Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, was to Command a Party of Men that came over from <hi>France,</hi> who were to Aſſault the Guards on one ſide, and I and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> were to ſet upon the Guards on the other ſide. Sir <hi>Gearge Berclay,</hi> with four Men put of each Party, was to Attack the King in his Coach, and to Kill him and all that were there in it.</p>

                  <p>At the <hi>Globe-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> upon <hi>Saturday</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the 15<hi>th.</hi> we having two orderly Men that lay at <hi>Kenſington</hi> to give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, had Notice brought us firſt that the King would go out; <hi>Durance,</hi> who was one of them, uſed to go every Morning to Court to get us what Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he could, and Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> told me upon the <hi>Friday,</hi> that he ſhould give me an Account as ſoon as ever he could the next Morning; and the next Morning at my Lodging in <hi>Little Rider ſtreet</hi> in St. <hi>James</hi>'s, he came to me, and told me, the Advance Guards was gone out, and the King's Kitchin was gone, and all was preparing for the King's going abroad, and there went a great many Noble Men and Gentlemen a Horſe-back with him, and therefore
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58191:24"/>
he thought there would be no Opportunity of effecting the thing; ſaid I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that's no Objection at all, nor any reaſon for putting it off, becauſe when the Sport is over, all the Company goes away, and the King comes only in his Coach with the Guards; he ſaid, he would give Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> an Account of it, and he came back with Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> to my Lodging, and upon repeating that Objection, and my giving the ſame Anſwer, it was agreed if the King had gone out that day to have put the Deſign in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>

                  <p>It was diſcourſed by every one round, which was the beſt way and method.

                  <p>My Lord, we beg leave to oppoſe Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>'s being ſworn; here was a Proclamation that did take notice of this barbarous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to aſſaſſinate the King, and the Proclamation did ſignifie, That the King had received information of ſeveral Perſons concerned in that Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and for the encouragement of taking thoſe ſo accuſed, he did promiſe a Thouſand Pounds reward for the taking of any of the Conſpirators; and in the concluſion of the Proclamation there is a Clauſe, <hi>That if any of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators ſhould diſcover or apprehend any of the other Perſons that were therein named, ſo as that they ſhould be brought to condign Puniſhment, ſuch Conſpirator ſo diſcovering ſhould receive a Thouſand Pounds reward for any of the other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons apprehended, and his own Pardon.</hi> My Lord, we have a Witneſs here ready to prove that this was Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>'s Caſe; he was himſelf in the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, he did actually diſcover Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, and was inſtrumental in the taking of him; and conſequently upon this Clauſe of the Proclamation, if he be brought to Juſtice, then is Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> intitled to this Reward and his Pardon; and conſequently he has ſuch an Intereſt and Advantage to himſelf as will prevent his being a Witneſs. It is true, indeed, where it is at the King's Suit, in a capital Caſe, it is pretty hard to ſay that a man has an Intereſt; but we think, as this Caſe is circumſtantiated upon this Proclamation, that the ſame Objection lies againſt him as would do if this were a civil Cauſe; if we ſhew how he is to have an Advantage by the event of this Cauſe, then he is not to be admitted a Witneſs.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir <hi>B. Shower.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Yes, he apprehended Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> himſelf, or was the cauſe of it, and thereby is intitled to the Reward and his Pardon.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>That upon which we ground our Objection is the different penning of the Proclamation; for if any one that is not a Conſpirator do but diſcover and apprehend any of the Perſons named in the Proclamation, he is entitled to the Thouſand Pounds; but the Conſpirators themſelves muſt go further; for a bare Diſcovery and Apprehending any of their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices will not entitle them to the Reward mentioned in the Proclamation, but they muſt diſcover and apprehend their Accomplices ſo as they be brought to Juſtice before they can be entitled to the Reward: And to be brought to Juſtice for any Crime, is in common underſtanding to be brought to ſuch Puniſhment as the Law inflicts for the Offence. Now Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>'s Caſe is this, he diſcovered Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and went with the Guards to the Compter and ſeiz'd him: And if Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> ben't convicted, Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> is not to have any thing for his pains; but if he be convicted, Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> is entitled to the Thouſand Pounds and his Pardon. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurely Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> cannot be admitted an Evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> ſince he is to receive ſo great a Benefit by his Conviction. Upon an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a uſurious Contract, the Perſon whoſe Deed it is cannot be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe 'tis to avoid his own Act: So in an Indictment for Perjury, on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58191:26"/>
the Stat. 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Party injured by the Perjury cannot be a Witneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is to have half the Forfeitures.</p>

                  <p>Then, My Lord, with humble Submiſſion, here is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Proclamation wherein he is nam'd, we deſire that may be read.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>And when it is read, it will be as little to your Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as the other.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Let them read what they pleaſe, we need ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly upon this Proclamation there's no Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for he is intitled to his One thouſand Pound already, tho' <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> be never convicted.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
                  <p>But is he not by this Proclamation which mentions his Accomplices, intitled to his Pardon? If ſo, he ſwears to ſecure himſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>By the Apprehending and Diſcovering, he's intitled to his Pardon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
                  <p>But not without he be brought to Juſtice; that is to ſay, till he be convicted; therefore he cannot be an Evidence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>That is, as to any that are there named, if any of them Diſcover and Apprehend one another, it muſt be ſo as that they be brought to Juſtice: But if any Perſon that is not named there does Apprehend any that is, he is intitled to the One Thouſand Pound, barely by the Apprehenſion.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
                  <p>Then there is another Proclamation where they are both named, as Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> tells me.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, We will ſet this Matter right; we will ſhow the other Proclamation, in which, if I am rightly inform'd, for I have not read it, Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> is nam'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>If you have not read it, I would adviſe you not to trouble the Court with it; for you will find the latter part is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to Three or Four particular Perſons, of which he is none.</p>

                  <speaker>Rookwood.</speaker>
                  <p>I am named in the Proclamation.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, but read the latter part of it, and you will find you are not nam'd in that Clauſe that they referr'd to: You need not read the former part of the Proclamation, we agree the Priſoner is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med there; but only look towards the bottom, which is the Clauſe that they refer to.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>They have not conſidered the Proclamation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make an Objection of they don't know what.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>We are in your Lordſhip's Judgment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>For what? See if you can make or ſtate a Caſe for our Judgment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> is mention'd in the firſt Proclamation, and <hi>Harris</hi> is not, but there are the Word Accomplices: He is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe mentioned in the laſt Proclamation, but not in the laſt Clauſe of it. I confeſs, if he had, it had been plain it would have taken off his Teſtimony; but now we muſt ſubmit it to you, whether he is not an Intereſted Perſon, and conſequently no good Witneſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly I do not ſee any colour for the Objection. Is he not as well intituled to his One thouſand Pound, tho' Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> had never been try'd, by the bare Apprehending of Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> as if he was Convicted?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir. B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>No, my Lord; becauſe the Words are ſo as he may be brought to Juſtice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>That is not ſo, as to any Perſon that apprehends one mentioned in the Proclamation, if the Perſon that apprehends be not mention'd in it, and named himſelf; if any one that is not mention'd apprehend one that is mention'd, he is intituled, by the Apprehenſion, to the One thouſand Pound. If any one that is mention'd apprehend another, then he is to bring him to Juſtice; now Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in this Proclamation, and ſo, as to the One thouſand Pound, he ſtands in the ſame Condition as any other Perſon that Diſcovered or Apprehended one of the Perſons there nam'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower,</speaker>
                  <p>But it ſeems he was one of the Conſpirators, becauſe he is himſelf deſcribed in another Proclamation.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>If it were ſo, it would not be material, nor any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Objection, but as they have made their Objection upon theſe Proclamations, we think there is nothing for us to give an Anſwer to.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Mr. Cowper,</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, my Lord, if it were ſo, will Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower</hi> ſay his Client is not brought to Juſtice, unleſs he be Convicted? I am ſure the Words <hi>Convicted</hi> or <hi>Attainted,</hi> are not in the Proclamation.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt,</speaker>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris,</speaker>
                  <p>Upon the 14th. of <hi>January</hi> laſt, the French Stile, New Stile, I was at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> where I was ſent for by King <hi>James,</hi> and was ordered to wait his Dinner till it was over, and accordingly I did wait till his Dinner was over, and then I came in, and Col. <hi>Parker</hi> was with him, and one Mr. <hi>Hare</hi> who is alſo mentioned in the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was there alſo: the King told me he was ſenſible I had ſerved him well, and now he had an Opportunity of doing ſomething for me; he told me he would ſend me into <hi>England,</hi> where I ſhould be ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and I was to follow the Orders of Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he ordered me Ten Lewidores to be paid by Mr. <hi>Caroll,</hi> who is Secretary to the late Queen, and Col. <hi>Parker</hi> went along with me, and Mr. <hi>Hare,</hi> to <hi>Caroll,</hi> and told him he came from the King, and we had the Lewidores, and we went to <hi>Calais,</hi> in order to our coming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hither: but we were told if we were Wind-bound, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney we received would not bear our Charges; there was Orders given for our further Subſiſtance at <hi>Calice,</hi> to the Preſident there. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we came to <hi>Calice,</hi> and the Wind did not ſerve us for 8 or 9 days; and while I ſtay'd there, the Money that I ſpent at <hi>Calice</hi> was paid by the Preſident of <hi>Calice,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Latour.</hi> Afterwards I Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England,</hi> near <hi>Romney Marſh,</hi> as I was told, and I came to the Houſe of one <hi>Hunt,</hi> and he provided me and my Comrade with a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Horſes; and coming from thence, I came in the firſt place to one <hi>Tucker</hi>'s an Apothecary in <hi>Sandway,</hi> and next from thence, we came to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> to <hi>Charles Crofts</hi>'s, and from thence in a Coach to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and from thence by Water to <hi>London:</hi> that night we lay in <hi>Grace-Church-ſtreet</hi> at an Inn, it being night, the Night-Tyde, and ſomething late. The next day I came to a Lodging at an Acquaintance of my Comrades, Mr. <hi>Hare,</hi> at the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi> in <hi>Brownlow-ſtreet,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Wateman</hi>'s. The next night I went to look for Sir <hi>George Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,</hi> whom the King told me I ſhould certainly find by ſuch a Sign of a White Handkerchief hanging out of his Pocket, on <hi>Mondays</hi> and <hi>Thurſdays,</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> where his Walk was to be in the Evening, becauſe he was not to appear in the day-time openly. It happen'd that upon <hi>Monday</hi> night after I came to Town, I went there, and did not find Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> according to the King's Direction, which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired at; but there was one Mr. <hi>Berkenhead,</hi> who told my Comrade, a Day or two after, That Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> would needs ſpeak with me, and accordingly I met with him; and he asked me how the King, Queen, Prince, and Princeſs did, and I told him they were very well; I told him I was appointed to attend him, and obey his Orders. He told me he had no Money at preſent, but in two or three Days he would ſend ſome; and ſo he did, by Major <hi>Holmes.</hi> I had Five Shillings a Day for ſubſiſtance, and I had no Horſe; and when I had a Horſe, it was Six Shillings a Day; after which rate I had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance for a Month at Five Shillings a Day, Guinea's going then at Thirty Shillings. Major <hi>Holmes</hi> pay'd me the Money by Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s Order, as he told me, and he afterwards gave me a Guinea, and that was the firſt <hi>Saturday</hi> when the Aſſaſſination was deſign'd;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58191:28"/>
for that we told him we wanted Money, and it was not reaſonable we ſhould take our Horſes out of the Stable before we pay'd for them: And I met Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> ſeveral times at <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and he told me it was a ſuſpicious Place, and deſired me not to come any more there; but when he had any particular Orders to give me, he wou'd give me notice of it where I ſhou'd meet him; and accordingly I did meet him ſeveral times.</p>

                  <p>As to Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> the <hi>Saturday</hi> that the Aſſaſſinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was deſign'd to be, the firſt time that I knew of it, I met Mr. <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> at one Mr. <hi>Burck</hi>'s Lodging, where he was up, and I ſaw him in a great Hurry and ſome Conſternation, and in came Mr. <hi>Bernarde</hi>; I ask'd him the meaning of it, and what they were going about; and Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> told me, If I wou'd go down to Captain <hi>Counter</hi> I ſhou'd know; accordingly I went, and to the beſt of my remembrance, he gave me a little Note to Captain <hi>Counter,</hi> but that I am not poſitive in. I went to Captain <hi>Counter,</hi> and as ſoon as ever I came, he told us, We muſt be immediately ready to go to <hi>Turnham Green.</hi>

                  <p>At the <hi>Woolpack,</hi> that was the Sign—as near as I remember. Mr. <hi>Hare</hi> and I were ordered together to come there, and there was Mr. <hi>Hungate,</hi> who had been there ſome time, and when I came in, Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> did declare Laughing, <hi>Theſe are my Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi>: And he talk'd ſomething of bringing the Garter, and of attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Coach; but he went out of the Room, and afterwards he came in and declared, <hi>We were all Men of Honour, and that the Buſineſs we were going about, was to attack the Prince of</hi> Orange; but <hi>Durant</hi> came in after that, and ſaid, <hi>The Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>did not go out that Day.</hi> When he talk'd of attacking the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> I was very much ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not knowing any thing of it before; and I came the next Morning to Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and ask'd him if we were to be the Murderers of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> to me, <hi>I am afraid we are drawn into ſome ſuch Buſineſs; but if I had known of it before I came over, I ſhould have beg'd the King's Pardon at St.</hi> Germains, <hi>and not have come over hither</hi>; and ſaid I, <hi>This is very fine, we have ſerv'd to a very good purpoſe, to be ſent over upon ſuch an Errant and Account.</hi> After this Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> and I, had a Meeting at <hi>Red-Lyon-Fields,</hi> where we did diſcourſe about the Matter. I did often declare againſt it, That it was ſo barbarous a thing, that no Man of Honour almoſt wou'd be guilty of it, but Major <hi>Lowick</hi> anſwered, That we were to obey Orders, for ſure Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> wou'd not undertake a thing of that nature without Orders.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>He own'd it was a barbarous thing; but he was ſent over to obey Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s Orders, which he had ſeveral times declared he was reſolved to do; upon that we parted: ſo afterwards I came to Mr. <hi>Rookwod</hi>'s Lodging; it was the <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning I came to him, and ſo went to Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s; while he was there, Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> gave me a Note, naming ſo many Names, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mr. <hi>Hungate,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hanford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hare,</hi> and his own Name at top, not the Name that he is Arraigned by here; but a ſham Name that he had, as the reſt of us all had ſham Names, which at that time we went by.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen,</speaker>
                  <p>Pray Sir, let me ask you one Queſtion. Where was your Horſe at firſt?</p>

                  <p>At firſt it was at my Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi>'s Stables, as they told me, in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe.</hi>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>Major <hi>Holmes</hi> did deliver my Horſe, and committed it to my care, and I carry'd it thence to another place.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>He had a Horſe; but whence he had it I don't know.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>This was the Night of <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22d. when it was diſcovered; for ſome of them were taken up the next Day.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>We talk'd of Aſſaſſinating the King; but what it was in particular, I cannot tell.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, we apprehended we were diſcovered before that; for Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> told me, That Three or Four Days before, in that Week, that his Name, and one <hi>Harriſon</hi>'s, were given into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and another, and another, Two or Three of them, as he told me; I think, Three or Four; and upon that Account Major <hi>Lowick</hi> went from his Lodging, and did not lie at his Lodging the Night before; and I came to Major <hi>Lowick,</hi> and he told me the ſame thing at the <hi>King's-Arms</hi> Tavern.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not ſay it was the 22d. for I cannot ſwear to the Day of the Month; but it was the Second <hi>Saturday</hi> that we were to have gone about this Buſineſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>

                  <p>Sir, I think I told the Court that before.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
                  <p>I ask him the Queſtion ſo fairly, what Diſcourſe intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the giving of the Liſt, and what followed upon it, that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Gentleman does not know which ſide I am off.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> ſaid we were to go to <hi>Turnham-Green</hi>; and he told me, that I was to be one of his Party, that we were to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, he did tell me I was to be his <hi>Aid de Camp</hi>?</p>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot tell, I had it from that Gentleman.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
                  <p>But whoſe Writing was it?</p>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed I know not his Hand-writing, and therefore cannot tell whoſe it was: He is for his Life, but I believe he cannot deny any thing that I have ſaid, I ſuppoſe not: I ſhou'd be very ſorry to accuſe Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> of any thing that was not true.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>I have mention'd Mr. <hi>Hare,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hanford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> my ſelf; and you, Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> had your own Name at top.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>

                  <p>It's a very ſtrange thing I ſhould give you a Liſt with a Man's Name that I don't know; I declare it, I know no ſuch Perſon.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>

                  <p>When did you ſee that Liſt laſt?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>He gave it into my Hands, and had it from me again, or I threw it away afterwards.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rookwood.</speaker>
                  <p>But you that were to be an Evidence, ought to have kept it to juſtifie your Evidence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt. Harris.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly I did not intend to have been an Evidence at that time.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>If they will ask him any Queſtions let them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>No indeed, I will ask him no Queſtions.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Then, my Lord, we have another piece of Evidence which we wou'd offer to your Lordſhip, which is not direct Evidence againſt the Priſoner, but only to prove a Circumſtance or two of what has already been ſworn: We do acknowledge, my Lord, it does not affect Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> but only to ſtrengthen and confirm what they have ſworn.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>With ſubmiſſion we hope it will not be Evidence fit to be given as to the Priſoner at all; for becauſe a Man may ſwear true in the particular Circumſtance of a thing, that therefore he ſwears true what he ſwears againſt the Priſoner, I think is no Conſequence in the World.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>It is a thing diſtinct, and foreign to the Matter, as to Mr. <hi>Rookwood.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, we do not ſay it directly affects Mr. <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>; but when your Lordſhip has heard it, we ſhall ſubmit it to you, how far it confirms even the Evidence given againſt him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Conyers.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, we ſay the Priſoner was to have his Horſe from <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi>; and that there were Horſes plac'd there for that purpoſe we are going to prove.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, It is one entire Conſpiracy, in which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one had his part; one was to have his Horſes and his Party in one place, and another in another: Now that there were at ſuch time ſuch Horſes at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> and thoſe Horſes were delivered out from <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> is certainly a Confirmation of the Truth of what the Witneſſes have ſaid.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>It is ſo. If that be it you offer, it is very material.</p>

                  <p>Then, Gentlemen, what ſay you to it for the Priſoner?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>If your Lordſhip pleaſe, we are of Counſel for the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58191:30"/>
Priſoner; and that which we are to inſiſt upon is this, which we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to your Lordſhip's Judgment. In the firſt place, whether here be two Witneſſes againſt the Priſoner to prove this Treaſon according to the Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. which requires two Witneſſes in High-Treaſon, and Lawful Ones; but that in the firſt place we ſay there are not two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes at all, at leaſt not to any Overt-Act that is laid in this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As to what Captain <hi>Porter</hi> ſays of what paſt between him and <hi>Durant,</hi> the Dialogue between them where <hi>Rookwood</hi> was preſent, we are in your Lordſhip's Direction; and we doubt not but the Jury will take it into their Conſideration, how far that affects the Priſoner; that he ſhall not be concern'd in any Tranſaction between Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> and any other Perſons: none of their Declarations, none of their Treaſonable Practices, can be imputed to or affect him in any way whatſoever. Now all that Captain <hi>Porter</hi> ſays of Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> is, that he was once at the <hi>Globe-Tavern,</hi> and there was a Diſcourſe about this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and then he tells your Lordſhip of a Dialogue between him and <hi>Durant,</hi> and Account of what paſſed between them; but he does not ſay any thing of Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> being any ways concern'd in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but only that he dropt this Expreſſion, It was a Deſperate Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Dangerous Enterprize, and he ſeemed againſt it, but in the end he concluded with ſomething in <hi>French,</hi> which what they are, and what they mean, we muſt ſubmit to your Lordſhip and the Jury: he interprets it, when Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> ſaid he muſt have a ſhare in it, then <hi>Rookwood</hi> replied, There's an end of it. But there is not one Word of Agreement ſworn to that Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> ſpoke, to ſhew his Conſent. There is but one time more that Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ſwears to, about the Priſoner at the Bar, and that is, at his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>odging in <hi>Little Rider Street</hi>; for as to the other Conſults, Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there: it ſeems there was a Diſcourſe about the Affair, but that <hi>Rookwood</hi> ſaid nothing, but went away: there was not ſo much as the leaſt Intimation of an Agreement to any ſuch Deſign, or Approbation of what was agitated in the Company: and we inſiſt upon it as to this in point of Law, that it amounts to no more than Miſpriſion of Treaſon at moſt. My Lord, I will not now contend about Notions, nor will I argue whether Conſulting and Agreeing be Evidence of an Overt-Act; I ſubmit to your Lordſhip's Directions, notwithſtanding the Variety and Difference of Opinions that have been.</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower,</hi> I know not what Variety of Opinions you mean; there have been ſome Diſcourſes in Pamphlets I agree, but it was always taken and held for Law, that Conſulting and Agreeing was an Overt-Act.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir <hi>B. Shower.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>It is not the being preſent where Traytors do Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and Conſpire the Death of the King, unleſs they actually agree; nor is it Evidence ſufficient to guide or prevail upon a Jury's Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to affirm upon their Oaths, that ſuch a one is guilty of High-Treaſon, becauſe ſuch a one was there and ſaid nothing at all; for the not diſcovering afterwards, nor accuſing, is no Evidence at all againſt Mr. <hi>Rookwood.</hi> As to Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> he gives you an account of a great deal that does not affect Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> neither all that paſt at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:58191:31"/>
nor in their Journey into <hi>England,</hi> for all that may be true, and yet the Priſoner no way concern'd in it. As to what he affirms of the Priſoner, we ſhall ſubmit it to your Conſideration: what it amounts to, and all that his Depoſition comes up to, is, That Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd that he was to obey implicitly Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s Orders; and <hi>Harris</hi> gives an account but of one particular time that Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> undertook or did agree to be concern'd in this Matter; it was but once, and that was, when he gave him the Note of thoſe that were to go to <hi>Turnham-Green,</hi> and that he was to be his <hi>Ayd du Camp</hi>: and as to that, we ſhall give you an account by Witneſſes whom we ſhall call, that theſe two Witneſſes ought not to be believed as to what they have ſworn, tho they do not come up to make two Witneſſes according to Law upon this Indictment: what they have ſaid as to this Man is not credible, tho they may ſpeak true as to others; and no doubt there was a barbarous Conſpiracy; it appears there was ſuch, beyond all Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Contradiction; and the Perſons that have been Condemn'd as Conſpirators have acknowledg'd it: but, my Lord, that which is now before your Lordſhip and the Jury, is, to enquire whether the Priſoner is concern'd in this Affair at all, and how far; and we hope the Jury will be of Opinion he is not concern'd. The Heinouſneſs of the Crime, and the Aggravations of it, being to be abhorred by all Mankind, we think ought not to ſway with the Jury, nor influence their Judgments to believe a Witneſs ever the ſooner in accuſing any other Perſon; it ought rather to have a contrary Allay, for the greater the Crime is, and the farther off from having any tolerable Opinion in the World, they ought to expect the greater Proof; and no one is to be preſum'd guilty of ſuch an Act, without very ſufficient Evidence of it; and the greater the Crime, the Proof ought to be the more poſitive and undeniable: it is not their being plainly poſitive that is ſufficient, but whether it is ſuch that is good in Law; and about that we are ſure your Lordſhip will give true Directions in point of Law: and whether the Witneſſes be credible or no, muſt be ſubmitted and left to the Jury, after we have call'd ſome Witneſſes who will give you an account of their Reputation.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, we humbly inſiſt there are not two VVitneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſuch as the Law requires, to prove the Charge upon this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Priſoner: The two Overt-Acts that touch Mr. <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> are firſt Conſulting and Agreeing how to Kill the King; the other is the finding Arms and Horſes for that purpoſe: but as to this latter, the finding Arms and Horſes, there is not one Evidence that comes up to it: and as to the former, the Conſultations, whether there be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Evidence that comes up to that, is very much a Queſtion with us: but we ſay, with Submiſſion, there are not two Witneſſes in that caſe; for Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ſays only what he was told by Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> that Sir <hi>George</hi> propoſed this Matter; but withal he tells you, that when Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> propoſed it, and Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> was inform'd what the Deſign was, he was ſo far from Conſpiring, Conſulting, or Agreeing to do it, that he ſaid it was a barbarous Act, and he recoil'd at it. Then at laſt ſays Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> You muſt command a Party.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Well, and what ſaid <hi>Rookwood</hi> then?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Porter</hi> ſays, he then ſaid, There's an End of it. Now, my Lord, what Evidence is this of a Conſultation and Agreement?
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58191:31"/>
and this is all that <hi>Porter</hi> ſays. As to what Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> ſays, we are to conſider whether the Liſt given to him be an Overt-Act; and there the Point in queſtion is, whether that Liſt can be given in Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> upon this late Act of Parliament, as an Overt-Act, it not being laid in the Indictment? There is indeed an Overt-Act of a Liſt laid in the Indictment, as given to <hi>Cranburne,</hi> but none as given to Mr. <hi>Rookwood.</hi>

                     </gap>lt, and upon Debate a Reſolution is formed, and tho he does at firſt diſlike it, yet when he is told he muſt command a Party, he ſays he is content, or there's an end of it; What do you make of that?</p>

                  <p>It's true, but when Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> ſaid he ſhou'd command a Party, he acquieſced, and ſaid there was an end of it: there was a Diſcourſe about cutting off the King, and that was agreed upon in the Company at that time; and tho at firſt he did not like it, yet he might afterwards agree to it.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I confeſs this is a Caſe of a very barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nature, of which I hope my Client will acquit himſelf: but I think we have the Authority of Parliament on our ſide, that this does not amount to a proof of Treaſon. It ſeems they lay a ſtreſs upon this, that Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> came to Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodgings on the Saturday Morning the 15th: but then take the Caſe as it is; for ought that does appear upon the Proof, he knows not upon what account the Meeting is before-hand. I think that is the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> upon which the Reverſal of his Attainder went, that the Evidence came ſhort, and that it was but Miſpriſion; for the Evidence was, that he was preſent at the ſuppoſed Declaration's reading, but ſaid nothing at all to it.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I do not know whether there were two Meetings or one then: but this is the ground we go upon, there ought to be two Witneſſes: and if there be two Meetings upon ſuch a Deſign, the ſecond may be is accidental, and it does not appear to be a deſign'd Meeting; and there was no Appointment of Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> to be there, nor any Negotiation by way of Meſſage or otherwiſe, to that purpoſe.

Is this, my Lord, an Overt-Act? Suppoſe a man be preſent at a Conſult about Treaſonable Practices, and he uſes words that are indifferent; it is true, in the caſe of a Wager it amounts to an Aſſent, but it hardly will come to that when People meet by accident, or for they don't know what.</p>

                  <p>Truly, my Lord, I can't imagine what they are doing, they are moving in Arreſt of Judgment before a Verdict given: they ſay the Overt-Act is not expreſly laid; Is that an Exception to the Evidence or to the Indictment?</p>

                  <p>If my Lord will pleaſe to give us the Liberty, we wou'd ſhew there can be no Verdict given upon this Indictment.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Certainly this is an irregular Proceeding; this is not a time of Exception to the Judgment.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
                  <p>Then, my Lord, we are in your Judgment, as to the Proof that has been given: If a man be preſent at a meeting of ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and there is a Treaſonable Debate about Killing the King, and this man is only preſent, but neither aſſents, nor makes the Propoſal how it ſhall be done, whether the bare being ſilent, and ſaying nothing, is ſuch an Overt-Act as ſhall Convict a man of Treaſon?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Holt.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I tell you, Conſenting to a Traiterous Deſign is an Overt-Act of High-Treaſon, if that Conſent be made to appear by good Proof: Now the Queſtion is, What is a good Proof and Evidence of this Conſent? a man is two or three times at a Treaſonable Conſult for Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King, and tho perhaps at the firſt he did not, yet at the ſecond he did know that the Meeting was for ſuch a Deſign,
<stage>(ſuppoſe for the purpoſe there was but two Meetings)</stage>
and at the ſecond it is determined to go on with the Deſign; Is not that an Overt-Act, tho it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Priſoner ſaid any thing?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
                  <p>If the firſt Meeting is not a Conſent, or an Overt-Act, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will a ſecond or third be if there was no more done than at the firſt, but they are like ſo many Cyphers without a Figure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Holt.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>The firſt Meeting poſſibly might be accidental, he might not know what it was for, tho that will go a great way if he does not diſſent or diſcover; but then he meets again with the ſame Company knowing what they had in Deſign, Does not that prove a Conſent? That was the Caſe of Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> in the Powder-Plot.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
                  <p>But where it may be uncertain, my Lord, whether it were with a good Deſign or a bad Deſign that he met with that Company, it ought to be taken moſt favourably for the Priſoner: this man might be preſent in order to a Diſcovery.</p>

                  <p>But beſides, that is not this Caſe: you are mooting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Points that are not in the Caſe. When Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> came to Mr. <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and finding them in ſome Diſorder, and being inquiſitive what was the Occaſion, he was ſent to <hi>Counter</hi>; and when he diſcovered what they were to go about, he afterwards meeting Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> ſays to him, Are we ſent over to murder the Prince of <hi>Orange?</hi> ſays <hi>Rookwood,</hi> If I had known of this Deſign before I came from <hi>France,</hi> I would have begg'd the King's, that is, King <hi>James,</hi> Pardon, and deſired to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. Hereby he expreſſes his Knowledge of the Deſign, and what he was to do; and tho he diſliked, yet wou'd obey Orders.</p>

                  <p>With Submiſſion, we thought it fit to know the Opinion of the Court firſt, if there be two Witneſſes againſt the Priſoners; for if there be not two Witneſſes, as the Law requites, we need not trouble the Court with our Evidence.</p>

                  <p>Then, my Lord, we muſt deſire that the Record may be read of Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s Conviction of Manſlaughter: a man that has been, guilty of doing ſuch an Act, feloniouſly, maliciouſly, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, as that is ſure, is not a competent Witneſs.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>We think it is proper for us to move it now again; for tho' it is no Objection to his being a Legal Witneſs, yet we hope it will influence his Reputation as to his Credit; for he that has been guilty of killing a man in ſuch a manner as the Indictment lays it, will find but little Credit, we hope, with a Jury of Countrymen. But ſince it has been read, and your Lordſhip and the Jury have taken notice of it, we will call ſome other Witneſſes as to Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Reputation and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, we think they will prove things as bad as an Attainder.

                  <p>Certainly, my Lord, you will not think fit to let them do ſo. I deſire they wou'd not uſher in any thing of Evidence without acquainting the Court what they call them for: for that were the way to let them in to call Witneſſes to things that are not proper.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Nay, without doubt it is not regular to produce any Evidence, without opening it.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>For if it be for any Crime that a man may be preſented for, and there is no Conviction, I think that ought not to be given in Evidence to take away a Witneſs's Credit; if it be only to his general Reputation and Behaviour, ſo far they may go, and we can't oppoſe it. Therefore I deſire Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower</hi> will open to the Court of what nature his Evidence is.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, they themſelves know that this ſort of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence never was admitted in any Caſe, nor can be, for it muſt tend to the Overthrow of all Juſtice and Legal Proceedings; for inſtead of trying the Priſoner at the Bar, they wou'd try Mr. <hi>Porter.</hi> It has been always deny'd where it comes to a particular Crime that a Man may be proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for, and this it ſeems is not one Crime or two, but ſo many and ſo long continued as they ſay, and ſo often practiſed that here are the whole Actions of a man's Life to be ript up, which they can never ſhew any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident when it was permitted, becauſe a man has no Opportunity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf; any man in the World may by this means be wounded in his Reputation, and Crimes laid to his Charge that he never thought of, and he can have no Opportunity of giving an Anſwer to it, becauſe he never imagined there wou'd be any ſuch Objection: It is killing a man in his good Name by a Side-wound, againſt which he has no Protection or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. My Lord, this muſt tend to the preventing all manner of Juſtice; it is againſt all common Senſe or Reaſon; and it never was offered at by any Lawyer before, as I believe, at leaſtwiſe never ſo openly, and therefore I wonder that theſe Gentlemen ſhou'd do it, who acknowledge, at leaſt one of them did, that as often as it has been offered it has been over-ruled; and I know not for what end it is now offered, but to make a noiſe in the Court: they know that it is irregular as much as any thing that cou'd be offered.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, my Lord, if the Priſoner at the Bar had offered this matter it had been excuſable; but that Gentlemen of the Long Robe, and who are ſo well acquainted with the Practice of the Courts of Law, ſhou'd pretend to do ſuch a thing, is unaccountable. There was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like this that was offered at <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> but that was by the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to prove that one <hi>Lunt</hi> who was a Witneſs had two Wives, and they brought a Copy of an Indictment upon which there was no Proceſs; after that they endeavoured to prove him guilty of ſeveral Robberies: but all that ſort of Evidence was refus'd. I only give them this Inſtance to ſhew, that where the Priſoner has attempted it, it has been always reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: and I am ſure they cannot ſhew me that ever it was allow'd even to the Priſoner himſelf to give any thing of this kind in Evidence; and this I muſt ſay, they can never ſhew me any one particular Inſtance when Counſel ever endeavoured to do it before this time.</p>

                  <p>Captain <hi>Porter</hi> tells you, about the latter end of <hi>January</hi> or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of <hi>February</hi> laſt, Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> came over into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>France</hi>; and there was a formed deſign to Murder the King; and after ſeveral Meetings and Conferences among the Conſpirators, they came to a Reſolution that he ſhould be Aſſinated; but which way to effect it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of a Diſpute among them, for the King, as you have heard go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently, about once a Week a Hunting, on the other ſide the Water near <hi>Richmond,</hi> the Deſign was firſt to Aſſaſſinate him at <hi>Richmond-Park,</hi> or thereabouts, as he returned from Hunting, and Preparation was made accordingly; but that not being ſo fully agreed upon, the Conveniency of the Place held ſtill ſome Debate, for ſome were of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that it was better to make the Attempt on this ſide the Water, than on the other; therefore as Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> tells you, to determine that Difficulty, there were ſeveral Men ſent, whereof he was one, <hi>Knightley</hi> another, and <hi>King</hi> a Third, to view the Ground on both ſides the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to make their Report, the Ground being View'd and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, made to ſome of their Accomplices, who to receive it met at the <hi>Nagg</hi>'s-<hi>Head</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> which was about the Tenth or Twelfth of <hi>February</hi> laſt; It was then agreed, that the King and his Guards ſhould be attack'd on this ſide the Water about <hi>Turnham-Green.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:58191:36"/>Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> has told you, that at ſeveral Meetings for the carrying on this Deſign, the Priſoner Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> was preſent, more particularly at the <hi>Globe-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> where were alſo Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> himſelf, and others, and there they did enter into a Conſult how they might Aſſaſſinate the King; and it being propoſed, Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> did not like it, as Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ſays, but ſaid it was a Deſperate Attempt, and thereupon Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> pulled out a Scheme that he had and ſhew'd it at that time to Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and ſaid you are ſent over from <hi>France</hi> and are to Obey my Orders, and you are to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a Party, and then Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> made an Anſwer in French, there's an end of it, which, as he ſays, Imports a Conſent.</p>
                  <p>Then at another time, which was the <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning the 15th of <hi>February,</hi> they met at Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodging, and there was a Diſcourſe about going on to put the Deſign in execution, and one <hi>Durans,</hi> one of of the Men that was to watch the King and the Guards going out at <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington,</hi> came in, and the Queſtion was, whether they ſhould go that Day upon the Deſign; they had Diſcourſe about it, and Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> the Priſoner was there preſent, and there did not appear any Diſſent in him to the Proſecution of the Deſign, but it ſeem'd it was readily agreed among them, to purſue it according to the former Determination.</p>
                  <p>Then the next Witneſs that is produc'd is M. <hi>Harris,</hi> who gives you a large Account of the beginning of his Knowledge and of his being concern'd in this matter; He tells you, he was in <hi>France,</hi> and at the Court of S. <hi>Germains,</hi> where the late King then was, and that he ſpoke with him, and where was alſo Colonel <hi>Parker,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> took notice of him and of his Faithful Service, and told him, he always deſigned him a Kindneſs, and then had Opportunity of doing it, and ſaid he would ſend him over into <hi>England,</hi> where he ſhould be ſubſiſted, and directed him to obey the Orders of Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and there being one <hi>Hare</hi> by, who was to come over with him, King <hi>James</hi> gave them both Names of Diſguiſe which they were to go by in <hi>England,</hi> and as it ſeems, others that came over did alſo aſſume, for Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> went by the Name of <hi>Roberts, Harris</hi> was to go by the Name of <hi>Jenkins,</hi> and <hi>Hare</hi> by the Name of <hi>Guiney</hi>; they were directed to apply themſelves to Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and had directions how they ſhould find him, which were to go into <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> in the Evening, upon a <hi>Monday</hi> or a <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and if they ſaw a Perſon that had a White Handkerchief hanging out of his Pocket, they were to take notice of him to be Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and they had Ten <hi>Lewis d'Ore</hi>'s a-piece for their Journeys to carry them off, and you have heard from whom they had them; and they were told, that if at <hi>Calais</hi> they were kept longer then they expected, whereby their Money was ſpent, care was taken that they ſhould be ſupplied from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Calais,</hi> the Preſident there; and it ſeems Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hare</hi> went together to <hi>Calais,</hi> and lay a conſiderable time for want of a Wind, whereby their Money fell ſhort of defraying their Expences, but they were afterwards ſupplied by the Governor of <hi>Calais,</hi> according as was promiſed at St. <hi>Germains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:58191:36"/>Gentlemen, he tells you, that after they came into <hi>England,</hi> the firſt time they went to ſeek Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> was upon the <hi>Monday</hi> Night but they did not find him at that time, but afterwards they met with him, and Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> had Subſiſtence-Money from him, according to King <hi>James</hi>'s Promiſe, which was at the rate of 5 <hi>s.</hi> a Day when he had no Horſe, and afterwards when he had a Horſe at 6 <hi>s.</hi> a Day; this is the Account he gives you how he came over, and of his Journey and meeting with Sir <hi>George Barclay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now he comes to ſpeak particularly concerning the Priſoner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Rookwood:</hi> He tells you, that on <hi>Saturday</hi> morning the 15th of <hi>February,</hi> the firſt day when this Aſſaſſination was deſigned to be committed, he went to the Lodging of one <hi>Burk,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> was, with others, and he found them all in great Diſorder; and and thereupon he ask'd them, What was the matter, and what they were going to do? And <hi>Rookwood</hi> bid him go to one <hi>Counter,</hi> and he ſhould know of him what was the matter: Accordingly he went to his Lodging, and <hi>Counter</hi> told him and thoſe who were with him, That they muſt get ready to go to <hi>Turnham-Green</hi>; and at the ſame Time and Place he met with Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and after ſome Diſcourſe of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking the Coach, Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> at the firſt ſaid, They were his Janizaries; and afterwards going out, he came in again and ſaid, They were Men of Honour, and that they were to go abroad to attack the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day, or a little time after, Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> met with Mr. <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and enters into Diſcourſe with him to this effect: What! are we ſent over to murder the Prince of <hi>Orange?</hi> It is a ſtrange ſort of Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<stage>(for it ſeems they were not informed in <hi>France</hi> what they were to do here, but they were only to put themſelves under the Conduct of Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and obey his Orders:)</stage>
Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> ſaid, He was afraid the Thing was ſo, and that they were drawn in; but ſaid, If he had known of the Deſign before-hand, he would not have come over, but have begg'd the King's Pardon. Which ſhews not only his Knowledge of the Deſign, but his being Engaged in the Proſecution of it.</p>
                  <p>And then, Gentlemen, you are told further, That upon the going out upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22d, which was the ſecond time it was to have been put in Execution, there was a Liſt of Men that Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> gave to Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> of ſeveral Names that he has mention'd to you; he ſays, Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi>'s Name was at the top, as one that was to Command the Party, and the Name he went by was <hi>Roberts</hi>; and there was <hi>Harris</hi>'s Counterfeit Name, which was <hi>Jenkins</hi>; and <hi>Hare</hi>'s Counterfeit Name, which was <hi>Guinea</hi>; and they were to make ready to go to <hi>Turnham-Green.</hi> He told him, There was the Liſt, and that he and <hi>Harris</hi> was to be of his Party, that he was to attack the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> ſhould be his Aid-du-Camp.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:58191:37"/>Gentlemen, I forgot to tell you, That between the firſt <hi>Saturday</hi> and the ſecond, Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> walking in <hi>Red-Lion</hi> Fields, and there in Diſcourſe among themſelves, Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> did expreſs themſelves to be much concerned that they were to be imployed upon ſuch a Deſign as this was, which they owned to be very barbarous; but Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> and <hi>Lowick</hi> ſaid, They were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Command, and muſt obey Orders, thô Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> did not like the Deſign they were Engaged in.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, they have told you of Horſes that were placed at <hi>Somerſet-houſe</hi> in a Stable there, under the Care of Mr <hi>Lewis</hi> my Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi>'s Gentleman of the Horſe, about ſix or ſeven Horſes, and thoſe ſix Horſes that were there at that time were afterwards taken away; but that is only a Circumſtance.</p>
                  <p>So that, Gentlemen, this is now the Sum and Subſtance of this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that has been given you as far as it relates to the Priſoner; his Council in his Defence have inſiſted upon ſeveral Things in the firſt place, thô it was laſt mentioned in Time, yet it ought to have the firſt Conſideration: The Councel for the Priſoner have endeavoured to take off the Credit of Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and have opened indeed very great Crimes that he ſhould be guilty of, which muſt render him a Perſon not to be believed, but they have not proved any thing; no Witneſs that they have called againſt Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ſays the leaſt againſt him to Invalidate his Teſtimony, or to induce you to Disbelieve what he has ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Then they ſay in Point of Law, There is no Overt Act proved of any Deſign againſt the King's Life that affects Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi>; now that Matter you are to conſider of, Whether or no it does not appear by the Teſtimony of two Witneſſes, that Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> was Concerned in this Deſign of Aſſaſſinating the King; Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> is poſitive that he was at the Conſult at the <hi>Globe</hi> Tavern, where it was Propoſed, Debated, and Reſolved upon; but Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> ſays, he did Diſlike it; ſo ſays Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> he did not Approve of it at the firſt upon his being Acquainted with it; but being ſent over to obey the Orders of Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> producing a Scheme ready drawn, wherein he was to Command the Party, telling him, That he muſt obey Orders. You hear what he ſaid, and the Anſwer he return'd in <hi>French,</hi> There's an end of it; Whether that does not amount to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Agreement to be Engaged in this Deſign, is left to your Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, for if it do, it is plainly an Overt Act.</p>
                  <p>Then Gentlemen, you hear further that <hi>Harris</hi> was told by Mr. <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> that he ſhould be of his Party, and be his Ayd du Camp, and go to <hi>Turnham-Green,</hi> to Attack the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and he had a Liſt of Men given him by <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and was directed to get the reſt ready.</p>

                  <p>It is not urged as an Overt Act, but as Evidence of an Overt Act that is Alledged; For inſtance, the Overt Act Alledged, is that they did Meet and Conſult, ſhall not they give in Evidence what was ſaid and done at thoſe Meetings, thô not Alledged.

                  <p>My Lord, we ſay this is not Evidence of an Overt-Act, according to this Act of Parliament; which ſays, No Evidence ſhall be given of any Overt-Act, that is not expreſly alledg'd in the Indictment; now the Indictment ſays, they did agree that Forty Horſemen Armed, of which the Four named were to be Four, and every one undertook to be one, who ſhou'd lie in wait to ſet upon the King in his Coach, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number ſhould ſet upon the Guards; and then it ſays, in order to fulfil this, they did prepare Horſes and Arms, and one of them by the Conſent of all the reſt, did carry forward and backward a Liſt, that is, <hi>Cranburn</hi>; and that particular Liſt is a particular Overt-Act alledged in the Indictment, which makes it plain, they thought it neceſſary to be particularly alledged by this Act of Parliament, or they could not give any Evidence of it; now the Liſt that Evidence is given of, is ſuppoſed to be delivered by the Priſoner to <hi>Harris.</hi> Now firſt we ſay it is not Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that Forty ſhou'd do it, for they may do it without a Liſt, and next it is not Evidence of the Liſt that they have mentioned, for that is alledged to be carried about by <hi>Cranburn,</hi> and as the Priſoner himſelf has obſerved, this Liſt given to <hi>Harris</hi> is not in the Indictment, and therefore no Evidence can be given of it.</p>

                  <p>It is an Evidence of that Overt-Act which is expreſly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Indictment, that they met together to Conſult how to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this Treaſon.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, we are in a very ſtrange Caſe here, if we be not very proper in this part of our Evidence; the Overt-Act laid, is that the Priſoner met together with others to Conſult how to Aſſaſſinate the King, and there the Priſoner among the reſt did agree it ſhould be done ſo and ſo. 'Tis admitted the Priſoner was there. But ſay they, if you only prove that he ſate by while there was a general Diſcourſe of ſuch a matter, but do not prove that he ſaid or did any thing, expreſſing his Aſſent, that will not amount to a proof of the Overt-Act laid, and yet, if we go about to prove further, any Act done that manifeſts his Aſſent, then they ſay you go too far, and prove an Overt-Act that is not mentioned in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment: Thus they grant, the agreement is a ſufficient Overt-Act, but Object, that being preſent barely is not a ſufficient proof of his Agreement, then when we go to make proof of any thing that is a ſufficient proof of his Agreement, they tells us it is not proper upon this Act of Parliament, becauſe not laid in the Indictment, though his agreement be laid in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, and ſo they wou'd amuſe us, rather than make any ſolid Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our Evidence; this Doctrine is certainly very odd, my Lord, and we doubt not will have little weight with the Court or the Jury.</p>

The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment ſays they agreed there ſhould be Forty Men or thereabouts Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, of which a certain number ſhould make an Aſſault upon the King's Coach. while another part ſhould ſet upon the Guards: Now the proof we make, is that Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> the Priſoner, was to Cnmmand a Party that was to ſet upon the Guards, and in order to it, he gives a Liſt of his Men to <hi>Harris</hi> who was to be his Aid, <hi>du Camp,</hi> and bids him get thoſe Men ready; and this was upon the day that this matter was to be acted, ſo that it proves very plainly that Overt-Act that we ſuggeſt in the Indictment, that a certain number of thoſe Men were to Aſſault the king's Perſon, and other part the Guards, and therefore they needed not have interrupted your Lordſhip; for this Liſt that <hi>Harris</hi> ſpeaks of, is a very good proof of the Overt-Act that is laid in the Indictment.</p>

                  <p>Then Gentlemen as to this matter which they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that this Liſt given on the Day of the intended Aſſaſſination, ought not to be allowed as Evidence to prove the Treaſon, becauſe it is not ſpecially laid in the Indictment, but is by the late Act of Parliament excluded from being proved to Convict the Priſoner; now though the Act doth exclude the giving in Evidence any Overt-Act that is not laid in the Indictment, yet it doth not exclude ſuch Evidence as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and fit to prove that Overt-Act that is laid in the Indictment: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the queſtion is, whether this giving of the Liſt does not prove ſome Overt-Act that is alledged in the Indictment, there is in the Indictment, an Agreement laid to kill the King, and if that be proved, that's an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert-Act of this Treaſon; now when the Conſent and Agreement of Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> to that deſign is proved, ſurely the proof of his giving a Liſt of Men is a further proof that he did agree to it, then it is very proper to be given in Evidence, for if by the New Statute no one Act can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Evidence to prove another, then muſt not only the Overt-Act but alſo the Evidence of that Act be expreſſed in the Indictment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> you have heard the Witneſſes, what they ſay concerning this matter. In the firſt place, if you do believe that there was ſuch Conſults and Meetings, where this intended Aſſaſſination of the King was Debated and Reſolved upon, and that Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> was preſent, and did agree to it, that is an Overt-Act, and again, if you are ſatisfied that there was an Agreement to prepare and provide a number of Men to ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King and his Guards in the manner you have heard, and he was concern'd in making this Proviſion, and was to have a Poſt and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a Party in that Attack, that is a further proof of that Conſent and Agreement, that is laid in the Indictment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I muſt leave it to you, upon the Evidence that you have heard; if you are ſatisfied upon the Teſtimony of theſe two Witneſſes that have been produc'd, that Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> is Guilty of this Treaſon of which he is Indicted, in Compaſſing and Imagining the Death of the King, then you will find him Guilty; If you are not ſatisfied that he is Guilty you will acquit him.</p>
