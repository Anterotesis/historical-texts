            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y good lorde the fauor and Noble dealynges towards me in the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes you were lorde em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour in Fraunce, when your aide and pollicie (by meane of a passeport) conuayed me from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Prince of Orrange, made me often remember that sutche courtesies with good will or seruice should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5300:3"/>
               <hi>But hauyng small power for the publishyng of duetie, and little abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to requite a good tourne (wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng occasion to bee gratefull) I take suche matter as tyme doeth minister for a furtherer of my expectation, and a meane to encrease my credite with your lordship. And consideryng whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dolefull newes was brought of one of your chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest sonnes dedde in Irelande, I wrote a heauie Epitaphe, I thought now hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng greate and goodnewes of another (both in nature and valliancie brother to the eldest who GOD hath called) to make a pece of ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, for the saluyng of my first presumption, &amp; the throughly expressyng of my present desire of due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull doyng.

               <hi>circumstance of wordes and filed phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of florishyng ceremonies, I fall to my purposed matter. It hath been an olde maner, and a newe finenesse in this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng worlde, that sutche as could pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace praise or commendation by their owne practises (either by pen or tong) would reape the glorie thei could get to themselues, and leaue out the fame of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if trothe by tract of tyme reueled not rightfull causes, and gaue eche well doer the reward of their workes, then if those maners of menne, finenesse of the worlde, &amp; greedinesse of glorie runnes awaie with hast to their owne commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, and no benefite to others: Blame not any nation (properly giuen to their priuate praise) to tread doun the laude</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5300:4"/>
               <hi>and honor of any strange people, neither borne in their Countrey, nor commyng to their soile, but to serue for money &amp; sutche report of fame, as the Countrey maie spare from them selues to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, that serue for these twoo causes before rehearsed. Not withstanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the eager myndes of menne (that bites at euery blaste of fame) shall not breed by their boldnesse, neither abuse nor ill custome, whereby the estimation of forwardmen should be hindered, nor the quicke forwardnesse of vainglorie should not finde too mutche occasion to triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph on the aduantage of tyme, I haue now tyme as I thinke with trothe and good laisure, written sutche intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the worlde of the taking of Macklin,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5300:4"/>

Thus wishing truthe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies (as a torche to burne on the topp of a hill) to bee looked on, and affections of men to bee tried and wrested to the beste constructions of that whiche beste becomes a good worlde to heare, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to your Lordship the true reportes I haue heard for the winnyng of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cklin, and sutche thynges as there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at Macklins mischance: written not for that sutche matter (or a greate deale greater) can bee hid from a noble</hi>

This not spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor applied to the discredite, and hindrance of any straungers well doyng, but in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and seruice of the Englishe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whose labour, charge, courage, readinesse, and warlike mindes, is not inferiour to the greatest neighbours, (or furthest of you can name) nere vs, in any Marciall order, maner, disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of warre, or hazard of life.</p>
            <p>And for a profe of these special poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes herein rehersed, the moste warres of christendome beares suche testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall and witnesse of their foreward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (though here at home God bee praised is peace) that few or none hath been so forward in the feeld, nor more daungerously serued. Then iniurie it were, and cleane against good nature of men, and order of armes, that any nation for their owne glory (vaine as a shadowe) should eclips the dezartes and valiauncie, of the Englishe now seruyng in Flanders, drawne thether

for fame (and their owne desires to do well) and liue from debt of the worlde and daunger of the Lawe. In whose commendation, and for the trothe of matter now penned, vnder good will of the wise, and sounde iudgemente of the world, I enter into a discourse and plaine order of the takyng of <hi>Macklin,</hi> dispraisyng no Nation at the seruice, nor leauyng out no matter is true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause trothe is to bee embraced, and matter depending of flatterie or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is vtterly to be disalowed.</p>
            <p>It happened I beyng at the Court (where the trothe of many thynges is moste certain) I sawe a letter written out of Flaunders, from the handes of a gentilman, whose eyes beheld the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seruice and enterprise, and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the great toune of <hi>Macklin,</hi> and the letter was so well penned, &amp; went so directly to the matter (in euery point and order) touchyng the particulars and generall takyng of the same citie,

that I was forced by the credite of the gentilman that wrote (and by proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confirmation of sonderie other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes) to beleue the letter to be moste true, and worthie the rehearsall to the open world.

the plonge for to wade, found the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so deepe, that it came aboue their shulders: a matter to bee marueled at, a harde aduenture, and a sore escape: But by that meanes thei found awaie to enter by Ladder at a Gate, where thei passed fiue seuerall tymes with some small power, but could enter no more but one persone at once. Yet hap serued so well, no resistaunce in that corner was made, till three hundreth of the Englishe soldiours had posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a peece of the toune: And then the Albanoies horse menne, thinkyng to breake through the force of footemen, charged them. So suche as foolishely aduentured to farre of the footemen, fell into the daunger of the Albanoies, whereon the horsemen gaue an other charge, and tastyng with their bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the pushe of the Pike, and seeyng the Englishe stande stoutly at defence, the Albanoies wheeled about, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke that maner of fighte, with the
<pb facs="tcp:5300:9"/>
losse of diuers of their horsemen.</p>
            <p>After which repulce the Albanoies had no mynde any more to come so nere daunger, whereby the Burgoes of the toune beganne to quaile, and stoode in a little mase and doubt of the matter. Then the whole tounes men and soldiours forsooke the rampiers and manned bothe brigges and strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes as well as thei might: in this sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and hard fight bothe doubtful and dangerous. The Englishe, Scottish, and all the other Soldiours for that attempt presente, hauyng passed ouer the gates, walles, and places of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest entrie, marched forewardes (cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng a noble woorde) and founde great resistaunce at the ende of euery streate by whiche sharpe encounter thei were faine by little and little (as Fortune serued their hopes) to winne their ground with some losse of Soldiours who mynded more victorie, then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie to retire, and at the laste with
<pb facs="tcp:5300:10"/>
mutche a doe and long bickeryng (the tounes menne for their libertie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and the assailantes for fame and conqueste) thei came in vewe of the Market place, where the tounes men and their stoutest companies stood in order of battaile, euery waie flancked with ordinaunce: But as the French man faieth, <hi>Il falloit aualler cela,</hi> the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours meanyng to trie what For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune durste dooe, gaue a lustie charge, and by Gods helpe, and the greate courage of sonderie stoute gentilmen, and officers of credite and value, thei had the vpper hande of their enemies, with whom thei made as short worke as thei might: But in deede before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunte victorie could any waie bee knowne, greate struggling and stoute sturre on bothe sides was seen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and maister Ihon Norrice was matched with a lustie Limlifter, a breachlesse Freer called Brother Peter, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manne that made and maintained
<pb facs="tcp:5300:10"/>
all the broile and businesse, who had put on a resolute mynde, either to kille Maister Norrice, or els to bee slaine hym self, and dealt blowes so brauelie in this his determination, that he hitt maister Norrice with a Halbert two full thwackes on the Curate, whiche blowes wer sone reuenged by maister Norrice, who dispatched y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Freer, and gaue hym a dedde paie in recompence of his paines. This gallaunte Freer thus slain, ended all the strief and bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die braule: for then euery one cried <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sericorde,</hi> and fell pitifully at the feete of the Soldiours, who findyng victorie vsed not mutche extremitie. For the nomber of all those that were slaine were not aboue twoo hundreth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones: one letter declareth that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernoure with the Albanoizes, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairyng a little before the ouerthrowe fledde (out at a backe Porte or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne) to Louaiu and so saued their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: another letter saith the gouernor
<pb facs="tcp:5300:11"/>
was taken prisoner. Oure Englishe Nation loste in their companie a fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Commoners, but as I beleeue thei were all gentilmen Soldiours. For to the nomber of thirtie Englishe men were slaine, and fower score sore hurte: whiche argues of eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, one hundreth and more were likelie to haue paied their liues for their enterprise. And further the losse or hurtyng of so many oure Nation, manifestly declares that thei did most of the seruice, and deserues therefore the moste honor: how so euer the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng of the firste newes bee taken and vnderstoode, one Maister Smithe, twoo valiaunte Lieutenantes, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Humfrey Turner an Enscante, Maister Iones a gallant yong Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour, were worthely seen serue, and slaine in the action. By a misfortune after the fight Maister Whitchurche, and Maister Heddleis brother of the Garde was slaine: and of all the other
<pb facs="tcp:5300:11"/>
Nations that came with the English, as yet can be knowne was but twoo persones slaine in the enterprise.</p>
            <p>Nowe yet I praie you, heare what an other man of good credite wrote of this matter, who stoode and plainely behelde the seruice from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to thende. The power of twelue hundreth in all, whereof eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth were Englishemen, set forward from Filforde and came to <hi>Macklin,</hi> as eager as Haukes that seeketh their praie, wadyng to the chinne, and cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng ouer Iron gates, as men that cared not for life, so fame might be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Yea surely saieth he, the strengthe of the toune considered, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnder the cope of heauen, suche an enterprise taken in hand, and brought to so glorious a victorie. For saieth he though very good captaines might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long fight &amp; hurtes forsake the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, these soldiers wer so desirous of seruice, that thei would not in any cace
<pb facs="tcp:5300:12"/>
at no tyme retire, and beeyng entered the toune but a very fewe, thei fought it out so manfullie, that maister Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande Yorke s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ept into the water, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng after them to their succour: And at the present displaiyng of his Ense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, he loste his Lieutenant, his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geante, and Maister Iones his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seante bearer, and he hym self shotte through his Dublette, and Maister Norrice not as a Collonell, but as a common Soldiour, ledde his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors the waie through thicke and thin, where moste daunger appeared. And encountered Frier Peter, who was cheef leader of all the Priestes in the toune, he was in daunger to be slaine, for the Frier firste shotte of his peece, then he tooke him to his Pike or Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berte, and laste fell to his sworde, and so like a couragious Confessour val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liauntly lost his life. And when all the broyle was in a maner ended, he saith that looked vpon all these dooynges,
<pb facs="tcp:5300:12"/>
               <hi>Mounsire de Temple,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mounsire de Fammai</hi> came to the toune, or were peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture about the toune nere the seruice, for the aunsweryng their hope, and furthering of the matter expected. Yet haue thei no sutche cause to bee writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of, as those that wer the onely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of the seruice in deede: wher fore the firste printed booke of this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes must be wayed, accordyng to the trothe and vmore of the matter.</p>
            <p>After the toune was wonne, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Norrice did what he might too keepe his people from pillage, but in the meane while Temples men ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng with the Scottes gotte the best booties: wherevpon the Englishmen fell to take that easely might bee had, either of Churchmen or Cloister hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but especially thei searched the Cloisters and Religious places, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng thei were Inquisitors for to seeke out Copes, Surpleses and Uestinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and to take so good an order by
<pb facs="tcp:5300:13"/>
their Commission, that no Masse should bee songe nor saied in <hi>Macklin</hi> many a long yere after, for wante of gilted Challices, and golden Copes.</p>
            <p>And the Shrine of Sainct Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball was so terriblie handeled, that it was bothe remoued out of his place, and left not worthe a pennie. And the Soldiours were so wealthie, that the olde custome of the Spaniardes was taken vp againe, for Dice plaie began so merrilie on the toppe of Drommes heddes, that money could not tarrie in the bothome of mens purses. Men that haue by their forwardnes found sutche good Fortune, are to bee excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed though thei merrilie passe a little money a waie at Dice: Declaryng by that pastime whiche standeth on good happe to winne, or euill lucke to lose. The whole <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of manne standeth but on hazarde and chance: a matter that soldiours doe mutche marke, and the worlde can not denie. But for all their
<pb facs="tcp:5300:13"/>
plaiyng at Dice (whiche Soldiours will not bee varred from) their Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Leaders, as it is reported, had more regard to that whiche was so hardly gotten, and yet to redeeme a Capitaine out of prison, maister Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice hath paied a greate somme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, whiche money was moste noblie employed: my freende good Capitaine Morgane that now is in <hi>Macklin,</hi> will I warrant you confesse the same whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is asked. An other poincte of honor is to bee spoken of. For when a Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the toune was readie to be spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, Maister Norrice hearyng that some Englishe women were emong the Noonnes, defended theim from harme, and sette them free, and vsed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courtesies more, that is worthie the noting. When I heard of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parte of a Soldiour, I remembred how a greate conquerour, in a maner of the moste parte of the worlde, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Darius</hi> wife and a nomber of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launte
<pb facs="tcp:5300:14"/>
Ladies vnder his mercie: vsed hymself so honourably towardes his captiues, that for feare to bee tempted with their beauties, he would not scarce come where thei were, and yet were the prisoners so reuerentlie and honestly vsed (beyng women of greate callyng and birth) that <hi>Darius</hi> thought hym self happie (though vnfortunate Prince he was) to bee conquered of sutche a noble kyng as <hi>Alexander,</hi> who could not onely conquer his owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but winne his enemies har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes by his fauourable and Princelie dealynges: And surely greater honor is gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by vsyng victorie wiselie, then by ouerthrowyng a multitude with manhoode, without shewyng mercie and gentilnesse. A conquerour by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressyng crueltie by courtesie, is hadd in admiration of his verie enemies, and a victor without vertue and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full consideration, is hated emong his freendes, and despised generally emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
<pb facs="tcp:5300:14"/>
all kinde of people. Nowe you muste note that the Englishemen, and suche as entered the toune by hazard, furie of shotte, danger of sworde, and pushe of the Pike, are not a little to bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and praised, and more to bee commended then thousandes of those that stood a farre of, and gaue but the lookyng on. And you maie see by the same some menne are happie, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to passe through many perilles, but likewise to liue long, and make theim selues and their soldiours ritche: and cause the fame of their Countrie to be spred as farre as the winde can blow, or the Sunne maie shine. And the more happie be our Englishemen and Scottes men, with all the reste of this attempte, that thei dwell as yet in the place thei haue taken, and mynde not to parte there fro, till the poore Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours bee pleased. And the keepyng the saied Toune in their handes all this while, argues thei haue deserued

            <p>Thus haue you heard the effecte &amp; rehersall of two letters, sent into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande from those in Flaunders, that sawe <hi>Macklin</hi> bothe wonne and loste, which commyng to light and to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen eye of the worlde, showes that all tounes, fortresses, and holdes (bee thei neuer so stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g) are subiect to sodain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowes, and in the deuine disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Almightie, who visiteth a nomber of our neighbours, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kindes of callamities, to make vs beare in mynde his Omnipotente po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and our owne dueties to GOD and our Prince.

And to keepe the people in some good likyng of me and my woorkes.
