            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Would have the Reader to understand that Night-worke and Day-worke is not all one, and as our <hi>London</hi> Diurnals (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Writers of them have Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to see to write truly, yet for all that they do often stumble into most grosse er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, which some are so bold as to call very Lyes: therefore my selfe that am fain to grope in the darke, (or at the best in the Moon shine) I hope, if I chance to ramble a little at one side now and then, it may be imputed to the darknes of the Times wherein it was written, and that want of eye-sight caused over-sight; and whereas we begin our Diurnals on Mondayes, and <hi>Oxford</hi> Newes begins on Sundayes, I must be contrary to them both, and begin on Saturday-night, as followeth;</p>
               <p>This Night (without any vain flourishing, lying, or <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning</hi>) there happened a very strange accident at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53561:2"/>
where near the upper end of the Butchers Row, within a quoytes cast of <hi>Carfax,</hi> there dwels one <hi>George Chambers</hi> a Stationer or Bookseller, who since these distracted Troubles hath bought and sold many Pamphlets of divers and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry subjects; some of them being of His Majesties part, and printed at <hi>Yorke,</hi> and at <hi>Oxford</hi>; many of them were of the Parliament partie, and printed at <hi>London,</hi> so that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unsold in the said Shop of such sorts (as were stale and past sale) to the number of 160, or thereabouts; these small Trifles were laid one upon another confusedly (like a pack of Cardes shuffled together) so these Books were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled together, friends and foes, Truthes and Lyes, all in a heape, one amongst another, tied in a bundle with a pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred, the Owner intending to have every sort of them bound by themselves afterwards. All these Divisions being thus accorded with a cord, (or parcell of Hempe, which will end all Divisions) were laid upon a shelfe in the Shop; to which Trusse, Fardle, Magazine, Masse, or <hi>Chaos</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, an Armie of <hi>Mice</hi> came (on the Saturday Night) a Book-haling, where they valiantly assaulted this Bulwarke of Bookes, playing the Pioners part so valiantly, that with tooth and naile they entered the papyreall Suburbs, and never left undermining till they had made way, tyrannically tearing through the Territories of that <hi>Babel,</hi> gnawing and eating their passage with their sharpe fanges, (as <hi>Hannibal</hi> did eate his way through the <hi>Alpes</hi> with Vineger) many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost choak'd with eating of three Words, onely <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, Malignant,</hi> and <hi>Delinquent,</hi> the Frogges of <hi>Aegypt</hi> never had such a Banquet in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, it would trouble <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius</hi> his Purveyers, <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> his Clerke of the Kitchin, or <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> his Master Cook to have made the Bill of fare, provided the acates, or drest the Diet, the severall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes were as followeth. (I pray you pardon me if I erre in the manner of the service, for (it was night and no order was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53561:2"/>
kept in the eating) but to the Diet, of which were all these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Dishes following.</p>
               <p>These valiant Vermin fell first upon some famous Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, namely <hi>Plain English,</hi> the <hi>Observator, Mercurius Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> the <hi>Continuation,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Raies eight Speeches,</hi> Master <hi>Prin's</hi> 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and last Volume, Master <hi>Speakers Parallel between a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Wife,</hi> Serjeant <hi>Wildes</hi> Argument for a <hi>new Great Seal,</hi> Sir <hi>Simon Dewes</hi> his <hi>Revelation,</hi> Master <hi>Callamie</hi> his <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of perjurie,</hi> M. <hi>Marshall his Letter</hi> (written to himselfe and devised by himselfe) M. <hi>Pym's</hi> deliverance from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>Plague plaister,</hi> (which indeed was by his own device taken from a gall'd Horse backe) after that the Mice began to nibble at Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudiard's</hi> Speeches, but finding them luke-warme (too cold for the King, and too hot for the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>) they left them, and fell to <hi>Anticavalerisme,</hi> then they fell to feed upon <hi>Queres, Mistakes, Feares, Iealousies, Malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Doubts, Orders, Ordinances, Votes</hi>; these they assaulted, and quickly made spoil of. Then there were many printed Bookes, wherein His Majestie had Declared His Gracious intention to all His loving Subjects, as <hi>Expressions, Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Exhortations, Admonitions, Protestations, Imprecations, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, Demonstrations,</hi> and of all these the Mice would not eat one bit, but couragiously they fell upon <hi>Remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Letters, Messages, Passages, Treaties, Animadversions, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrations, Exclamations, Objections, Questions, Answers, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, Replications, Reduplications, Quadruplications, Detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Distractions, Rebellions, Intelligences, Observations, Decrees, Orders, Lyes, Libels, Diurnals, Execrations, Resolves, Proofes, Disproofes, Extravagancies, Delinquencies, Cases, Causes, Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Articles,</hi> (all this while they touched not any Book or Paper that concerned the King, or wherein any thing was exprest either for His Majesties Service or Honour) Then afresh they fall to't again, gnawing and knabbling, <hi>Briefes, Breviates, Approbations, Amplifications, Transcriptions, Massacres, Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

These were the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of Dainties that were spoiled, devoured, sacked and ruinated at this banquetting Battail; amongst which Viands three of Master <hi>Pym</hi>'s Speeches were mistaken by the Mice to be kissing Comfits, Marmalad, and Suckets, (for in sent and taste they were as sweet as <hi>Sugar</hi> Carrion) but though they were delicious in the palate, it was found (by wofull experience, that no Rats-bane could be more poysonous, nor any venome more banefull in operation, which is an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem that though Mice are common pilfering Thieves, and do maintain their straggling Common-wealth onely by stealing, yet when they grow so audaciously impudent that they dare to feed upon Treason (though it have a pleasant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53561:3"/>
smacke) yet it choaked them, and proved their bane, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them died, and it is certain most of them are destina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or bewitched like Traitors to be catch'd in a Trap, or fall into the clawes of the Cat, as Conspiratours, and wicked treacherous Rebels will drop into the Hangmans budget: but the Day begins to dawn, therefore Ile give over till soon at Night: yet one thing more which was almost forgotten, there were two of <hi>Tailors</hi> Bookes in the bundle which the Mice touched not, the one was intituled <hi>New Preachers, New,</hi> and the other was a sweet well favoured Sermon upon <hi>Tobias and his Dog.</hi>

               <head>Sunday Night.</head>
               <p>THis Night was very zealously consumed by the Brethren and holy Sisters, till between twelve and one of the clocke: amongst the Flocke there was a devout Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (one Mistris <hi>Fumpkins</hi> a Porters Wife in Pudding Lane) who made a short Repetition of almost foure houres, upon Master <hi>Woodcockes</hi> Lecture the <hi>New-English</hi> Teacher at <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> Church, at <hi>Laurence</hi> Lane end near <hi>Guild-hall, quasi All guile,</hi> where true Lye, very Lye, she did exceeding Lye, lay open Lye, how zealous Lye, fervent Lye, ardent Lye, and perswasive Lye, he had encouraged his Auditours, vehement Lye, to continue constant Lye, obstinate Lye, rebellious Lye, she said the Gentleman did sweat out most delicate Doctrine, and that he laboured like a Thrasher, and belaboured the Pulpit and Cushion extreme Lye, telling them that if they had not given Money or Plate towards the <hi>Cause,</hi> or labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Shovell, Spade, or Barrow, for the raising of the Defensive (most Offensive) Workes and Fortifications to keep out the Armie of <hi>Protestants, Malignants,</hi> and <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,</hi> if they had done neither of these good Actions, they were not in the state of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if they had not or would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53561:4"/>
not hazard their Estates and Lives, to oppose, cast down, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, extirpe, and depose all kingly Government, all Church Order, and decencie, all Lawes and Authoritie, all obedience and loyaltie, all Christianitie, humanitie, and civill societie, that if they had not put any, or all of these vertues in practise there was small hope of any goodnesse in them, or any hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to befall them.</p>
               <p>When this good woman had finished her godly Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there was wine in bottles, &amp; cheare in bowles brought in, which the whole Assemblie fell upon religiously, consuming all in the way of Edification.</p>
               <p>The rest of the Night was spent with great diligence and studie, in devising who and where to break open and rifle the Houses of such as are doomed or condemned as Malignants, the purchase so gotten (whether it be Money or Goods to be sold) the High and Mightie, Magnificent <hi>Quartermain,</hi> the great Plunder-master Generall. His Fee is three pence in the pound, for all the pillage so lawfully taken, and it was affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that at that rate his Vailes amounted to fifteen pounds in one day. Thus hath he raised his Trades from one degree to another, from a Brewers Clerke to a Preacher in a Mault-floore, and from a preacher to a most valiant <hi>Brownisticano, Plunderissimo, Generalissimo.</hi>

               <head>Munday Night.</head>
               <p>ON Monday Night, about six of the clocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Sun being two houres high, there were Letters (with some words in 'em) directed from a trusty hand in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to one <hi>Cut-beard</hi> a <hi>Barber</hi> in scalding Alley, one of which Letters contained briefly that the Cavaliers are in mightie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, and the Colledges in much want: but you must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand withall, that they want neither meat, manners, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, or courage; and yet their case is lamentable, for since
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53561:4"/>
the taking of the sawcy Town of <hi>Teuxbury</hi> by the Parliament Forces, Mustard hath been at a greater price than Biefe at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>; also their miserie is to be pittied (if they were not Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Delinquents, and true Subjects to the King) for if there chance to come into the Market three hundred or more of <hi>Salmonds</hi> in a day, besides other fish and flesh in abundance, yet their poor &amp; wretched estate is such, that it would grieve any tender heart to see what shiftes they are fain to make to get vineger so that it is manifest that our happinesse doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Malignant partie in all places, for we have a great deale more sawce than meat, and more meat by halfe than manners.</p>
               <p>This Night it was Ordered, that no Butter-women should come to the Citie with any Butter marked, printed, or molded with any formes of Crosses, upon pain that all the said Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses should be demolished and melted, for the use of Cookes and Schul-boyes, &amp; such like contemptible destructions; for it was wisely taken into consideration that such Crosses were as dangerous and papisticall, as the Crosse in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> or the Crosses upon the ends of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> his Church, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crosses whatsoever, they being by the judgements of the wise and opinions of the Godly held to be markes of the Beast, <hi>Roman</hi> badges, superstitious, Antichristian, idolatrous and abominable, onely such Crosses are allowed and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as are upon any manner of money, whether it be Papist or Protestant Princes Coine, the matter is indifferent.</p>
               <p>It is to be conjectured, that all the Crosse wayes in <hi>England</hi> must be made round, &amp; that no Tailer shall dare to sit Crosse-legged upon pain of being plundered, for sitting superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and his Hell raked and ransacked <hi>of all his true</hi> and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten Reliques and Remnants.</p>

               <head>Tuesday Night.</head>
               <p>THis Night three hundred Dragooners brought two old seditious and wicked Ministers out of <hi>Gloucestershire</hi>; It is said they durst not onely presume to pray for the King o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, but also with all vehemencie exhorted the people to obey, love and honour Him, according to the rules and commands of Gods Word and the Lawes of the Land; they were likewise taxed and accused for most wicked sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of their Auditours to sue and seek for peace, and to be constant in the protestant Religion; and further, they denied to give any money to raise or maintain War against His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie and the Orthodox Doctrine established: also it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against them, that they perswade many others to the like loyaltie and obedience: one of them was so bold as to preach against Rebellion, and cited some Authours for what he said, he quoted <hi>Casaubon,</hi> and <hi>Casaubon</hi> quoted <hi>Suetonius,</hi> that it was recorded that <hi>Brutus, Cassius, Cymba, Cas<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

For which rebellious and distastfull kinde of Teaching they were committed to severall prisons, there to lodge amongst their Fellowes, whilest their Cattle must be seised, their Benefices suspended; it is much hoped that Master <hi>Green</hi> the Feltmaker near <hi>Bridewell,</hi> or <hi>Gunne</hi> the preaching Cooper hard by the Bear-garden, or <hi>Carbrain</hi> the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist Dier on the backe side, shall have their places: their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies turned out of doores, their Houses rifled and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacked, and their Goods carried to Plunderers Hall, there to be sold for the supportation and furthering of the good

Cause, and themselves (for examples and terrour of others to remain in Gaole till such times as they have learned better manners.</p>
               <p>It was also Voted this Night, that no man or woman should be capable to receive, have, hold, or keep, either goods, lands, meat, drinke, apparell, or any manner of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries whatsoever, except the said parties shall have the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; possessions of the said necessaries, either by the meanes of credit, ready money, love, or by the new made true and lawfull way of stealing and plundering.</p>
               <p>Moreover the said Tuesday Night the Garrison at <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford</hi> (being all <hi>Carosists, Royalists,</hi> and <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> are in such distresse that Radishes and Onions are exceeding scarce, and (to their further griefe) Oranges and Limmons are dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to them than to us, so that all manner of meates are like to be in good request amongst them, their best and only sawces are stomacke, pepper and salt.</p>
               <p>Also this Night was brought from <hi>Brainsford</hi> to <hi>Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hithe</hi> that the Malignant partie did oppose his Excellencie, and that they would shew themselves the Benignant partie, for the service of God, their King, Countrey, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, and that we the true Anabaptisticall, Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisticall, and zealous Reformers shall be as opposite to the Truth as the Truth is to us, which was Voted. Also this Night, there were papers found with some scriblings written by no bodie, wherein our <hi>London</hi> new Bulworkes, Rampires, Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Workes were abused with nick-names, as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our <hi>Fortifications</hi> but <hi>Twentyfications,</hi> and our <hi>Bul-workes, Cow-workes,</hi> because the women made them, but they said, the men were onely for the <hi>Ram</hi>-peire. It was also Voted that (by reason of Feares and Jealousies that the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> would come and plunder the Citie) in policie the people should be all plundered by the Parliament Forces, so that if the Cavaliers do chance to come, they shall finde nothing to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53561:6"/>

               <head>Wednesday Night.</head>
               <p>THis Night there were Pamphlets scattered, one of them was concerning Squares and Rounds, the Authour of Square-dealing was one <hi>Homo Quadratus,</hi> the other was <hi>Non Angulus Rotundus,</hi> wherein some worthy Citizens of <hi>Oxford</hi> were both taxed and vindicated, namely, <hi>T.

               <p>Also there came from the Presse A New Learned Weake Description of Weekly Newes; it was so acute that it did cut and curry the <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> in such fearfull fashion, that a deafe man would rejoyce to hear it, this Volume of one sheet was called <hi>Mercurius Civicus,</hi> the Authour never wrote before that time, and died in his first Week of his Travels; it is said by the Malignants, that he was most unfortunately choaked with seventeen neat and palpable Lyes, which he had carefully invented, and incerted in the said Book for the credit of our Armie, he is worse than dead, for his reputation is buried with this Epitaph, <hi>Here Mercurius Civicus lyes in his throat</hi>; for we are resolved to believe any thing that makes for the advancing of our Cause, and likewise we suppresse and politiquely give no credit to such Newes or Losses as do make against us; in briefe, we have lost a profitable Member by the death of this painfull Authour, but hang him, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that he is alive again, or the Devill in his likenesse; however, it is to be conjectured, that he that was so nimble

to abuse and tell the Malignant partieso roundly in one week, no doubt but if he had lived longer he would have bang'd them backe and side, beyond all beliefe and credit.</p>

               <p>Newes came this Night, that the Authour of a seditious Pamphlet was taken at <hi>Lewis</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> It was a Book wherein was declared the goodnesse and happinesse of the King, that (beyond all example or record) in 15 yeares Raigne had not any Nobleman, Gentleman, or any Subject that arose against him in any way of opposition or Rebellion, so that the Sword of Justice had no occasion to be drawn to cut of Treason (a blessing unparallel'd in this Kingdom or any other for so long time) till now; &amp; the Book said further, that when <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> raigned, our Saviour was borne, and that the Emperour was Monarch of all the discovered Kingdomes of the World, and that Peace was then over the face of the whole Earth, which whole Earth <hi>Augustus</hi> commanded to be taxed, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.1. Shortly after there was raised a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Spain,</hi> (by an Armie of Thieves) under the command of one <hi>Crocotus</hi> (a mad, hare-brain'd, desperate, ambitious
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53561:7"/>
fellow) This <hi>Crocotus</hi> with his crew troubled <hi>Caesar,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many outrages upon peaceable people; and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the Rebellion the Emperour caused Proclamations to be set forth, that whosoever could vanquish the Rebels, or take their Generall <hi>Crocotus</hi> and bring him alive or dead, should have twenty five thousand Crownes for his service, and pardon withall for any former faults committed: as soon as <hi>Crocotus</hi> heard of this Proclamation, he began to fear that some of his own Souldiers would cut his throat, or sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise and deliver him to <hi>Caesar,</hi> for so great a reward as was proclaimed; upon which consideration, he wisely disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe, ran away from his Armie, and fell at <hi>Caesars</hi> feet, claiming the benefit of the Proclamation, for he had brought <hi>Crocotus</hi> alive, and so revealed himselfe, and was received into grace and favour, mending his manners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all expectation.</p>
               <p>The application of this storie was, that it was desired that every offender would imitate <hi>Crocotus.</hi>

and worthy Welwisher to the Lowest Uppermost House re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, as followeth:</p>
               <p>My small Friend (quoth he) I will tell thee briefly what this new <hi>Publique Faith</hi> is, it is called Publique because it is common to all, and hath communitie in all, and to take away, waste, and consume all; it is Generall, Catholique, and Universall, not peculiar to any man, particular not private to any person, there is no man hath any proprietie in it, more than he hath in his goods and lands (as at this time the case is) so that it is neither <hi>Thine</hi> nor <hi>Mine,</hi> but every mans; it hath absolute power to borrow money, and to force unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving people to be exceeding desperate Creditours; and whosoever is so wickedly minded as to presume to deny or delay what the <hi>Publique Faith</hi> demands, such refractory per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must be robb'd (of all they have sometimes) some have been so bold as to call it plundering, but instead of the word <hi>stealing,</hi> there is a pretty nickname given to it, called Seasing; for this strange Faith hath that invisibilitie in it, not onely to tolerate Thiefts and Rapines, but to allow Burglaries, Fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Murders, Rebellions, (and some parcels of Treasons) to be no breach of Lawes, and to lay all unruly persons in prison as will not be contented quietly (without grumbling) to be rifled and undone. It hath likewise power (with the fame extorted or stolne goods or monies taken) to raise War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to transforme Colliers into Captaines, Broken Merchants to Colonells, trade fallen Tapsters into Tyrannicall <hi>Rodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montadoes,</hi> and these brave <hi>Man-divells</hi> shall be the Leaders of such Troops of unresistable, unconquerable <hi>Mirmidones</hi> that shall inforce all men to the obedience of the <hi>Publike faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Faith,</hi> is neither <hi>Protestant, Lutheran, Calvinist, Papist,</hi> or any kinde of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> The <hi>Turke</hi> hath no faith to follow it, or the <hi>Moores</hi> to follow it, it is a faith that is full of workes, (whereby it is notoriously meritorius) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53561:8"/>
it doth no harme to bad men (for it leaves them to the judgement of another world) it onely by afflictions tries the vertuous strength of their patience, as do desire peace, and to be obedient to their Sovereigne, and would willingly live quietly in such manner as God and the Lawes of this Kingdome (grounded and derived on and from Gods Word) hath established for the government and tranquilitie both of Church and State, such men as these, and none else but such as these are opprest, rifled, ransacked, imprisoned, masacred, and beggered by the mightie meanes of the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Faith</hi>: for it all the Goales in <hi>England</hi> were searched (I mean such Goales as are under the high and mightie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Publique Faith</hi>) all those that lie in those Gaoles are laid there by that Faiths command for no other faults, but for being true Protestants and loyall Subjects to their Soveraigne, on the contrary there is not any Anabaptist, Brownist, Schismaticke, Seperatist, or Rebell in any trouble or prison under the command of the <hi>Publique Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas (of it selfe) it hath not power, except by dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of legal Statutes &amp; Ordinances, joyned (and protected) by regal power and Authorietie, yet it assumes, (or presumes to take to it selfe, and make of it selfe what Power it list, either regal or legal, what shal most advance the selfe will of it selfe: it is so potent, as it can maintain it selfe in magnificent pompe, by forcible borrowing, and withall it is so just as to pay dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (with emptie promises) it can turne Orthodox prayer and preaching into pedlary prating, also Libels, Lyurnals, and scandalous railing Pamphlets are not onely tolerated by the <hi>Publique Faith,</hi> but all and (worse than all this) hath been countenanced and encouraged by exalting the insulting swarme of mechanicke or trencher <hi>Pulpiteers,</hi> that what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the medley of their seditious gallimaufrey hotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potch doctrine, and the meer froathie inventions compiled and dispersed in great Volumes for pence a piece; it is most
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53561:8"/>
certain, that God hath not escaped blasphemie, or the King calumnie, the people unspeakable miserie, the estate oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie, and the whole Kingdome infamie, to the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible scorne of all Nations. The <hi>Publique Faith</hi> can frame and devise Navies of shippes, Armies of men and amunition, and Letters and Messages from the Kings of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> (of which Letters those Kings ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew, and those Shippes, Armies, and Armes are invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or like Castles in the ayre) this Faith can also invent sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Battailes, Fights, and triumphant Victories, where ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stroke was strook or blow given, and it can command Bels to be rung, Bonefires to be inflamed, and publique Thankesgiving in Churches, and proclaim it selfe victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, when it is most miserably and bravely beaten, and that it killed seven hundred with the losse of two men and one boy, and halfe a Horse, whereby the credulous seduced peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have their giddy braines tost to and fro, from Jealousies to Feares, from Feares to Hopes, and from Hopes to lend and give Money as if they were mad, and in so laying out their Money, they deservedly purchase their miserie.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this Faith cannot be perswaded by any meanes to endure or abide a King, especially if he be a good one, or will not be such an one as this Faith would make him, but if he do but claime his right, or stand upon lawfull termes for his Royall and just Priviledge and Prerogative; if he be so unruly, that he will not be ruled by this <hi>Publique Faith,</hi> he must then be robb'd and plundered of all that ever he hath, or at least of as much as this Faith can lay hold on, for it hath power with the Kings Amunition, Armes, Shippes, Money, Revenue, Townes, Houses, Castles, or any thing that is the Kings, in the Kings name to shoot bullets against the King, and fight against the King, for the preservation and service of the King. Thus the <hi>Publique Faith</hi> hath surpassed <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's</hi> Magicians in Legerdemain, it hath trasform'd our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53561:9"/>
Land into the Isle of <hi>Guls</hi> temporally, and old <hi>England</hi> into New <hi>England</hi> spiritually. It hath made mens wealths and alleageance, crimes and causes, of their losse of estates and lives; it hath put down all Spirituall Courts, so that there is no punishment for the sweet sin of Lecherie, whereby Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adulterie, Bigamie, Poligamie, and Incest with bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen uncontrolled fronts, make whores, knaves, cuckolds, bawdes, bastards, thieves, and beggars by the hundreds, so that if this world lasts and this geer go forward, we shall have <hi>Plato's</hi> Common-wealth here, and concerning our wives, we shall all turne to be <hi>Nicholaitans</hi>; by which brave unbridled Libertie, <hi>Hey down derry Downing,</hi> Roome for an <hi>Hackney</hi> Presbyterean, that whilest his wife lay sicke, got the Nurse and the Maidservant both with childe, but some satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was made, for the Wife died, he married the Nurse, concerning the other plumpe Girle, some course was taken, but all's one for that, the Parish is big enough to keep both the Cow and the Calfe. Thus can the <hi>Publique Faith</hi> taxe a reverend Clergie with corrupted Simonie, and yet it selfe can make money of all things, it can turne Obedience into Rebellion, and Loyaltie into Treason, it can molest a good King, disturbe and ruinate Kingdomes, and in conclusion to wear it selfe so thred-bare, that all the Cloath-workers in <hi>England</hi> will never be able to set a new nap upon it.</p>
               <p>Thus have I declared the almightie and omnipotent sway of the <hi>Publique Faith,</hi> yet I have not related any things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning particulars, but onely touch'd at the generall Heads of the potencie, power, actions, force, and vertues of it, the Day breakes, and our Authour writes nothing but Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes (or Deeds of Darkenesse) so, Good morrow my Masters.</p>

               <head>Friday Night.</head>
               <p>THis Night lamentable Newes was brought that Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Troopes did most unmercifully plunder a poor old woman within foure miles of South-East <hi>Wickham,</hi> the case was pitifull as it was related, that the woman kept a blinde, smoakie, drie Alehouse, neare the High-way, and that two Tinkers had been there and dranke all her Ale the day before the Armie marched that way, but the next day the Souldiers being on their march demanding drinke for their money, the old woman told them, that she had none left, but the Souldiers being offended, in a revenging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, entered her house, and plundered it of all the water which she had provided to brew withall, but took nothing at all from her besides, but the poor distressed Ale-wife cried out, and wrung her hands, saying, she was undone, she was undone, utterly undone, at which instant the Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming by, and hearing the deplorable noyse of the woman, demanded what was the cause that made her crie out so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, she answered, that the Souldiers had been the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her, by depriving her of the benefit of two Trades at once, <hi>videlicet,</hi> a Brewer and an Ale-wife, by drinking up all her water, whereupon his Highnesse threw her an Angell, and rode away laughing at her miserie: some say that <hi>Boy</hi> the Dog of War wagged his taile merrily in a jeering man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the womans calamitie; and this was the most extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary outrage that the Prince or his Armie committed at that or any other time, for the Malignants say it is no robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to plunder Rebels.</p>
               <p>But now be amazed, astonished, and possest with wonder and admiration, and if ever we had cause to be beside our selves, out of our wits, or starke mad with joy, now is the time; there was this Night brought to light the most horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53561:10"/>
terrible, detestable, cruell Plot that ever was contriv'd since the dayes of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Even-song comes short of it, the Massacre of <hi>Paris</hi> comes not neare it, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> intended Invasion was a toy to it, and the Powder Plot was but a blast or puffe in comparison of it; but I hold my Reader too long before I come to the unpurposed purpose, or marrow of the matter, which was as followeth:</p>
               <p>This Night our watchfull Centinels, closely and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined all that came neare them, and if any were so sawcie as to say they were for God and the King, there was a a strict Order for them, for being dangerous persons to the State, about nine of the clocke, or two houres before or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde: a tall fellow disguised, with a water tankard on his shoulder, stopt with a clout, as the manner is, which he had filled at the Conduit, as he said, falsly, for it was proved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to be wilde-fire-water, this audatious <hi>Herostratus</hi> knowing where a Souldier stood with his Musket, which Souldier had a pound of Powder in a paper loose in his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, which the Villain having notice of, he suddenly stepped to him, and plucked out the stopple of his Tankard, whereat the water gushed forth with such violence that it fired the Powder, and blew the Souldier from the Standard in <hi>Cheape</hi> over the houses into <hi>Milkestreet,</hi> as farre as Saint <hi>What d'ye call hims Church,</hi> where the learned Master <hi>Case</hi> teaches, the wicked wretch was taken with his watery Engine, and upon examination he confest, that he and seventy nine more of his fellowes were hired by the Malignant partie to fire the Citie in eleven score and twelve places with this new-found stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem of Water-tankards, for the which Plot the Traitour was committed to <hi>Waltham</hi> house neare <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and it is thought that publique Thankesgiving must be given for this great Deliverance.</p>
               <p>This Night also there came Newes of two strange dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters which happened at Saint <hi>Albans,</hi> the the one was of

one <hi>Iohn Robotham</hi> Esquire, whom the Malignants do call Justice <hi>Ignorance,</hi> this worthy Squire to expresse his Loyaltie did oppresse all such as any way did love or honour the King, for which purpose his Clerke and himselfe did drive a great Trade in buying and selling of <hi>Mittimusses,</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, Bindings over, Withdrawings of Recognisance, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitments, Releasings, Fees, Plunderings, and gentle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by which meanes he got a wicked deale of money; this mightie bottomelesse Justice <hi>Robotham</hi> did for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of His Majestie take away all the Armes and Amunition that any of His Majesties Friends had, and with the same Armour and Armes so plundered, he armed the Rebels, and yet all that was done by him was done for the Kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; amongst the rest of the Armes he had an head-piece of his own which he took great pride in, for it was light, bright, white, and (at the least Elder-gun proofe) it was his great Grandfathers <hi>Morion</hi> (a Murrein on't) at the siege of <hi>Southampton</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> indeed there was a privie search made for it, (for the very house of office was examined) but no finding could be found, and because there were so many Wenches with childe in the Town, [Mistris Justice] Master Justice <hi>Ignorant's</hi> Wife protested by her Halliday and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manhood that she had rather have lost his Cod-piece than his Head-piece.</p>
               <p>Also there was one <hi>Thomas Sadler</hi> who had formerly been a fractur'd Linnen-Draper, retired to a Countrey conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his <hi>Lawn</hi> transform'd into Land, his <hi>Holand</hi> metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosed into <hi>Zeal-And</hi> himselfe quite devoured by invisible uncharitable Devotion; to expresse the ardencie, fervencie, vehemencie, and furiositie of his love to the observation of Church Orders, upon a Fast-day he went into his Barne where he congregated his own people and some others, there being a great Bucking-tub brought into the Barne, the said Tub having two holes which a cole-staffe was to be put

through upon occasion, through which holes a rope was fastened, and Master <hi>Sadler</hi> being in the Tub, the rope was cast over a beame, wherewith he commanded himselfe to be hoised up, that he might make his preachment, where after nine Psalmes, and a stretch'd out five quarters prayer, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and proceeded with singular and single Doctrine to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade his Audience to be loyall in Rebellion, and obedient in opposing all Law and Order, which Godlesse instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Assemblie did not onely give large eares unto, but also edified beyond measure thereby; at last he being sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly inspired and transported with a fierie <hi>Enthumiasmicall</hi> rapture, he began to denounce destruction and confusion against the Cavaliers, and with his violent expressions, and agilitie of action, in stamping the word Damnation hard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his foot, he thumped out the bottome of his hanging Pulpit, (whereby his foundation was as bottomlesse as Hell, of his Doctrine) and withall fell down in the threshing floor, where he lay a good while in a tranuce; some say he was bruised, but the wisest of his Audience do believe that he was in private contemplation with the Spirit. And thus up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fast-day was this admirable piece of faste and loose.</p>
               <p>It was much disputed in the House what the true meaning of the word Malignant is (that is so often repeated in Print, and Pulpit) one said, it was derived from two Latine words, <hi>Malè lignum,</hi> an evill wood, a crooked, knottie, sappie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviceable timber, good onely to make Gallouses.</p>
