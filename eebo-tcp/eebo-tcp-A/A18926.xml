            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I answer first to the word Baptismes or / washinges: the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned haue affirmed (Beza in Heb. 6.2.) that it was the custom of primatiue chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to referre baptisme ouer vnto the days of Easter and Pentecost / for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>which cawse they were called the Days of Baptisme / that is / of baptizinge Many Catechumenistes: vnto which practise Mayster Beza demeth this forme of speach had relation. That this Epistle to the Heb. shold be so late writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten / for myne owne part I doubt / and therfore (though not easly be remoued from such a blessed mans iudgment / yet) I cannot for the present vrge it much.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Baptismes also may plurally be vsed / because Many were at one ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me baptized / that being the tyme of the lords haruest / though not at the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer two tymes / as / Act. 2.41. etc. 10.47.48.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly / it was customarie with the westerne Churches to baptise with / 3. dippings (as signifyinge the Trinitie of persons / in the vnitie of one essence) why may not Baptismata importe these immmersions in one baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me? 4. Besides / if baptizing of feete (Ioh. 13.) were not a Ciuil / but an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall ordinance (and who knowes not that it was of auncient vsed?) why may not Baptismes haue relation to this and the other Baptisme this being called by som auncient the Consummation of the sacrament. Any of these 4. senses are more probable then Anabaptisme / or / Rebaptization.</p>

Shewe me somuch as one seminge argument drawen from Doctrine or Example in the whole booke of good. <hi>Sic volo, sic iubeo,</hi> or / <hi>autos ephe,</hi> wyll not be sufficient ground for my conscience.</p>
                  <p>Now steppeth in one / with an imagination of a deepe difference betwixt Baptisme and Layng, on of handes: for (saith he) Lay-men / or / the Common people may (in a Churches begininge and first razing) lay on handes (as Nomb. 8.10.) so may they not Baptize.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First (for argument salte) let it be vnderstood so / in Nomb. 8.10. Yet it followeth not / That watsoeuer was lawfull to be don then of the common people / that also is stil lawfull. If they put out the vniuersall (All) or / whatsoeuer / and say / Somthynge that the Common people then did may now be don: This I graunt. But / that sacramentall imposition is one of these Somthinges / how will that be proued? Nay / marke the contrarie. In the Begininge of the New testaments church / people had no such libertie: and this appeareth / in that Christ and the Apostles from Christ / and the Euangelists from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did stil set forward this Ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

                  <p n="2">2. But what if the place of Nombers teach not that?

                  <p n="1">1. Thus: If the lawe (who was but a whipping schoolmaster vnto Christ) accepted of Infants / then muth more the ghospell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or thus: whome God once in truth accepts / them he neuer in truth reiects. These two arguments can by scripture neuer be gaynsayde.</p>
                  <p>But to speake playner: the former promise and couenant to and with Abraham and his seede is indeede ghospell and the strength of the Ghospell: Galat. 3.8. from whence I thus reason.</p>

                  <p>Obj. For want of matter they giue vs moe words / and say: <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi> was a sacrament of works / but Baptisme a sacrament of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Ans. Lyke lips / like lettuce: for our sauiour saith that Circumcision was not of Moses / but of the fathers (Ioh. 7.22.) and blessed Paul saith that Circumcision sealed faith: Rom. 4.11. and in the 13. vers. that it sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that promise that was not by the Lawe (that is / by the works of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we) but by fayth. And the tyme of the guifte therof (vz / after he beleiued / not after he wrought) makes the case playner.</p>
                  <p>Obj. Ey (saith the blynd Catabaptiste) after Faith they sholde be seald / because Baptisme seales faith.</p>
                  <p>Ans. So Paul hath taught that Circumcision only sealed Faith / yet I trowe it also sealed Infants of the faithfull that yet professed no faith but in and by the Parent: And therfore Abrahams children had faith Actuall in the
<pb facs="tcp:17683:10"/>
                     <hi>Parent</hi> (of whose loynes they were vntill they Apostated by rebellion) and faith imputed vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Hauing no reason they first ask / why the first day is not still kept? Secondly / what one president we haue in the newe testament of an infant baptized?</p>
                  <p>First / for the day I answer: That externall ceremonie is put away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with thexternall signe Circumcision. The day and the signe came in togither / no maruel then if they depart togither. Secondly / no man demeth it symply vnlawfull to baptise the 8. day. Thirdly / if that 8. day was partly a figure of the day. (after the 7.) wherin our Christ rose for our iustification (which is in a sense the 8. day. Ioh. 20.26.) and so the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewithall of our lords day / it may then teach / that the lords church (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided they be not in the vnconstituted wildernes) it is (that being the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall day of Convocation) to be obserued for Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>For the other question / I will first answer with another question: Is nothing warrantable wherof there is not direct and expresse warrant in the new Testament? Indeed such teachers flatly reiect the old testament. May a man marry with his syster? No. How proues thow that by the new testament? The 1. Cor. 5.1. is of a mother / and I talke of a syster. It may be / that that Incestuous person was one of these madding spirits that thought nothing of the old might stand with the Newe / without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse warrant in the newe. Secondly / it is saide the whole housholde was baptised / Act. 16.15. et 33. as it is said that all Abrahams houshold was circumcised / Gen. 17.23.27. (the one ey looking to the other / for like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of speach and action) shal we thincke that there was no infant / nor anie one but could professe true faith? It is absurd. Nay the Apostle telleth the Iaylor plainly / that if himself beleiue / his whole houshold (that is / such as were vnder his tuition) were within the compasse of saluation. He doth not say. If thou and all thyne houshold belieue: but / If thow beleiue. And indeed so it was with Abraham / he beleiuinge (the lord looked not if his houshold beleiued) togither with him / his whole housholde was sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let the Catabaptists knowe therfore / that with Herods servants (Math. 2.) they but butcher infants: denyinge that comforte now vnto the faithfull parents / which at first was giuen vnto the father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nay let them knowe that Christ his comminge depriued none of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer comfort / but indeede added vnto the same. The bloody cutting / he hath converted into an easy washinge. The female that before (after a sort) stood of / he hath now receiued in: and therfore now no difference betwixt
<pb facs="tcp:17683:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Male and female / for we are one in Christ: and if Christs / then Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams seede and heires by promise: Gallat. 3.28.29. and if hepres by promise / then to haue the seale of the promife / as before is proned.</p>

                  <p>Two cawses therfore of seperating fully in fellowship spirituall / from such a Congregation as hath truly professed Christ / there semeth vnto vs (for the present) sufficient and lawfull. The one / if so they / haue bene orderly conuicted of obstinate Rebellion: the other / if so they seeke the spoyle (or lyfe of such a member / vniustly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:17683:15"/>Touchinge the first / we se that after the Lord his prophets had conuicted <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> of obstinate rebellion (Hos. 2. Ezek. 16.52. Ier. 3.8.) They put the Bill of Diuorcement into their hands / and so cut them of: Hos. 6.5. vntill they returned by repentance. This course might the howse of <hi>Cloe.</hi> (1. Cor. 1.11.) Haue taken with Corinth / had they (after Pauls conuicting them) persisted rebellious in the matters conuicted. But as <hi>Cloe</hi> (and others of like spirit) did not presently reiect Corinth (though no doubt they had delt with them about their Corruptions / before they writ to Paul therof) but themselues not preuailinge / they louinglie sought further meanes for their Conuiction and vrginge repentance: so / euerie person that in his owne eyes / is presently righteous in his owne cawse (specially in matters disputable and doubtfull) is not redely to reiect the congregation for not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting his admonishment / but charitablie seeke further meanes (if yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes be not dammed vp) for helpinge that which (in the body) is haltinge / to be turned in to the way and healed: And this may be a coolinge <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arde to our right <hi>Brownistes</hi> (if so any may rightly be so called) who (haue they no more substantiall knowledge / for discerning things different / then <hi>Tom skul,</hi> or Balaams Asse when he was at home in the stable) they vpon euery sly and vnstaied crochet / buzzing in their ytchinge eares / through the suggestion of <hi>Ahabs</hi> spirit / do fly the Congregation / grinninge and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king like dogs of the Eueninge against all such as will not presently confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to their Opinion: it may be / to slap vp a litle of their disgorged vomit. Let such reade / Heb. 10.24.25. and so to the end: suerly / our sowles haue no pleasure in such: and somuch the rather / as we cannot se thes Schismaticall Apostates com home by repentance: but seme to haue committed such a syn / as therfore the lord dammeth vp the way to repentance.</p>
                  <p>The other cawse is cruell persecution / when as such a member cannot stay in any communion with them / but with likly spoile and perill of lyfe. In such cases the prophets fled: 1. King. 18.4. end 19.3. The Apostles fled and were bid to flie: Math. 10.23. The saints fled: Act. 8.1. and Heb. 11.37. Many such / as of whome the world were not worthie / wandred vp and downe in sheepes and Goates skinnes / being destitute etc. Nay our sauiour himself diuers tymes (though he knewe his tyme of suffring was not yet com) he secretly fled: how much more in such case may we? If any say: few of these flights / were from such people as were not first God his church: Let it be so. If we may flie from an holy people by reason of outward persecution / then much more for inwarde persecution. And this ouerthwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth such (I speak only of such) pharisaicall Prescisians as haue taught their people that <hi>Clapham</hi> and others such / may be knowen for false prophets / if but in this: <hi>they fly for feare of the sworde. If it be truth they teach, they wold stay &amp; seale it with theyr blood.</hi>

But yow must slubber your childrens bread ouer with a litle such counterfait hony / or else they wold not so easly swalowe the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the Pharises.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-bisshop of Caunterbury (as I was told) sitting once in examination of som / he said / that if he were of Cartwrightes opinion / he wold be of the <hi>Brownistes</hi> practise.

And suerly / were I of full mynd with som of your writers and teachers / I shold with the right <hi>Brownist</hi> deme euerie speaker and communicator with yow to be flatly visible Antichristian; where (as I cannot subscribe vnto yow in euery thing) I verily beleiue manie in that land / to giue such testimonie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian obedience grounded on sauing faith / as I neede not feare to beleiue them to be true Christians.

                  <p>Such a people therfore gathering and thus couenantinge to walke / are a Church gathered and established: only / to the absolutinge or perfectinge of this Churches Order / there is required further / an election and Ordination of Officers.

                  <p>The Officers are of two sortes: <hi>Bishops</hi> (in english ouerseers) and <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi>) in english / Ministers / or Seruitours) 1. Tim. 3.1.8.

These must hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the mysterie of the faith in a pure conscience: And in the former / there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of absolute Necessitie / aptnes to teach / and ability to confute errours. Such the Pastor and Doctor / euery one graunts / must be: and such the other Elders must be / as I haue proued in my Bybles breife. As for the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge of 1. Tim. 5.17. (euerie of whose sences is to be preferred before the drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Lay elders) do looke into D. <hi>Bilsons</hi> forsaid booke. A plaine print of the footesteps of preaching Presbyters / or / Elders / se in all auncient writers theologicall and historicall: and that whersoeuer they mention presbyters in a church (vnder the Episcop / or Pastor) they must be vnderstood such Elders commonly translated / <hi>Preistes.</hi>

                  <p>If al Levies lips were to preserue knowledge / how much more was the lawe to be fetcht from <hi>Kohaths</hi> Leuits which were ioyned with the Cheife preist / in the worke of Ouerseinge and peculiar gouernment.

Let therfore our other Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put away this their errour: and let all that haue helde it / smite their hand on their thighe and say: what haue we don? while we sought to establish or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances diuine / we haue constituted an ordinance humaine.

If one sholde aske these fellowes / what office or Calling it was which Christ so exercised / can they say he did it / by vertue of Preisthoode or Prophecie / or only as he was Kinge / and so by power Regall due vnto him (as he was Dauids sonne) thoughe at other tymes he wold not vse it?

            <p>But let the Despiser of gouernment (as Iude calles him) goe / the Apostle Paul willeth euery man to abide still in that Callinge lawfull / where in he was found / when he was called to christianitie: presuming hereby / that euerie one that shold be called to Christ / shold be alredie installed in som legetimate calling: as though God wold hardly call any / that were out of all callinge. And indeed / A man without a callinge / is like a carcase without a sowle: fitter to be pitted for feare of infection / then to be tollerated amongst men. Pharaoh (Gen. 47.3.) cold aske Iosephs brethren of what trade they were? Either because he demed the religious Hebrues wold not liue without som trade: or because it was common with the Egiptians to haue trades: or / for that the integritie of that age was such / as eueri where (ordinarily) people had trades. Many Kyngs we haue / and many people we haue: but fewe kyngs or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that enquire after trades: and too many people / that were not able to answer vnto the Demaund / <hi>what trade</hi>?

Nay / will thow be seldom or neuer tempted / or strongly assailed with ill / then liue in a Callinge / and labour painfully therein: so shal there be no place to vayne thoughts / nor shall the spartous assailements of Satan be able to penetrate thy straits. While Iesus plaid the Carpenter / we read of no tentations / but so soone as he was called from that and went into the wildernes for solitarie / then we heare of a Tempter and his manifold tentations. So much for that.</p>
            <p>Tho second part of this peoples question is this: <hi>Is not he Maries sonne?</hi> Yes forsooth: he is the sonne of Mary / and yet so her sonne / as neither blynd Iewe / nor naturall Gentile is able to comprehend. Maries son he is: not Iosephs son. Truer they spoke then they were aware. But as Caiphas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied / and Pilate superscribed / so these pronounce theire owne condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vnwntinge. Maries son he is / and yet more then Maries son: for behold / God clothed in flesh / our nature assumed of God / wherby (oh euer worthie meditation) God and Man is made One. This doctrine is termed blasphemie by the manie sects of Anabaptistrie / of our tyme. One sort with <hi>Arius,</hi> Denies him to be eternall / and of the fathers essence / affirming him a Creature with the begining of tyme. Another crue terme him also a Creature / but diduce his begining of Days from Mary: som of them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him bare man / with <hi>Artemon</hi> and <hi>Samosatenus</hi>: som of them / make him a third thing (or a mixt Creature) compounded on God and Man / not Distinguishing / but confounding the natures / as did <hi>Apollinaristes.</hi> Another feet (and they are most common) do deny Christ to exist one person in two natures: giuing vnto him with <hi>Manes</hi> one Nature / and that meere Diuyne: som of them saing it was of the essence of his father: som / that is came from heauen: som / they will not define from whence.</p>

            <p>Our Arrians say / he is called / <hi>the beginning of the Cratures of god,</hi> Reuel. 3.14. therfore he had a beginning: foolishlie concluded: for blessed Iohn tellinge the (ch. 1.) that 1. he was the Word: 2. with God. 3 and was God 4. that without him Nothinge was made (he was Somthin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge / did he make him selfe?) they shold rather conclud he is called the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Creatures / because euerie Creature was begon by him: as we say: this Carpenter was the beginner of the Ship? that is / the Maker or efficient cawse of the ship.

Noahs ship rid vpon the waues / and the Church must flote through all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous miseries. In it was a Cham and vncleane creatures: and in this wilbe the lurking hypocrite and many vncleane sowles / faring the better for the presence of our Carpenter. That / at the last rested vpon the tops of the Mountaines: and shall not our Carpenters Church after all hurly-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes / ariue at A hauen of happines / hier then the Mountaines?

            <p>Thus the head of our nature and first fruites of our lump / he followed the occupation earthly / vntill he fell vnto the occupation heauenly. In the first he was serviceable to the earthlie parent / in the second to the heauenly: but Being once adapted to the second / he leaues of the first / to teach men to cast aside earthly toyle / when by ministring the ghospel / they fall of building the Church.

               <hi>Is not this the Carpenter Maries son?</hi> The Iewes hearing him speak so learnedly and powerfully / they wonder it shold be in A Man / that neuer had bene trayned vp in letters.

I feare / if a third step not in and say / both scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res are true / for Christ is true God and true Man / the men wold goe nere to fyre the howse in their heat.</p>
            <p>Sweet Carpenter / thus they plowe furrowes on thy back all the day longe.

When the Hearers were offended in him <hi>(en auto)</hi> not by him (for the scandale was <hi>Taken,</hi> not <hi>Giuen</hi>) they then fall to Whats and Ifs and all sortes of disgracinge Interrogatories.

But wantinge Syn (and therein he went before all Prophets) they tosse vp and downe (as with a Racket) his Callinge and Birthe homely: not being able to infringe his Doctrine / they labour to disgorge theyr stomake on his Person.

            <p>In the Places of Heb. 6.1.2.3.4.5.6. and Ch. 10.23. vnto 28. verse. is A syn layd downe termed <hi>Irremissible.</hi> To the effectinge which syn / two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are mentioned: the One <hi>a forsakinge of the beginnings of faith,</hi> Called also Hope: the other is <hi>a forsakinge of fellowship</hi> Or communion spirituall with such as with whome they had community spirituall. This Collection is plaine: and other Collection there is not. Such Apostacy and Schisme is termed <hi>Willinge</hi>: because they do not (as <hi>Peter</hi> did) fal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebly through feare of Ciuil powre or such externall thinges. For the word (<hi>ecousios</hi>) Willingly or <hi>frely,</hi> is such an vnforced fall as was <hi>Iulians</hi> in the whole foundation: of <hi>Arius</hi> and many other heretiks in the truth of Christs person: and such hath bene the fall and <hi>schisme</hi> of Most of these who whetted my pen vnto this treatise. Not Apostates only in the Mouth (as was <hi>Ecebolius</hi> and Fr. <hi>Spiera</hi>) but that which is worse / Apostates in the heart (the place of Faithes rootinge) as by theyr owne resistinge the truth (and that bitterly) which once they held and professed with knowledge and much Comfort / it appeareth. For first they haue bene enlightened / tasted of the heauenly guifte and stood in and for that Hope: But afterwards vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constrained by outward powre / they haue frely forsaken the grounds / either wholy with Iulian or in part with <hi>Arius</hi>: nor yet cold we euer se any one of them possessed with Repentaunce: but either swalowe vp more of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons water: or else are one with Papists / Anabaptistes / Arrians / and what sect not (yet condemninge them all) in A word / flat Atheistes. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se (consideringe the truth they once held) are sayd (Tit. 3.11.) to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of their owne selues. Nor is this the <hi>Nouatians</hi> doctrine / for they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood this Syn in the Hebrues / not only of <hi>Faith</hi> / but also of Manners: which is euidently not only ag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

hynder others to ascende. These as starres fallen from the firmament / labour with Lucifer to hale others after. Bariesus laboured but to kepe others in the same darknes he was borne and bred in. Peter calleth such / welles dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen dry / clowdes carryed about: and Iude termes them despisers of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment / twise dead / pulled vp by the rootes / raging waues / Planets or wandring starres / denying God and our Lord Iesus Christ. Not that euer any one possessed with the beginings of faith did simply fall from all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledginge God and Christ (for neuer was such a thinge) and the two Apostles foretel that there shold be many of these spirits) but a fallinge frely (vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained) from the rudiments of God and Christ first receiued from the Ghos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel. These Apostates and withdrawing spirits / vpon the hearinge and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding herof / They will haue whats and ifs and all sortes of Narrations / wherby to be offended in me. Theyr fathers delt so with the liuing roote of the vyne: and must I (an vnworthy dry braunch / though through god his grace vnblasted) must I scape scotfre? No / no. These spirits must speak euell of the thinges they knowe not: and what they knowe naturally / Iude. 10.) as beastes vnreasonable / euen in those thinges also they corrupt themselues. But our Carpenter hath set downe A lawe / that persecuting his members (specially his Ministers) it is a persecuting of himself (the better may we beare it) as also that such but kick against the prick to theyr owne Perill.</p>
            <p>Amiable myld speaches are for such as yet haue not com to the truth: or hauing comprehended som thinges / haue not yet attained vnto other things (for we but se in part) but Mosaical theratnings appertaine to the former spirits. Secondly Euangelical sweetnes is for bruized reedes / not obstinat hearts. Thirdly / all falling through in firmity / is to be supported with meeknes: but backslidinges (as the former) are to heare this speach: The light of the Righteous encreaseth vntil perfect day / but the candle of the wicked shalbe blowen o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Is not this the Carpenter, Maries Son?</hi> Yes: this is the Carpenter / on whose edged axe Many shold fall: and this is Maries son in regard of the flesh: but the son of God by the first generation / whose goinge out was before begining of Days: A Rock of offence / and a stone whervpon many shold fall till they were grounded to powder: and yet the light of the Gentiles / and the glory of his people Israel. This Carpenter is the Christ: His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary is Anti-christ. Whosoeuer gather not vnto this Carpenter / they scater to him / but gather vnto the Dragon the parent of Anti-christ. His exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Aduersarie is either Gog / Couered: Or Magog / vncouered.
