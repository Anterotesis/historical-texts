            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Worshipfull, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued: 4. sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were about Christ,
when Christ was about
his passion: The first were executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
which tormented him: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
sort were Iewes, which mockt
him: the third were lookers on, who
markt him: the fourth were welwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
who lamented him. Now, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it is like, that amongst these
his welwillers, diuers godly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wept
for him, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> of Arimathea, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel,
Nicodemus,</hi> and such like, yet
it is certaine that more women wept
<pb facs="tcp:3716:3"/>
then men. More women wept then
men, partly by the permission of men,
who thought that the womens weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
came rather from weakenes in
themselues, then for loue towardes
Christ; and partly by the prouidence
of God, who suffered more women
to weepe then men, that the women
who bewailed Christ his death, might
condemne the crueltie of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
procured it. Now the women wept
also more then the men, either of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
affection, or els of a voluntarie
disposition, naturally subiect to many
either affectionate passions, or passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
affections. But touching these
women, that which otherwise was
naturall in them was here voluntarie:
for the sinne of a woman was the ruin
of a man. Therefore these women
willingly wept the more, that though
a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did most in the second death
of the first <hi>Adam;</hi> so she may do least
in the first death of the second <hi>Adam:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3716:3"/>
For it was <hi>Eue</hi> a woman, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
the first <hi>Adam</hi> with an apple,
and caused him to sinne: but it was
<hi>Iudas</hi> a man, who betraied the second
<hi>Adam</hi> with a kisse, and caused him to
dye. Wherefore principally indeede,
Christ speaketh to the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because
both more women wept then men, &amp;
the women also wept more then the
men, more women more weeping:
yet indifferently he speaketh to all his
deare friends, <hi>VVeepe not for me, but
weepe for your selues.</hi> At the first the
woman began in disobedience, and
tempted <hi>Adam</hi> to eate of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fruite: yet since, women (as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Magdalene,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin,
and the women here with diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
haue farre exceeded men in all
obedience, vnto them rather then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men he turneth his speech, and yet
saith generally, <hi>VVeepe not for me, but
weepe for your selues.</hi> In which sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
wee may obserue as many parts
<pb facs="tcp:3716:4"/>
as there bee words, eight words eight
parts. The first is, <hi>VVeepe not,</hi> (that is)
weepe not too much. The second, <hi>but
weepe,</hi> (that is) weep not too little. The
third, <hi>weepe not but weepe,</hi> both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Fourthly, <hi>for me,</hi> not too much
for my death. Fiftly, <hi>for your selues,</hi>
(that is) not too little for your owne
liues. Sixtly, <hi>for me for your selues,</hi>
both together. Seuenthly, <hi>Weepe not
for me.</hi> Eightly, <hi>Weepe not for me, but
weepe for your selues.</hi> God graunt that
our harts may be so affected with the
consideration of these excellent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as they may bee most to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of our comfort in him, and his
glorie in vs.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>VVeepe not, &amp;c.</hi> When <hi>Iairus</hi>
(ruler of the Sinagogue) wept bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the death of his daughter, Luk.
8. 52. Christ sayd vnto him, <hi>VVeepe
not.</hi> When <hi>Rachel</hi> wept and would
not be comforted for the losse of her
sonne <hi>Beniamin,</hi> seeing so few of her
<pb facs="tcp:3716:4"/>
children left, Iere. 31. 16. the Lord sayd
vnto her, <hi>Weepe not.</hi> When a poore
widow wept for the death of her on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sonne, Luk. 7. 3. Christ sayd vnto
her, <hi>VVeepe not.</hi> And so Christ here
seeing many <hi>Iairus,</hi> many <hi>Rachels,</hi>
many widowes, weeping for the son
of God, sayd vnto them, <hi>VVeepe not.</hi>
Forbidding therby immoderate wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
which is condemned in nature,
in reason,<note place="margin">Psalm. 65. 12.</note> and in religion: In nature,
the earth when it reioyceth in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest,
then it is couered with corne:
but when it hath to too sorowfull a
countenance, &amp; forelorne in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then it is fruitles and barren. The
water when it is quiet and calme,
bringeth in all manner of Marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize:
but when the sea stormes and
rores too much,<note place="margin">Esay 23. 1.</note> then the very shippes
doe howle and crye. The ayre look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brightly and cheerefully, refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
al things: but weeping too much,
that is, rayning too much, as in <hi>Noahs</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3716:5"/>
his floud,<note place="margin">Gen. 7. 12.</note> it drowneth the whole
world. The fire being sprinkled with
a little water, burneth more cleerely:
but if wee cast too much water into
the fire, it will neither giue heate nor
light. The eye it selfe hath twise as
many drie skinnes, like sluces to stop
vp the course of teares, as it hath
moyst humours like channels to let
them flow forth. If all the bodie were
an eye, and there were not eares in it,
where were then the hearing? If all
the eye were a moyst humour, and
there were no drie skins in it, where
were then the seeing? Seeing then
too much weeping is in the earth,
barrennes; in the water, shipwracke;
in the ayre, an inundation; and too
much water putteth out the fire, and
in the eye blindnes; certainly if the
earth could speake, and the water
speake, and the ayre speake, and the
fire speake, and the eye speake, they
would all sing a song of fiue parts, and
<pb facs="tcp:3716:5"/>
say together, We must not weep too
much. <hi>Mulsi nimium ingratum est:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.</note>
which is thus translated in Prouer. 20
27. It is not good to eate too much
honey: and if it bee not good to eate
too much honey, it is naught to eate
too much wormewood. One sayth,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, teares are like precious
stones: and as the Egyptian pearles
which wee commonly call vnions,
which grow but one by one, not one
vpon another; so teares must bee like
these vnions, shed easily one by one,
not one vpon another. <hi>Seneca</hi> sayth,
that that which wee must doe daylie,
we must doe it moderatly: so that, if
wee cannot quite stop the issue of our
teares, as she in the Gospell could not
of her bloud: yet wee must weepe so
to day as we may weepe to morowe,
and keepe teares alwaies in store, for
some other occasion. For we knowe
that <hi>Heraclitus</hi> when hee had wept,
and sowsed himselfe in sorrow al his
<pb facs="tcp:3716:6"/>
life time, at length dyed of a dropsie:
and so (as I may say) drowned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in his owne teares: and <hi>Niobe</hi>
by ouermuch weeping, was turned
into a stone, euen as <hi>Lots</hi> wife by loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
backe vnto Sodom, was turned
into a piller of salt. It was one of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>
his poesies, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
not to eate the heart, but too much
heauines eateth the heart of man:
which is thus expounded, Prouer. 25.
20. As a moth fretteth a garment, and
the worme eateth the wood, so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
hurteth mans heart. Now, if
we must not eate vp the heart of any
other thing with our teeth, much lesse
must we eate vp our owne heart with
our teares. Therefore euen blind rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
such as the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue had, doth
yet cleerely see this, that wee must not
weepe too much.</p>
            <p>But religion goeth yet a step fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
For when God had placed man
in the garden of Eden, which is the
<pb facs="tcp:3716:6"/>
garden of pleasure, he did indeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
all things therein which might
pleasure him, his wife who was equal
to him, to accompanie him, all other
creatures farre inferiour vnto him, the
earth to tread on, and to yeeld him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
the trees that did stand about
him, the riuers that did runne besides
him, golde to trample on, pearles to
looke on, the beasts to name them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
hearbes which he did feede on, and
the flowers which he did smell to, all
these serued for his delight and ioy:
but afterward whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
against the man, that he should
liue in sorrow about the fruits of the
earth: and against the woman, that she
should haue sorrowe about the fruite
of her wombe: yet it pleased God to
asswage and sweeten our sorrowes
with diuers singular comforts. As
first, we haue the Holie ghost, who is
our onely comforrer: next, a good
conscience, which is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall feast:
<pb facs="tcp:3716:7"/>
next, the holie scriptures, which are
as it were another paradise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lastly, an
vnfained faith, by which wee haue
peace with God. Therefore <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>
sayth well, I account that many
haue no spirit, no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, no scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
no faith in God, that yeelde too
much to griefe And <hi>Ierome</hi> yet more
plainly, I doe in mine heart abhorre
all excesiue sorrowe, seeing it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hell vpon earth, and an entrance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in this life into that wofull place
where there is nothing but weeping
and gnashing of teeth. So that immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
weeping is condemned in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which teacheth al things; in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which teacheth all men; in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which teacheth all Christians,
that wee must not weepe too much.
Thus much of weeping too much,
which is the first part, <hi>Weepe not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now a little of weeping too little,
which is the second part, <hi>but weepe.</hi>
They to whome Christ spake at first
<pb facs="tcp:3716:7"/>
offended in the excesse, therefore he
beginneth thus, <hi>weepe not,</hi> but I might
well shift the words and begin thus,
<hi>but weepe,</hi> for wee offend altogether
in the want of weeping, seldome in
the excesse. The reason is, because we
lacke charity, which being three fold,
the greatest worke of true charitie
towards our selues, is repentance: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our neighbours, is preaching:
towards God, is prayer, and all these
require teares: so that if wee weepe
so little as that wee weepe not at all,
we weepe too little, which we must
not doe. For the first, touching repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
one sayth plainly, <hi>Lauandum
est cor interdum in lachrymis poenit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae:</hi>
The lesser our sorrowes are, the
greater are our sinnes: but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side,<note place="margin">Psal. 74. 13.</note> 
               <hi>The heads of dragons are
broken in the waters:</hi> that is, verie
stronge and vile sinnes are weakned
and washed away with teares. That
obligation that was against vs,<note place="margin">Coloss. 2. 14</note> before
<pb facs="tcp:3716:8"/>
it was fastned to the crosse of Christ,
it was written in parchment, now it
is written in paper: so that, if we blur
it with dayly weeping vpon it, our
teares will be like <hi>aqua fortis</hi> to take
out the handwriting quite, that God
shall neither reade, nor see our sinnes.
Therefore sayth one, wee must wash
our heartes in the troubled poole of
Bethesda, in the troubled teares of
repentance: for as in a well (except
there be some water in it) wee cannot
easily see the baggish that lieth in the
bottome, so in the depth of our heart
wee cannot see our sinnes without
teares. Teares make our sinnes seene,
and not seene; not seene to God, and
seene to vs: God not seeing them,
forgiues them; wee seeing them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them. <hi>Austine</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his 25. booke, writeth that
the teares of the vine branch doe cure
the leprosie: and so the teares of these
vine branches which are grafted into
<pb facs="tcp:3716:8"/>
the true vine, doe cure the leprosie of
sinne. That sinfull woman, because
she loued much, shee washed Christ
his feete with her teares: a strange
sight. I haue oftentimes seene the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
wash the earth: I vnderstande
that well enough, but I neuer sawe
the earth wash the heauen, yet here I
see it, an earthly and a sinfull woman,
washed the heauenly feete of Christ.
But because shee washed Christ his
feete with her teares, therefore Christ
crowned her head with his mercies.
The prodigall sonne had no sooner
turned home by weeping crosse, and
cryed <hi>peccaui,</hi> but straight way hee
was receiued. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, see what
force there is in three sillables. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>softome</hi>
saith, God hearing a sinner in
true contritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vtter but this one word
<hi>peccaui,</hi> I haue sinned, is in a manner
so charmed and inchaunted with it,
that he hath no power ouer himselfe,
he cannot but graunt remission. Saint
<pb facs="tcp:3716:9"/>
               <hi>Peter</hi> likewise (saith <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) did
recouer that place by bemoning his
offence, which hee had lost by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his master. For sayth <hi>Nazianzen,</hi>
God is more mercifull then man can
be sinfull, if man will bee sorrowfull.
Wherefore wee may see by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that weeping is
the best salt-peter to relish our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that wee may get our pardon.
Touching preaching, the voice of a
Preacher should bee the voice of a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which should not pipe to make the
people daunce: but mourne to make
the people weepe. Hence it is, that in
the old lawe none which were blind
or had any blemish in his eye, might
serue at the Altar. And when they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
their first borne, who was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
in euery familie, their Priest
or their Preacher, they offered with
him a paire of turtle doues, or two
yong pigeons: which doues did sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
a paire of mournfull eyes, and
<pb facs="tcp:3716:9"/>
these two young pigeons did signifie
likewise two weeping eies: and at
their offering they prayed for their
first borne, that afterwardes hee may
haue such eyes himselfe. For as pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
flie to their windowes, Esay
60<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. So the godly preacher hath no
other refuge to flie vnto, but onely to
his windowes: that is, to his eies that
are glased with teares, when he wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
for the sins of the people. Christ
is much delighted in these kinde of
eies, saying so often to his spouse, Thy
eyes are like pigeons eyes. The holy
Ghost also descending himselfe in
for me of a doue, and the Prophets v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
receiued their prophesies by
riuers sides, as <hi>Ezechiel</hi> had his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
deliuered him by the riuer Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,
<hi>Daniel</hi> beside the riuer Tigris,
<hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> besides the riuer Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:
yea also many preached their
prophesies not so much in wordes as
in riuers of teares: <hi>Mine eyes gushed
<pb facs="tcp:3716:10"/>
with riuers of waters,</hi> (sayth <hi>Dauid)
because men keep not thy law: Oh that
my head were full of water</hi> (sayth <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie)
and mine eies a fountaine of
teares:</hi> I protest sayth <hi>Paul,</hi> that for
these three yeares, I haue not ceased
to warne euery one of you with
teares day and night: For indeede as
<hi>Austine</hi> sayth, There is more good
to bee done with sighing then with
speaking, with weeping then with
words, <hi>Prosper</hi> sayth that a Preacher
must seeke <hi>non plausum sed planctum,</hi>
not his owne praise, but the peoples
profite in mourning for their finnes:
and <hi>Hierome</hi> sayth, that the Preacher
is most highly commended, not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the people clap their hands, but when
they knocke their bteasts: wherefore
as that is an Idoll and no GOD that
hath eyes and seeth not, so he is an
idle shepheard, and no louing Pastor,
who hath eyes and weepeth nor som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in preaching to the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3716:10"/>3. Touching prayer Saint <hi>Iames</hi>
sayth, <hi>That the prayer of a iust man
preuaileth much if it be feruent,</hi> for a
feruent prayer commeth from a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
spirite, which is wholly inspired
by the holy spirite, who maketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
in vs and for vs, with sighs and
groanes which cannot be expressed:
as it is Psalm. 147. 18. <hi>He sendeth out
his word and melteth them, hee brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth
out his spirite, and the waters
flowe:</hi> he breatheth out his spirit whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the holy Ghost moueth vs to prayer,
and the waters flow, when the waters
trickle downe from our eyes: for as
a seething pot runneth ouer, so is an
holy hart in prayer. The Oliue tree
is most abundant in fruite when it is
distilled, and a Christian is most plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
and powerfull in prayer when
hee weepeth: whereupon King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
saith, <hi>I am as a greene Oliue tree
in the house of the Lord:</hi> and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
himselfe went often to the
<pb facs="tcp:3716:11"/>
mount of Oliues, where hee offered
vp prayers and supplications with
strong crying and teares: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee willeth vs also to haue faith
as a graint of mustered seed: now mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterd
seede you know makes the eyes
weepe, so that hee which in prayer
hath faith like a graine of musterde
seede, hath his eyes also as the fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pooles
of Heshbone: and there Christ
sayth as it is in Cantic. 4. 9.<note place="margin">Cant. 7. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast
wounded my heart with one of thine
eyes:</hi> it with one, then much more
with both. For as <hi>Synesius</hi> sayth in
his 67. epistle, weeping is more flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
more forcible to perswade God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and euen to wound his heart, then all
the eloquence, then all the Rhetorike
in the world. <hi>Cyprian</hi> sayth, <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
spiritus hominis aspirat, spiritus
Dei suspirat:</hi> When the spirit of man
sendeth out sighes in prayer, then the
spirit of God giueth grace. And <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
sayth, God lookes that we shuld
<pb facs="tcp:3716:11"/>
powre out our teares, that hee might
poure out his mercies: As <hi>Ezechias</hi>
lying ficke prayed, and praying tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
himselfe towardes the wall and
wept: and so with weeping as with
gunne shot hee battered downe that
partition wall which kept Gods cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
from him: therefore GOD
sayd to him, <hi>I haue heard thy prayers
and thy teares.</hi> A strange speech, I
haue heard thy prayers, that I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
well enough, but I haue heard
thy teares: what should bee the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this trow you? haue teares
tongues, or can they speake? yes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
I dare bee bold to speake it, the
thunder of the Almighty ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not make
such a mightie sound, such a noyse in
the eares of man, as the teares of man
doe in the eares of God, Psalm. 39. 12.
Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> both before he had
prayed, desired God to heare the voice
of his teares: and also after hee had
played, Psal. 6. 8. Hee thanked God,
<pb facs="tcp:3716:12"/>
because he had heard the voyce of his
weeping: for indeede hee also him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
saith of himselfe, Psalm. 109. I
mingled my drinke with weeping:
and where was this drinke of his but
in the cuppe of which hee saith in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place, <hi>I will take the cuppe of
saluation, and call vpon the name of
the Lord:</hi> and as <hi>Dauid</hi> mingled his
drinke with weeping, so he mingled
his prayer with weeping. Wherfore
as <hi>Elizeus</hi> cast salt into the waters of
Iericho, to make them sweet, so must
wee salt our prayers with teares to
make them sauorie and delightsome
to God. A man can neuer loue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
aright, if hee do not sometimes
weepe in repentance, nor his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
that doth not sometimes weepe
in preaching, nor God, that doth not
sometime weepe in prayer: so that
wee must not bee like the Stoickes
which were neuer moued, then wee
shall weepe too little, as this second
<pb facs="tcp:3716:12"/>
part sheweth: <hi>But weepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third parte is, <hi>VVeepe not but
weepe.</hi> Which noteth, seeing both
the excesse and defect are to be eschu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that therefore the true meane
which wee must keepe in weeping,
consisteth in this equal intermingling
of these two extremities. <hi>VVeepe not
but weepe,</hi> both together, weepe not
too much saith he, for that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie
to nature, but weepe too little is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to repentance, weepe not too
much, for that is contrarie to reason,
but weepe too little, is contrarie to
preaching; weepe not too much, for
that is contrarie to religion, but weep
too little is contrarie to prayer. Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> charged <hi>Timothie</hi> to be instant
in season &amp; out of season, first in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
then out of season, teaching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that that vnseasonable oportunitie
is better then seasonable importunitie,
yet to keepe a meane in exhorting,
that we must as well vse importunity
<pb facs="tcp:3716:13"/>
sometimes, so it bee in season, as to
slack an opportunitie alwaies, though
it be out of season. Euen so saith our
Sauiour here. <hi>VVeepe not, but weepe,</hi>
first, <hi>weepe not,</hi> then, <hi>but weepe:</hi>
teaching thereby, that not to weepe,
is better then to weepe, yet to keepe a
meane in weeping, that wee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in not weeping, weepe, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
in weeping not, weepe. For the
Apostle sayth, that they which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
must be as if they reioyced not:
and they that weepe, as though they
wept not. They which reioyce, must
bee as if they reioyced not, because
(sayth <hi>Gregorie,</hi> writing vpon the 27.
of <hi>Iob</hi>) all the ioy which the godlie
haue in this life, is as a sower grape
gathered out of time. And <hi>Ambrose</hi>
sayth, the children of God, not only in
sorrowe, but in ioy, shed teares, they
reioyce as though they reioyced not.
And they that weep must be as if they
wept not, because (saith <hi>Macarius</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:3716:13"/>
his 5. Homilie) euen teares are a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort
to the righteous. And <hi>Ambrose</hi> again:
to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are well affected, weeping
is a great delight, they weep as though
they wept not. Therefore as certaine
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly apples haue a sweetish sower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and some old wines haue a sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
sweetnes: so our sorrow must be
ioyfull, and our ioy sorrowfull: our
ioy must be sorrowful, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ
wept, there is a sorrowfull ioy: but
Christ wept vpon Palme Sunday,
there is a ioyfull sorrowe. For ioyfull
sorrowe: When the Israelites eate
the Paschall Lambe, there is a ioyfull
sorrowe: but they eate it with sower
hearbes, there is a sorrowful ioy. We
must bee as weeping, and yet alwayes
reioycing: and wee must be as reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
and yet alwaies weeping, and
ioyne both together, Weepe not, but
weepe. <hi>VVeepe not:</hi> This is a fierie
speech, as when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> sayth, Reu. 19.
11. That Christs eyes were as a flame
<pb facs="tcp:3716:14"/>
of fire, that is, subiect now to no wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:
<hi>But weep,</hi> this is a watery speech,
as when <hi>Dauid</hi> sayth, I water my
couch with my teares: so that if wee
could reconcile these two speeches
together, wee must reconcile fire and
water together. In <hi>Elias</hi> his sacrifice,
1. King. 18. 38. there was both fire and
water: so that the fire of the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
and licked vp the water of the
Altar. And assuredly, our sorrowfull
spirit will be a most acceptable sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to God, as <hi>Elias</hi> his sacrifice was,
if we haue both the fire of <hi>Aetna,</hi> &amp;
the water of <hi>Nylus:</hi> so that the ardent
fire of faith will well nigh consume,
and almost burne vp the flowing
streame of loue. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his 21.
booke <hi>De ciuit ate Dei, cap.</hi> 5. writeth,
that there is a fountaine in <hi>Epirus,</hi>
which not onely putteth foorth tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
that are lighten, but also lighteth
torches that are put out. <hi>Fulgentius</hi>
likewise doth report, that there is an
<pb facs="tcp:3716:14"/>
other fountaine in France with boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
much, casteth vp flames of fire.
The fountaine of teares which is in
our eyes, must bee like to these two
fountaines, as we may see Psal. 39. 2.
and 3. <hi>VVhen my sorrow was stirred,
my heart was hot within me:</hi> there is
the torch lightened. <hi>And while I was
musing the fire kindled. VVhen my so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
was stirred,</hi> there is the first fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<hi>my heart was hot within me,</hi>
there is the torch lightened, <hi>and while
I was musing,</hi> there is the other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<hi>the fire kindled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> there is the flame
burning. Whereupon one sayth fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Nec fluant oculi, nec siccent:</hi> Our
eyes must neither bee drowned, nor
drie: if they want fire, they will bee
drowned: if they want water, they
will be drie. Therfore, weepe not but
weepe: fire and water must goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that our eyes be neither drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
nor drie. And this is the right
moderation which we must keepe in
<pb facs="tcp:3716:15"/>
weeping, as appeareth in this third
part: <hi>VVeepe not, but weepe,</hi> both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>The fourth part followeth, <hi>for me,</hi>
not too much for my death, for the
death of Christ is the death of death,
the death of the diuell, the life of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and the life of mankind: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of all this, is innocencie and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
which maketh first, that as
the life of Christ is the life of life, so
the death of Christ is the death of
death. Therfore both before his death
he chalengeth and threatneth death,
saying, Oh death I will be thy death:
and also after his death hee derideth
&amp; scorneth death, Oh death thou art
a drone, where is now thy sting? Aske
death any of you I pray you, and say,
death howe hast thou lost thy sting?
how hast thou lost thy strength? what
is the matter that very children doe
now contemne thee, whereas Kings
&amp; euen tyrants did before feare thee?
<pb facs="tcp:3716:15"/>
Death will answere, that the onely
cause of this, is the death of Christ.
When a Bee stingeth a dead bodie
hee taketh no hurt, nor loseth his
sting: but stinging aliue bodie, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
loseth both his sting and his life
too: so death stinginge vs had no
harme, but kept his sting still, and
tooke hart of grace therby: but when
Christ the life of vs all had been once
stinged, the sting and strength of the
diuel was taken cleane away. Oh bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
king and Lord of all, who hast so
disarmed death that it can doe vs no
harme. Before, death was much like
a Bugbegger which they fray childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with, who being masked, iettes it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
vp and downe, and makes all the
people afraid of him, vntill such time
as some one lustie fellowe amongst
the rest, steps to him and takes a good
staffe &amp; cudgelleth him well fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly,
&amp; puls his vizarde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his face,
&amp; makes him knowne to the whole
<pb facs="tcp:3716:16"/>
world: and then whereas before lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
and tawle men were afraide of
him: now euery childe mockes him
and laugheth him to scorne, and stand
pointing at him. Oh Blessed Christ,
who by thy death hast thus dismasked
death. Christ was layd in the dust for
starke dead, and the diuell trampled
vpon him: but hee vpon Easter daie
started vp, and like a lyon of the tribe
of Iuda, he trampled the souldiers the
diuels apes vnder his seete: as apes at
the first play with the lyon and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,
still thinking them to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe,
vntill they trample and treade
him vnder their feete. As the Chame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon
spying a serpent sitting vnder a
tree, getteth vp into the same tree,
and letteth downe a fine thread out of
his mouth, smaller then the spiders
thread with a drop of blood at the
bottome, more cleere then any pearle,
which falling on the serpent killeth
him. So Christ like a Chameleon cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb facs="tcp:3716:16"/>
vp into the tree of his crosse,
and seeing the diuell that olde serpent
sitting vnder the tree, lets downe a
threade with blood at the bottome
thereof, more cleerer then any pearle,
the least drop whereof straight way
killeth the diuell. Christ standing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at the tree of his crosse, cloathed
himselfe in a blood red garment, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
when the diuell saw, he ranne swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against Christ with his hornes,
Christ perceiued him steppeth aside,
and so the diuell runneth his hornes
into Christ his crosse, and there they
stick fast. A dragon for a time may tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
ouer the Elephant, but at the
last the Elephant bringeth downe the
Dragon with him: so the diuell that
ancient dragon, may for a time bee
doing with Christ, but at the last hee
killeth him. He that felleth a tree vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the sunne shineth, may wel
cut the tree, but hee cannot hurt the
sunne: He that powreth water vpon
<pb facs="tcp:3716:17"/>
an iron that is red hotte, may well
quench the heate, but cannot hurt the
iron: so the diuell could not hurt the
sonne of righteousnes Christ Iesus:
and hot iron is too hard a morfell for
the diuell to digest. Those barbarous
people called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which feede

so the right <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the only deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of all mankind, death I meane, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of Christs flesh, by finding it not
to bee rawe but wholsome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
meate indeed, presently tooke
a surfet of it and within three dayes
dyed. For euen as when <hi>Iudas</hi> had
receiued a sop at Christs hands, anon
after, his bowels gushed out: In like
sort, death being so saucie as to snatch
a sop (as it were) of Christs flesh, and
a little bitte of his bodie, was by and
by like <hi>Iudas</hi> choaked and strangled
with it: and faine to yeelde it vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb facs="tcp:3716:17"/>
when Christ on Easter day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued.
Death (I wisse) had not been
brought vp so daintilie before, nor v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to such manner of meates, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
had his pray either with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
daughters, vpon the poyson
of sinne, or els with <hi>Noahs</hi> crow, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the carrion of corruption. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now (saith <hi>Fulgentius</hi>) death did
indeed taste of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but could not
swallow him vp, &amp; digest it. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise,
Christ as soone as hee had but
a little taste of death, eftsoone did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure
death, &amp; so the deat of Christ
by reason of righteousnes, is the death
of death. It is also the death of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
as the Apostle sayth, By his death
he did not onely ouercome death, but
him which had the power of death,
that is, the diuell.</p>
            <p>Diuers ancient Fathers note that the
Virgin Mary was maried, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
might be deceiued: for hee knew
well enought that Christ should bee
<pb facs="tcp:3716:18"/>
borne of a Virgin: but he neuer sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that blessed <hi>Mary</hi> was a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
considering she was bettothed to
<hi>Ioseph.</hi> Therefore hee did not lye in
waite, to destroy the seede of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
so as other wise he would, if he
had by a whoore or wife any such
thing: so that the birth of Christ did
cosen the diuell, but the death of
Chrsit did conquer the diuel, and that
much more gloriouslie when the
temple of his bodie was vpon the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of the crosse, then when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was vpon the pinacle of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
for when he was vpon the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
his words spake better things then
<hi>Salomon:</hi> but when he was vpon the
crosse, his bloud spake better things
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bloud of <hi>Abel:</hi> there his words
came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his lungs out of his mouth,
but here his bloud came from his hart
out of his side, and there hee fought
standing lustily to it, and withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
so then he would not throwe
<pb facs="tcp:3716:18"/>
down himself, but here he skirmished,
the diuel yeelding &amp; humbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the death of Christ, &amp; there the
diuell went vp vnto him vnto the top
of an high mountaine, &amp; so (as I may
saye) bad him lose at his owne gole:
but here Christ himselfe descended
into hell, and so spoyled principalities
and powers, and slew the great Leuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
in the very bottome of his owne
bottomlesse pit. For the diuell like a
greedie rauenous fish, nibbing at the
baite of Christs bodie, as <hi>Damascen</hi>
speaketh, was pearced through, and
twitched vp with the hooke of his
deitie. Hence it is that before Christs
passion, <hi>Peter</hi> tooke money out of a
fishes mouth to pay his tribute: and
also after Christ his passion, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
boyled a fish for him to feede
vpon: whereby we see that as Christ
made a fish paye tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> so
hee made the diuell also paye tribute
to death for him: and that the diuell
<pb facs="tcp:3716:19"/>
while he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about to catch the good
fish Iesus Christ, Gods sonne, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
(as the letters of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> seuerally
signifie) was himselfe caught, yea also
killed by Christ: so that all the while
our Sauiour was buried in the graue,
the diuell was boyled in hell. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as it was bootlesse for <hi>Goliah</hi> to
brandish his speare against <hi>Dauid:</hi> so
it little auailed the diuell, to shake the
speare likewise in the hand of the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
against the heart of Christ: For
as <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing heard <hi>Goliah</hi> prating
and talke his pleasure, yet when they
came to the poynt, at the first stroke
ouerthrewe him: so Christ with the
very same speare, which gaue him a
little venue in comparison, or but a
fillip on the side, which was soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
recured, gaue the diuell soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a deadly wound in his forehead,
which he shall neuer bee able to claw
off againe. And again, as <hi>Dauid</hi> hackt
off the Giants head with his owne
<pb facs="tcp:3716:19"/>
sword: so Christ wrested that shaking
sword out of the Cherubines hands,
and therewith chopt off the serpents
head: and so, the death of Christ by
reason of righteousnes, is the death of
the diuell. It is on the other side the
life of himselfe. That noble Eunuch
riding in his coach, read in <hi>Esay</hi> that
Christ was silent before his death, as
the lambe before the shearer: He saith
not, as a lambe before the butcher, but
before the shearer: insinuating, that
death did not kill Christ, but sheare
him a little. Neither yet had death
Christs fleece when he was shorne:
for Christ taking to him a sponge full
of vineger, Ioh. 19. 29. that was full of
our sharpe and sower sinnes, did giue
vs for it, purple wooll full of bloud,
Hebr. 9. 19. that is, full of his pure and
perfect iustice, and indeede the onely
liuerie which Christ our Lord and
master giueth to his seruants, is a coate
made of purple wooll. The iust (saith
<pb facs="tcp:3716:20"/>
               <hi>Dauid</hi>) shall florish like a palme tree:
Christ is that true <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that true palme
tree, who although he bare al the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
of sinne in the world vpon his
backe, yet then he doth most flourish
of all, euen as Camamile the more it is
trod vpon, the more it groweth and
florisheth. And as the palme tree hath
many weights aboue, &amp; many snakes
beneath, and yet may truely say of it
selfe, <hi>Nec premor, nec perimor:</hi> I am
neither by the weights of the bowes
ouermuch laden and pressed downe,
nor by the snakes below eaten vp, or
consumed: So Christ neither by the
weight of Gods wrath aboue, is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
nor by the heauines of our
sinnes, pressed downe: but like the
Swanne, singeth sweetest when his
death is neerest. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi>
sayth, that God giueth his snowe like
wooll: but we may turne the sentence
and say, that Christ giueth his wooll
like snowe. For as snow couereth the
<pb facs="tcp:3716:20"/>
ground, when it is rugged and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
so Christs coate without seame,
couereth our sinnes: and though they
were as crimson, yet maketh he them
white as snow. And as <hi>Gedeons</hi> fleece
when it was moyste, the earth was
drie, but when it was drie, the earth
was moyste, so when Christes fleece
was moyste as a greene tree, then
were all wee drie like rotten stickes:
but when Christ his fleece was drie,
(all the blood and water, being wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
out of his pretious side) then were
we moystened with his grace; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
seeing Christs fleece fell not to
deaths lotte when he was shorne, but
we haue it, who beleeue in him, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that neither death was the
better, nor Christ the worse, but as a
lambe is much more nimble and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
for shearing, so this shearing of
Christ was a kinde of quickning to
him, and only a trimming to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee ascended to his father, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3716:21"/>
was trimmed and powled before
he went to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Adam</hi> slept his side was
opened, when Christ died his side
was opened: <hi>Adams</hi> side being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
flesh and bone was taken out,
Christs side being opened, water and
blood was taken out. Of <hi>Adams</hi>
flesh and bone the woman was built,
of Christs water &amp; blood the church
is built: so the death of Christ is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els but the sleepe of <hi>Adam,</hi>
for as hee himselfe sayth of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
death, <hi>The damsell is not dead but
sleepeth:</hi> so he sayth of his own death,
<hi>I layd me downe to sleepe, and rose up
againe, for the Lorde susteined mee.</hi>
And in another place, when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saide to his sonne, <hi>Awake my
glorie, awake my lute and harpe?</hi> God
the Sonne answers to his Father, <hi>I
will awake right early.</hi> That vessell,
which <hi>Peter</hi> saw in a traunce, which
was let downe from heauen vnto the
<pb facs="tcp:3716:21"/>
earth, and knit to the foure corners,
and had all kind of beasts in it, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token
Christ: Christ came downe
from heauen vnto the earth, and his
glory is knit vp by the foure Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists:
and hee hath made Iewes and
Gentiles, yea, all nations one in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Now saith <hi>Cassianus,</hi> it is worth
the marking, which the spirit of God
sayth, Not that the vessell was a great
sheete, but like a great sheete: a sheete
may signifie either sleepe or death, but
neither was <hi>Peters</hi> vessell a sleepe,
though it were like a sheete: neither
was Christs bodie dead, though it
were lapt in a sheete: For wee our
selues cannot so properly bee sayd to
liue in our first birth, as in our second
birth: and Christ his life when hee
lay in the new wombe, in which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any other was conceiued, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to his life, when hee slept in a
new tombe, in whihc neuer any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was buried. Therefore as <hi>Iacob</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3716:22"/>
trauailing towards Haran, when hee
had layde stones vnder his head, and
taken a nap by the way after his tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
iourney; so Christ trauailing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
heauen, when hee had slept a
little in a stonie sepulchre, which was
hewen out of a rocke, liued yet most
princely after his painful passion. Tell
me, where did <hi>Ionas</hi> liue? in the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the ship, or in the bellie of the
whale? in the hatches of the shippe?
why? that was nothing, but to liue
in the bellie of the whale, when the
marriners were in danger vpon the
water, <hi>Ionas</hi> was most safe vnder the
water: this indeede was somewhat,
who euer sawe such a wonder? The
waues whereof, one while hoysted
vp to the highest clowdes, an other
while hurled downe to the neather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
depth: <hi>Ionas</hi> himselfe being all
this while in the very gulfe of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and yet not a haire the worse.
Christs case was the same: as <hi>Ionas</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3716:22"/>
was in the bellie of the whale three
dayes and three nightes: so, and so
long was the sonne of man in the
bowels of the earth, yet hee had no
more hurt then <hi>Ionas</hi> had. But he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
better vnder the earth, then wee
can vpon the earth: and he liued bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in death, then we doe in life. Tell
mee, where did <hi>Daniel</hi> liue? in the
kings court, or in the lyons den? in
the Kinges court? why? any man
might haue liued there, but to liue in
the lyons den, when the mouth of the
den was shut, and the mouthes of the
lyons open: this indeede was the life
of an Angell and no man. What king
could euer haue made lyons attende
and waite vpon him? yet here you
might haue seene <hi>Daniel</hi> sitting in the
middest of many hungry lyons, when
as the lyons lay downe at his feete
couching and crouching before him,
and adored their owne pray cast vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which otherwise they would
<pb facs="tcp:3716:23"/>
haue wooried, and being beastes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
men in humanitie towards this
Saint: seeing men became beastes in
crueltie against him. The same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was in Christ, Christs sepulchre
was sealed vp as well as <hi>Daniels</hi> den:
and hee sayth also of himselfe in a
Psal. <hi>My soule is amongst lyons:</hi> these
lyons were the terrours of death, and
horror of hell, yet he tooke no more
hurt then <hi>Daniel</hi> did, but brake the
chaynes into fitters, and the gates of
hell into shiuers, and then most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie
triumphed; and so the death
of Christ by reason of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is the life of himselfe. It is last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the life of man: when Christs
speare had opened the way of life,
which the cherubins sword stopped
vp: then sayth he, <hi>This day shalt thou
bee with me in paradise. Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eue</hi> both in one day were expelled
out of paradise: Christ and the theese
both in one day were receiued into
<pb facs="tcp:3716:23"/>
paradise, yea both in one houre: for
about noone, when the wind blew,
Gen. 3. 8. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
and so about the sixt houre
that is about twelue of the clocke in
the day time, Gen. 3. 44. vers. Christ
and the theese were receiued: Christ
saying vnto the theefe while hee did
draw him vp into paradise, Osea 11.
4. <hi>I draw thee with the cordes of man,
euen with bands of loue:</hi> but the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagints
translate the hebrue word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that is, with the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a man, as if he shuld say, I do so
deerely loue thee, that I am conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t my
selfe to bee destroyed, that thou maist
bee saued; my selfe to die, that thou
maist liue. I doe draw thee with the
destruction of a man, euen with ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
of loue: so that the theefe which saw
his own wounds, &amp; death in Christs
bodie, did see also Christs sauing
health, and life in his owne bodie, as
<hi>Alcuinus</hi> noteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sixt of <hi>Iohn,
<pb facs="tcp:3716:24"/>
Assumpsit vit a mortem, vt mors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciperet
vitam:</hi> when the liuing Lord
dyed, then the dying theefe liued. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
sayth the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in one
of his Psalmes: The breath of our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strilles
Christ the Lorde is taken in
our sinnes, to whom we sayd, Wee
shall liue in his shadowe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if Christ bee
the breath of our nostrilles, then hee
is our life: and againe, If wee liue in
his shadow, then we liue in his death,
for where there is breath in a shadow,
there is life in death.</p>
            <p>Now, as the ouershadowing of the
Holie ghost was the life of Christ; so
the ouershadowing of Christ, is the
life of man. And as <hi>Peters</hi> shadowe
gaue health to the sicke; so Christs
shadowe giueth life to the dead: yea a
thousand times rather Christs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Elias</hi> his spirit was doubled vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <hi>Elizeus,</hi> because <hi>Elias</hi> being aliue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
some to life: but <hi>Elizeus</hi> (as
<hi>Ierome</hi> sayth) being dead, raised vp
<pb facs="tcp:3716:24"/>
one from the dead. <hi>Peters</hi> spirit was
doubled vpon Christ, because <hi>Peter</hi>
being aliue, was a Phisition vnto the
liuing: but Christ (as <hi>Chryso stome</hi>
sayth) being dead, was a Phisition to
the dead: or rather indeede in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
there is no comparison: but as
<hi>Peters</hi> spirit, was a shadowe to Christ
his spirit, so <hi>Peters</hi> shadowe was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to Christs death. <hi>Arnobius</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
these words, <hi>Despise not the worke of
thine owne hands,</hi> writeth thus: We
are the worke of thy hands, seeing we
are thy workmanship. Now, because
the work of thy hands, was destroyed
by the worke of our hands, therefore
were thy hands nayled to the crosse
for our sins, that those hands of thine
might repaire the workes of thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
by the tree of the crosse, which was
destroyed by the tree of concupisce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:
thus farre he. Whereby we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the fruit of the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of good and euill, is euill, that is
<pb facs="tcp:3716:25"/>
death: but the fruite of the tree of the
crosse of Christ is life euerlasting.
And therefore as honey being found
in a dead lyon, the death of the lyon
was the sustenance of <hi>Sampson:</hi> so
<hi>Christi fel, nostrum mel:</hi> Christs gall
is our honey: and the bitter death of
Christ by reason of righteousnes, is
the sweete life of mankinde. When
<hi>Ezechias</hi> was sicke, the Sunne went
backwards: but that going backwards
of the Sun, was no hurt to <hi>Ezechias:</hi>
for thereby he had 15. yeares added
to his life: So the sunne of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
his going backwards was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for vs, though he was debased for
<hi>vs. Thou madest him lower then the
angels,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith: there the sunne
of righteousnes is lower ten degrees
then the angels, for our sakes. And in
another place: <hi>What is man that thou
art so mindfull of him, or the sonne of
man that thou so regardest him?</hi> There
he is ten degrees inferiour to man. A
<pb facs="tcp:3716:25"/>
liue dogge is better then a dead lyon:
there he is ten degrees lower then the
wormes. <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth that there
was a Diall set vp in <hi>Campus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
which was to continue 30. yeres,
wherby they might know the course
of the Sunne: yet (as he reporteth) it
did not agree with the Sunne for the
space of all those thirtie yeares. In the
death of Christ we might haue seene
such a Dial, the Sunne did not alwaies
agree with the Diall: the better for vs.
Christ is that tender Pellican, who by
wounding his owne breast, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
his owne to life againe by his
bloud. I came (sayth Christ) that men
might haue life, and that they might
haue life more aboundantly. What is
that more aboundantly? but only this,
that wee haue more life in the death
of Christ, then euer wee lost in the
death of <hi>Adam. O falix culpa quae ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
meruit redemptorem:</hi> Happie <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
(sayth <hi>Gregorie</hi>) that euer he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb facs="tcp:3716:26"/>
because that we by his sinne, haue
grace superabounding. As <hi>Peters</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
was but a shadowe to Christs spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
so <hi>Peters</hi> death was but a shadow
to Christs death: And as the death of
a lyon was the life of <hi>Sampson,</hi> so the
death of Christ is the life of man.
Thus you see that the death of Christ
is the death of death, the death of the
diuell, the life of himselfe, and the life
of man: and therefore he sayth in this
fourth parte, <hi>Not too much for my
death: For me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the fift part followeth: <hi>For
your selues:</hi> Not too little for your
owne life: for the life of man is the
life of death, the life of the diuell,
the death of himselfe, the death of
Christ: the reason of all this is iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and sinne, which euen in Christes
deare friends (sayth <hi>Bernard</hi>) is cast
downe, but not cast out. Therefore
though sinne cannot reigne in vs, yet
it will alwaies dwell in vs: for it is so
<pb facs="tcp:3716:26"/>
bred in our bones, that vntil our bones
bee with <hi>Iosephs</hi> bones carried out of
Egypt, that is, out of the world, sinne
cannot bee carried out of our bones.
One recordeth that the Romanes got
such a victorie ouer <hi>Chos<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oes,</hi> that he
made a law that neuer after any King
of Persia should euer warre against
the Romanes. Wee cannot possiblie
subdue sinne in such sort, but doe we
what wee can doe, sinne will alwaies
be a Iebusite, a borderer, yea a traytor,
rebelling against the spirit: which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the life of man to be (as <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
sayth) a debt as it were owing,
and due to death. For the diuell is the
father of sinne, and sinne is the mother
of death Hereupon S. <hi>Iames</hi> sayth:
Sinne when it is finished, trauelling
with childbirth (as I may say) bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
foorth death: For euen as a man
commeth into a house by a gate, so
death came into the world by sinne.
The corruption of our flesh did not
<pb facs="tcp:3716:27"/>
make our soules sinfull, but the sinne
of our soule made the flesh corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.
Whereupon <hi>Lactantius</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
sinne, <hi>Pabulu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> mortis,</hi> the reliefe
or the foode of death. As a fire goeth
out when al the fuell is spent, but bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
as long as that lasteth: so death
dyeth when sinne ceaseth: but where
sinne aboundeth, there death rageth.
The Prophet <hi>Abacucke</hi> sinning not,
death was so farre from him, that he
was able to flye without wings: but
King <hi>Asa</hi> sinning, death was so neere
to him, that hee was not able to
stand vpon his feet. Nay, you may see
this in one and the selfe same man,
<hi>Moses,</hi> who sinning not, death could
not meere with him in the bottome
of the red sea: but sinning, death did
seaze vpon him in the top of Mount
Nebo: so that the life of man, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of sinne, is the life of death. It is
also the life of the diuel. As one saith:
<hi>Tot crimina, tot daemona:</hi> euery man
<pb facs="tcp:3716:27"/>
hath as many diuels in him, as he hath
euils, euery sinne being sufficient to
maintaine a diuell. The godly finding
no ioy on earth, haue their conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in heauen: but Sathan finding no
ioy in hell, hath his conuersation on
earth. So that the earth is a hell vnto
vs, but a heauen to him. Here he hath
his liuing, as it was sayd in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>Thou shalt eate the dust of the
earth, all the daies of thy life.</hi> This dust
(sayth <hi>Macarius</hi>) is the diuels diet.
And therefore as a scalde curre wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
for a bone, so he goeth about
daily seeking whom he may deuour,
&amp; waiteth continually vntill the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shake off the dust of their feete, that
is, shaketh off some sinne which they
haue gotten by walking in the world,
that then he may lick it vp. It is meate
and drinke to him to see vs sinne: he
loues alife to see vs sinne, euen as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Cham</hi> did to see <hi>Noahs</hi> naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
And as flyes are alwaies flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="tcp:3716:28"/>
a sore place, and the oxe wil eate
the best grasse he can get: so the diuel
is as busie as he can to haue his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
vpon the best. So sayth <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact,</hi>
It is euen a sport or a pleasure to
Sathan, which is a sore or a paine to
man, especially if he be a godly man:
for the good Angels reioyce most
when one that is a sinner repenteth:
but euill Angels reioyce most when
one that is a penitent sinneth. If the
diuel cannot keepe a man from liuing
long, then he will hinder him from
liuing well. <hi>Aut impetrat morte, aut
impetit mores,</hi> sayth Zeo: If he cannot
kill a man, he will corrupt him. And
indeede hee taketh more pleasure in
corrupting one godly man, then in
killing an hundred wicked. He was
more delighted when <hi>Dauid</hi> slew <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi>
then when <hi>Saul</hi> killed himselfe:
when <hi>Peter</hi> denied Christ, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayed him: so that the life of
man, by reason of sinne, is the life of
<pb facs="tcp:3716:28"/>
the diuell. It is on the other side, the
death of himselfe. <hi>Oh miserable man
that I am, who shall deliuer me from
this bodie of death?</hi> The life of the
godly is a very bodie of death: but
there death is only a shadow of death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thales,</hi> being demanded what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
there is betweene life and
death, sayd, they are all one: then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked againe, if he had not rather
die then liue: no sayth he, for they are
all one: but <hi>Hierome</hi> sayth excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly,
they are not all one, <hi>Aliud est</hi> viuere
<hi>moriturus, aliud mori victurus:</hi> It is
one thing to liue in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of
death, an other thing to dye in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
hope of life. Therefore, Eccle.
7. 3. it is sayd, that the day of death is
better then the day of birth, for when
wee are borne, wee are mortall: but
when we are dead, we are immortall:
and wee are aliue in the wombe, to
dye in the world, but are dead in the
graue, to liue in heauen. Hence it is,
<pb facs="tcp:3716:29"/>
that the wicked are merrie at their
birth day, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> made a feast at
his birth day, Gen. 40. 20. when his
chiefe butler was hanged: and <hi>Herod</hi>
likewise made a feast at his birth day,
Matth. 14. 16. when <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>
was beheaded: but they are sorie
at their dying day, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was sorie
when he went about to hang himself,
and <hi>Caine</hi> was afraide that euery one
that met him in the streetes would
haue killed him. Contrariwise, the
godly are sorie at their birth day, as
<hi>Iob</hi> was, Iob 3. vers. 3. <hi>Let the day pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
wherein I was borne:</hi> and <hi>I eremy</hi>
sayth, Ierem. 20. 14. <hi>Let not the day
wherein my mother bare me be blessed:</hi>
but they are merie at their dying day
<hi>as Simeon was, Lord now lettest thou
thy seruant depart in peace:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>
sayth, <hi>I desire to be dissolued, and to be
with Christ.</hi> For wheras there be two
wayes, the one hauing in it first a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorie
death, then an eternall life: the
<pb facs="tcp:3716:29"/>
wicked chuse rather to liue for a
time, though they dye for it eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hereafter: but the godly chuse to
haue their life hid with Christ here,
that they may liue with Christ eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
hereafter: therefore, the wicked
neuer thinke of death, but the godly
thinke of nothing else. As <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Monarke of the world, had all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things saue onely a sepulchre to
burie him in when hee was dead, hee
neuer thought of it: But <hi>Abraham</hi>
the heire of the world, had no other
proper possession, but onely a fielde
which hee buried his dead in, hee
thought of nothing els. We read that
<hi>Dantel</hi> strowed ashes in the Temple,
to descry the footsteps of <hi>Baals</hi> priests
which did eate vp their meate: so did</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham,</hi> he strowed ashes in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of death, saying: <hi>I will speake
vnto my Lorde though I bee but dust
and ashes:</hi> that so continually seeing
and marking the footsteps of death,
<pb facs="tcp:3716:30"/>
how it doth dayly eate and consume
their bodies, they may bee alwaies
prepared for it. Our first father made
himselfe clothes of figge leaues, but
God misliking that, gaue him gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of skinne, Gene. 3. 21. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ in the Gospell cursed the
figge tree, which did leaue only leaues
to couer our sinne, but commended
the <hi>Baptist,</hi> who did were skinne to
discouer our mortalitie: For not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, <hi>Vita morbus,</hi>
our whole life is a disease: but also as
<hi>Bernard</hi> sayth, <hi>Vita mors,</hi> The life of
man by reason of sinne is the death of
himselfe. It is lastly the death of
Christ: when Christ was crucified,
at first he was (as the Prophet sayth)
broken for our sinnes, according to
that of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> Sinne it was that
brought the Son of God to his death,
the Iewes were only instruments and
accessaries to it; sinne was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall:
they cried, crucifie him in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3716:30"/>
court: but our sinnes cried, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
him in the court of heane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now
as the death of Christ is sufficient to
saue the wicked, so the sinnes of the
wicked were not sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
Christ. But the scripture saith
of them which either are not, or at
most would but seeme to bee godly,
they say they knowe GGD, but by
their works they deny him, and <hi>Saul,
Saul,</hi> why persecutest thou me? And
they crucifie vnto themselues againe
the Sonne of God, therefore our sins
did at the first crucifie Christ: and
now also the wicked which are not
of his bodie, but wee which are his
members, we I say do yet oftentimes
by our sinnes crucifie Christ with the
Iewes. Yea, I will say more if you
will heare mee, wee crucifie Christ
farre more cruelly then the Iewes
did, then his bodie was lassible and
mortall, nowe it is glorified and
immortall. They knewe not what
<pb facs="tcp:3716:31"/>
they did, we know well enough: they
pearced him with a speare, we pearce
him with reproches: they buried him
in the earth, we burie him in obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Wherfore, let euery one as soone
as hee is tempted to any sinne, thinke
straightwaye that hee seeth Christ
comming towardes him, wrapt vp in
white linnen clothes, as he was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with a kercher round about his
head, crying after a gastly and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
manner: Beware, take heed what
you doe: detest sinne, adhorre sinne,
fie vpon it, a shame light on it, it did
once most vilely and villanously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me: But now seeing my wounds
are whole, doe not I beseech you, do
not rub and reuiue them againe with
your sinnes, to make them bleede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh.
Now, seeing that the scepter of
the kingdome of heauen is put into
my hands, doe not offer me againe a
reede to mocke me. Now seeing my
head is crowned with pure golde of
<pb facs="tcp:3716:31"/>
eternall glorie, doe not set a crowne
of thornes vpon it againe: Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that I am installed on the right
hande of the throne of maiestie, doe
not pull mee out of my throne, and
throwe me into the graue againe, and
with your sinnes seale a mighty stone
vpon me to presse me, and keepe me
downe in death. This I assure you
will be a forcible meanes to afray and
terrifie vs from sinnes, if we consider
that the life of man by reason of sinne
is the death of Christ: and therefore
hee sayth in this fifth parte, <hi>Not too
little for your owne life. For your
selues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sixt part is next, which noteth,
seeing both the excesse and the want
is to bee eschewed, therefore the true
meane which we must keep between
Christ and our selues, consisteth in a
certaine qualification of these two
extremities, <hi>For me: For your selues,</hi>
both together. Weepe not too much
<pb facs="tcp:3716:32"/>
(sayth he) for my death, which is the
death of death: weepe not too little
for your owne life, which is the life
of death: not too much for my death,
which is the death of the diuell: not
too little for your owne life, which is
the life of the diuell: Not too much
for my death, which is my life: not
too little for your owne life, which is
your death: not too much for my
death, which is the life of man: not
too little for your owne life, which is
the death of Christ. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the Corinths to approue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
by honour and dishonour: first
by honour, then by dishonour: teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby, that dishonorable honour
is better then honorable dishonour.
Yet to keepe a meane in this matter,
that we must as well count it our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
sometimes to bee dishonoured
with Christ, as a dishonour to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
honored without Christ. Puen
so sayth our Sauiour here, <hi>For me, for
<pb facs="tcp:3716:32"/>
your selues.</hi> First, <hi>for me,</hi> then <hi>for your
selues:</hi> teaching therby that to reioyce
for Christ, is better then to weepe for
our selues, yet to keepe a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
both, that wee must as well
sometimes descend out of Christ, as
our selues to weepe: as alwaies ascend
out of our selues, into Christ to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce.
For the Apostle sayth, <hi>Reioyce
with them that reioyce,</hi> so, <hi>weepe with
them that weepe:</hi> If my friend be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
sorrowfull, and neuer ioyfull,
he hath no pleasure by me: if he bee
alwaies ioyfull, and neuer sorrowfull,
I haue no proofe of him, but hee is
my deerest friend most delighted in
me, most approued by me, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
such part as I doe, sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing,
and sometimes weeping, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing
when I reioyce, and weeping
when I weepe: the like is to be seene
in this place, <hi>For me, for your selues.</hi>
If a Christian alwaies thinketh of
his owne miserie, &amp; neuer of Christs
<pb facs="tcp:3716:33"/>
mercie, he will despaire: if he alwaies
thinketh of Christs mercie, &amp; neuer
of his owne miserie, he wil presume:
but he is the best christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so high that
he cannot despaire, and so low that he
cannot presume, who inclines aswell
to the one, as to the other, sometimes
reioycing, and sometimes weeping:
reioycing for Christ, and weeping
for himselfe. Therefore as in a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
if there bee any oddes in the
scales, we take out of that which is in
the heauier, and put it to that which
is in the lighter, vntill there be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene them: so here wee
must weigh these matters well, that
we may bee iust weight, neither too
heauie for our owne miserie, nor too
light for Gods mercie. <hi>Dauid</hi> sayth,
<hi>Hide me O Lord vnder the shadowe of
thy wings:</hi> not vnder the shadowe of
thy wing, but of thy wings: of thy
right wing of mercie by loue, and the
left wing of thy iudgement by feare.
<pb facs="tcp:3716:33"/>
As God hath two wings, the one of
mercie, the other of iustice: so wee
must haue two wings, one of ioye for
God, and the other of despaire for our
selues. And as the Quaile flying ouer
the sea, seeing her selfe not able to
hold out, spreadeth out her wings &amp;
falleth into the sea, and layeth one of
her wings vpon the water, and lifteth
vp the other wing vnto heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so we
must flye with the wings of ioy, from
ioy in GOD, with the wings of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,
vnto despaire in our selues. Lest
we should presume, we must go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
for feare: and yet lest we should
despayre, wee must goe forwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God with loue. As God doth
couer vs with his two wings, the one
of iustice, the other of loue: so wee
must couer GOD with our two
wings, the one of feare, the other of
ioy. We must iumpe forwards vnto
God, and backwards againe vnto our
selues, which is <hi>Iobs</hi> crosse leape. The
<pb facs="tcp:3716:34"/>
sinne of man is the death of life. <hi>For
me,</hi> (sayth he) I am the death of death:
therfore despayre not. <hi>For your selues,</hi>
you are the life of death: therefore
presume not. <hi>For me:</hi> I am the death
of the diuell, therefore despayre not:
<hi>For your selues,</hi> you are the life of the
diuell, therefore presume not: <hi>For me,</hi>
I am the life of my selfe, therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spayre
not: <hi>For your selues,</hi> you are
the death of your selues, therfore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
not: <hi>For mee,</hi> I am the life of
man, therefore despayre not: <hi>For your
selues,</hi> you are the death of Christ,
therefore presume not: <hi>For me</hi> (sayth
he) death is onely dead, and not aliue:
dead in me, and not aliue in you: <hi>For
your selues,</hi> death is both dead and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue;
dead in me, aliue in you. <hi>For me,</hi>
I am onely aliue, and not dead; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue
in my selfe, and not dead in you:
<hi>For me,</hi> you are onely aliue, and not
dead; aliue in me, &amp; not dead in your
selues: <hi>For your selues,</hi> you are both
<pb facs="tcp:3716:34"/>
aliue and dead; aliue in me, and dead
in your selues. The worst foes that
we haue, are the diuell and death: the
best friends wee can haue, are Christ
and our selues: the death of Christ
killeth those foes, &amp; quickeneth those
friends: the life of man quickeneth
those foes, and killeth those friends.
It is much that the death of Christ
killeth death, more that it killeth the
diuell, most of all that it killeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al that it killeth Christ.
Wherefore wee must not loose any
one of these weights: but when wee
weigh the reasons why wee must
weepe for our selues, we shall finde as
great cause of ioy in God, great cause
of sorrowe in our selues, farre greater
cause of ioy in Christ, greater cause of
sorrowe in our selues, farre greatest
cause of ioy in Christ, greatest cause
of sorow in our selues: for that which
is more then all to make vs ioyfull in
Christ, that is more then all to make
<pb facs="tcp:3716:35"/>
vs sorrowfull in our selues. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
of Christ is the death of
death, great cause of ioy in Christ.
<hi>Debora</hi> reioyced when <hi>Barake</hi> put
<hi>Sisera</hi> to flight: haue not we as great
cause to reioyce, seeing taht Christ
hath put death to flight? The sinne of
man is the life of death, a great cause
of sorrowe in our selues. If <hi>Anna</hi>
wept for her barrennes, haue not wee
as great cause to weepe, seeing we can
conceaue nothing but sorrowe, and
bring forth iniquitie vnto death? The
righteousnes of Christ is the death of
the diuel, great cause of ioy in Christ.
If <hi>Iudith</hi> reioyced when she cut off
the head of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> haue not wee
greater cause to reioyce, seeing Christ
hath cut off the head of the diuell?
The sinne of man is the life of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
greater cause of sorrowe in our
selues. It <hi>Thamar</hi> wept being deflou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by her brother, haue not we grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cause to weepe, committing daily
<pb facs="tcp:3716:35"/>
spirituall adulterie with the diuell?
The righteousnes of Christ is the life
of himselfe, greatest cause of ioye in
Christ. If <hi>Sarah</hi> laughed when shee
should haue a quick child in her dead
wombe, is not this the greatest cause
of laughter that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be to vs, that Christ
liued in death, and could not see cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
in the graue? The sinne of
man is the death of himselfe; greatest
cause of sorrowe in himselfe. If <hi>Agar</hi>
wept being pulled out of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
house; is not this the greatest cause of
weeping that can be vnto vs, that we
are here pilgrimes, and strangers from
our fathers house in heauen? The
righteousnes of Christ is the life of
man; this is more then all, to make vs
ioyfull in Christ. If Queene <hi>Hester</hi>
did reioyce, (as Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
doth at this day, whom God long
saue and preserue) because she deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her people from thraldome, and
destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; can any thing in the world
<pb facs="tcp:3716:36"/>
then make vs more ioyfull, then this,
that we being cursed in our selues, are
blessed in Christ; being embased in
our selues, are exalted in Christ; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
condemned in our selues, are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
in Christ; being dead in our
selues, are aliue in Christ. The sinne
of man is the death of Christ: this is
more then all, to make vs sorrowfull
in our selues. If the Virgine <hi>Mary</hi>
wept so sore for the death of her son
<hi>Iesus,</hi> as it her soule had been pearced
thorowe with a sword, (as <hi>Simeon</hi>
speaketh) can any thing in the world
then make vs more sorrowfull then
this, that Christ being blessed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
was cursed for vs; being exalted
in himselfe, was abased for vs; being
iustified in himselfe, was condemned
for vs; being aliue in himselfe, was
dead for vs. Oh deare brother, if thou
bee sorrowfull at any time, remember
what Christ hath done for thee, and
thou wilt soone be glad: if thou bee
<pb facs="tcp:3716:36"/>
ioyfull at any time, remember what
thou hast done against Christ, &amp; thou
wilt soone be sorrowfull: so shall we
neuer suffer shipwrack of faith, either
by too much sorow, as <hi>Esau</hi> did, who
sought the blessing with teares, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
for himselfe, not reioycing in
Christ: or els by too much ioye, as
<hi>Herod</hi> did, who heard <hi>Iohn</hi> gladlie,
reioycing for Christ, not weeping for
himselfe. But as a ship, being neither
too heauily burdened, not too lightly
ballased, feareth neither windes nor
waues, but saileth safely to the hauen:
so wee being neither too heauie for
our selues, nor too light for Christ,
but reioycing <hi>For me, for your selues,</hi>
both together, shall neither bee drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the waues of desperation, nor
puffed vp with the windes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption:
but we shall liue safelie in
the Arke of <hi>Noah</hi> vpon the sea of this
world, vntill we arriue at the hauen of
all happines in heauen. And this is the

right moderation which wee must
keepe betweene Christ &amp; our selues,
as appeareth in this sixt part, <hi>For me,
for your selues,</hi> both together.</p>
            <p>The seuenth part followeth, <hi>Weepe
not for me,</hi> wherein wee must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
three things: that is, three vertues
that were in Christ: First, his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<hi>VVeepe not:</hi> secondly, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitie,
<hi>Not you:</hi> thirdly, his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie,
<hi>Not for me.</hi> Wisedome
in his instruction appeareth, in that
he teacheth vs how we should bee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
towardes the dead: for if wee
must not weepe inordinately for the
death of Christ, then wee must not
trouble our selues greatly for the
death of any Christian. Indeed wee
may weepe for the wicked, not onely
when they are dead, but euen when
they are aliue: but wee must reioyce
for the godly, not onely when they
are aliue, but when they are dead: and
why? because the wicked being aliue
<pb facs="tcp:3716:38"/>
are dead: but the godly being dead,
are aliue. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> when his
sonne <hi>Absolon</hi> dyed, whom he knew
to bee a wicked man, wept for him,
saying, <hi>Absolon my sonne, O my sonne
Absolon, would to God I had dyed
for thee?</hi> but when his young sonne
dyed, whom he knew to be an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
he was well apaid, and rose from
the ground, and anoynted his face,
and sayd, <hi>I shall goe to him, he cannot
returne to me:</hi> wherby he warranteth
that of <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> who sayth, that the
godly deceased are not <hi>amissi,</hi> but
<hi>praemissi,</hi> not lost for euer, but left for
a time: not gone away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, but se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to
God before vs. For if it be true which
<hi>Ignatius</hi> sayth, that life without
Christ is death: then this is true also,
that death which is in Christ, is life:
and what need we then weare blacke
mourning clothes in signe of sorrow,
seeing they weare long white robes
in token of triumph? The Athenians
<pb facs="tcp:3716:39"/>
had a lawe giuen them by <hi>Solon,</hi>
which did forbid mourning &amp; wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at funerals, sayth <hi>Chrysostme:</hi>
it beseemeth vs rather to reioyce
then to weepe for the departure of
the righteous: and <hi>Ierome</hi> sayth, we
may weepe for them, because they
are not with vs, but wee must not
weepe for them, because they are with
God: For <hi>Isidorus</hi> sayth, <hi>Charitas
plorare iubet, sed piet as lugere vetat:</hi>
Though loue commands vs, yet faith
forbids vs to weepe for the dead:
therefore <hi>Paulinus</hi> sayth, <hi>Salua fide,</hi>
though wee may notwithstanding
our faith, performe al dueties of loue,
yet wee must first notwithstanding
our loue, enioy the comforts of faith.
So if we shed some few teares which
runne softly like the waters of Silo:
no force sayth <hi>Ambrose,</hi> they will
not bewray in vs any want of faith,
but onely testifie abundance of loue:
thus and no otherwise did <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3716:39"/>
weepe for <hi>Sarai</hi> his wife, <hi>Rebecca</hi> for
<hi>Debora</hi> her nurse, <hi>Berseba</hi> for <hi>Vrias</hi>
her huskand, Christ for <hi>Lazarus</hi> his
friend. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, that Christ
hanging vpon the crosse, taught vs a
many of excellent lessons, and one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest was, how wee should
behaue our selues towardes our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that are departed out of this life:
and it is amplified out of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues,
and also shewed by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
and the Ephesians, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of <hi>Elias</hi> that the dead must
not bee carried to the graue with
mourning, but with singing; &amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wonderfull wisedome he sheweth
how sparing we ought to be in wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
for the death of our godly frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,
considering their good happe, and
our good hope. In that hee sayth,
<hi>VVeepe not for me:</hi> 2. his benignitie,
not you: All his intollerable troubles
nothing troubled him so much as
that his friends were troubled for his
<pb facs="tcp:3716:40"/>
troubles: and yet (as it should seeme)
they had great reason thus to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
All the people wept for <hi>Moyses</hi>
death, all Egypt for <hi>Iosephs</hi> death, all
Israel for <hi>Iosias</hi> death, all the Church
for <hi>Steuens</hi> death: but a million of
<hi>Moyses,</hi> of <hi>Iosephs,</hi> of <hi>Iosias,</hi> of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens</hi>
are not comparable to Christ.
The women of Troy lamented the
death of worthy <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctor,</hi> making this
the foote of their dolefull dittie, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctora flemus:</hi>
howe much more then
might these women of Ierusalem la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
the death of their captaine Christ?
Al the widdowes lamented the death
of <hi>Dorcas</hi> because in her life time
she had made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such fine clothes &amp;
garments: and had not these women
then farre greater cause to lament the
death of Christ, who made euery one
of them a wedding garment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee did marrie them to himselfe?
Ye daughters of Israell (sayth <hi>Dauid</hi>)
weepe for <hi>Saul,</hi> who hath clothed
<pb facs="tcp:3716:40"/>
you with scarlet: how much more
then ought these daughters of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
to weepe for Christ, who clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
euery one of them with the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
robe of righteousnes? yea and gaue
his owne deare self for them, that
they might put on the Lord Iesus.
When Christ was borne, the night
was turned into day as it was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied,
Psal. 139. 12. <hi>Then shall the night
shine as the day.</hi> But when Christ was
crucified, the day was turned into
night, as it was prophecied, Amos 8. 7
<hi>Then shall the sun goe downe at noone
day.</hi> The sunne therefore wept for
Christ. As <hi>Hamons</hi> face was couered
when he was condemned to dye; so
the sunnes face was couered, when
Christ was condemned to dye. The
temple also wept for Christ. As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
rent his garment, when he heard
of <hi>Ionathans</hi> death; so the temple rent
his vayle, when it heard of Christs
death. The graues like wise wept for
<pb facs="tcp:3716:41"/>
Christ: as the King of Niniue threw
vp dust vpon his head when the citie
was appoynted to dye; so the graues
threw vp dust vpon their heads, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Christ was appoynted to dye. Lastly,
the stones wept for Christ: as <hi>Iob</hi> cut
off his haire when hee heard of his
childrens death; so the stones were
cut in peeces and cloue asunder when
they heard of Christs death. An asse
carrying Christ to Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
cryed <hi>Hosanna:</hi> Christ carrying
his crosse out of Ierusalem, the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
cryed <hi>Halaluiah:</hi> so if these children
had held their peace, and not sung, the
very stones would haue sung out the
praises of Christ: If these women had
held their peace, and not cried, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
stones would haue cryed for the
death of Christ: or rather indeede, as
soone as euer these women lest cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because Christ bad them, the
stones straight waies fell a crying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ bad them. And what hart
<pb facs="tcp:3716:41"/>
of man could then haue refrayned
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weeping, though it had bin harder
then any stone, seeing the hard stones
before his eyes, dissolued and distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into teares? Yet behold the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
kindnes of Christ, Christ dyed
not for the stones, not for the temple,
nor for the graues; but for vs men and
for our sinnes he dyed: yet he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
those dead and senceles creatures
to weepe, and to haue a liuely feeling
of his death, though they had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of his death: But being content
himselfe to shed his own heart bloud
for vs, yet will not suffer vs in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
to shed so much as one little
teare for him, in that he sayth, <hi>Weepe
not for me.</hi> Thirdly and lastly, his
magnanimitie, in that he sayth, <hi>Not
for me,</hi> appeared in that, holding now
in his hand, the cup of trembling, and
being readie to drinke of the verie
dregges of it, yet neither his hand, nor
his heart trembled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3716:42"/>
               <hi>Ennius</hi> the poet could say, <hi>Nemo
me lachrymis decoret, nec funera
fletu,</hi> Let no man weep for my death:
and Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> the Martyr, (as
<hi>Prudentius</hi> testifieth) sayth, <hi>Desinite
discessu meo fletus dolenter fundere,</hi>
Do not weepe for my departure: but
as <hi>Ennius,</hi> or any other Pagan, could
neuer come neere Christians in true
magnanimitie, so Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> or
any christian could neuer come neere
Christ. <hi>Paul</hi> of any I heard of, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
neerest him going towardes Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:
what doe ye (sayth he) wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and breaking my heart? for I am
readie not onely to bee bound, but to
dye for the name of the Lorde Iesus
Christ. Euen so sayth Christ here, or
rather indeede not so, but a thousand
times more couragiously: going out
of Ierusalem, what doe you (sayth
he) weeping and breaking my heart?
for I am readie not to bee bound, but
to dye for the saluation of man. Hee
<pb facs="tcp:3716:42"/>
knewe well enough that his passion
would be a new kind of transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vnto him, for at his transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hee was accompanied with his
Disciples, <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi>
but at his passion <hi>Peter</hi> denied him,
<hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> forsooke him: there
he was vpon mount Tabor, which
smelled sweetly of hearbes and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
but here hee was vpon mount
Caluarie, which smelled lothsomely
of bones and dead mens sculles: and
there his face did shine as the sunne,
but here his face was buffeted and
spit vpon: &amp; then his garments were
white as the light; but here his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were parted, and hee himselfe
whipped starke naked: and there he
was between two famous Prophets,
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> but here hee was
betweene two theeues, the one on his
right hand, the other vpon his left:
and there his Father spake ioyfully
to him from heauen, <hi>This is my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:3716:43"/>
sonne:</hi> but here hee schriched la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably
vnto his Father from the
crosse, <hi>My God, my GOD, why hast
thou forsaken mee?</hi> Yet beholde the
magnanimitie of Christ, Christ knew
well enough before hande of this
whole passion prepared for him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as hee was not transfigured as before,
bt disgraced so as neuer was any man,
yet nothing could moue him. Oh
worthy resolution, the like whereof
was neuer hearde of before! This
fearefulnes of his Disciples, this noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenes
of the place, the buffets, the
nakednes, those theeues, those schri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
could not a whit daunt his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roycal
hart: but euen as a noble cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hauing alreadie had a legge and an
arme slasht off, when all the stage in
admiration of his valoure and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode,
cries, saue the man, saue the
man: yet puts out himselfe, and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vpon one leg, and striking with
one arme, fighteth still as stoutly as if
<pb facs="tcp:3716:43"/>
he had not beene hurt at all: so Christ
hauing beene scourged and scorned
alreadie, when the whole centre of
heauen and earth wept for him: yea,
when the powers aboue the heauens
came downe, and the dead vnder the
the earth, rose vp to moane and pittie
him: onely hee himselfe would aske
no fauour of others, nor shew fauour
to himselfe, but was very angrie with
them, that gaue him such counsell.</p>
            <p>And though all the Saintes in
heauen and earth, did bleede at the
very heart, in a manner, euen as much
as hee himselfe did being vpon the
crosse, to see so good a man to be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised:
yet nothing would stay him,
but still he went on forwarde as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
and cheerefully, as to any ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
or feast, to that most ruthfull and
dreadfull death. Thus you see in this
seuenth part: the wisedome, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitie,
&amp; magnanimitie of Christ,
in that he sayth, <hi>VVeepe not for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3716:44"/>The eight parte, which is the last,
now onely remaineth. <hi>But weepe for
your selues:</hi> wherein we must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
likewise three vertues that ought
to be in vs: First, deuotion: secondly,
compunction: thirdly, compassion.
First, deuotion in weeping for this
life: secondly, compunction in wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at the heart: thirdly, compassion
in weeping for our owne life: First,
for deuotion. A man may be sayd to
be deuout in prayer, to be deuout in
speaking, &amp; to be deuout in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
deuout in thanksgiuing: but we
vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which causeth
vs to breake forth into teares, and in
weeping for our selues, we must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout:
wee must perswade our selues,
that we are out of our own cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, &amp;
that the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which we possesse not
yet, is the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie which we shuld de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
If Christ wish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here,
to weep for themselues, and did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
elsewhere weepe for Ierusalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:3716:44"/>
saying: <hi>Oh Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how oft
would I, &amp;c. but you would not:</hi> how
much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought we to weep for
this life? They of Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were
caried captiue into Babylon, endured
threescore and tenne yeares: nowe
iust so long lasteth our life, as the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
sayth. And so by this account,
our whole life is nothing else but the
captiuitie of Babylon: therefore wee
may well say, <hi>By the waters of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
we sate downe and wept, when we
remembred thee Oh Sion:</hi> and Psalm.
42. <hi>My teares haue been my meate day
and night, while they sayd to me, where
is nowe thy GOD?</hi> And in another
place, <hi>VVoe is me that I am constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to dwell with Mesech, &amp; to haue
my habitation among the tents of Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar.</hi>
Ierusalem was once finally sackt
by <hi>Titus and Vespasian,</hi> whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
an infinite number that were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
spoyled, ten hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men, tenne hundred thousande
<pb facs="tcp:3716:45"/>
men I say, were slaine downe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(as <hi>Iosephus</hi> a Greeke writer, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesipphus</hi>
an Hebrue writer testifieth.
But that which happened once to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
happeneth dayly to vs: wee dye day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
our whole life is nothing else but
such a fooyle and sackage: &amp; among
all the miseries of this life, nothing is
more miserable then this life it selfe?
So that the onely happines wee can
haue in this life, is a true and a godly
bewayling of our vnhappines: which
made our Sauiour say, <hi>VVoe be vnto
you which laugh now, for you shal weep:</hi>
but on the other side, <hi>Blessed are they
that mourne, for they shall bee comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi>
Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> desired God to
spare him a little, and let him liue a
while longer. Wherefore? that hee
might laugh, and that hee might bee
merrie? No sayth he, but <hi>Vt plangam
delorem meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> that I might weepe for
my wo &amp; grief: he thought, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
could not haue time enough in this
<pb facs="tcp:3716:45"/>
life, though it were neuer so long, to
lament &amp; rue the miseries of this life,
though it were neuer so short. For as it
is, Rom. 8. 22. If euery creature do sigh
and groane in it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the verie earth
which wee haue vnder out feete doe
mourne and pine away for sorow, for
the heauie burden of our sins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it is almost weakened and prest
down to hel; how much more ought
we, hauing the first fruits of the spirit,
to haue true deuotion in weeping, for
this life, according to this, <hi>But weepe
for your selues.</hi> Secondly, compuctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>frango:</hi> as if he should
haue sayd, <hi>Scindatur vena cordis:</hi>
Breake your hearts for sorrowe. And
this is the cause why <hi>Dauid</hi> sayth, <hi>I
haue rored for the very disquietnes of
my hart.</hi> And therefore followes <hi>Pauls</hi>
conuersion of the Christians in the
Acts of the Apostles, who cryed out
in the veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of their spirits, <hi>Men
and brethren, what shall we doe?</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:3716:46"/>
this compunction in weeping at the
heart, is commaunded, Psalm. 4. 5. For
whereas wee commonly reade it, <hi>In
your chambers and be still,</hi> or bee still
in your chambers: the <hi>Septuagints</hi>
expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, Haue compunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in your
chambers: whereby they signifie to be
pricked to the quicke, vntill the bloud
followe againe: and by chambers, in
that place, our hearts is ment. As, <hi>When
thou prayest, enter into thy chamber:</hi>
that is, into the silence and secrecie of
thy heart: for that hauing compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in your chambers, is as much as
if he should haue sayd, bleed inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the heart. Our teares must not be
Crocodiles teares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as there is pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the teeth outward, so there
is weeping from the eyes outward: as
<hi>Bernard</hi> saith, We must be let bloud,
and haue a veine opened with the
launce of compu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ction. And this veine
(sayth <hi>Fulgentius)</hi> must not be <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
sed cordis:</hi> must not bee the liuer
<pb facs="tcp:3716:46"/>
veine, or any such like, but the heart
veine onely. Whereupon (sayth <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid)
My heart droppeth,</hi> Psal. 129. 28.
Not that his heart dropped indeede,
but because the teares which he shed,
were not drops of water, such as may
bee easily forced, comming from the
eyes, but drops of bloud, such as christ
did sweate, issuing from the heart.
These indeede are true teares (sayth
<hi>Austin)</hi> which are the bloud of a
wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded heart: So that the heart must
first be rent, and deeply wounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the eye can weepe. But if once
our sinnes fall vpon vs like theeues,
and wound vs at the heart, and leaue
vs halfe dead, and make vs powere out
the bloud of true teares, then by &amp; by
will Christ powre in the wine and
oyle of gladnesse. For sayth <hi>Ierome,</hi>
speaking of this compu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ction, <hi>Vngit,
non pungit:</hi> These wounds doe not
hurt vs, but heale vs. Which we may
see in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> so long as his heart was
<pb facs="tcp:3716:47"/>
hardened, &amp; seared with an hot iron,
he playd the wild colt, (as I may say)
without any griefe or remorse, kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against the prickes: but when it
pleased God to take out of his breast
that stonie heart (as the Prophet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth)
and to giue him an heart of flesh
for it, the only one pricke of the flesh,
the sting of concupiscence, was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
alone to tame him, and humble
him, and rule him aright. For euen as
a bladder, if it be pricked, all the wind
voyds out of it: so <hi>Paul</hi> his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pricked, and bleeding continually
for his sinnes, was freed of all concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednes
of all vanitie and pride. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the men of Iudea and Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
were pricked at their hearts, Act.
2. 37. so must we haue true compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
in bleeding and weeping at the
heart: alluding to this, <hi>But weepe for
your selues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, wee must haue compassion
in weeping for our owne life. Indeed
<pb facs="tcp:3716:47"/>
it is an acceptable thing to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
vpon others, but here wee are
bound to haue compassion vpon our
selues. <hi>Miserere animae tuae, placens
Deo,</hi> as one sayth, The Priest must first
offer sacrifice vnto God for himselfe,
then for the sinnes of the people. In
the Gospel, the Pharisie took compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
vpon the Publica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, saying, <hi>I thank
God I am no whoremaster, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
person, nor as this publican:</hi> But
the godly publican wept for himself,
and tooke compassion vpon his own
life, and therefore God tooke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
vpon him. We must not first
weepe for others, but first wee must
drinke one heartie draft of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for our selues, and then for our
brother. If thy eye be single, al thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
is full of light: but if thou haue a
beame in thine own eye, &amp; yet woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
pull out the moate that is in thy
brothers eye, all thy bodie is full of
darknes: whereas the way is first to
<pb facs="tcp:3716:48"/>
weepe and wash out the great beame
our of their owne eye, that then thy
eye being more single, thou maist see
cleerely to pull a little moate out of
thy brothers eye: otherwise, that
which was most fondly and foolishly
sayd to Christ, may be truely and fitly
sayd to thee, <hi>Phisition heale thy selfe:</hi>
And, <hi>he saued others, himselfe he can
not saue.</hi> Like to those Hagges and
Pharies, which in Latin be called <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miae,</hi>
which wee haue heard of in old
time, who (as they say) could see well
enough abroad, but when they came
home, were wont to put vp their eyes
in a boxe, &amp; so they were stark blind.
To whom we may wel say, as Christ
sayd to one, <hi>Abi in domum tuam:</hi> Goe
into thine owne house: doe not prie
into other mens liues abroad, and shut
not vp thine eyes in a boxe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou
art at home, but rather when thou art
abroade: looke to thine owne house,
looke to thine owne heart, weepe for
<pb facs="tcp:3716:48"/>
thine owne selfe, for thine owne life.
Many can swallow a camell &amp; straine
out a gnat: though their own backs be
surcharged, and ouerladen with all il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauoured
lumpes of sinne, like camels
bunches; yet they neuer feele it, they
neuer make any bones of it, they can
swallow it well enough without any
drinke of teares: but if they see a little
gnat sitting vpon their brothers coate,
presently they must needes forsooth
weepe for it, and vrge it and presse it
very sore, and straine it through their
teares. Such are the wicked vnlearned
Brownists, and other like sectaries of
this age; they say they weep daily for
the ruine of Syon, for the desolation
of this Church. But our Church an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as she had heard her spouse
Christ Iesus say in the like case, <hi>Weepe
not for me, but weepe for your selues:</hi>
I (sayth our Church) was neuer more
glorious heretofore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this Realme
of Englande, neuer am like to bee
<pb facs="tcp:3716:49"/>
hereafter, then I am now at this
day, the Lord bee thanked for it: and
there is no one point of doctrine or
discipline, which I maintaine, which
hath not beene within these fortie
yeares confirmed and besprinckled,
and euen inameled with the blood of
as blessed Saints, as holy Martyrs, our
owne countrimen, as euer did holde
vp innocent hands to GOD. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>VVeepe not for mee, but weepe
for your selues:</hi> You haue departed
not only from his Church, but from
the primitiue Church: of which you
speake so much, Act. 2. 48. In the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Church, they remained with
one accorde in the Temple, you run
out of the Temple, and refuse to pray
with vs. In the primitiue Church,
they did breake bread at home, you
breake peace abroade: In the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church, they had singlenes of
heart, you haue changed all singlenes
into singularitie: I do not speake this
<pb facs="tcp:3716:49"/>
vnto any of this worshipful audience,
but to you Brownists: you are those
Donatists, of whom Saint <hi>Austine</hi>
speaketh in his 29. Epistle written to
<hi>Ianuarius,</hi> who would take from vs
the Lords prayer, with their impious
arguments: so would ye Brownists.
You are those Nestorians of whome
<hi>Cassianus</hi> speaketh: <hi>Quia nolunt es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
vt omnes sunt, volunt omnes esse
sicut illi sunt.</hi> Who, because they
would not be as other men are, would
haue all men to bee as bad as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
You are of those Luceferians,
of whom <hi>Ierome</hi> speaketh in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of decalogue, <hi>Quibus famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are
est dicere, fact a est ecclesia lupana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:</hi>
who make it a common worde
in their mouthes to saye, that the
Church is become a Stewes, so say
the Brownists. You are those Adriani
of whom <hi>Epiphanius</hi> speaketh in his
<hi>Anchoratus,</hi> 4. &amp; 5. pag. <hi>grecae:</hi> who
being busie bodies themselues, and
<pb facs="tcp:3716:50"/>
Bishops in other mens Dioces: yet
thinke much that godly and learned
Bishops shuld beare rule in their owne
Dioces, so thinke the Brownists. You
are those factious Schismatickes, of
whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaketh of in his 4.
booke, 26. chapter: who for light
and trifling quarrels, rent and teare
the great &amp; glorious bodie of Christ:
so doe yee Brownists. Yea, you are
those Schismatikes, of whome <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
speaketh, <hi>Qui eos qui de Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia
sunt, canes, &amp; porcos censent:</hi> who
accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Ministers of the church
no otherwise, then of hogges, and
dogges: I speake to you Brownists.
You are those murmurers against
<hi>Moyses,</hi> of whom <hi>Optates</hi> speaketh
in his first booke against <hi>Paremon,
Qui sunt sepulti, antè sunt mortui:</hi>
who were buried before they were
dead, because they wept for others
before they wept for themselues: so
doe ye Brownists. But to leaue them
<pb facs="tcp:3716:50"/>
as they leaue the Church, and returne
to our selues (deare brethren) who are
Christs deare friends, and friends of
his holie Church, we must not onelie
weepe, but weepe at the heart, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weepe at the heart, but weepe for
this life; not only weepe for this life,
but weepe for our owne life: and so
continuallie practise true deuotion,
compunction, and compassion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this, <hi>But weepe for your
selues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus haue I gone ouer al the eight
parts of this text: Now I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
no greater fauour of God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
wee might meditate of this which
hath been spoken, so as our whole
liues, and all our affections (especiallie
these affections of ioy and sorrowe)
might thereby be ordered, and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
aright. For weeping, and not wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
are things indifferent: things of
themselues neither good nor bad, but
thereafter, as according to circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:3716:51"/>
and occurrences, they are either
well or ill vsed: Euen as glorying, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring,
fearing, or louing. For glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
it is sayd, <hi>Let not the wise man
glorie in his wisedom: but let him that
glorieth, glorie in this, that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Lord.</hi> Againe, <hi>VVe must not
reioyce in any thing, but in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and him crucified.</hi> For labouring,
it is sayd, <hi>Labour not for the meate
which perisheth, but for the me at which
endureth for euer.</hi> And againe, <hi>Thou
shalt get thy liuing with the sweate of
thy browes.</hi> For fearing, it is said, <hi>Feare
not him that can kill the bodie onely,
but feare him who is able to cast both
bodie and soule into vtter darknesse.</hi>
For louing, it is sayd, <hi>Loue not the
world, nor the things of the world: if
any man loue the world, the loue of God
is not in him.</hi> Glorie not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
not in the wisedom of the world,
but in the knowledge of God: La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
not, but labour, not for the meat
<pb facs="tcp:3716:51"/>
which perisheth, but for the meate
which abideth for euer. Feare not, but
feare, not him that can kill the bodie
onely, but him that can kill both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and soule. Loue not, but loue, not
the world, but GOD. And so here,
Weepe not, but weepe, not for me,
but for your selues. <hi>VVeepe not for
me, but weepe for your selues.</hi> To weep
is lawful, not to weepe, without wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
is vnlawfull: not to weepe, is
lawfull, not to weepe, without wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
is not lawfull. Againe, to weepe
for our selues, is lawfull; to weep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderatly
for Christ, is vnlawfull;
not to weepe for Christ is lawfull; not
to weepe at al for our selues is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
whereas without any vnlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in either, both weeping, and not
weeping, will be lawfull, if our wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
be alwaies ioyned with not wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and our not weeping sometimes
ioyned with weeping; if our weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bee for our selues, not for Christ,
<pb facs="tcp:3716:52"/>
and our not weeping be for Christ, &amp;
not for our selues. Therefore, we must
mark what our Sauiour said, he saith
not thus, Weepe for me, and weepe
for your selues; that is too much sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
and too little ioy: neither thus,
Weepe not for me, nor weepe for
your selues; that is too much ioy, and
too little sorow: neither thus, Weep
for me, but weepe not for your selues;
that is a desperat speech: neither thus,
Weepe not for your selues, but weep
for me; that is a presumptuous speech:
onely he sayth thus, <hi>VVeepe not for
me, but weepe for your selues.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(holy brethren) if wee haue any
teares, novv let vs shed them: if wee
haue any Psalmes, now let vs sing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
The holy Gospell is nothing els, but a
ioyfull newes, the summe whereof is
comprised in that Euangelicall and
Angelicall message to the shepheards,
<hi>I bring you glad tidings of great ioy,
which shall bee to all people.</hi> But ther
<pb facs="tcp:3716:52"/>
Christ was borne in his mothers
armes, now he holdeth vp the Angels
that they fall not, and lifteth vp men
that are falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with his armes stretched
out vpon the crosse: This is his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which is vpon his shoulder, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say.
9. 6. And <hi>O Ecumenius</hi> sayth vpon
the second of <hi>Iob,</hi> This was a greater
glorie and credite for Christ, then the
creation of the whole world. Sweete
Sauiour, I embrace the wounds of thy
hands and feet, I esteeme more of thy
hysoppe, thy spunge, thy reede, thy
speare, then of any princely Diadem:
I boast my selfe, and am more proude
of thy spittings and thornes, then of al
pearles and iuels: I account thy crosse
more splendent and glorious, then any
royall scepter. What speake I of a
scepter? thats a goodly matter indeed,
then al the sunne-beames in her grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
brightnes of beautie. This is that
triumph, 2. Cor. 2. 14. wherby Christ
made vs to triumph in himselfe, and
<pb facs="tcp:3716:53"/>
to bee more then conquerours, as <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
sayth, whereas the goodnes and
sweetnes of Christ, did triumph ouer
all impietie and malice. Therefore if
the women met <hi>Saul</hi> playing &amp; sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Saul hath slaine his thousand, and
Dauid his ten thousand:</hi> how much
more ought all the sonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Ierusalem, to meete ioyfully
playing vpon the harpe, and singing
that new song to the Lambe with the
24. Elders, Thou art worthie to take
the book, and to open the seales there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
because thou wast killed, and hast
redeemed vs by thy bloud. There is a
time to weepe, and a time to laugh, a
time to mourne, and a time to dance.
Why art thou then so heauie oh my
soule, and why art thou so disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
within me? still put thy trust in
GOD, and hee will deliuer thee.
Wherefore, let vs looke vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and there shall we see the Angels
singing this song, <hi>Glorie bee to God on

(I say) we had good cause to reioyce:
how far greater cause haue wee now
to reioyce, seeing he is returned back

<pb facs="tcp:3716:54"/>
               <hi>But weepe for yourselues:</hi> not because
Christ dyed, but because your sinne
were the cause of his death: for this I
will weepe day and night: yea, if I

               </gap>ch,
as by my sinnes to crucifie Chris:, &amp;
to put him to so many deathes, and to
kill so deere and so louing a Lord. Oh
that I could possibly deuise what to
say, or what to doe, to obtaine thus
much of you, or rather of God for
you: that you would weepe, though
it were neuer so little for your sinnes.
But I can doe no more but commend
and commit that which hath beene
spoken, to the effectuall working of
the holy Ghost in you: &amp; to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
obedience of your good hearts to
God. Many excellent things are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of thee, renowned citie, oh thou
<pb facs="tcp:3716:54"/>
glorious citie of London: and yet
there are many foule blemishes in
thee, which nowe I will not, and by
reason of the time, I cannot rip vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you: but must leaue them vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one of your priuat consciences:
onely remember I pray you this one
lesson, that you sinne not, for he that
sinneth once, killeth Christ once: and
hee that repeateth one sinne twentie
times, killeth Christ twentie times:
Oh that God would giue force to my
words, and tell me what I should say.
I would to God that I could moue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any
remorse, in bitinge and gnawing
of your consciences for your sinnes.
Beloued, oh beloued, kil not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
of your hearts, grieue not the
holy Ghost: for when wee sinne, the
holy Ghost is grieued: hee is grieued
when we are not grieued; but if we
be grieued for our sinnes, then is the
holy Ghost delighted: as sayth Saint
<pb facs="tcp:3716:55"/>
               <hi>Basill,</hi> such griefe and weeping will
be the verie seede, or the interest and
loane of euerlasting life. For as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pittieth his childe, and if he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him crie, he stilleth him, &amp; takes
out his hand-kercher and wipes the
childes eyes himselfe: so GOD our
heauenly Father, will with his owne
holy finger wipe away all teares from
our eyes, take vs by the hande, and
leade vs out of the house of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
into the house of mirth: then
hauing sowen in teares, we shall reape
in ioy: yea, hauing sowen but a few
teares, which may be put in a bottle,
we shall reape al those manifold ioyes
which are in heauen: For (sayth one)
<hi>Heauines may endure for a night, but
ioy commeth the next morning:</hi> then
shall Christ turne all our miserie into
musicke: all our wormewood into
wine: all our sighing into singing:
then shall <hi>Abraham</hi> that good mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb facs="tcp:3716:55"/>
binde vs vp into sheaues as good
corne, and fill his bosome full of vs,
and carrie vs into the Lords barne, to
make a ioyfull haruest in heauen:
then shall we with the wise Virgins,
hauing store of oyle in our lampes,
that is, teares in our eyes, goe out of
this vale of teares which floweth
with weeping, and enter into that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
Canaan, which floweth with
milke and honie. Then shall we sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting
all earthly things, so reare
aloft and flye vp as with the Eagles
winges, into the heauenly paradise,
and there settle in the tree of eternall
life: then shall all teares of weeping
and mourning bee wiped from our
eyes: and then shall wee see cleerely
the bright sonne of God sitting at the
right hand of his Father in heauen:
