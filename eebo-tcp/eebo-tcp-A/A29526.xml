            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But besides these, there are two other (which our <hi>new Annotation</hi> putteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my hand) no lesse apt and proper then either of those.

            <p>Here is then a fourfold head from whence this Metaphor may be derived.

            <p>And this was one of those doctrines,

those <hi>divers and strange Doctrines,</hi>

monstrous errours after these broke in upon the Church. The Golden Age of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists</hi> being spent, then how did false Teachers croud in amain, infesting the Church, and assailing the truth almost in every part of it? broaching and venting <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and strange doctrines;</hi> some, and many of which were so strange, as it cannot but amaze and astonish any Christian head or heart to hear of them.

            <p>Which latter also our Apostle Saint<note place="margin">False Teachers foretold of.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> (if so be that he were the Penman of this Epistle, which for the present I shall yield) took notice of.

Such Wolves there were many after <hi>Paul's</hi> departure (his dissolution) in that <hi>Neronian perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> and others following it. But besides these, there was another kind of <hi>Wolves,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> looked upon as no lesse dangerous, if not more. And those were <hi>white Wolves, Wolves in sheeps cloathing.</hi> So our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth <hi>false Prophets,</hi> Matth. 7. 15.

Now such also the Apostle took notice of, that they should come after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. So he tells them there more plainly in the verse following, vers. 30.

Well did he know that there was no other <hi>Gospel</hi> but one; <hi>No other Name under heaven given among men whereby they must be saved</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> elsewhere tells the <hi>Iews,</hi> Act. 4. 12.); no way or means of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation appointed by God for lost man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; save onely through the merit and mediation of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> But in as much as it was a doctrine diverse from, and a depravation of the true Gospel, therefore he so calleth it; as he explaineth himself in the verse follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, [<hi>Which is not another Gospel; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel of Christ,</hi> v. 7.]. Thus were they carried about.</p>
            <p>And what he saw in them as done, or doing, he feared the like in his <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.</hi> So much he tells them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>I fear</hi> (sairh he) <hi>lest by any means, as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted,</hi>

               <hi>from the simplicity that is in Christ.</hi> This he also speaketh in reference to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the <hi>false Apostles;</hi> who made a medly of the Gospel, mixing their own Philosophical speculations, or Jewish Traditions, or Ceremonial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances with it. By which meanes they corrupted and adulterated that pure doctrine, even as pure and precious liquors are imbased and corrupted by other mixtures.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41951:22"/>
in the first verse (as you have heard) foretold of false Teachers that should come, in the next verse he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what successe they should have; <hi>And many shall follow their pernicious wayes,</hi> ver. 2. And what he there fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relleth, St. <hi>Iude</hi> sheweth us how in his time it came to passe. Having in the fourth verse of his Epistle in like manner described the <hi>false Teachers</hi> of his time, in the sequel of the Epistle he sets forth their followers; whom he calleth <hi>Clouds without water, carried about of winds,</hi> ver. 11. and in the next verse, <hi>Waves of the Sea, and wandring stars;</hi> thereby denoting Christians who were inconstant in their profession; not like <hi>fixed stars</hi> which are regular in their Motion, but like <hi>Planets,</hi> or <hi>Comets,</hi> wandring from one opinion or way to another, being constant onely in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy. Thus were there some, and not a few in those times, those proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primitive times, who were thus <hi>carried about with divers and strange doctrines.</hi> This is that which our Apostle saith of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> in the place fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17, 18. that by their pestilent doctrine in denying of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,

               <hi>good;</hi> not their <hi>estate,</hi> but their <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But so did not the false Apostles, and other false Teachers of that time.

               </hi> 2. 21.); <hi>their own things,</hi> as their own <hi>honour,</hi> so their own <hi>profit.</hi> And such for the most part are <hi>false teachers,</hi> they are <hi>self-seekers;</hi> seeking rather to make a gain of others, (which thing <hi>Paul</hi> disclaimes both for himself, and <hi>Titus,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 17, 18.) then to gain them to Christ. This is that which St. <hi>Peter</hi> foretelleth of the <hi>false teachers</hi> that should come in after-times, among other things, they should <hi>make merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize</hi> of their followers.

               <hi>the wages of unrighteousnesse;</hi> so as he cared not what he said or did, so he might but gain that reward which <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack</hi> proffered him; though it were to the cursing of that people which he knew to be Gods people, the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> had not God withheld him, by causing the dumb Asse to reprove him; as you have it recorded, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 7, 13, 37. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16. Even so is it with some false teachers, <hi>having an heart exercised with covetous practices</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh, verse 14. of that Chapter), they care not what they say, or do for gain. And thus do they <hi>make merchandize of the soules of men.</hi> This is said to be part of <hi>Babylons Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,</hi> Rev. 18. 12, 13. As <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>silver,</hi> and <hi>precious stones,</hi> and divers other commodities there reckoned up, so among other, <hi>the soules of men.</hi> Which may very well be taken literally, in as much as <hi>Babylons, Romes Merchants,</hi> her Idolatrous Priests and false Teachers, do make a spiritual Merchandize of them. Now put these together, and here you may see, how many of these <hi>divers and strange doctrines</hi> come to be conceived, bred and brought forth.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> The general Resolution.</note> upon some of those <hi>generals,</hi> which I made use of before.</p>
            <p>1. This cometh to passe not without<note place="margin">1. Through Gods righteous Judgment.</note> a <hi>special Providence of God;</hi> who in his most righteous Judgment, both <hi>sendeth,</hi> and <hi>giveth men over to strong delusion, that they should believe a Lye:</hi> (as the Apostle hath it in that forecited Text,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41951:29"/>
2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 11.) And wherefore so, and so? The verse foregoing renders the reason of it; <hi>Because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved.</hi> Thus it is; where the truths of God, (Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths) are not sincerely and cordially imbraced, believed and loved, lodged in the heart, and the power of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the life, God in his just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giveth men over to the power of strong delusions, that they should be deceived by them, and carried away with them.</p>
            <p>2. This cometh to passe through the<note place="margin">2. Satans subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> 
               <hi>working of Satan,</hi> through his <hi>subtlety.</hi> In this way was our first parent, our great Grandmother <hi>Eve,</hi> deceived. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> coming to her in the form (or rather Body) of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> (making use of that subtle and insinuating Creature to speak through, and convey his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by), <hi>he beguiled her through his subtlety</hi> (as the Apostle hath it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3.) And in a like way doth that <hi>old Serpent, called the Devil and Satan,</hi> (the accuser of the brethren, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary to the Church) <hi>deceive the world,</hi> (as you have it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 9.) the wicked and ungodly world, which is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41951:30"/>
the greatest part of it. This he doth through his <hi>subtlety,</hi> winding himself into the heads and hearts of men, sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them by his Temptations, thereby drawing them, as into <hi>moral Vices,</hi> so into <hi>doctrinal Errours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. For this men are beholding to<note place="margin">3.

Insomuch that if man be left to the inclination and sway thereof, it can be no wonder if he be turned aside from the way of truth, to the imbracing of the most pernicious and damnable Errours.</p>
            <p>But I shall let passe these <hi>Generalls;</hi>

               <hi>Instruments</hi> are very active in this work. St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaking of him, (of <hi>Satan</hi>) saith, <hi>He walketh about as a Lyon, seeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 8. and we may as truly say, that he <hi>creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about as a Serpent, seeking whom he may poyson;</hi> in both kinds <hi>Compassing the earth</hi> (as himself speaketh, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 7.). And our Saviour speaking of some of them, (his <hi>Instruments</hi>) the Scribes and Pharisees in his time, he saith, that <hi>they compassed Sea and Land to make one Proselyte,</hi> Matth. 23. 15. They were indefatigable in their endeavours of bringing the Gentiles over to their own Religion, of turning them from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenisme</hi> to <hi>Iudaisme;</hi> which when they had done (as our Saviour there further chargeth it upon them), they made them <hi>twofold more the children of the Devil then themselves;</hi> i. e. more superstitious then themselves; (as oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Disciples</hi> do in the way of Errour, exceed and go beyond their <hi>Masters</hi>)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus for the most part it is with false and <hi>Heretical teachers.</hi> They are very active and unwearied in spreading their Errours, not caring what paines

they take that way: In so much that they are willing to <hi>Compasse Sea and Land,</hi> to go far and near (as the <hi>Iesuites</hi> are notoriously known to do, who tta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel into all parts of the habitable world; and as some <hi>Sectaries</hi> among our selves are said at this day to do, into all parts of this Nation), that they may by spreading their doctrine, make <hi>Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,</hi> gain disciples.

times: Such use they made of their <hi>Philosophy.</hi> Thereupon it was that <hi>Paul</hi> gave that Caveat to his <hi>Colossians,</hi> Chap. 2. v. 8. <hi>Beware</hi> (faith he) <hi>lest any man spoyl you through Philosophy, and vain deceit;</hi> that is, by such subtile and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Arguments as are drawn from the principles of <hi>Naturall Reason:</hi> which however in it self it is useful, yet when it is made the measure of spiritual my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, this is a dangerous abuse of it.

which Scripture is expresse, and which the Church of God in all ages of it hath looked upon as truths, the belief where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was necessary to salvation.

on a time to flye in the ayr in the sight of many people, his divellish Art failing him, he fell to the ground, and brake his leg, which proved to him mortal, in a little time bringing his wretched life to a miserable end.

            </p>
            <p>And the like hath been the practice of divers other <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>false teachers.</hi> Some of which are said to be abroad among our selves in this Nation at this day, who pretend as to <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> so to <hi>Miracles.</hi> Of all which we are to judge as of the former.

               <hi>Artifices</hi> which are very usefull to them in this way; As, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Glosse</hi> which they set upon their Doctrines, and the <hi>Vizour</hi> which they put upon their own faces.</p>

And if <hi>Satan</hi> do this, no wonder if <hi>sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, false Teachers,</hi> being his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and acted by him, do the like. So the Apostle there infers in the verse following, (ver. 15.) <hi>Therefore it is no great thing if his Ministers also be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as Ministers of righteousnesse.</hi> This did the false Apostles, (as the verse foregoing there hath it) verse 13. They <hi>transformed themselves into the Apostles of Christ</hi>]; pretending not onely to the like Commission that they had to preach the Gospel; but also to equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize, yea, to exceed and excell them in their <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces.</hi> Thus were they (as they are there called) <gap reason="foreign">

they were in their way, <hi>Compassing Sea and Land to make one Proselyte</hi> (as the next verse hath it): And elsewhere we read how strict and precise they were in their outward deportment; in their habits, gestures, diet, washings, and such like ceremonial observances.

               <hi>have as it were crownes of gold on their heads, and their faces are as the faces of men; and they have hair as the hair of women;</hi> being outwardly very demure; by which meanes they and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines gain no small esteem with the vulgar, who look no further then to the outward appearance.</p>
            <p>And it cannot but be thought that<note place="margin">So among our selves.</note> there are some <hi>false teachers</hi> at this day in this Nation, who do therein tread in their steps, making use of the same stratagem.

            </p>
            <p>1. It may be they are <hi>Learned men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Learning.</note> who either broach, or maintain some of these Opinions; Possibly, <hi>eminently learned;</hi> at least reputed so to be.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41951:41"/>
so hath it been, and yet at this day is. If men of eminent learning (really or reputedly so) shall be turned aside from the truth, to the imbracing and holding forth of any errour, (as sometimes, and not seldome, they are, whereof many Causes and Reasons might be assigned) it is not to be wondered, if those who being unlearned themselves, have them in admiration that way, and look upon them in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> (as <hi>Achitophel</hi> in his time was accounted for <hi>Politicks,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 23.) as <hi>the Oracles of God,</hi> be carried about with them, after them.</p>

He being through <hi>fear of scandal</hi> fallen into a <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous dissimulation, Iudaizing</hi> with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for fear of displeasing them, in the observation of some <hi>Legal Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> which before being among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he had seemed to renounce
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41951:41"/>
and disclaim, by this meanes he drew many after him. So the 13. verse there setteth it forth; <hi>And the other Iewes dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas likewise was carried away with their dissimulation.</hi> Of such preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency oft-times are the examples of men eminent for piety and holinesse (as <hi>Peter</hi> was) that if they miscarry whether in <hi>Practice</hi> or <hi>Doctrine,</hi> they draw many other well-meaning, but unstable soules after them.

               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:41951:46"/>

And that not onely with <hi>Children,</hi> who are apt to be

taken with <hi>novelties;</hi> such things as they have not seen before, be they never such toyes, yet they are apt to part with things of far greater value for them; But also with others, persons who in respect of their years might, and should be wiser. What is it that induceth many, (I wish I might not say some <hi>Professours</hi>) to follow every vain fashion in their apparel, and hair, &amp;c. though in themselves never so undecent and unbecoming, (as divers of the fashions at this day are) but onely this, they are <hi>divers</hi> and <hi>strange?</hi> And what is it that induceth the impure <hi>Adulterer</hi> sometimes to forsake the <hi>wife of his youth,</hi> being both for her person and Condition every waies amiable, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the bosome of another no waies to be compared with her? why, onely this, she is a <hi>stranger, the strange woman</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> calleth the <hi>Harlot,</hi> Prov. 5. 20. and often elsewhere). And so for the abominable <hi>Sodomite</hi> to commit that horrid sin against nature, but onely because it is (as St. <hi>Iude</hi> calleth it, v. 7.) <hi>Strange flesh,</hi> of another sex.

but this, because they are so.</p>
            <p>And truly so is it sometimes in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<note place="margin">Novelty and strangenesse taking Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> of Religious concernment, both <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> they are taking with some; How so?

And in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, this it is which moveth some, and not a few, at this day, to run after some <hi>Teachers,</hi> and to listen after some <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines:</hi> Onely because they are <hi>new</hi> and <hi>strange.</hi> So the Apostle foretold that it should be, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>The time will come</hi> (saith he) <hi>when they</hi> (speaking of some Christians) <hi>will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts</hi>

and agreeable to their <hi>Reason,</hi> though never so clearly held forth to the eye of faith in <hi>Scripture.</hi> And upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation it is that they erect and build their own <hi>divers and strange doctrines:</hi> which (presuming themselves to be great <hi>Masters of Reason</hi>) with much confidence they hold forth, to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of some, who are willing to hearken to them, and to be deceived by them.</p>
            <p>4. To these adde one more, which is as taking as any of the former, if not<note place="margin">4. It may be they have a shew of Piety.</note> more. And that is; It may be they are such doctrines as <hi>have in them a shew of piety.</hi> Such were the doctrines which the <hi>false Apostles</hi> preached, and pressed. They were such things (as the Apostle describeth them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. last) as <hi>had indeed a shew of wisdome in will-worship, and Humility, and neglecting of the Body.</hi> Such were divers of those Ceremonial observances, which were so eagerly pressed by them upon Christians in those times. They had a great shew of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> in them; being exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Self-denyall,</hi> which (being rightly performed) are services very acceptable to God. Thus
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41951:51"/>
did they varnish over that superstitious <hi>Will-worship</hi> of theirs; whereby it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very taking with such as were not aware of the hook hid under that bait.</p>
            <p>And the like may be said of many of the doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day, which pretend to extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary strictnesse, and so carry a shew of singular piety and devotion with them; whereby many well-meaning, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary soules are bewitched; and so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with them.</p>
            <p>And surely that is the case of some and divers of those doctrines which walk abroad in this Nations at this day: they have a shew of speciall and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>piety</hi> in them. Some of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to an high advancement of <hi>free Grace,</hi> which in it self is a <hi>glorious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> Such is that <hi>Arminian</hi> doctrine, (which it seemeth is of late crept into this place, being brought in by some who <hi>creep into houses,</hi> and so <hi>beguile un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable soules</hi>), I mean the <hi>Doctrine of Universal Redemption,</hi> with its Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, (as <hi>Errour</hi> seldome goeth alone), which is cryed up as a doctrine highly advancing and magnifying the grace of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41951:52"/>
God, by this extending it to the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of Mankind,</hi> far above that which confines it to a select number: which yet is but a meer pretence. For if all be alike Elected in Christ, alike given to Christ, and alike redeemed by Christ, so as nothing is done, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended more for one then another, where is then that <hi>speciall differencing and distinguishing Grace of God,</hi> which is so admired by the Apostle in divers of his Epistles? So as in truth this doctrine, being rightly scanned, is not an exaltation of Grace, but a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation from it. And divers other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines there are of like nature, which have the like varnish set upon them: As, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Antinomian</hi> tenents, and some other, which I shall not trouble you with the enumeration of. Onely desiring you to take notice of this in the general, as one special means of thus carrying about some, and many well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning, but unstable soules; even the specious shew of pretended piety that is in some Doctrines.</p>
            <p>And thus I have now (through the good hand of my God leading me along) dispatched the former of my
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41951:52"/>
tasks, that which I intended by way of <hi>doctrinal Explication</hi> and <hi>Illustration.</hi> Wherein I have shewed you what is meant by <hi>Divers and strange Doctrines,</hi> and what by being <hi>carried about</hi> with those Doctrines. Then that there <hi>have been, and are such doctrines;</hi> and that <hi>Christians are subject to be carried about with them;</hi> Giving you the Grounds and Reasons of both. That which now remains of this part of the Text, is <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where (in the first place) I might <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Applic.</hi> A just Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation over the present state of the Church in this Nation.</note> here make a stand, and take a just and sad <hi>Lamentation,</hi> pouring forth my soul in bemoaning the present state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church of God in this Nation. Wherein, (Lord!) what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of <hi>strange doctrines</hi> are there to be found? And how many every where <hi>carried about</hi> with them? For <hi>Doctrines,</hi> how <hi>divers?</hi> and many of them how <hi>strange?</hi> Surely <hi>Africa</hi> was never more fruitful in variety of <hi>Monsters,</hi> then <hi>England</hi> is at this day in variety of <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:</hi> divers of which are so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, so hideous, as surely <hi>Hell</hi> it self affords none more. Such as give us to hope, that the <hi>Devil</hi> is now pouring
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41951:53"/>
out the very dregs of his <hi>poysonous Cup.</hi> But withall, how many are there found to be <hi>intoxicated</hi> therewith? Yea, some, who some yeares since were looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as stayed and sober Christians, yet now we may see them reeling and stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering like drunken men to and fro; carried this way and that way, as not knowing how, or where to stand. Such is the Condition of this poor Nation at this day: Insomuch that this disease of the <hi>Spiritual Vertigo</hi> is grown <hi>Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> common in all places. Look where we will, almost, how may we see <hi>wheeles turning about, Chaffe whirled about, Waves</hi> and <hi>Clouds driven about, unstable soules carried about with the wind of divers and strange doctrines.</hi> A mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of just and deep <hi>Lamentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so let it be to every of us. Should any of you, while your selves stand safe upon the shoare, see others, though <hi>Strangers,</hi> much more if <hi>friends,</hi> tossed upon the waves among <hi>Rocks</hi> or <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,</hi> ready to perish every moment, I presume it could not but affect the flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest heart among you. And surely such is the condition of many of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Sisters at this day in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41951:53"/>
who are thus tossed to and fro with <hi>divers and strange doctrines,</hi> some of which are no better then <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Quicksands,</hi> desperate, and damnable doctrines, such as who ever imbraceth, living and dying in the belief of them, must needs split and perish upon them. Now how should the consideration hereof affect the hearts of all those who truly loving God, cannot but bear an hearty affection to their brethren, so as to desire their everlasting welfare and happinesse! But I shall not insist upon this, either the further <hi>discovering</hi> of this <hi>Malady,</hi> or the <hi>bewailing</hi> of it. I shall rather come to that which more nearly concerneth your selves; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute that which I told you was my design in taking up of this Text; Which is,</p>
            <p>To <hi>Warn you,</hi> you of this place, of<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Use</hi> 2. A double Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note> this Congregation; To whom let me in the Name of God here hold forth a double <hi>Caveat:</hi> First, <hi>Be not you offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> at these: Secondly, <hi>Be not you se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced</hi> by them. Of these two several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Begin with the former.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Be not you offended</hi> by these; by<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caveat</hi> 1. Be not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> what either you see or hear of in this
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41951:54"/>
kind; so offended, as to like <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Religion</hi> ever the worse for them. A blessed thing not to be thus offended. <hi>Blessed is he whosoever shall not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in me</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 6. This unstable soules are subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to upon divers occasions; like queasie stomachs which are ready to take distaste at every thing that displeaseth them. But upon none sooner then this, the instability, and unsettlednesse of those that professe the faith of Christ; when they shall see them carried about with <hi>divers and strange doctrines.</hi> So much we may learn from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ep. 2. where speaking in the first verse of <hi>false Teachers,</hi> such as should broach <hi>damnable Heresies;</hi> and in the second verse, of their <hi>followers,</hi> which should not be few, but many, [<hi>Many shall follow their pernicious wayes</hi>], He subjoynes this to both, [<hi>By reason of whom the way of truth shall be evill spoken of</hi>]. <hi>The way of truth</hi>], The true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, which shewes the true and onely way to true happinesse; It should by this meanes be exposed to the Reproaches and Obloquies of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of it. And surely so is it with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41951:54"/>
the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> at this day, which is professed and held forth as the true Religion of God in this Nation; by reason of those <hi>divers and strange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> which are to be found in it (some of them confessedly far worse then any that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is charged with), and the strange <hi>unsettlednesse of the Professours</hi> of it, who as if they had no sure bottome to stand upon, are thus carried about with every wind. By this meanes this <hi>way of truth is evil spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of</hi> by the adversaries of it. And that especially by our <hi>Adversaries</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who as they have ever been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to cast this in the Protestants face, their <hi>divisions,</hi> so now questionlesse, they rejoyce in them, and triumph over them; from hence concluding, that surely this cannot be the <hi>way of Truth,</hi> which hath so many windings, and turnings, and Crosse waies in it: This cannot be the <hi>true Religion</hi> of God, the Professours whereof are so far from that which God hath promised to his Church under the Gospel, viz. <hi>Cor unum &amp; via una, One Heart and one way.</hi> Thus are others <hi>offended</hi> hereat. But let not any of you be so offended. No Reason
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41951:55"/>
why you should be so. This being no<note place="margin">No Reason why Christians should be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at this.</note> other then what,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Hath been.</hi> It is no <hi>new thing.</hi> No other then what hath been in all Ages<note place="margin">1. This is no other then what hath been.</note> of the Church; even in the first and purest times of it. Then were there such <hi>divers and strange doctrines</hi> set on foot, and divers <hi>carried about</hi> with them. And what wonder then to see the like acted over again in these dregs of time. It is no other then what hath been.</p>
            <p>2. And (secondly) it is no other then<note place="margin">2. No other then what is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told shall and must be.</note> what hath been <hi>foretold should be, must be; There must be Heresies</hi> (saith the Apostle,) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19. And that as in all, so specially in the latter times.</p>
            <p>For which most clear and expresse is that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who writing to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> informs him hereof, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Now the Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and Doctrines of Devils,</hi> &amp;c. And again, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>This know also,</hi> (saith he) <hi>that in the last dayes perilous times shall come, For men shall be lovers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, Covetous, boasters,</hi> and so he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on, shewing what a flood of evills should in the last times (being, as it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41951:55"/>
were, the lees and dregs, the worst of times) break in upon the Church, spreading over the face of it; and among other he reckoneth up this for one, that there should be some who should <hi>creep into houses, and lead captive silly women,</hi> &amp;c. there should be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Seducers,</hi> and many <hi>seduced</hi> by them.</p>
            <p>Now wherefore is this so clearly foretold, but to prevent that offence, which any might be ready to take, when they see these things come to passe. This was our <hi>Saviours</hi> end in foretelling to his <hi>Disciples</hi> what harsh usage they should find in and from the world, after his departure from them, <hi>These things</hi> (saith he) <hi>have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended,</hi> Joh. 16. 1. And again, <hi>These things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them,</hi> v. 4. And to the very same end he elsewhere foretelleth in like manner of false Teachers that should come, and the prevalencie of their seductions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24. <hi>There shall arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and shall shew great signes and wonders, insomuch that</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:41951:56"/>
               <hi>(if it were possible) they shall deceive the very Elect.</hi> So prevalent should they be in their seducements. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he foretell this? why, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that offence which any might be ready to take hereat, when they should see it; So it followeth, <hi>Behold, I have told you before,</hi> v. 25. given you this warning, that you might not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or troubled at it, when you shall see so many errours held forth, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny giving heed to them.</p>
            <p>And of such use let these and the like predictions be unto us. Now that we see what was foretold to be come to passe, being thus forewarned of it, be not offended at it, so as to like the true Religion of God ever the worse for it. Here is the former of these <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veats.</hi> Passe we to the second, which my eye is principally upon.</p>
            <p>Not being <hi>offended,</hi> take heed (in the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caveat</hi> 2. Take heed of being sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</note> second place) of being <hi>seduced. Be not ye carried away with divers and strange doctrines.</hi> That was the Apostles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to his <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and let it now be mine to you. Such <hi>doctrines</hi> there are abroad; and many there are who are <hi>carried about</hi> with them. Now
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41951:56"/>
taking notice hereof, take you heed that none of you be found in this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that you be not also <hi>led away.</hi> So St. <hi>Peter</hi> presseth it in the close of his latter Epistle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17. Having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told them of (what we at this day see) <hi>false Teachers,</hi> and many that should be seduced by them, <hi>Ye therefore (beloved)</hi> (saith he) <hi>seeing ye know these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, beware lest ye also being led away with the errour of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastnesse.</hi> And the like let me, with like tender respects to your soules, presse upon you; Seeing so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny seducers are abroad, and so many every where seduced by them, take heed that you be not in like manner car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about as they are. Which let me beg from you: And that,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>For our sakes, whom God hath set</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. For your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters sakes.</note> 
               <hi>over you.</hi> (I begin here; Not that we seek our selves in the first place, (as some are ready enough to charge it) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a <hi>Gradation,</hi> I begin at the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est stayr first). If you should be thus carried away, this will be <hi>our Losse,</hi> our <hi>Grief;</hi> which look you to. So Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> presseth it, making use of this very Argument to this very end, 2 Ep.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41951:57"/>
v. 8. where speaking to the <hi>Elect Lady, and her Children,</hi> and exhorting them to constancy in the faith, which he doth the rather because of those <hi>false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> which were then abroad, of whom he speaketh, v. 7. <hi>For many deceivers have entred into the world</hi>] Then he subjoynes, <hi>Look to your selves, that we lose not the things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward</hi>]. <hi>We.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Peoples Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters losse.</note> So it is, where Christians come to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statize, to fall from the Truth which they have received and imbraced, there their <hi>Ministers,</hi> who have been their Teachers and Instructers, they <hi>lose the things which they have wrought;</hi> their former labours by this meanes are fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated; they are lost and spilt; and so it cometh to passe that they do not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their full reward.</hi> True indeed, as for their <hi>Eternal reward,</hi> that they shall not lose. That was the Confidence and Comfort of their Lord and Master, the <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> who complaining of the fruitlesnesse of his labours among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> (as he is brought in, and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> being therein a Type of him) <hi>Isai.</hi> 49. he beareth up his spirit with this comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41951:57"/>
assurance, v. 4. <hi>Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, &amp;c. yet surely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God.</hi> This was his comfort, that though his Labours had been in vain as to the greatest part of that people, and of the world, yet God his Father, who knew with what uprightnesse and sincerity he had done the work which he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to do, would, for all that, crown his endeavours with an answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reward. And the like may all his <hi>servants</hi> comfort themselves with. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faithful in their Ministration, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving themselves unto God, in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his glory, and the good of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what ever the successe of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours be, yet they shall not lose their <hi>eternal reward</hi> hereafter. But in the mean time, they may lose a part of their reward here: which consisteth partly in the <hi>fruit of their labours;</hi> when they see them successeful in the hearts of their people. This they may by this means lose. Yea, and in some sense they may be said to lose part of their <hi>Reward hereafter.</hi> For if those whom they gain unto Christ are their <hi>Crown,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:41951:58"/>
and their, <hi>Glory,</hi> as the Apostle calleth them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved, and longed for, my Ioy and my Crown, so stand fast in the Lord.</hi> And so writing to his <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 1 Thess. 2. 19, 20. <hi>For what is our hope, or joy, or Crown of rejoycing</hi> (saith he)? <hi>Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ at his coming? For ye are our glory and Ioy.</hi> Now if so, then the Apostatizing of those whom God hath (as to an outward Profession) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them, their falling off from the Truth received, is as the falling off of so many <hi>Pearles</hi> from their <hi>Crownes.</hi> And so by this meanes it cometh to passe, that they do not (as he there speaketh) <hi>receive their full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this being thus their <hi>Losse,</hi> it is<note place="margin">Their Grief.</note> also their <hi>Grief.</hi> So it must needs be. If this be their <hi>Ioy</hi> to see those whom they have gained by their Ministery, to continue constant in the profession and practice of the Truth, (as it is) <hi>I rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced greatly</hi> (saith St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> writing to the Elect Lady in that his second Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) <hi>that I found of thy children walking in the truth,</hi> verse 4. And so writing to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41951:58"/>
               <hi>Gaius</hi> in the Epistle following, he tells him first, as concerning his own person in particular, 3 <hi>Ioh.</hi> verse 3. <hi>I rejoyced greatly when the Brethren came, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth:</hi> Then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all others who were converted by his Ministery, verse 4. <hi>I have no greater joy then to hear that my children walk in the truth</hi>]. Now (I say) if this be so great a joy to them, (as it is to all the faithfull Ministers of Christ, who do seriously intend, desire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the salvation of those committed to them) it cannot, on the other hand, but be a great sadding to their spirits, to see hopefull branches broke off from the stock, fair blossomes falling off from the Tree; to see those upon whom their Ministery hath been in measure effectual, (at least to the enlightening of them), deserting the truth, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of errour, seduced by false Teachers, and so <hi>carried about with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and strange doctrines.</hi>
            </p>

to them, to see any of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren whom they have bred and brought forth, and brought up to some maturity, with so much carefulnesse and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be taken captive by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or to be carried away by <hi>Gipsies,</hi> or the like. Truly in like manner, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deeply affect the faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ (who are as <hi>spiritual pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth himself, 1. Cor. 4. 15) to see any of those whom God hath given them as Children, who have been (as it were) the <hi>labour and travell of their souls,</hi> to see them <hi>captived by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> to see them carried away by those <hi>Gipsies in Religion</hi> (of which there are many walking abroad in this Nation at this day), I mean <hi>Seducers,</hi> false <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> who by their <hi>Canting Language,</hi> and other like artifices, deceive simple soules, and so carry them about with them into the waies of Error. This (I say) cannot but deeply affect the hearts of the faithfull Ministers of Christ; be a sadding to their spirits.</p>
            <p>Now then have you a regard to this,<note place="margin">The Ministers Losse and grief reflecting upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> that you be not in this way the causers of it. This is that which the Apostle presseth upon his <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> v. 17. of

that forecited Text of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 2 Ep. v. 8. <hi>Look to your selves, that ye lose not those things which you have wrought,</hi> (or gained) <hi>but that ye may receive a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>] <hi>Ye</hi>] This <hi>Apostates</hi> do; Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the truth believed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, they <hi>lose the things which they have wrought,</hi> lose the reward of them; so as all their profession shall not turn to any account to them. For this expresse is that of the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 18. 24. repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and inculcated, Chap. 33. 12, 13, 18. <hi>When the righteous turneth away from his righteousnesse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse that he hath done shall not be mentioned, &amp;c.</hi> So it is in <hi>doctrinall truths,</hi> as well as <hi>Practical performances.</hi> A professour turning aside from the way of truth, to the imbracing of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, thereby he blasteth all his former Profession, loseth the fruit and benefit of his former <hi>Faith,</hi> or seeming <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> And unlesse he look to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, may also lose that <hi>full Reward,</hi> (as the Apostle there calleth the reward of Eternal Life) <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in as much as it is an abundant recompence for what ever any shall either do or suffer).
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41951:60"/>
This <hi>Reward</hi> all Apostates are in danger to lose.</p>
            <p>Not that all errours in <hi>doctrine</hi> (no<note place="margin">Errours not all alike dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> more then in <hi>practice</hi>) are alike dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. We know what the Apostle saith of those Teachers, which <hi>build wood, and hay, and stubble upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 12. Holding fast <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>his saving Truths,</hi> the <hi>Mystical</hi> and <hi>doctrinal</hi> foundations, yet raise and build some unwarrantable superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures upon them, holding forth some doctrines that will not endure the <hi>Tryal;</hi> of such he saith, verse 15. that though their <hi>work be burnt,</hi> (as it shall be at that great day of tryal, when all things shall be <hi>tryed</hi> (as it were) <hi>by fire</hi>), and <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves suffer losse,</hi> (lose the praise of their labour, which shall not be accepted or rewarded with God) yet <hi>they themselves shall be saved, though it be as by fire.</hi> Though they escape narrowly, as a man that escapes out of the fire naked, where he hath lost both his goods, and his Garments; yet, as to their persons, they shall be saved. God accepting the sincerity of their intentions as to the main, will graciously over-look and pardon those infirmities, and so receive
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41951:61"/>
them to mercy. Now what he there saith of the <hi>Teachers</hi> of such doctrines, we may apply to the <hi>followers</hi> of them. So long as they hold fast the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> though they be (through infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) drawn aside into some Errours not fundamental, they may as to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, through the indulgent grace and mercy of God, be saved. Which we hope concerning many poor seduced foules in this Nation at this day. Thus it is true, all Errours are not alike dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in themselves.</p>
            <p>But withall, who knoweth what the<note place="margin">Yet all dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the Consequence.</note> 
               <hi>Consequence</hi> of those more <hi>venial Errors</hi> may be? when the <hi>wheel</hi> begins to turn, going down the Hill, who knoweth where it will stay? Not, unlesse it be accidentally stopped, untill it come to the bottome. And even so is it with <hi>poor seduced soules;</hi> if once they begin to be <hi>carried about with divers and strange doctrines,</hi> though of an inferiour concernment, if they once begin to <hi>fall from their steadfastnesse,</hi> who knoweth where they will rest? whether before they come to the <hi>bottome of the Hill,</hi> to the <hi>bottome of Hell,</hi> or no? I presume your own experience can furnish some
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41951:61"/>
of you with some instances of this kind: Of some, who beginning at the first with some smaller Errours, (as, <hi>viz.</hi> withdrawing themselves from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Assemblies), in processe of time, by turning and turning from one Errour to another, they have never left till they came to the very browe and brink of Hell; even to the deriding and scorning of that Religion which before they professed; to the defying of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, publick and private; to jear at heaven and Hell, at the immortality of the soul, and Resurrection of the Body, as if they were no other but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy dreams; and so brought even to the height (or rather depth) of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Atheisme</hi> and profanenesse. O let these examples be as <hi>booyes,</hi> or <hi>Sea-marks</hi> unto you, to warn you to take heed of coming near those shelves, those quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, which they have thus made ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack upon. As you love your selves, your own precious soules, take heed of being thus <hi>carried about with divers and strange doctrines.</hi> Which if you shall suffer your selves to be, unlesse Gods mercy be the greater in checking and

            <p>And so finding our Saviour blaming the <hi>Pharisees</hi> for their ambition, and among other things charging them with this, that <hi>they loved the chief seats ni the Synagogues,</hi> Matth. 23. 6. they, not understanding what the word <gap reason="foreign">

was, wherein (as in our Churches) there were many chief seats for more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent persons, they apply it to the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, which Ministers in preaching of the Word make use of for convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies sake, not without an expresse Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture- president for it, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Ezra,</hi> of whom we read, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 4, 5.

            <p>The other place is that, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 4. where our Saviour sending forth his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty <hi>Disciples</hi> upon that great and earnest employment to preach and plant the Gospel, he orders them that they should <hi>carry neither Purse, nor Scrip, nor shoes, nor salute any man by the way;</hi> This kind of men overlooking the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the verse, which equally concerneth themselves, forbidding that which they usually practise in their journeys, the <hi>carrying of purse, or scrip, or shoes,</hi> they take hold of the latter, and from thence refuse to salute any man, and so to afford any respect unto <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,</hi> as well as others.

            <p>Thus do they make good what St. <hi>Peter</hi> there speaketh, Being <hi>unlearned</hi> and <hi>unstable,</hi> they <hi>wrest the Scriptures.</hi> And that not onely such places as he there speaketh of, which are dark and obscure, whether for matter, or expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but plain Texts, the sense whereof is obvious to every eye, that hath not the like filme of prejudice upon it that theirs hath.

                  <hi>Caveat</hi> 1. Take heed of High things.</note> is the Apostles Caveat to his <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 12. 16. <hi>Mind not high things.</hi> And let it be mine to you.

               <hi>the Mountain;</hi> take heed of high things. In particular of <hi>high thoughts,</hi> and <hi>high speculations.</hi> I shall instance onely in these two.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Of high thoughts</hi> concerning your<note place="margin">1. High thoughts.</note> selves; of your own wit, your own wisdome, your own Judgment; as if you were more perspicacious, more quicksighted then others. This <hi>Caveat</hi> the Apostle subjoynes to the former, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 16. <hi>Be not wise in your own conceits.</hi> Such for the most part <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> are; they have high thoughts of themselves, as if they could seek fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then others. And with this <hi>leaven</hi> (for the most part) their <hi>Disciples</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise are sowred. And thence is it that having once given entertainment to an opinion, they are so hardly induced to part with it again. <hi>Seeth thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool, then of such a one,</hi> Prov. 26. 12. would not you fall into the like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Be not in this sense <hi>High-minded,</hi> Have not over weening thoughts of your selves.</p>
            <p>And (secondly) whilest you take heed<note place="margin">2. High Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> of high thoughts, take heed also of <hi>high Speculations.</hi> Whilest you take
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41951:78"/>
heed of setting the one into your soules, take heed how you let out your soules after the other; that they do not reach at things above their reach. So our former Translation (not unfitly) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>That no man prefume to understand above that which is meet to understand,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Either, above that which is meet for any man to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, as some Divine secrets are, which yet some will be prying into, or above that which is not meet for such or such persons to attempt to understand. Such are some high and deep Points in <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> to low, and shallow capacities. They are too high for them. And thereupon it is, that when they will be medling with them, and looking too far into them, they are like weak braines upon an high Tower, which presently turn round, they are easily <hi>carried about.</hi> Even as it is with small <hi>Skifs</hi> and <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boals;</hi> so long as they are in the narrow and shallow waters, they are steady, but lanching forth into the main, the broad and deep Ocean, then how are they tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? Even so fareth it sometimes with some well-meaning Christians. So
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41951:78"/>
long as they keep themselves within the banks of more plain and necessary truths, as the doctrines of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. now they are steady and stable, but adventuring to lanch forth into the <hi>deeps,</hi> how are they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about? Such deeps the Apostle speaketh of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. where having treated of Gods just and gracious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation, in rejecting of the <hi>Iew,</hi> and receiving the <hi>Gentile</hi> into Covenant in their room, he breaketh forth into this passionate Exclamation, as a man asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the thought of that which he could not comprehend the reason of, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>! <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdome and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his Iudgments, and his wayes past finding out?</hi> So they are in many of his common providences, in disposing of humane affairs here below, much more in disposing of men for their eternal estates. Those Decrees of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> or <hi>Preterition;</hi> Gods choosing of some to be <hi>vessels of honour,</hi> ordaining them to life and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jesus Christ; his over-looking and passing by of others, leaving them to be <hi>vessels of wrath,</hi> ordaining them
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41951:79"/>
to just condemnation for sin; and both these <hi>before they have done either good or evil,</hi> (as the Apostle layeth it down, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11.) meerly out of the good pleasure of his own will, without any respect (as to the <hi>Decree</hi>) to any thing in the persons so disposed of, this is a depth which neither man nor Angel can sound the bottome of. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then when such Skifs and Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats, unlearned and unstable soules shall boldly adventure into these deeps, that they are tossed to and fro, that they are carried about into <hi>Pelagian, Vorstian, Arminian,</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Errours, which too many vessels of greater burden, men of eminent learning and parts have been, and at this day are. That you may be secure from the like danger, take heed of these <hi>high things;</hi> as of high <hi>thoughts,</hi> so of high <hi>speculations;</hi> as how you entertain the one, so how you meddle with the other. Remembring what the <hi>Kingly Prophet</hi> saith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Psal.</hi> 131. 1. <hi>I do not exercise my self in things too high for me;</hi> (things passing the measure of his apprehension, or limits of his vocation) As also what the Apostle saith unto you, <hi>Be wise</hi>

I am so far from discouraging such meetings, that I wish where there is one, there were many.

again in his second Epistle, Chap. 3. 5. he tells him, that <hi>the Scriptures which he had known from a child were able to make him wise unto salvation.</hi> And in the verses following, (verse 16, 17.) enlarging himself in setting forth the divers and excellent uses of Scripture, he saith, <hi>It is profitable for doctrine, &amp;c. that the man of God may be made perfect, thorowly furnished to all good works.</hi> Now if <hi>Scriptures</hi> contribute so much to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial perfection, surely they cannot be uselesse to the most illuminated Saints upon earth.

life; <hi>Primum vivens, &amp; ultimum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riens,</hi> the first that liveth, and the last that dyeth. But this is not the <hi>heart</hi> that our Apostle here speaketh of.

               <p>The <hi>Heart</hi> here spoken of, is (as the<note place="margin">The Soul of man.</note> Apostle telleth us) such a thing as whose establishment is not by <hi>Meats,</hi> but by <hi>Grace.</hi> Understand hereby then the <hi>Soul</hi> of man.

               <p>So it is (first) when a man is <hi>actually</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Such is Actual turning from the way of Truth.</note> 
                  <hi>turned.</hi> When he is under this sad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, <hi>carried about</hi> (as the Apostle saith) <hi>with divers and strange doctrines.</hi> This is an <hi>Evil,</hi> and that both a <hi>Sinful,</hi> and a <hi>Penal</hi> one.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Sinful.</hi> So it was in our <hi>first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. A sinful Evil.</note> when they hearkened to the voice of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> bringing to them a <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> diverse from, and contrary to that which God himself had preached to them. And so is it in their posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; when they shall in like manner hearken to the <hi>Instruments of Satan,</hi> subtle seducers, suffering themselves to be turned aside from the way of Truth to the imbracing of Errours. This is a <hi>sinful Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so it may be called, and looked<note place="margin">Upon a double Account.</note> upon, upon a double account; As it
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41951:102"/>
is a <hi>forsaking of Truth,</hi> and as it is a <hi>cleaving to Errour.</hi> Thus the Lord complaineth of his people, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>My people have committed two Evils</hi> (two grand and notorious Evils), <hi>they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out Cisternes, broken Cisternes, that can hold no water.</hi> They forsook the true God, and turned to false gods, Idols. This he chargeth upon them as a double Evil. And so is it, when any one shall forsake and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish the <hi>truth</hi> once received, and acknowledged, and shall follow after <hi>Errours,</hi> this is a <hi>double Evil.</hi> Even as it was in the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when being <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Manna,</hi> they <hi>lusted for flesh,</hi> (of which you have the story, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 4, 6.) this was in them a double Evill. Their <hi>loathing</hi> one, their <hi>lusting</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; their loathing of that <hi>heavenly Manna,</hi> and their lusting after <hi>Egyptian flesh-pots.</hi> Even so is it with Christians; when they shall come to loathe <hi>divine and heavenly truths,</hi> which their soules have formerly fed upon, and found relish in, satisfaction and contentment, and shall lust after <hi>divers and strange doctrines,</hi> this is a <hi>double Evill.</hi> So St.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41951:103"/>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> looked upon it in those <hi>Seducers,</hi> of whom he complaineth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 15. that they had <hi>forsaken the right way, and were gone astray, following the way of Balaam.</hi> And so may we look upon it in the <hi>Seducers</hi> of these times, as also in many of those that are <hi>seduced</hi> by them. Their turning from the Truth received, and imbracing of Errour, is in them a double Evil. A <hi>sinfull evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And as sinful so <hi>Penal.</hi> As a <hi>sin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. A penal Evil.</note> so a <hi>punishment</hi> of sin, and that a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one. So the <hi>Apostle</hi> looked upon it, who writing to his <hi>Thessalonians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Apostasie of the latter times, he saith, that <hi>For this cause</hi> (viz. because men <hi>received not the love of the truth) God shall send them strong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that they should believe a lye,</hi> 2 Thess. 2. 11. Thus doth God justly punish those disrespects which men shew unto his <hi>truth,</hi> when it is held forth unto them, their not receiving and imbracing it with intire and cordial Affection, and living up to it, by giving them over to <hi>Satanical delusions,</hi> to be captived and blinded by them, that they should believe a <hi>Lye,</hi> be carried about
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41951:103"/>
with <hi>di<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vers and strange,</hi> forged and false <hi>Doctrines.</hi> Thus is this <hi>Actual turning</hi> an Evil thing.</p>
               <p>And such (in the second place) is<note place="margin">2. Habitual insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility a great Evil, in two respects.</note> 
                  <hi>Habitual Instability.</hi> When men have unsettled heads and hearts, and so are subject to be turned, and to be <hi>carried about</hi> in this manner. This also is an <hi>evil,</hi> a great Evil. So it will appear, if we do but consider these two things: First, how it <hi>indisposeth a man to service;</hi> and, secondly, how it <hi>exposeth him to danger.</hi> Both which may fitly be illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated from a <hi>Ship</hi> (a Similitude which I have the more frequent recourse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in regard that, as it suiteth very well with the <hi>Subject</hi> in hand, so it is fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and well known to you.) A <hi>Ship,</hi> being tender-sided, and waltery, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>serviceable,</hi> nor <hi>safe.</hi> Not service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Owner,</hi> not safe to the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger.</hi> And truly such is the condition of an <hi>unstable soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. It is <hi>unserviceable.</hi> Unserviceable<note place="margin">1.

Both which require a stable <hi>head,</hi> and a stable <hi>heart.</hi> Where these are wanting, it cannot be
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41951:104"/>
expected, or hoped, that a man should walk uprightly with God in a constant course of Obedience. We see how it is with <hi>a man in drink</hi> (so we speak sometimes, and yet not improperly, when the Body being surcharged with any inebriating liquor, the <hi>soul</hi> (which is <hi>the man,</hi> the most noble part of him) is drowned in it), his head turning round, what Indentures doth he make with his feet: He cannot now walk right on, but <hi>reeleth to and fro,</hi> this way and that way (as the Psalmist spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 27.): And truly so is it with an unsettled Christian, having an unstable <hi>head</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so an unstable <hi>foot,</hi> so as he cannot walk steadily with <hi>God.</hi> He cannot do (what our <hi>Apostle</hi> requires all Christians to do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 13.) <hi>Make streight pathes</hi> (or <hi>steps) unto his feet.</hi> This is that which St. <hi>Iames</hi> telleth us in that Text forecited, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 8. <gap reason="foreign">

And being so, it cannot be expected than either <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man</hi> should ever have any great service from such a one. It was <hi>Iacobs</hi> prophetical prediction concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his first-born son, <hi>Reuben,</hi> Gen. 49. 4. <hi>Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> in valour, or any excellent atchievements. And the like may be said of <hi>unstable Christians.</hi> Being <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable as water,</hi> (which too many are) subject to be moved and <hi>carried about with every wind of doctrine,</hi> as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is with every gale that bloweth upon it; Let it never be expected that they should <hi>excell,</hi> in doing any speciall service whether for <hi>God,</hi> or for his <hi>Church.</hi> Thus doth this <hi>Habituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stability</hi> indispose a man for service.</p>
               <p>2. It <hi>exposeth him to danger.</hi> Even<note place="margin">2. Exposing it to Danger.</note> as it is with a <hi>Ship</hi> (still I have recourse to the same similitude), being tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41951:105"/>
and waltery, as it will not <hi>bear much sail,</hi> so it is subject to be <hi>overset</hi> by every gust. Even so is it with an <hi>unsettled Christian.</hi> As he is not <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing much service,</hi> so he is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being <hi>over-set by every Tentation;</hi> to be carried about by <hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>hope of gain</hi> and outward advantage, or by <hi>the sleight and cunning craftinesse of subtile seducers;</hi> which is a thing of very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous consequence, making the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a man most hazardous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe, continually exposing him to the danger of no lesse then the sinking of his soul in eternal perdition. But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised brevity. Thus is it (as you see) an <hi>evil thing to have the heart,</hi> the soul of man, <hi>unsettled,</hi> especially as to <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religious concernment.</hi>
               </p>

So it is, being both <hi>Honestum, Utile,</hi> and <hi>Iucundum,</hi> (which are the three kinds of good) an <hi>Honest</hi> good, a <hi>Profitable</hi> good, a <hi>Pleasurable</hi> good.<note place="margin">1.

Possibly by fits and starts an unsettled, unstable Christian may do some good services, in themselves acceptable unto God, and profitable to others.

This is the fruit of this <hi>heart-establishment,</hi> to make the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian like <hi>Davids tree, planted by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season, and whose leaf also doth not</hi>

The <hi>heart</hi> being in a good and constant temper, it maketh both an <hi>equable pulse,</hi> and a <hi>chearful countenance.</hi> And so is it with the Christian, when his <hi>heart,</hi> his soul is settled and established in the matters of God, this maketh him as <hi>Constant</hi> in his way, so <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. David</hi> having his <hi>heart fixed,</hi> then he will <hi>sing and give praise,</hi> Psal. 57. 7. <hi>An unsettled heart must needs be an uncomfortable heart.</hi> Even as it is with a <hi>Traveller,</hi> falling with divers wayes, and being anxious and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which to take, now he goeth on heavily, though possibly he may be in the right; whereas being confident of his way, he goeth on chearfully.

not have them sought after by them. And thus do they keep poor soules in a fluctuating, doubting condition; by which meanes their Consciences can never be quiet; not having any sure <hi>basis</hi> to rest upon; but they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually subject to be <hi>carried about.</hi> A sad and dangerous condition, what ever they may think or speak of it.

in it. So far he. Which we accept, (especially coming from an Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) owning it for a Truth; though not the whole truth. Advance we a step further. A mans own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is <hi>uncertain:</hi> Nay, it is <hi>certain,</hi> being <hi>certainly defective and imperfect.</hi> Such are the best duties and services of the most sanctified persons upon earth, being clogged with many weaknesses and imperfections: which though they do not render and deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate them <hi>peceata, Sins,</hi> yet <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minosa, sinful.</hi> This is the <hi>Churches Confession,</hi> Isai. 64. 6. <hi>All our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesses are as filthy rags.</hi> Not onely their <hi>Ceremoniall services,</hi> but even their <hi>morall performances;</hi> they were all mixed with <hi>Hypocrisie, Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,</hi> or some such like tincture of Corruption, as rendred them loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some in the sight and presence of God.

               <p>This is that which <hi>regenerate Paul</hi> complaines of in himself, that <hi>when he would do good, evill was present with him,</hi> Rom. 7. 21. Evil, <gap reason="foreign">

of thy heart and spirit. And so may it well be to every true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

What <hi>doubts</hi> which it cannot resolve? Are his <hi>sinnes</hi> many and great? this is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to pardon them: are his <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> many? this is sufficient to heal them: are his <hi>wants</hi> many? this is sufficient to supply them. Thus is <hi>Grace,</hi> this Grace of God in Christ, <hi>sufficient, All-sufficient.</hi> And being so, well may this be attributed to it, as the proper effect of it, to satisfie, settle, and <hi>establish the heart</hi> of Man.</p>

So the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of that verse there hath it. <hi>There is no fear in Love, but perfect Love casteth out fear</hi>]: <hi>Perfect Love,</hi> sincere, cordial Affection towards God, and towards man, it casteth out fear; freeth the heart from that slavish, torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fear.
