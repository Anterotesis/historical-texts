            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This was now the third of the <hi>Barchine</hi> Famely (so called of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> whose surname was <hi>Barcas</hi>) that commanded in chief over the men of War. <hi>Hanno</hi> therefore and his Partizans, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able to tax the Virtue of their enemies, nor to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the like services to the Common-wealth, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55026:4"/>
left whereby to value themselves, excepting the generall reprehensions of War, and cautelous advise of not provoking the <hi>Romans</hi>: but they were little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. For the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> saw apparently, that the Oath of the <hi>Romans</hi> to the Articles of Peace, was like to hold no longer, than till the <hi>Romans</hi> could find some good advantage to renew the War. It was therefore rather desired by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that whilst they were in a fit condition, the War should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, rather than in some unhappy time of Famine or Pestilence, or after some great losse in their Army or Fleet, they should be driven to yeild to the impudent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their insulting enemies.</p>
            <p>This disposition of his Citizens <hi>Hannibal</hi> well enough understood. Neither was he ignorant that in making War with the <hi>Romans</hi> it was no small advantage to get the start of them. Could he but bring his Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> he hoped to find Friends and assistance, even from those People, that helped to encrease the Armies of the <hi>Romans.</hi> But his design must be carried privately, or else it would be prevented. He resolved therefore to lay Siege to <hi>Saguntum</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he now was with his Army, which might seem not greatly to concern the <hi>Romans,</hi> and would highly please the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having resolved hereupon, neverthelesse he went or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly to work, beginning with those that lay next in his way. First therefore he entered into the Territory of the <hi>Ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But at this time our Great man of War, knew as well how to dissemble his Courage, as at other times to make good use of it. For he withdrew himself from the River side, as seeming fearfull to passe over it, aiming thereby to draw over that great multitude from their Banks of advantage. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as <hi>Hannibal</hi> expected and desired, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he retreated out of feare, thrust themselves in a disordered manner into the River, to pursue him. But when <hi>Hannibal</hi> saw them well neare over, he turned back his Elephants to antertain them at their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thrust his Horsemen, both above and beneath them into the River, who by the advantage of their weapons slew almost all of those in the River with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out resistance, and then pursued the rest,<note place="margin">His Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</note> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amazed, fled, and so he made a very great slaughter of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Saguntines</hi> perceiving the storme drawing near to them, hastened their Ambassadours to <hi>Rome,</hi> who complained that they were like to be undone, onely for their Friendship to the <hi>Romans.</hi> This so moved the Senate, that some would have War presently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, both by Sea, and Land, and the two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls sent with Armies, one into <hi>Spain,</hi> the other into <hi>Affrick:</hi> But others went more soberly to work (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Roman</hi> gravity) whereby it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that Ambassadours should be sent into <hi>Spain,</hi> to view the State of their Confederates.</p>
            <p>These Ambassadours found <hi>Hannibal</hi> at <hi>Carthagena,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55026:5"/>
where they had Conference with him, who carried himself so reservedly, that they departed, as doubtfull as they came. But whilst they were passing to and fro, <hi>Hannibal</hi> prepared, not only his Forces, but some <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> pretences against <hi>Saguntum.</hi> For the <hi>Tudetani,</hi> who were neighbours to the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> complained to him of sundry wrongs that they had received from them of <hi>Saguntum</hi>: Probably <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself had hatched some of them. Having therefore such an occasion, he sat down with his whole Army before <hi>Saguntum.</hi> The <hi>Romanes</hi> were glad of the Quarrel,<note place="margin">He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieges <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntum.</hi>
               </note> as hoping that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> with all belonging thereto, would in short space become their own. Yet were they not hasty to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before they were ready to strike; but meant to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize untill they had an Army in readinesse to be sent into <hi>Spain,</hi> where they intended to make <hi>Saguntum,</hi> the seat of War.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>Hannibals</hi> Siege, his <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were much discouraged by reason of the brave Sallies which the <hi>Saguntines</hi> made upon them, in one of which <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself received a dangerous wound in the thigh that made him unable to stir for many dayes. Yet in the meantime he was not unmindfull of his businesse, but gave order to build certain movable Towers that might equall those upon the City walls, and to prepare to batter the Curtaines, and to make a breach. These being finished and applied, had soon wrought their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired effect. A large breach was made by the fall of some Towers, whereat a hot assault was given: But it was so gallantly defended by the besieged, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were not only beaten from the breach, and out of some ground within the City, which in the first fury they had wan, but they were pursued even to their own Trenches and Camp. Yet at length the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army (wherein were one hundred and fifty thousand men) did so tire out the Townsmen by their continuall Allarms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that at length it gat into the Town, and had been Masters of it, but that they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55026:5"/>
were hindred by some Counter-works which the Besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had raised.</p>
            <p>In this extreamity there was one <hi>Alcon,</hi> that came out of the City to treat with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who would give no other tearmes but these hard ones, That they should deliver up to him all the Gold, Silver, and Plate, and other Riches which they had in the City; That the Citizens should leave the City, and take up such other habitations as he should appoint them; neither should they carry any more out with them, save the cloaths on their backs. These tearmes seemed so unreasonable to <hi>Alcon,</hi> that he durst not returne into the City to propound them to the Citizens. Yet might they far better have submitted thereto, how hard soever, because thereby they might have saved their lives, and the honour of their wives and Daughters, whereas, the City being shortly after taken by storm,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Saguntum</hi> taken.</note> they saw their Wives and Daughters defloured before their faces, and all put to the Sword that were above fourteen years of age. The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures found in <hi>Saguntum,</hi> which were very great, <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> reserved, therewith to pay his Army. The Slaves, and other booty, he divided amongst his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, reserving some choise things, wherewith to present his Friends at <hi>Carthage,</hi> to encourage them to the War.</p>
            <p>This news exceedingly vexed the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors sent to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi>

the <hi>Romanes</hi> to challenge them if they had done any thing contrary to their late League and Covenant. <hi>Its true</hi> (said this Speaker) <hi>that in our negotiations with</hi> Luctatius <hi>your Ambassador, the Allies of both Nations were comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but the</hi> Saguntines <hi>were not then your Allies, and therefore no parties to the Peace then made: For of your Allies for the future, or of ours, there was no question: As for the last agreement between you and</hi> Asdrubal, <hi>wherein you will say that the</hi> Saguntines <hi>were comprehended, its you that have taught us how to answer that particular. For whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you found in the Treaty, between us and</hi> Luctatius, <hi>to your disadvantage, you said it was his presumption, as promising those things for which he had no Commission from your Senate: If then it be lawfull for you to disavow the Actions of your Ambassadors and Commanders, concluding any thing without precise Warrant from you; the same liberty may we also as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, and hold our selves no way bound in honour to performe the contract that</hi> Asdrubal <hi>made for us, without our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and Consent.</hi>

               <hi>Gaul</hi> (now <hi>France:</hi>) But he found the <hi>Gauls</hi> bounding upon <hi>Spain</hi> ready in Armes,<note place="margin">His pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> to forbid his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Country; but with gentle Speech, and rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, which he sent to their Leaders, he wan them to favour his expedition. So without any other molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he came to the Banks of <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> where dwelt on each side of the River a People called <hi>Volcae.</hi> These being unacquainted with the cause of his coming, sought to stop his passage over the water: But he was greatly assisted by those of <hi>Vivarets,</hi> and <hi>Lionois</hi>: for though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them had transported themselves, and their goods into <hi>Daulphine,</hi> thinking to defend the Banks against him; yet such as remained, being willing to free their Country from such unwelcome Guests, they helped him to make Boats: informed him of a better passage higher up the River, and sent him Guides.</p>
            <p>When his Boats were ready, he sent <hi>Hanno</hi> the Son of <hi>Bomilcar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</note> up the River to the Foard, and himself in the mean time made a shew of entering the Foard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that <hi>Hanno</hi> charging the <hi>Gauls</hi> on their own side, and himself at the same time passing the River in their faces,<note place="margin">His Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> might win the further Bank, which was done accordingly, though with some difficulty, and thereby the enemies were dispersed.</p>
            <p>Having passed this first brunt, and overcome both the rage of the River and those that defended it, he was visited by the Princes of the <hi>Cisalpine-Gauls,</hi> that inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Piemont,</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> who had lately revolted from the <hi>Romanes.</hi>

Yet found he himself extreamly encombred by the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> and lost more of his Carriages and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> than he could well spare. For he was twice strongly assaulted by them before he could recover the plaines on the other side. He was fifteen dayes passing over the <hi>Alps,</hi> wherein, besides the trouble of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55026:7"/>
he was much assaulted by foule weather, and Snow, it being now the begining of Winter. But the fair and fertile plaines which they now were entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, with the assistance, and encouragment of the <hi>Cisal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine Gauls,</hi> gave them much comfort, having nothing else of difficulty remaining, but that which from the begining they made account to overcome by their proper valour and resolution, namely the <hi>Romane</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and resistance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romane</hi> Ambassadours who had denounced War at <hi>Carthage,</hi> in their return homewards, took <hi>Spain</hi> in their way, with a purpose to draw into their Alliance as many Cities, and Princes as they could: The first that they attempted were the <hi>Volcians,</hi> from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this answer: that they would never joyn with them who had forsaken the <hi>Saguntines</hi> in their greatest need; and that themselves had found the <hi>Cathaginians</hi> such good neighbours, that they meant still to adhere to them. From <hi>Spain</hi> the Ambassadours passed through <hi>Gaul,</hi> perswading them not to suffer <hi>Hannibal</hi> to passe through their Countery, and gloried much in their own strength: But the <hi>Gauls</hi> laughed them to scorn, and had scarce patience to hear them speak: Telling them that they meant not to set their own Houses on Fire to save the <hi>Romanes</hi> from burning; That the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> had never offended them as the <hi>Romanes</hi> had done, who had already forced some of them out of their habitations, and made others Tributaries, who were as free as themselves.</p>
            <p>With these unpleasing answers the Ambassadours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home; carrying no good newes of friends like to help them, but rather that the <hi>Gauls</hi> intended to take part with their enemies.

To further the desire of <hi>Sempronius,</hi> the <hi>Gauls</hi> that inhabited near to <hi>Trebia,</hi> complained of injuries done to them by the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Indeed they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to supply <hi>Hannibal</hi> with necessaries, and therefore he was bold to be his own Carver. Hereupon <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius</hi> sent forth a thousand Horse, which coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for upon <hi>Hannibals</hi> Forragers, who were heavy laden,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> Forragers beaten.</note> they cut many of them in pieces, and chased the rest even to their Camp. This indignity made the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> to sally out, who caused them to retire faster than they came: <hi>Sempronius</hi> relieved his own men, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> did the like: So that at length the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was drawn forth, and Battel offered, if the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had not refused it.</p>
            <p>This Victory (for so the Consul would name it) made the <hi>Romans</hi> very desirous to try it out in open Field, notwithstanding <hi>Scipios</hi> diswasion from it. This <hi>Hannibal</hi> was informed of by the <hi>Gauls</hi> that were in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp: therefore he resolved to secure the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by adding a Stratagem to his fortes. He found in a hallow place overgrown with Reeds, a fit trench to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an Ambush: Therein he cast his Brother <hi>Mago</hi> with a thousand choise Horse, and as many Foot. The rest of his Army, when he had well fed, and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

them, he led into the Field and marched towards the Consuls. Early in the morning he had sent over the River some <hi>Numidian</hi> Horsmen to brave the enemy, and draw him forth to a bad Dinner before he had broken his Fast. <hi>Sempronius</hi> readily embraced the opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of fighting, and forthwith sent over the River, in a miserable cold day, his Footmen, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to the armeholes, which together with the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> equalled them in Foot, and exceeded them in Horse: when therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse were broken by the <hi>Numidians:</hi> when their Foot were charged, both in Front and Flank, by the <hi>Spaniards, Gauls,</hi> and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and when all were pressed in the Rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The remainder of this broken Army was collected by <hi>Scipio,</hi> who got therewith into <hi>Placentia,</hi> steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the same night, which was very rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. <hi>Sempronius</hi> e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Winter proved very sharp, and unfit for service, which well pleased the <hi>Romans,</hi> who lay warme in <hi>Placentia,</hi> and <hi>Cremona.</hi> Yet did not <hi>Hannibal</hi> suffer them to lie very quiet, but vexed them with continual Alarms, assaulting divers places, and taking some.

These and all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prisoners, <hi>Hannibal</hi> held in streight places, loaden with Irons, and misserably fed. But their followers he intreated courteously, and sent them to their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries without ransome, protesting that he undertook the War in <hi>Italy</hi> to free them from the oppression of the <hi>Romans.</hi> By these meanes he drew many to his party, and assistance. But some of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> fearing that their Country should be made the seat of War, conspired against his Life: others discovered the danger to him, who yet,<note place="margin">Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> soon after, were ready to practice the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which enforced <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <note place="margin">His dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous march.</note> In those Marshes and Bogs he lost all his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants save one, with one of his own eyes, through the moistnesse of the Aire, and by lodging on the cold Ground: Yet at last with much ado, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the firme and fertile Plaines, and Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about <hi>Arretium,</hi> where he somwhat refreshed his weary Army, and heard newes of the <hi>Romane</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C. Flaminius</hi> and <hi>Cn.

The Senators were so displeased at this, that they sent for him back; but he neglected their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55026:11"/>
and hasted to meet with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> whom he found at <hi>Arretium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> was well pleased with the fiery disposition of this Consul: and therefore provoked him by many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, hoping thereby to draw him to fight, ere <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> came with the rest of the Army. For which end he put to Fire and Sword all the Country round about him, even under the Consuls nose. By this <hi>Flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> thought his Honour to be much empaired, and therefore advanced towards the enemy. Many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him to stay for his Colleague, but he would not be perswaded: Then he commanded the Army to march.</p>
            <p>All the Territory of <hi>Cortona</hi> as far as to the Lake of <hi>Thrasymene</hi> was on a light fire, which, whilst <hi>Flaminius</hi> thought to quench with his enemies bloud, he pursued <hi>Hannibal</hi> so unadvisedly, that he fell, with his whole Army into an Ambush: from thence he was charged unaware from all sides, so that he knew not which way to turne, nor how to make resistance. There was he slain in that place, accompanied with the carcasses of fifteen thousand of his Countrymen: About six thousand of his Vantguard took courage out of desparation, and breaking through their enemies, they recovered the tops of the Mountains: but being discovered there, <hi>Maharbal</hi> was sent after them,<note place="margin">The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten again·</note> who overtook them by night in a Village, and surrounded them with his Horse, and so they yielded, rendering up their Armes upon promise of life and liberty. This accord <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> refused to confirme, and so made them all Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>At this time he had about fifteen thousand Prisoners: all that were not <hi>Romans</hi> he set free without ransome, still portesting, that for their sakes he came into <hi>Italy</hi>: But the <hi>Romans</hi> he kept in streight Prison, and held them to hard meat.</p>
            <p>Presently after the Battell of <hi>Thrasymene, C. Semproni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> with four thousand Horse came neere to <hi>Hanaibals</hi>

Camp. He was sent from <hi>Ariminum</hi> by <hi>Servilius,</hi> the other Consul, to encrease the strength of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> but coming too late, he only encreased the misadventure. <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent out <hi>Maharbal</hi> to intercept him,<note place="margin">The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten.</note> who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them amazed at the ill newes of the late losse, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and brake them, killing almost half of them, and drew the rest simply to yeild to mercy. <hi>Servilius</hi> hearing of the overthrow and death of his Colleague, hasted to <hi>Rome</hi> for the defence of it.</p>
            <p>Greatly were the <hi>Romans</hi> amazed at these disasters, and their aproaching danger.<note place="margin">Great fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> Wherefore they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to a remedy which had been long out of use, and that was, to choose a <hi>Dictator,</hi> whose power was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Consuls, and scarcely subject to the Controll of the whole City:<note place="margin">A <hi>Dictator</hi> chosen.</note> And now they chose <hi>Q.

Minutius Rufus,</hi> Master of the Horse, who was as the <hi>Dictators</hi> Leiutenant.</p>
            <p>The first act of <hi>Fabius</hi> was the reformation of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that was amisse in matter of Religion: then were the Walls and Towers of <hi>Rome</hi> repaired, and fortified, the Bridges upon Rivers were broken down, and all care taken for the defence of <hi>Rome</hi> it self. Four Legions the <hi>Dictator</hi> raised in hast, and from <hi>Ariminum</hi> he received the Army which <hi>Servilius</hi> had conducted thither. With these he marched apace after <hi>Hannibal,</hi> not to fight, but to affront him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fabius</hi> his warinesse.</note> He always lodged upon high grounds, and of hard accesse, knowing that the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse were far inferior to the <hi>Numidians.

Passing by <hi>Spoletum,</hi> and <hi>Ancona,</hi> he encamped upon the <hi>Adriatick</hi> shores, refreshing his diseased and over-traveled Army: and arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Africans,</hi> after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, and made his dispatches for <hi>Carthage,</hi> presenting his Friends,

which were very many) with part of the Spoils that he had gotten.</p>
            <p>Having refreshed his Army, cured his wounded, and fed his Horses, he followed the course of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Shore towards <hi>Apulia,</hi> a Northern Province of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> spoiling all that lay in his way. Yet took he not one City in all those Countries. Indeed he assaied <hi>Spoletum,</hi> but finding it well defended, he presently gave it over. All his care was to weaken the <hi>Romans</hi> in force and reputation;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> Policy.</note> knowing that when he was absolute Master of the Field, it would not be long before the walled Cities would open their Gates to him. To this end he presented <hi>Fabius</hi> with Battel, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him with all manner o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> bravado's; but <hi>Fabius</hi> would not bite: His design was to attend the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> so neere as to keep them from stragling,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fabius</hi> his wisdom.</note> and to preserve the Country from utter spoil. Thus by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees he inured his men to dangers, and brought them first to look on the Lion afar off, that at length they might adventure to sit on his taile.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Minutius</hi> had a contrary disposition, and was as fiery as <hi>Flaminius,</hi> taxing <hi>Fabius</hi> with cowardlinesse and fear; yet nothing moved this wary <hi>Dictator</hi>: He suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

When <hi>Hanibal</hi> saw that he could by no means draw him to fight, and that the Winter drew on, he resolved to rest his Army that was loaden with spoil, in some safe and plentiful Country till the Spring came again. But before he could do this, he must passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by the <hi>Dictators</hi> Camp, that hung over his head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For there was no other way for him to get out of this fertile Country which he had already wasted. But by the errour of his Guid he was brought (as it were) into a pinfold. Now began the wisdom of <hi>Fabius</hi> to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and aplauded, as if he had caught the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in a trap. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> freed himself by a fine inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55026:13"/>
He had gotten about two thousand Kine, upon whose Hornes he tied dry Fagots,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hinnibals</hi> Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem.</note> and in the dark night seting them on fire, he caused them to be driven up the Hill. The sight was strange and terrible to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> himself thinking it to be a devise to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him, kept within his Trenches. So <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his Army escaped the danger, and gat into a safe Country. Then did he make semblance of marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Dictator</hi> coasting him after the wonted manner; and keeping still on the high grounds betwixt him and the City, whilst the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> wasted all the plain Countries, and taking <hi>Geryon</hi> in <hi>Apulia,</hi> he turned it into Barnes and Storehouses for the Winter, and encamped under the broken Walls. Thus little was done till the <hi>Dictator</hi> was called home to <hi>Rome</hi> about some businesse of Religion; and when he went, he left the Army in charge with <hi>Minutius,</hi> the Master of the Horse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Minutius</hi> was glad of this oportunity to shew his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency. He was perswaded that the <hi>Romans</hi> in plain field would beat the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who had got the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Victories by subtilty, and ambushes. All the Army was of his opinion, and therefore they perferred his forwardnesse before the cold warinesse of <hi>Fabius</hi>: Hereupon he resolved to fight, though he had been peremtorily forbidden by the <hi>Dictator,</hi> and the breach of whose command was Death: But <hi>Minutius</hi> thought that the honour of the Victory, and love of the Army, would secure him. <hi>Hannibal</hi> on the other side was very glad that he should play with a more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous Gamster: therefore he drew neer, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the <hi>Romans,</hi> sending forth a third part of his Army to wast the Country. There was a piece of high and advantageous Ground between the two Armies: <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> sent two thousand Horse to seize upon it: but <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi> by fine force, won it from them, and encamped upon it, whereby he became a nearer neighbour to <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:55026:13"/>
               <hi>Minutius</hi> for many dayes not stirring, <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent forth many of his men to fetch in Harvest. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage <hi>Minutius</hi> wisely espied, and therefore drawing forth his Army, presented Battel to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but he was not now in case to accept of it; wherefore <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> sent out some against the Forragers, who were scattered all over the Fields, and loaden with Booty,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> Forragers beaten.</note> and so were easily overthrowne. It angred <hi>Hannibal</hi> that he was not able to help them, but it angred him worse when the <hi>Romans</hi> tooke heart to assault his Trenches. But in the heat of this businesse <hi>Asdrubal</hi> came from <hi>Geryon</hi> with four thousand Horse, which emboldned <hi>Hannibal</hi> to issue forth against the <hi>Romans,</hi> to whom he did not so much hurt as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>For this piece of service <hi>Minutius</hi> was highly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Army, and more cryed up by the People at <hi>Rome,</hi> all judging him more worthy of Command than <hi>Fabius.</hi> But the <hi>Dictator</hi> was not so joyfull of the newes, as angry that <hi>Minutius</hi> had disobeyed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. He said, that he knew his own place, and that he would teach the Master of the Horse to know it also; and that he would make him give an account for what he had done in his absence. The People much disliked these his speeches, and made an Act,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Minutius</hi> made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with <hi>Fabius.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> should be joyned in equall authority with the <hi>Dictator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before this Businesse was effected, <hi>Fabius</hi> seeing how things were like to go, dispatched the election of a new Consul in the roome of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> and having finished his businesse, went out of the City towards his Army. But the newes of <hi>Minutius</hi> his advancement was at the Camp as soon as he, so that his Lieutenant treated with him now as his Colleague, asking him how they should devide their authority: <hi>Fabius</hi> briefly told him, that seeing the Citizens had made the Master of the Horse equal with the <hi>Dictator,</hi> he would divide the Legions with him by Lot, according to the custome:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55026:14"/>
               <hi>Minutius</hi> was ill pleased with this, for with half the Army he could not work such wonders as he hoped for. Yet meant he to do his best: and so taking half the Army, he encamped about a mile and a half from <hi>Fabius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It behoved the Master of the Horse to make good the opinion which had thus advanced him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fought good occasion to fight, to which <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> was as forward as he. The Country between them was open and bare, yet <hi>Hannibal</hi> found meanes to lay an ambush in it: For the sides of the valley had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny spacious Caves,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the night, thrust into them five hundred Horse, and five thousand Foot: and least they should be discovered, he made offer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the morning to seize upon a piece of ground that lay on the other side from the Caves, thereby turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their eyes that way. <hi>Minutius</hi> hoping to increase his honour as he had gotten it, sent first his light Armu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then his Horse, and at length he followed in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with the Legions. He was soon caught, and so invironed on all hands, that he neither knew how to make resistance, nor a safe retreate. In this dangerous case, whilst the <hi>Romans</hi> defended themselves, they lost many of their best men.<note place="margin">The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> beaten.</note> But <hi>Fabius</hi> drew neer in good order to relieve them, and doing therein the office of a good Citizen, regarding more the good of his Country, than the disgrace which he had wrongfully sustained.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Fabius</hi> his approach, <hi>Hannibal</hi> retired: <hi>Fearing</hi> (as he said) <hi>to be well wet with the cloud that had hung so long upon the Hil-tops. Minutius</hi> forthwith submitted himself to <hi>Fabius,</hi> by whose favour he acknowledged, that his life was preserved. Thence forward the War went on slowly whilst <hi>Fabius</hi> his <hi>Dictatorship</hi> lasted, and the year following also when he had delivered up his charge to the Consuls, that followed his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</p>

hear the great commendations which were given to <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> by the principall Citizens, because the War was not finished, nor much done tending thereto: And this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was very helpfull to <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> in his suit for the Consulship; and farther to help him, he had a kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Bibius Herennius,</hi> Tribune of the People: He boldly affirmed that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was drawn into <hi>Italy,</hi> and suffered there to range at his pleasure by the Noblemen; that without a Plebeian Consul the War would never be ended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which perswasions the multitude were won to be wholly for <hi>Terentius,</hi> to the great vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nobles, who could not endure such an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start: But nothing could hinder the choise of <hi>Terentius:</hi> Wherefore the Nobles, (to ballast this hot-headed man) set up <hi>L. Aemilius Paulus,</hi> a gallant man and a brave Captain, to stand for the other Consuls place, and he easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried it.</p>
            <p>These new Consuls, <hi>Varro,</hi> and <hi>Paulus,</hi> omitted no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in preparing for the War, wherein, though <hi>Varro</hi> made the greater noise, boasting what wonders he would do if he could but once see <hi>Hannibal,</hi> yet the care, and Prudence of <hi>Paulus</hi> did tend much more towards the effecting of it. He wrote to the two old Consuls to forbear fighting, and yet to ply the <hi>Carthagians</hi> with daily Skirmishes, and so to weaken them by degrees, that when he and his Fellow Consul came with the new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they might find the four old Legions well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to the Enemy, and the Enemy well weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. These new Consuls raised an Army of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove eighty thousand Foot, and six thousand Horse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> all this while lay at <hi>Geryon,</hi> where all his provision, and store was. The <hi>Romanes,</hi> to be neer him, lodged about <hi>Canusium,</hi> laying up most of their provisions in the Castle of <hi>Cannae.</hi> This place <hi>Hannibal</hi> wan, and thereby not only furnished himself, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled his enemies to want many necessaries:<note place="margin">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55026:15"/>
fit for the service of the Horse. Of this mishap when <hi>Servilius</hi> had informed the Senate, it then seemed needfull to them to adventure a Battell with the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian,</hi> rather than to suffer him thus to root himself in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When all things were ready in the City, and the season of the year commodius, the two Consuls, with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my set forward against <hi>Hannibal.</hi> This was done with great solemnity: Sacrifices and solmne Vowes were made to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the other Gods, for good successe and Victory: and the Generals were accompanied with a great number that brought them out of the City, and dismissed them with Friendly leave-taking, and good wishes.</p>
            <p>These new Generals arriving at the Camp, dismissed <hi>M. Atilius,</hi> one of the last years Consuls, because of his age, and retained <hi>Servilius</hi> with them, as their Assistant. <hi>Aemilius</hi> laboured to encourage his men, telling them, that the enemy had stole all the former Victories by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes; that otherwise the <hi>Romans</hi> were far beyond them in Valour <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore he exhorted them to play the men and to do their best. This set them on fire to be dealing with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and herein <hi>Varro</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with them, longing for an oportunity to get the honour which he promised to himself, having now such a numerous Army By this means the <hi>Romans</hi> fell into a great inconvenience by the disagreement of of their Generals; <hi>Varro</hi> would fight, and <hi>Aemilius</hi> would not for the present,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Varro</hi> makes hast to fight.</note> hoping for better advantage ere long, when the enemy should be forced to dislodge out of the plain Country. The Consuls command in in turnes every day. <hi>Aemilius</hi> lodged six miles from <hi>Hannibal</hi> where the ground was uneven. <hi>Terentius</hi> the next day descended into the plaines, his Colleague be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching him to stay, but could not prevaile. He sat down neer to the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> who yet gave him but a rude welcome, and intertainment. The <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horse, and light Armature fell upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Vant-Courriers,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55026:15"/>
and put the whole Army into a tumult, whilst it was yet in its march; but the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were beaten off, though not without losse. The next day <hi>Aemilius,</hi> who could not securely draw back the Army, encamped upon the River <hi>Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>aved them, which must not be endured. When <hi>Aemilius</hi> perceived that he could not prevaile, he was carefull that what must be done, might be done well. Ten thousand Foot he caused to be left behind in the Camp, opposite to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> to the intent that <hi>Hannibal</hi> might be forced to do the like, or else when they were in fight, these might fall upon his Camp,<note place="margin">They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to fight.</note> and take it, with all the wealth therein, which would much distract the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> This done the Consuls drew forth their Army over the Water, and ranged them in order of Battell.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Hannibal</hi> was very glad of, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay, passed over the River also, leaving in his own Camp enow to defend it, and no more. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his men, he told them how fit the ground was wherein they were to fight; and that therefore they were to thank the Gods who had so infatuated the enemies as to choose such a place where the stronger in Horse was sure to pervail: Besides (said he) <hi>These are the men whom you have beaten as often as you have seen them: and now you are to fight for their Cities, and all the Riches that are in them, and ere many houres passe ye shall be Lords of all that the</hi> Romans <hi>enjoy.</hi> This set his men on fire to be at

               </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of spirit, and courage. He so marshalled his Army, that all hands were brought to fight, where every one might do the best service. His Darters, and Slingers he sent before to encounter the <hi>Roman Velites</hi>: His <hi>Africans</hi> Armed after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, made the two Wings, very deep in File. Between these he rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> armed, the first with broad Swords, and the other with short and well-pointed Blades. The <hi>Gauls</hi> were strong of Body, and furious in giving the Charge, but soon wearied, spending their violence at the first brunt. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were lesse eager but more wary. These <hi>Hannibal</hi> caused to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, leaving void the place wherein they had stood, and into which they might fall back, if they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardly pressed. Between the left Batallion by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver side, were the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse under <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>: On the right Wing was <hi>Maharbal</hi> with the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midian</hi> Horse. <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself with his Brother <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> led the Rear. His Army this day was ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse, and fourty Thousand Foot: His enemies had two to one against him in Foot, and he five to three against them in Horse.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Army was marshalled after their usuall manner. On the right hand were the <hi>Roman</hi> Horsemen under the Consul <hi>Paulus</hi>: On the left Wing was <hi>Var<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Battel. The Sun was newly risen, and offended neither part, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> having their faces Northward, and the <hi>Romans</hi> Southward.</p>
            <p>After some light Skirmishes between the two For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorns, <hi>Asdrubal</hi> brake in upon the Consul <hi>Paulus,</hi> and after a rough charge, and much execution done, the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse were overborn, and driven by plain force to a staggering recoil. When the Battels came to joyning, the <hi>Roman</hi> Legionaries found work enough, and more than enough to break that Body upon which at first they fell; yet at last <hi>Hannibals</hi> men were forced to a hasty retreat. But whilst the Legions, following their supposed Victory, rushed on upon those that stood before them; and thereby engaged themselves deeply within the principal strength of the enemy, the two <hi>African</hi> Battalions on either side, advanced so far, that getting beyond the Rear of them, they almost wholly inclosed them. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> having broken the Troops of the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse, followed them along upon the River side, beating downe, and killing most of them without regard of taking Prisoners. The Consul <hi>Paulus</hi> left his Horse, and cast himself amongst the Legions, as hoping by them to make good the day. But he failed of his expectation: Yet did he cheer up his men as well as he could both by Words, and Example, slaying ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with his own hands. The like did <hi>Hannibal</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in the same part of the Battel, but with better successe. For the Consul received a blow from a Sling that wounded him much, and though a Troop of <hi>Roman</hi> Gentlemen did their best to save him from further harm, yet was he so hardly laid at, that by wounds and weaknesse he was compelled to forsake his Horse: whereupon all his company also al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted.</p>

All this while <hi>Varro,</hi> with his associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55026:17"/>
in the left Wing, was marvelously troubled with <hi>Maharbal,</hi> and his <hi>Numidians</hi>; who beating up and down upon the great Sandy plain, raised a foul dust, which by a strong South wind, was driven into the eyes and mouths of the <hi>Romans.</hi> These using the advantage both of their number and lightnesse, wearied the Consul and his followers exceedingly, neither giving nor sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any charge, but continually making offers and then wheeling about. Yet at the first, they seemed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise him a happy day of it. For when the Battels were even ready to joyn, five hundred of these <hi>Numidians</hi> came pricking away from their fellows, with their Shieldes on their backs, as was the manner of those which yeilded, and throwing down their Armes, yielded themselves, <hi>Varro</hi> had no leasure then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them, but bad them to rest quietly behind his Army till all was done. These crafty march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants did as he bad them for a while, till they had oportunity to put their designe in execution. Under their Jackets they had short Swords, and Poniards, with which and other weapons that they gathered up of those that were slaine, they flew upon the hindmost of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whilst all eyes were bent another way, where they did much mischief,<note place="margin">

Thus <hi>Hannibal</hi> in a plain ground found meanes to lay an Ambush at the back of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>The last blow that put an end to all, was given by the same hand that gave the first. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> having routed and slain all the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse, save the company of <hi>Aemilius</hi> that joyned themselves to the Foot, did not stay to charge upon the face of the Legions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, fetching a compasse, he came up to the <hi>Numidians</hi> with whom he joyned, and gave upon <hi>Terentius.</hi> This fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cloud prognosticated a dismal storme; wherefore <hi>Terentius</hi> his followers, having wearied themselves much in doing little, and seeing more work towards than they were like to sustain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thought it their safest

            <p>When <hi>Hannibal</hi> had sacked the <hi>Roman</hi> Camps, and trused up the spoils, he dislodged and marched away to <hi>Samnium,</hi> finding a disposition in many People there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts to forsake the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to make aliance with him.

Barrels of Corn he sent floating down the River to relieve them, which, being discovered, came into <hi>Hannibals</hi> hands. <hi>Gracchus</hi> cast abundance of Nuts into the stream, which faintly sustained the Besieged. At length when all their food was spent, and whatsoever green thing grew under the Walls, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> plowed up the ground, and the besieged presently sowed it with Rape-seed. <hi>Hannibal</hi> admired their patience, and said, <hi>That he meant not to stay there till the Rapes were grown,</hi> and therefore, whereas he had intended to have made them an example for their obstinacy, he was now content to grant them their lives upon an easie ransome, and so quietly dismissed them. The time of the year now being come, <hi>Hannibal</hi> retired into <hi>Capua,</hi> where he wintered, and where (as some say) his Army was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with the pleasures and plently there, and made more effeminate than before.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent his Brother <hi>Mago</hi> to <hi>Carthage</hi> with the joyfull newes of this great Victory.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mago</hi> sent to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi>
               </note> He told the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Senate, with how many <hi>Roman</hi> Generals his Brother had fought, how many Consuls he had chased, wounded, or slain. How the <hi>Romans,</hi> who never used to shun a Battel, were now grown so cold that they thought their <hi>Dictator Fabius</hi> the only good Captain. That not without reason their spirits were thus abated, since <hi>Hannibal</hi> had slain above two hundred and six Thousand of them, and taken above fifty Thousand Prisoners. He told them how many States in <hi>Italy</hi> followed the Fortune of those great Victories. He told them that the War was even at an end, if they would follow it close and give the <hi>Romans</hi> no time of breathing. He wished them to consider that the War was carried into an enemies Country, that so many Battels had diminished his Brothers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that the Souldiers that had deserved so well, ought to be well rewarded, and that it was not good

to burden their new <hi>Italian</hi> Friends with exactions of mony, Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that these must be sent from <hi>Carthage.</hi> Lastly he caused the Gold Rings, taken from the fingers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights that were slain, to be powred out before them, which being measured, filled three Bushels.</p>
            <p>This errand of <hi>Mago</hi> for the present found extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary good welcome; And large supplies were voted to be sent to him:<note place="margin">Large sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> But his old enemy <hi>Hanno,</hi> obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and the too much Parsimony, of the Citizens was the cause that there was very little done, and that which was done came too late. However, <hi>Mago</hi> brings the news of the great supply which was decreed to be sent; which much rejoyced <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats. The Spring drew on when the supply was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but there came no more than a few Elephants, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> was forced to rest contented with them. Then did he take the Field, and sought to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self master of some good Haven Town that might serve to intertain the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet when it should arrive with the supplies. For this end he sent <hi>Himilco,</hi> who by the help of his good Friends the <hi>Brusians,</hi> won <hi>Petilia</hi>; he won also <hi>Concentia</hi> and <hi>Crotan,</hi> and the City of <hi>Locri,</hi> and many other places; only the Town of <hi>Rhegium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diverse Cities taken.</note> over against <hi>Sicily,</hi> held out against him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> at this time were in such a case, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> with a little help from <hi>Carthage,</hi> might have reduced them to great extremity. But his own Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens suffered him to languish with expectation of their promised supplies, which being still deferred from year to year,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Supplies come not.</note> caused as great opportunities to be lost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as a Conquerer could have desired. But whatsoever <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> thought, he was faign to apply himself to his <hi>Italian</hi> Friends, and to feed them with Hopes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to trifle away his time about <hi>Nola, Naples, Cumae,</hi> &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loath to weaken his Army by a hard Siege; that was to be reserved for a work of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55026:20"/>
Many offers he made upon <hi>Nola,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with bad successe. Once <hi>Mercellus</hi> fought a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel with him there, under the Walls of the City, having the Citizens to assist him, wherein <hi>Hannibal</hi> lost a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men; which was no great marvil, his forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then divided, and imployed in sundry parts of <hi>Italy</hi> at once.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>T. Sempronius Gracchus,</hi> and <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus,</hi> the late famous <hi>Dictator,</hi> were chosen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls. But <hi>Fabius</hi> was detained at <hi>Rome</hi> about matters of Religion, or Superstition rather, wherewith the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was commonly, especially in the times of danger, very much troubled, so <hi>Gracchus</hi> alone, with a Consular Army, waited upon <hi>Hannibal</hi> amongst the <hi>Campanes,</hi> not able to meet him in the Field, yet attentive to all occasions that should be presented. The Slaves, that lately had been Armed, were a great part of his followers. These and the rest of his men <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> continually trained,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gracchus</hi> his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and had not a greater care to make his Army skilfull in the exercises of War, than in keeping it from quarrels that might arise by their upbrading one another with their base condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gracchus</hi> at this time had a bickering with the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> upon whom he came at unawars,<note place="margin">The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puans</hi> beaten.</note> and slew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two thousand of them, and took their Camp, but staid not long to rifle it for fear of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that lay not far off. By this his Providence he escaped a greater losse, than he brought upon the <hi>Capuans</hi>: For when <hi>Hannibal</hi> heard how things went, he presently march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither, hoping to find these young Souldiers and Slaves busied in loading themselves with the Booty: But they were all gotten safe into <hi>Cumae,</hi> which so angred <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that at the earnest request of the <hi>Capuans,</hi> he assailed it the next day: Much labour, and with ill success he spent about this Town. He raised a woodden Tower, and brought it close to the Walls thereby to assault it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cuma</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.</note> but they within built a higher Tower, whence they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55026:21"/>
made resistance, and found meanes to set <hi>Hannibals</hi> Tower on fire, and whilst the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were busy in quenching the fire, they issued out, charged them valiantly and drove them to their Trenches. The Consul wisely sounded a retreat in time, or <hi>Hannibal</hi> had requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. The day following, <hi>Hannibal</hi> presented Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel to them, but <hi>Gracchus</hi> refused it: Seeing therefore no liklyhood to prevail,<note place="margin">The Siege raised.</note> he raised his Siege and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Fabius,</hi> the other Consul, took the Field, and recovered some small Towns that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had taken, and punished the Inhabitants severely for their revolt, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Army was too small to Garrison all the Towns that had yeilded to them, and with all, to abide (as it must do) strong in the Field. Wherefore <hi>Hannibal,</hi> attending the supply from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> that would enable him to strik at <hi>Rome</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, was driven in the mean time to alter his course of War; and instead of making (as he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done) a general invasion upon the whole Country, he was faign to wait upon occasions, that grew daily more commodious to the enemy, than to him.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>The People of <hi>Rome</hi> were very intentive upon the work they had in hand, they continued <hi>Fabius</hi> in his Consulship, and joyned with him <hi>Cladius Marcellus.</hi> Of these two, <hi>Fabius</hi> was called the <hi>Shield,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> the <hi>Roman Sword.</hi> The great Name of these Consuls, and the great preparations which they made, put the <hi>Campans</hi> in fear that <hi>Capua</hi> it self should be besieged, wherefore at their earnest request <hi>Hannibal</hi> came from <hi>Arpi,</hi> and having comforted his Friends, on a sudden he fell upon <hi>Puteoli,</hi> a Sea-town of <hi>Campania,</hi> about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he spent three dayes in vain, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing six thousand in Garrison, wherefore he left it,

            <p>In the mean time <hi>Hanno</hi> made a journy against <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neventum,</hi> where <hi>T. Gracchus</hi> met him.<note place="margin">A Battel</note> 
               <hi>Hanno</hi> had with him about seventeen thousand Foot, <hi>Brutians,</hi> and <hi>Lucans,</hi> besides twelve hundred Horse, most of them <hi>Numidians</hi> and <hi>Moors.</hi> Four hours he held the <hi>Romans</hi> work ere it could be perceived to which side victory would incline. But <hi>Gracchus</hi> his Souldiers, which were most of them Slaves, had received from him a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory denunciation, that this day or never they must pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase their Liberty, by bringing every man an enemies head. The sweet reward of Liberty was so desireable, that they feared no danger in earning it, though the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off their enemies Heads troubled them exceedingly, which <hi>Gracchus</hi> perceiving, proclaimed that they should cast away the Heads, assuring them that they should have their liberty presently after the Battel, if they wan they day.

               <hi>Fulvius</hi> returned back to the Siege of <hi>Capua,</hi> which now began to suffer want. And faign they would have sent again to <hi>Hannibal</hi> but that all wayes were intercepted. The truth is, <hi>Hannibal</hi> had already done his best, and now began to faint under the burden of that War, wherein (as he afterwards protested) he was vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Hanno</hi> and his Partizans in the Senate of <hi>Carthage,</hi> rather than by any force of the <hi>Romans.

So a Gate was opened whereat a <hi>Roman</hi> Legion entred, disarmed the Citizens, and made the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Prisoners; The Senators were laid in Irons; and presently after, <hi>Fulvius</hi> caused all the <hi>Campane</hi> Prisoners to be bound to stakes, and scourged a good while with Rods,<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> after which he struck off their heads.

            <p>
               <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Levinus</hi> being chosen Consuls, <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> went into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> was to make War with <hi>Hannibal</hi>: They were busy in raising Souldiers, but wanted mony extreamly; many wayes were proposed

how to supply that want. At last the Consuls said,<note place="margin">The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick wants supplied.</note> that no preswasions would be so effectual with the People, as good examples; wherefore they propounded and it was presently resolved, that every one should bring and put into the Treasury all the mony, Jewels, and Plate that they had, and none reserve more than one Salt, and a Bowle wherewith to make their offerings to the Gods: as also a Ring for himself: and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther small Ornaments for his Wife and Children; and this was accordingly done by all, with much cheerfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>Then went forth <hi>Marcellus</hi> against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whose Army was now greatly diminished by long and hard service.

After this the Consul took two Cities of the <hi>Samnites,</hi> wherein he slew above three thousand of <hi>Hannibals</hi> men; which <hi>Hannibal</hi> could not prevent, the <hi>Romans</hi> being grown stronger in the Field than he. But now came newes that <hi>Massanissa</hi> was at <hi>Carthage,</hi> with five thousand Horse, ready to set sail for <hi>Spain,</hi> whither, when he came, he was to accompany <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Hannibal</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi> This did not more comfort <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> and his followers, than it terified the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Hannibal</hi> was informed that <hi>Cn. Fulvius,</hi> a <hi>Roman Prator,</hi> lay neer to <hi>Herdonea,</hi> to get the Town by practice: <hi>Hannibal</hi> made great marches thitherward, and when he came, offered Battel to <hi>Fulvius,</hi>

The <hi>Roman</hi> Legions made good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance a while, till they were compassed round with the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horse: then fell they to rout, and a great slaughter was made of them; <hi>Fulvius,</hi> with

twelve Collonels, and about thirteen thousand were slain, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> set <hi>Herdonea</hi> on fire because it was appointed to be delivered up to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcellus</hi> hearing this, hasted thither: At <hi>Venusia</hi> they met,<note place="margin">A Battel</note> and fought a Battel from morning till the night parted them, and ended with uncertain Victory.

            <p>Then <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Q.

But <hi>Marcellus</hi> was so importunate, that he could not be rid of him, wherefore <hi>Hannibal</hi> bad his men to beat soundly this hotspur <hi>Roman</hi> Captain of whom he could not be rid till he had let him bloud. Then followed a Battel wherein <hi>Hannibal</hi> had the victory,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> took six Ensigns and slew about three thousand of the <hi>Romans.</hi>

               <hi>Marcellus</hi> rated his men exceedingly, and called them cowards, which did so shame them, that they asked pardon, and desired him to lead them forth again against the enemy. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was angry to see that nothing would make them quiet, and so they fought again, and though the <hi>Romans</hi> had the better of it, fighting very desparately, yet they lost so many men that they had little cause to boast of the Victory: Only this advantage they had, that hereby <hi>Fabius</hi> got time to prosecute his Siege at <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> without disturbance. <hi>Fulvius</hi> the other Consul this while took in diverse Towns of the <hi>Hirpines, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

He caused the chief of <hi>Metapont</hi> to write to <hi>Fabius</hi>; offering to betray it into his hand. These Letters were sent by two young men of the City, who did their errand so well, that the Consul wrote back, and appointed the day when they should expect him. <hi>Hannibal</hi> being glad of this, at leasure made ready his Ambushes for the wary <hi>Fabius</hi>; but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hindred him from coming, and so a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him, thinking it enough to hinder him from joyning with his succours. There was he advertised of <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi> approach by letters that were going to <hi>Hannibal</hi> which he intercepted: wherefore he resolved that it was better to run some desparate adventure than to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to joyn together. He therefore took six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot and a thousand Horse, all of his choisest men, and away he posted as fast as he could to assist his Fellow Consul. <hi>Livy</hi> at that time lay encamped neer to <hi>Serea Gallica,</hi> and <hi>Asdrubal</hi> within half a mile of him.

So he dislodged secretly by night, intending to get over the River <hi>Metaurus</hi>: but being misled by his Guids, he had not gone far before: <hi>Nero</hi> was at his heels with all the Horse, which hindred him from going any farther, and the other Consul fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with the Legions in order of Battel. <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> seeing a necessity to fight, omitted no care, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection. His <hi>Gauls</hi> he placed in the left wing upon a Hill,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> which the Enemy could not ascend without much difficulty.

            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> at this time had no Captain of note in their City, nor a better Army than of raw Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were levied in hast. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> the Son of <hi>Gesco,</hi> that was lately chased out of <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Scipio,</hi> was their best man of War.

Thus <hi>Scipio</hi> became Master of the Field, and took in diverse Cities, and sent <hi>Massanissa</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> after <hi>Syphax</hi> into his Kingdom, whom they beat again, took him Prisoner, and partly by fair meanes, and partly by foule, became Masters of most of his Kingdom, which <hi>Scipio</hi> bestowed upon <hi>Massanissa.</hi> And this was the first time that the <hi>Romans</hi> took upon them to make Kings.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were extreamly dismayed, when they heard this newes, and for the calamity which had befaln their good Friend <hi>Syphax,</hi> and when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that <hi>Massanissa,</hi> their immortall enemy, had gotten possession of his Kingdom.

               <hi>Scipio</hi> knew well in what a poor case <hi>Rome</hi> then was, and how unable to defray the charge of the War if it should be continued, and therefore he was willing to grant them Peace upon these conditions.

            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> was far the weaker in Horse and a great part of his Army were raw Souldiers, yet his Lords of <hi>Carthage</hi> would brook no delay. He encouraged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his men as was most suitable to their qualities. To the Mercenaries he promised bountifull rewards. The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> he threatned with inevitable servitude if they lost they day: but especially he animated his old fellow Souldiers by the many Victories which they had gotten over those that far exceeded them in number. He bad them looke on their Enemies and see whether they were not by far fewer than that huge Army they had slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at <hi>Canna.</hi> He bad them remember that it was the Father of this <hi>Scipio</hi> whom they had made to run away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore he intreated them, upon whose virtue he meant wholy to repose himself, that they would strive that day to make good their honour, and to purchase the fame of <hi>Men Invincible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Armies drew neer, the <hi>Numidian</hi> Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on both sides began to Skirmish: the Trumpets, and other instruments sounded to Battel.<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> 
               <hi>Hannibals</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants (which were alwayes an uncertain kind of help) were to break upon the <hi>Romans</hi>: But some of them ran back upon their own Horse, which they so disordered, that <hi>Massanissa,</hi> taking the advantage, before they could re-ally, charged them, and drave them quite out of the Field. The rest of these Beasts, made a great spoile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Roman Velites,</hi> but being wounded, they ran back upon the right point of their own Battel, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horse that were in that wing; which gave such advantage to the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse, that charging them when they were in disorder, they drave them away likewise. Then did the Battels of Foot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and ran one at the other, and the Mercenaries at the first seemed to have the better of the <hi>Romans</hi>: But at length the <hi>Roman</hi> Discipline prevailed against boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous strength. And whereas the <hi>Romans,</hi> were second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55026:32"/>
by their Friends, these Mercenaries received no help from those that should have seconded them. For the new raised <hi>Africans,</hi> when they saw the Mercenaries give back, they retired also, which made the hired Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers think themselves betrayed, whereupon they declined the fight. The <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Battel was herewith more terrified then before, so that refusing to give way to the Mercenaries they sell out amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and forbore to make head against their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Thus were many of them beaten down and slain through their own indiscretion: And this gave the <hi>Romans</hi> such advantage that the made a great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and Mercenaries, who could neither fight nor easily fly. Such as could, ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who kept his ground and would not stir to help these run-wayes.</p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Scipio</hi> advance against <hi>Hannibal</hi> who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him after an other manner than ever he had been received in his life before. All the former dayes work, seemed but a Pastime in comparison of this. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were incouraged because they had prevailed all the day before they were also far more in number: But <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi> old Blades were fresh and the better men. They fought with such obstinate resolution that no man gave back one Foot, but rather chose to die than to lose their ground, so that for a long time the Victory was uncertain: But the return of <hi>Massanissa</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> with the Horse from the pursute of the Enemies, was to the <hi>Romans</hi> most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and in a needfull time.

when it came to be collected, there was pitious lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongst the People, the <hi>Roman</hi> yoak begining to pinch them already, that some of the Senators could not forbear weeping; but <hi>Hannibal</hi> could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from laughter: For which <hi>Asdrubal Haedus</hi> (one of <hi>Hanno's</hi> faction) checked him, saying, that it ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed him to laugh, since he had been the cause why all others did weep.

For you should have wept when you gave up your Ships and Elephants, and when you bound up your hands from use of Armes without the good leave of the</hi> Romans. <hi>This miserable condition keeps us under, and holds us in assured sevitude. But of these things you had no feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Now when a little mony is wrung from you, you are very sensible of that, God grant that the time come not, wherein you shall acknowledge, that it was the least part of your misery for which you have shed these teares.</hi>

He found also that they had robbed the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, which caused the Taxes to be laid upon the common People, whereof he made such plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that they were compelled to restore with shame

other things, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into their hands. <hi>Hannibal</hi> getting an incling of this,<note place="margin">He flies to <hi>Prusias.</hi>
               </note> fled to <hi>Gortina</hi> in <hi>Creet,</hi> where he lived a long time very quietly, but at length he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the envy of many by reason of his great wealth, whereupon he filled certain great chests with Lead, and deposited them in the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> there, as if he kept the Treasure for a dead lift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the People, having such a Pledge as that of him, looked lesse after him: But he in the mean time stole away to <hi>Prusias,</hi> King of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first molten his Gold, and powered it into some hollow Statues of Brasse, which he carried away with him.</p>
            <p>Shortly after there fell a War between <hi>Prusias,</hi> and <hi>Eumenes,</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus, Prusias</hi> being encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to break his League and to make War upon him, by his confidence in <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whom he had there to mannage his War for him. The War therefore grew hot betwixt them, both by Land and Sea. But <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> by the assistance of the <hi>Romans,</hi> overpowred <hi>Prusias</hi> in both: And whereas <hi>Prusias</hi> was but weak of himself, <hi>Hannibal</hi> procured him the assistance of some other Kings and States, and those of very Warlike Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and amongst them the aide of <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who sent him <hi>Philocles</hi> his General, with a very considerable Army to help him.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Prusias</hi> had received an overthrow from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> by land, he sought to try his Fortune by Sea, wherein yet he was too weak for him: wherefore <hi>Hannibal</hi> advised him to try whether he could not do that by Policy, which by plain force he was not able to effect. He put therefore a multitude of all sorts of Serpents into Earthen Pitchers, to be hurled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the Enemies Ships when they were in fight: giving order to the Souldiers and Sea-men to set all upon the Ship wherein <hi>Eumenes</hi> himself was, and to defend themselves from the rest as well as they
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55026:34"/>
could: and that he might the more certainly know in which Ship <hi>Eumenes</hi> was, he sent an Herauld be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand with a Letter, containing nothing but a meer flout to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> and full of abuses to his Person. Whenas therefore <hi>Prusias</hi> his men came to it, they fought neither against great nor small, but on-against the Ship wherein <hi>Eumenes</hi> was, whereupon he he was fain to seek his safety by flight; yet had he perished had he not thrust in upon the next shore, where he had placed, for a relief upon all occasions, a company of his men.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Eumenes</hi> his other Ships, when they pressed hard upon the Enemy, they let fly amongst them their Earthen Pitchers full of Snakes, which at first seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them a ridiculous thing: but when the Pitchers, falling upon the Decks, brake in pieces, out flew the Snakes, so that they could stir no where in the Ships by reason of the Serpents, whereby they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves no lesse annoied by their stings, than with the Arrowes of their Enemies, which caused them to give over fighting, and to fly to their Camp which was upon the Shoar.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Hannibal</hi> by this trick, got the better of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> in that fight. Nor then only, but also in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other encounters; and by one Stratagem or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ever put <hi>Eumenes</hi> to the worst.

But <hi>Hannibal</hi> having before found cause to suspect the faith of <hi>Prusias,</hi> had made some secret sallies under ground to save himself from any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, or sudden assault. But finding now that all passages were shut up against him, he had recourse to his last remedy, which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to put in practice, as well to frustrate his enemies from their Triumphing over him, as to save himself from their torture and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hands, who, as he well knew, would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respect his famous enterprises, his Honour, nor his Age.

But for thee <hi>Theanor,</hi> I commend thy good will, because its honest and virtuous, but I tell thee thou bringest Physick to them that are not sick. Admit that thou, hearing we had been in Wars, hadst brought us Armes to defend us, and when on the contrary thou hadst found us quiet, and at peace with all our neighbours, thou wouldst not have thought fit to bestow these Armes, and leave them with those that had no need of them. Even so, thou art come to relive our poverty as though it were a burden to us, whereas on the contrary, its an easy and pleasant thing to us to carry, and we are glad we have it in our Houses amongst us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have no need of Armes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or mony against that which doth us no hurt at all. But tell thy brethren that they use their goods very honestly: and also that they have Friends here which use their Poverty as well: and as for the intertainment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and burial of <hi>Lysis,</hi> he hath himself fully recompenced us, having taught us, amongst many other good lessons, not to be afraid of Poverty, nor to be grieved to see it amongst us. <hi>Theanor</hi> having made some reply about the good and evill of Riches, and told him that as Poverty was not evil in it self, so neither was Riches to be had in contempt and dispised: No truly (said <hi>Epaminondas</hi>) yet considering with my self that we have a World of covetous desires, some natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall that are born with us, and bred in our flesh by the

Yet we must use continuall force and oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against our concupisences which are strangers to us, to quench them, and by all possible meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, and subdue them in us.</p>
            <p>And when this is done, there is also (said he) an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of justice against greedy Covetousnesse, and a desire of getting, which is not, not to go rob our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Houses, nor, not to rob men by the high way, nor not to betray our Friends, or Country for mony: for such an one opposeth, not covetousnesse, but pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, its Law, or feare that bridleth his covetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to offend: But that man that ofttimes willingly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staines from just gaines, he it is that by exercise keeps himself far from unjust, and unlawfull taking of mony. For it is impossible in great pleasures that are wicked and dangerous, the Soul should contain it self from lusting after them, unlesse formerly, being oft at his choise to use them, he had contemned them. Its not easy to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them, nor to refuse great Riches when they are offered, unlesse a man long before hath killed in him this covetous desire of getting, the which, besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other habits and actions, is still greedily bent shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to gaine, pleasiing himself in the pursuit of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, hardly forbearing to wrong an other so he may benefit himself. But that man that disdaines to receive gifts from his Friends, and refuseth Presents offered him by Kings, and that hath rejected the bounty of Fortune, puting by all covetous desires of glistering Treasures laid before him, he shall never be tempted to do that which is unjust, nor shall his mind be troubled, but he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

himself quietly to do any thing that is honest, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an upright heart, finding nothing in it but that which is good and commendable. Yet was the Life of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> far mor excellent than his discourse, as will appear by that which follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedon,</hi> the <hi>Cizicenian,</hi> at the request of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> promised to winne <hi>Epaminondas</hi> to take the <hi>Persians</hi> part. To effect this, he came to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and brought a great masse of Gold with him, and with three Thousand Crowns of it, he bribed a young man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mycethus,</hi> who was greatly beloved by <hi>Epaminondas.</hi> This young man went to him and told him the occasion of the other mans coming to <hi>Thebes</hi>: But <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omedon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> said to him, I have no need of mony: If the King of <hi>Persia</hi> wish well to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> I am at his service without taking one penny:<note place="margin">His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Riches.</note> If he hath any other meaning, he hath not Gold nor Silver e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough wherewith to corrupt me: For I will not sell the love which I bear to my Country for all the Gold in the World: and as for thee that dost now tempt me, not knowing me, but judging me like unto thy self, I pardon thee for this time, but get thee quickly out of the City lest thou corrupt others, having failed to prevail over me: and for thee <hi>Mycethus,</hi> deliver him his mony again, which if thou dost not presently, I will send thee before a Justice.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Diomedon</hi> besought him that he would let him go away in safety, and carry that with him which he brought thither: Yea (said <hi>Epaminondas</hi>) but it shall not be for thy sake, but for my honour-sake, lest thy Gold and Silver being taken from thee, some man should accuse me that I had a share in that privately which I had refused openly. Saying further, whither wouldst thou that I should cause thee to be conveyed? To <hi>Athens,</hi> said <hi>Diomedon</hi>: This was done accordingly, and he had a strong convoy sent with him, and that he might not be troubled by the way, betwixt the Gates of <hi>Thebes</hi> and the Haven wherein he was to imbark himself, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> gave <hi>Chabrias</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> charge of him,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55026:40"/>
that he should see him safe at his jorneys end.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</note>Though <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was very Poor, yet would he never take any thing of his Citizens or Friends: and being so inured to poverty, he was enabled to bear it the more patiently by his study of Philosophy. For on a time, having the leading of an Army of the <hi>Thebans</hi> into the Country of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> he borrowed five Crownes of a Citizen for the defraying of his necessary chatges in that Journey. <hi>Pelopidas</hi> being a man of great wealth and his very good Friend, could never possibly force upon him any part of his Goods, but he rather learned of him to love Poverty. For <hi>Epaminondas</hi> taught him to think it an honour to go plainly in his Apparrel, to eat mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, to take paines willingly, and in War to fight lusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Yet when he had occasion to relieve others, he would make bold with his Friends goods, which in such cases were common to him. If any of his Citizens were taken Prisoners by the Enemy, or if any Friend of his had a Daughter to be married,<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> and was not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow her, he used to call his Friends together, and to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse every one of them at a certain summe, after which he brought him before them who was to receive the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and told him how much every one had bestowed upon him, that he might returne thanks to them all.</p>
            <p>But once he went far beyond this: For he sent a poor Friend of his to a Rich Citizen of <hi>Thebes</hi> to ask of him six hundred Crownes, and to tell him that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> desired him to let him have them. The Citizen being amazed at his demand, went to <hi>Epaminondas</hi> to know what he meant to charge him so deeply, as to make him to give six hundred Crowns to the other? It is (said <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi>) because this man, being an honest man, is poor, and thou who hast robbed the Commonwealth of much, art rich.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</note>He lived so soberly, and was such an enemy to all superfluity and excesse, that being on a time invited to Supper to one of his Neighbours, when he saw great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of dainty meats, made dishes, and perfumes, he
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55026:40"/>
said unto him, I thought thou hadst made a Sacrifice by this excesse and superfluity, and so immediatly went his way. The like also he spake of his own Table, saying, that such an Ordinary, was never guilty of Traytors, and Treason. On a time being at a Feast with some of his Companions, he drank Vinegar, and when they asked him what he meant by it, and whether he drank it for his health? I know not (said he) but this I am sure of, it puts me in remembrance how I live at home. Now it was not that his stomach was an enemy to dainty meats, or that he lived so penuriously at home, for he was marvelous noble minded: But he did it, that by his strict and unreprovable life, he might bridle and restraine many insolencies and disorders which then raigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and to reduce them to the former temperance of their Ancestors.</p>
            <p>Upon a time, a Cook giving up an account to him and his Fellows of their ordinary expences for certain dayes, he could find fault with nothing but the quantity of Oyle that was spent: which his Companions marvelling at; Tush (said he) it is not the expence which offends me, but because we have powred in so much Oyle into our Bodies. The City of <hi>Thebes</hi> upon an occasion made a publick Feast, where they were very merry, and jolly: But on the Contrary, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> went up and down without Oyle and perfumes, or decked with brave ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, seeming very sad: Some of his Familiar Friends meeting him in this posture, and wondering at him, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him why he walked so alone,<note place="margin">His Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</note> and ill apparrelled through the City? Because (said he) you may in the meane time freely and safely drink your selves drunk, and make merry, taking thought for nothing.</p>
            <p>His modesty also was such, that it would in no wise suffer him to seek advancement, but on the contrary he withdrew himself from Government, that he might with the more quiet apply himself to the study of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy. It happened upon a time that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> intreated aide of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who at that time were in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55026:41"/>
League with them, and acordingly they sent them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Foot Companies: at which time <hi>Epaminondas</hi> being about thirty five years old, Armed himself and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them. At this time it was, that that intimate Friendship began betwixt <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and him, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued even to the end of their lives. These two being in a Battel the one by the other against the <hi>Arcatians,</hi> whom they had in front against them in the plaines of <hi>Mantinea,</hi> it fell out that one of the points of the Battel of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in which they were, retired, and many fled: But these two resolved rather to dy than fly, and accordingly they stood to it gallantly,<note place="margin">His Valor.</note> till <hi>Pelopidas</hi> being wounded in seven places, fell down upon a heap of dead Bodies. Then did <hi>Epaminondas</hi> (though he took him for dead) step resolutly before him to defend his Body and Armes, he alone fighting against many, resolving rather to die in the place than to leave <hi>Pelopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> amongst the dead men, until that himself being thrust into the breast with a Pike, and wounded in the Arme with a Sword, was ready to faint: at which time Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence so ordered it, that King <hi>Agesipolis</hi> came on with the other point of the Battel, and saved them both.</p>
            <p>Not long after the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> by a stratagem, won the strong Castle of <hi>Thebes</hi> called <hi>Cadmaea,</hi> and put a strong Garrison into it, and gave the Government of the City of <hi>Thebes</hi> unto <hi>Archias, Philippus,</hi> and <hi>Leontidas,</hi> authors of all the mischief:<note place="margin">Tyran's in <hi>Thebes.</hi>
               </note> whereupon, to avoid their Tyranny, <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> and many others were fain to save themselves by flight, upon which they were banished by sound of Trumpet. But as for <hi>Epaminondas</hi> they as yet said nothing to him, but let him alone in the City: for he was contemned as a man of no account, because he was so much given to his Book: and if he should have any mind to stir against them, yet they judged he could could do nothing because of his Poverty.</p>
            <p>Whilest <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and his Companions were at <hi>Athens,</hi> they laid a plot to free <hi>Thebes</hi> from those Tyrants: But <hi>Epaminondas</hi> not making a shew of any thing, had devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55026:41"/>
an other way to effect it, by raising the hearts and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of the young men of the City. For when they went out to play, and exercise themselves, he alwayes found out a way to make them wrestle with the <hi>Lacedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi>; and when he saw the <hi>Lacedomonians</hi> throw them, and give them shrewd falls, they being the stronger, he would prvately rebuke the <hi>Thebans</hi> and tell them, that it was a shame for them to suffer the <hi>Lacedomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to set their feet upon their throats for want of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, who yet were not half so strong, and boiste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ous as themselves were. All<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this while <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers went on in their Plot,<note place="margin">His pru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dence.</note> and had such good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that one night they got privily into the City of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes</hi> and met at <hi>Charons</hi> House about forty eight in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> knew all this well enough, and at night some took him aside and endeavoured to perswade him to joyn with them in delivering their City from these Tyrants, to whom he answered, that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken order with his Friends, and <hi>Gorgidas,</hi> to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a readiness upon any such occasion, but for his own part he would not have a hand in putting any of his Citizens to death, unless they were legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: yet (said he) if you will make an attempt for the delivery of the City so as that it be without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or blood shed, I will joyn with you with all my heart: But if you will persevere in your former deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, pray you let me alone, pure, and not defiled with the blood of my Citizens, that being blameless I may take hold of another occasion which may tend more to the good of the common wealth.

for the People of <hi>Thebes,</hi> that some be left free, and blamelesse of these murthers, and guiltlesse of all that should be done in the fury of this action.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> still applyed himself to his Book: yet at last he was put forwards by <hi>Pammenes,</hi>

            <p>Upon a time <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> King of <hi>Lacaedemon</hi> entered into <hi>Boeotia</hi> with an Army of twenty thousand Foot, and five thousand Horse, wherewith he harrased and spoiled all the plain Country, and presented Battel to the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> in the open Fields, which yet they would not accept of, finding themselves the weaker: Howbeit, they defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves so well by the assistance of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the wise conduct of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> that they caused <hi>Agesilaus</hi> to return home with his Army.

            <p>Not long after, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> returned with their former Army to make War with the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seized upon certain straights, and places of advantage, so blocked up the way, that they could not over run the Country, and spoile it as they had done before; yet did <hi>Agesilaus</hi> so molest, and trouble them, that at last it came to a main Battel that held long, and was very cruel:<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> and though at the first <hi>Agesilaus</hi> had the better, yet the <hi>Thebans</hi> charged him so furiously, that at the length he himself was wounded and forced to retire, being well paid for teaching the <hi>Thebans</hi> Millitary Discipline. And this was the first time that the <hi>Thebans</hi> knew themselves to be as strong and lusty as the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they Triumphed in signe of Victory, and from that time forward, they grew more couragious to make head against the Enemy, and to present them battel.

            <p>At another time they went with a great number of chosen men before the City of <hi>Orobomene,</hi> where yet they prevailed not, because there was a strong Garrison of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> that sallied out upon them, and the fight was very sharp betwen them: yet, though the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> were far more in number,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> the <hi>Thebans</hi> gave them the overthrow, which never happened to them before.

               </note> wherein it was especially agreed, and concluded, that all the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> should be free, and use their own Lawes: and Commissioners were sent abroad to withdraw all the Garrisons where any were kept. Unto this the <hi>Thebans</hi> only refused to agree, that every Town should severally capitulate for it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing that the Towns in the Country of <hi>Boeotia</hi> should be comprehended under the City of <hi>Thebes</hi>: but the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> mightily opposed themselves against this, and <hi>Calistratus,</hi> one of their Orators, made a notable Oration about it before all the States of <hi>Greece. Epaminondas</hi> on the contrary, made an excellent and vehement speech in defence of the right of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> insomuch as this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy was left undecided, and the Treaty of Peace was universally agreed to amongst all the other <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> are excepted.</note> the <hi>Thebans</hi> only excepted, who were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in it.</p>
            <p>At this time the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who had long contended amongst themselves about the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>Greece,</hi> now agreed, that the one should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by Sea, and the other by Land: And therefore they could not endure that the <hi>Thebans</hi> should aspire to be chief, which made them seek to dismember the other Towns of <hi>Boeotia</hi> from them, the rather, for that the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> being strong and lusty of Body, and much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by their late Victories over the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> would now contend with them for their superiority, having a wonderfull confidence in the Wisdom and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55026:43"/>
of their Captaines, especially of <hi>Epaminondas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matters resting thus doubtfull, the Citizens of <hi>Plataees,</hi> a Town of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> were desirous to enter into League with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> promising that if they would send them Souldiers, they would put the Town into their hands: But the Governours of <hi>Boeotia</hi> having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of it, and being desirous to prevent the <hi>Athenians,</hi> brought a party of Souldiers against it, who came before <hi>Plataees</hi> before the Citizens heard any newes of them, so that part of them were surprised in the Field by the Horsmen, and the rest fled into the Town: where having no aid, they were faign to accept of such tearmes as it pleased the <hi>Thebans</hi> to grant them, which were, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to depart the Town with bag and baggage,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plataees</hi> destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and never to returne again into the Country of <hi>Boeotia.</hi> Then did they raze the City to the ground, and saked the Town of <hi>Thespies</hi> which also was at enmity with them.</p>
            <p>The Ambassadours of <hi>Persia</hi> again solicited the <hi>Greeks</hi> to a Generall Peace, and Commissioners from every Town were to meet at <hi>Sparta</hi> about it. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was yet scarce known, having laboured to conceal himself. and in all his exploits of War, had ever preferred the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his great Friend, and Companion in Armes, <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> before himself. He was now chosen by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Thebans</hi> to go to <hi>Sparta,</hi> where, finding that the other Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners did much comply with <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> he spake boldly, and plainly, not only in behalf of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> but for all <hi>Greece</hi> also: making it evident to all,<note place="margin">Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> that War still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the greatnesse of <hi>Sparta</hi> only, which kept all the other Towns of <hi>Greece</hi> under. He therefore advised them to establish a firme Peace, which would last the longer, when all comprized in it should be equals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agesilaus</hi> perceiving all the Commissioners to be very attentive to and well pleased with this speech, he asked him aloud, if he thought it just, and equal, that all <hi>Boeotia</hi> should be set at liberty. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> resently,<note place="margin">And cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asked him, if he thought it not also iust and reasonable that all <hi>Laconia</hi> should be set at liberty? Thereupon <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silaus,</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:55026:44"/>
in great anger, stood up, and commanded him to answer plainly, if they should not restore all the Towns in <hi>Boeotia</hi> to their Liberty? and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> answered him as before. This so displeased <hi>Agesilaus</hi> (who had an old grudge to the <hi>Thebans</hi>) that immediatly he put their Name out of the List of those that should be comprized within the Treaty of Peace, and proclaimed open War against them, and now there was no remedy but the <hi>Thebans</hi> must bear the whole brunt alone, for there was no one Town that durst send them any aid, because they were all sworn to the Peace, insomuch as all judged them to be utterly undone. Friends pittied there estate, and their enemies rejoyced, verily believing that they could never stand before the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> send King <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> with an Army towards <hi>Thebes,</hi> who being come neer to <hi>Chaeronea</hi> with ten thousand Foot, and a thousand Horse, he pitched, his Camp there staying for his Allies. The <hi>Thebans</hi> being informed of the approach of the enemy, chose <hi>Epaminondas</hi> to be their Captain Generall, giving him the charge of this War, with six other Counsellers to be assisting to him. Now there came Oracles to <hi>Thebes</hi> from all parts; some promising Victory, and others threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening their overthrow; and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> commanded them to set those on the right hand of the chaire for Orations, that promised Victory, and the other on the left hand, which being so disposed of, he gat up into the chaire, and said to his Citizens, <hi>If you will be obedient to your Captains, and valiant against your enemies, these O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoles on the right hand belong to you:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> 
               <hi>But if through faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of heart, ye refuse dangers, those on the left hand shall be your Portion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did he list the Names of all the <hi>Thebans</hi> which were able to bear Armes, and chose out of some parts of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> such as he thought fittest for the Wars. His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence exceedingly cheered up his Army, and all the time that he was Captain, the <hi>Thebans</hi> never saw in their Campany of those which they call <hi>sudden feares.</hi> He used
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55026:44"/>
to say, that there was no Death more honest and desirable than to die in the Wars, and that the body of a Souldier should be hardened to endure any labour or paines. He could not abide fat men,<note place="margin">Fat men cashired.</note> and therefore cashired a whole Company of them as unprofitable burdens in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. He had in all, but six thousand fighting men: and as they marched forwards, they met with some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky signes, as many esteemed them; but he valued them not, thinking that a resolution to fight in a good cause, ought to be much stronger, and of more force to raise up in him good Hope, than these evill signes that appeared, to make him fear the worst.</p>
            <p>As he was marching towards the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> they heard it Thunder, and they that were neer him, asked him what that meant. He answered, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokened that the Enemies braines were troubled, and beclouded, who, having places of advantage hard by them, yet encamped in the plaines. Indeed the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> waited there for their Allies, who yet failed them. For all of them, having at leasure considered of the speech of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> at <hi>Sparta,</hi> began to distast the ambition of the <hi>Lacedemonians. Epaminondas</hi> seeing his advantage, caused his Army to march with speed,<note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and wan the straights by the City of <hi>Coronea,</hi> and encamped there: <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> understanding that the <hi>Thebans</hi> had possessed themselves of that passe, despairing to recover it, he made his Army to march a great compasse about the Country of <hi>Phocide,</hi> going along the Sea Coast through a dangerous, and troublesome way, and so at the last he entered into the Country of <hi>Boeotia</hi>: and as he went, he took in some little Towns, and certain Gallies that lay upon the Coast, and at the last arrived at <hi>Leuctres,</hi> and there sate down to refresh his men, who were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwearied with their tedious march. Then did <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nindas</hi> presently advance that way to meet them, and having passed over some little Mountaines, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them in the plain of <hi>Luctres,</hi> where his men were much amazed to see so great an Army of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:55026:45"/>The six Counsellors came together to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they should go forward and fight, few against many, or else retreat, waiting for some beter advantage. In this Councel, their opinions fell out to be equall. Three judged it best to retreat, the other, whereof <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was one, thought it best to fight, and with these three, <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> who was Captain of the Sacred Band, joyned, whereupon they all agreed to give them Battel.<note place="margin">And Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> 
               <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> seeing his Souldiers somewhat affirighted at the former ill signes, to put courage into them, he suborned some that were newly come from <hi>Thebes,</hi> to scatter a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that no man could tell at <hi>Thebes</hi> what was become of the Armes that hung up in the Temple of <hi>Hercules</hi>; but it was commonly said, that the Demigods, their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, had taken them away, to aid their posterity, at this present time. He caused another also, who was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come from <hi>Trophonius</hi> hole, to report, that the God which gives his Oracles therein, commanded him to tell the <hi>Boeotians</hi> that when they had overcome their enemies in the plain of <hi>Leuctres,</hi> they should celebrate yearly Playes to the honour of <hi>Jupiter</hi>: and to gain the more credit to these devices, <hi>Leandridas,</hi> a <hi>Spartan,</hi> that was banished out of his own Country, and now was assisting the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> being brought before the Souldiers, he encouraged them to fight valiantly that Day: For he swore unto them, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had many Oracles, biding them to beware of <hi>Leuctres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> also, assembling his Army, encouraged them with strong, and lively reasons, to shew their valour, so that at lasty Souldiers being freed from their superstitious feares, longed for nothing more than to come to blowes. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> ever concluded his Orations to them with these Words: <hi>O worthy men, embrace sacred Death: Advance your selves to a most honorable, and famous Fight for your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for the Tombes of your Ancestors, and for your Holy things.</hi> Just at this very time there came to the <hi>Thebans</hi> an aid of five hundred Horse, and fifteen hundred Foot, all <hi>Thessalians,</hi> conducted by <hi>Jason.</hi> This <hi>Jason</hi> endeavored
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55026:45"/>
to have made peace with both parties, but could not prevail.</p>
            <p>Also as <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> retired with his Army out of <hi>Boeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> he met a great supply of <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and their Allies, brought to him by <hi>Archidamus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Agesilaus.</hi> These he sent before, thinking to daunt the courage of the <hi>Thebans</hi> with the sight of them, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the rest of his Army suddenly returned into the plain of <hi>Leuctres,</hi> being fully resolved to fight: and the <hi>Boeotians</hi> for their part shrunk not an inch back, and so on both sides they set their men in Battel array. <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi> ordered his Battel after a new fashion never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore practised by any Captain: For having chosen out of his Army the best, and most valiant Souldiers, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them together in one of the Points of his Battel, where himself meant to fight in Person, seconded by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopidas,</hi> and his three hundred chosen men; called the <hi>Holy Band</hi>: In the other Point he placed his weaker men, commanding them expresly not to abide the charge of their enemies that should assaile them in Front, but fair, and softly retire when they saw them come near them: and it fell out as he wished: and he hoped to determine the Battel by the virtue,<note place="margin">A Battel</note> and prowess of those where he had placed all the flower, and choice of his Army.</p>
            <p>Now the sign of Battel being given, the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> advanced with the two Horns of their Battel, ordered in the form of a Crescent. On the contrary, one of the wings of the Battel of the <hi>Boeotians</hi> began to give back, and the other with great fury ran to charge the enemy in the Flank, and soon they were come to the Swords point. At the first, because either side fought despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, the Victory for a time stood doubtfull, But at last <hi>Epaminondas</hi> his Troop brake in amongst the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> and slew most of those that were about <hi>Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus.</hi> Yet while the King was alive, he kept back the <hi>Thebans</hi> from the victory, being accompanied with all the flower of his Army, who fought very valiantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him: But after he fell dead to the ground, having
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55026:46"/>
received and given an infinite number of wounds, then thronged they together on all sides, and there was a bloody and cruell fight about his Body, where were heaps of men slain one upon another, and though <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi> did all that possibly he could, yet the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> made such resistance, that at last they forced the <hi>Thebans</hi> somewhat to give back, whereby they convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Body of the King out of the presse: But this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not long: For <hi>Epaminondas</hi> both by his words and example, did so raise up and encourage the hearts of his men,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.</note> that they fought like Lyons, and gave so fierce a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond charge upon their enemies, that they wholly routed them and made them fly for life, and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursuing the flying enemy, made a great slaughter of them, and obtained the most glorious victory that ever Captain won, having in a pitched Field overcome the most Noble, and warlike Nation of all <hi>Greece,</hi> and that with a far smaller number of men than his enemies had. He also rejoyced more in this, than in all his other victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, because it happened to him in his Fathers life-time: and he often used to say, that of all the honest and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Fortunes that befell him, nothing joyed his heart more, than that he had vanquished the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> at <hi>Leuctres,</hi> his Father and Mother living to see it: and indeed, he that day, did not onely preserve their lives, but of all his Citizens besides,<note place="margin">His Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> having fully resolved utterly to destroy the <hi>Thebans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> used at all other times to come abroad fine and neat, and with a pleasant countenance: but the next day after this Battel, he came out very sad, heavy, and pensive, and when his Friends asked him whether he had heard any ill news which occasioned this posture, he said, <hi>No: but</hi> (said he) <hi>I perceive by my self yesterday, that being overjoyed with the victory I obtained, my heart was more elevated than it ought, and therefore to day I correct that joy, which yesterday exceeded its due bounds.</hi> He knowing that it was the manner of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> as much as possible, to conceal their losses, he suffered them not to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55026:46"/>
carry away all their dead Bodies together, but every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one after another, by which it appeared that there were four Thousand of them slain: But of the <hi>Booetians</hi> there were not found above three hundred dead. This Battel was fought in the beginning of the second year of the hundred and second <hi>Olympiade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> having by this overthrow lost the greatest part of their honour, which they had maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so long, yet lost not their courage; but to keep their youth still in heart, and to take away all fear from such as had escaped, they sent <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> with an Army into <hi>Arcadia,</hi> who was contented to take a few small Towns of the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> and so to return home again. Some say that <hi>Lycomedes,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> making an inrode neer to <hi>Orchomene,</hi> slew in an encounter, <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropus,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and two hundred <hi>Spartans</hi> with him, which provoked the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> against them: and thereupon the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> finding themselves too weak for them, they sought alliance and aid from the <hi>Thebans.</hi> Sure it is that these two States were now at enmity, which occasioned the <hi>Arcadians</hi> and <hi>Thebans</hi> to joyn together, who, with their Allies being led by <hi>Epaminondas</hi> entered into <hi>Laconia,</hi> with an Army of fourty thousand men, besides thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand others that followed the Camp. At this time the <hi>Athenians</hi> sent Captain <hi>Iphecrates,</hi> with twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, to aide the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>:<note place="margin">He plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
               </note> But before their coming, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was entered into <hi>Laconia,</hi> and had sacked all the Country which had not been wasted by any enemy for six hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spartans</hi> seeing their Country thus plundred, and destroyed, were desirous to have gone out with such Forces as they had, but <hi>Agesilaus</hi> would not suffer them, telling them how dangerous it was for them to leave their City, and to set upon such a potent, and numerous enemy. This made them quiet: and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> in the mean time marched with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55026:47"/>
towards the River <hi>Eurotas,</hi> which at that time was risen very high, because of the Winter raines. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured all he could, to draw forth <hi>Agesilaus</hi> to a Battel, who beholding <hi>Epaminondas</hi> a great while, marching with his Army in Battel aray along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver side at the Head of his Troops,<note place="margin">He braves the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
               </note> he wondred at his boldnesse, and Valour, but would by no meanes adventure out of his Fort: So that when this Army had plundred all <hi>Laconia, Epaminondas</hi> led them back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain laden with a very rich Booty. And though <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silaus</hi> was commended for pteserving his City in safety; yet <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had by this inrode, and especially by his Victory at <hi>Leuctres,</hi> so impoverished the Country, that <hi>Sparta</hi> could never after recover that losse, nor grow into that reputation and power which it had before. Yea, notwithstanding the aide sent by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the skill and experience of <hi>Iphicrates, Epaminondas</hi> returned with his Army intire as he came.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> that he might keep the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> still underfoot, and heape new troubles upon them, gave Counsell to the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> and their Allies, to re-edify, and replenish with People the City of <hi>Messina,</hi> which the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had long before destroyed, and when all the whole Councel had given their consents to it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Messina</hi> re-edified.</note> he forthwith, by diligent enquiry sought out all that had been ancient Inhabitants in that City, and in the space of eighty five Dayes, having repaired the ruined Houses, he raised again one of the most Noble, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cities of <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ece,</hi> and left there a strong Garrison for their security. This gat him as much, if not more love and honour than any other service which he had ever done,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being freed from a great fear by his departure, made an agreement with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> leaving to them the chief command by Sea, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving to themselves that by Land. And afterwards, by the assistance of the <hi>Athenians</hi> and that aide which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55026:47"/>
came to them out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> by little and little they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Towns again.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arcadians,</hi> to stop their proceedings, assaulted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Pallene</hi> in <hi>Laconia,</hi> and taking it by storme, put all the Garrison therein to the Sword, &amp; then razed the Town,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pallene</hi> destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and plundred all the Country there abouts. And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would seek revenge, they sent for aid to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who sent <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and the other Counsellers to assist them with six thousand Foot, and five hundred Horse. The <hi>Athenians</hi> having intelligence hereof, sent their Army under the Conduct of <hi>Chabrias,</hi> who marched directly to <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he met with a good supply of Souldiers from the <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Pallenians,</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> so that now he had a Brigade of ten thousand men. These intended to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and stop all the passages and entrances into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Poloponesus.</hi> The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and their Allies joyning also with them, made up an Army of twenty thousand men: And accordingly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pelopone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> beginning at the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Cencrees,</hi> unto the Haven of <hi>Lecheum,</hi> they block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the wayes from one Sea to an other with migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty great peices of Timber laid acrosse, and with a marvelous deep ditch: and this great work was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with such speed, both by reason of the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of labourers, as also through the forwardnesse of them that prosecuted it with such earnestnesse, that they had quite finished it before the <hi>Boeotians</hi> could ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> when he came thither, viewing this fortification, perceiving that the easiest place to storme it, was that which the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> themselves guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he sent to give them defiance though they were thrice as many in number as he was, yet for all this they durst not come out, but kept close under their fortification: Notwitstanding he assaulted them in it, and at last drave them out. In the heat of the fight every one doing his best, some assailing, others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> chose out the valiantest men in

all his Army, and bravely charging the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he forced them to give back, and in dispite of them, he entred into <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> which of all other his Noble exlpoites, was the most wonderfull and memorable action. From thence he marched to the Cities of <hi>Epidaure,</hi> and <hi>Troezen,</hi> and so pillaged all the Country:<note place="margin">He beates the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
               </note> But he staied not to take any of the Towns, because they had strong Garrisons in them: Yet he put <hi>Sicyone, Phuente,</hi> and some other Towns into such fear, that they yeilded themselves to him.</p>
            <p>This being done, he went to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and overcame the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in a set Battel, and beat them home, even to the Gates of their City: Yea some of his men were so unadvised, trusting to their own valour, that they entered the Gates of their City pel mel with those that fled, which put the <hi>Corinthians</hi> into such a terrible fear, that they ran with all speed possible to shelter themselves in their Houses: But <hi>Chabrias</hi> making head, beat them out again, and slew some, whereupon he caused a token of Triumph to be set up, as if he had given the <hi>Thebans</hi> an overthrow, for which <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> laughed him to scorn. The <hi>Boeotians</hi> brought their Army as neer unto <hi>Corinth</hi> as they could, and <hi>Chabrias</hi> with his Army encamped without the Walls in a very strong Place of advantage, and there were many Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes betwixt them, in which <hi>Chabrias</hi> behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with such Valour that he gained great reputation even of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> himself, who upon a time being asked, whom he thought to be the Greatest Captain, himself, <hi>Chabrias,</hi> or <hi>Iphicrates? Its hard</hi> (said he) <hi>to judge whilst we are all alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Newes was brought to him that the <hi>Athenians</hi> had again sent an Army into <hi>Poloponnesus,</hi> furnished with new Armor: Indeed this Army consisted of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> whom <hi>Dyonisius</hi> the Tyrant, sent out of <hi>Sicily</hi> to aide the <hi>Lacedem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55026:48"/>
in this War, and at the end of Summer returned home again.</p>
            <p>It fell out in these last encounters that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> having forced the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> that guarded the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification before mentioned, had many of them in his power to have slain them:<note place="margin">His Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</note> but he contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self only with this Glory, that in dispite of them, he had entered into <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> seeking to do them no more hurt; which gave occasion to those that envied his Glory, to blame him, and to accuse him of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as having willingly spared the enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they should in particular thank him only: But here it will not be improper to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how he behaved himself amongst his Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and how wisely he defended his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</p>
            <p>Amongst all those that envied his Glory and virtue,<note place="margin">He is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied.</note> there was one <hi>Meneclides,</hi> an Orator, and an eloquent man, but with all, most wicked, and very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious. He finding that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> won so much honour by the Wars, never left perswading the <hi>Thebans</hi> to embrace Peace, and prefer it before War, and that because hereby they should not alwayes live under the obedience, and command of one man. But <hi>Epaminondas</hi> one day told him in the open Counsel: Thou wilt (said he) deceive the <hi>Thebans</hi> whilst thou advisest them to leave the Wars: and highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending ease and Peace, thou goest about to put iron bolts upon their feet. For War begets Peace, which yet cannot hold long but amongst them that know how to maintain it with the Sword. Then turning himself to the Citizens, he said, If you will have the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallity and command of all <hi>Greece,</hi> you must shroud your selves in your Tents, and lie in your Pavillions in the open Fields, and not follow sports and Pastimes here at home. For he knew well enough that the <hi>Boeotians</hi> undid themselves by ease and Idlenesse, which made him endeavour continually to keep them in exercise and War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:55026:49"/>Upon a time when the <hi>Thebans</hi> were to choose Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they went about to choose <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> one of the six counsellers, whereupon he said to them: <hi>My Masters, pray you consider of it now you are at leasure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you choose me: For I tell you plainly, if I be chosen your Captain you must to the Wars.</hi> He used to call the Country of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> which was a plain, and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion Country, the Stage of War, saying, that it was impossible to keep it, unlesse the Inhabitants had their Targets on their Armes, and their Swords in their hands: and this was not, because he did not love Peace, and privacy to study Philosophy, or that he was not more carefull of them that were under his charge than he was of himself, using alwayes to watch and forbear his meat, when the <hi>Thebans</hi> were at their Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, and Feasts, giving themselves over to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: but because he knew them well enough, and was never more carefull of any thing than to keep his Army from idlenesse.</p>
            <p>Upon a time the <hi>Arcadians</hi> desired him that some of his Companies might come into one of their Towns to lie dry and warm there, all the winter, but he would by no means yeild to it. For (said he to his Souldiers) now they see you exercising your selves in Arms, they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at you as brave and valiant men; but if they should see you at the fire side parching of Beans, they would esteem no better of you than of themselves. Neither could he endure Covetousness: for if at sometimes he gave his men leave to go a free<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>booting, his meaning was, that whatsoever they got, should be bestowed in furnishing them with good Arms; and if any went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to fill his Purse with money he judged him unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be a Souldier. Upon a time he understood that his Target-bearer had received a great summe of money for the ransome of a Prisoner, whereupon he said to him: <hi>Give me my Target, and go thy wayes home, and buy thee a Tavern wherein to spend the rest of thy life: for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thou wilt no more, like an honest man, put thy self in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55026:49"/>
in the Wars, as formerly thou hast done, because now thou art grown rich and wealthy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was thus virtuous, and unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his life, yet the aforementioned <hi>Menectides</hi> would never cease contending, and reproaching of him: and one day he went so far as to upbraid him because he had no children, and was not married,<note place="margin">His pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and that he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified himself more than ever King <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To this <hi>Epaminondas</hi> answered, Thou hast nothing to do to counsel me to marry, and in this respect, there is never a man here whose advise I would less make use of than thine (and this he spake because the other was taken notice of to be an Adulterer) And whereas thou thinkest that I envy the fame and renown of <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> thou art fowly deceived. Yet let me tell thee, that whereas he was ten years in winding one City, I on the contrary, by putting the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to flight in one day, have delivered not onely our own City, but all <hi>Greece</hi> from their slavery. But thanks be to you? My Lords <hi>Thebans</hi> (speaking to all the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) by your assistance I did it, and thereby overthrew the power and government of our insulting enemies.</p>
            <p>Yet after all his brave deeds,<note place="margin">He is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused and abused.</note> both he and <hi>Pelopidas</hi> were ill rewarded for all their good service, by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull Citizens: For at their return from <hi>Laconia,</hi> they, with some other of the six Counsellers, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, that after the time that their Government was expired, they retained their power four months after the time appointed by the Law. With much ado <hi>Pelopidas</hi> was quitted: But <hi>Epaminondas</hi> willed all his other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to lay the fault upon him, who by his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty forced them to it; and instead of excusing himself, he told them all the brave exploits which he had done at that time: Adding withall, that he was willing and ready to die, if they so pleased, Provided that they wrote upon his Tomb, that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was put to death, because he had compelled the <hi>Thebans</hi> against their wills to burn the Country of <hi>Laconia,</hi> which in five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55026:50"/>
years before had never been plundered. That he had repeopled the City of <hi>Messina</hi> with Inhabitants, two hundred and thirty years after it had been laid wast by the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> That he had brought all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Towns of <hi>Arcadia</hi> to be as one Body, in League together, and had set all the <hi>Greeks</hi> at liberty: and all these things (said he) we did in that Journey. The Judges when they heard this worthy and true defence, they all arose from their seats, and laughed heartily, and would not take up their Balls to Ballot against him.</p>
            <p>But for the second accusation, to wit, that he had shewed favour to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> for his own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar honour, he would make no particular answer to it before the People, but rising out of the Theater, he passed through the Assembly and went into the Park of Exercises. Upon this the people being incensed against him, refused to chuse him into Office as they had wont to do, though there was great need of him, and Created other Counsellers to go into <hi>Thessaly:</hi> and the more (as they thought) to despite him, they commanded him to go that expedition as a private Souldier, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused not, but went very willingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pelopidas</hi> being sent a second time into <hi>Thessaly</hi> to make peace between the people and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Pheres,</hi> was by this Tyrant (not regarding that he was an Ambassadour, and a <hi>Theban</hi>) committed to prison, together with <hi>Ismenias.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pelopidas</hi> imprison? ed by a Tyrant.</note> Upon this, the <hi>Thebans</hi> being justly offended, sent an Army of eight thousand Foot and five hundred Horse against him, howbeit under the conduct of unskillfull Captains, who, wanting judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to use their advantages, thought good to return home without doing any thing: But as they went back <hi>Alexander,</hi> being stronger in Horse than they, pressed hard upon their Reer, killing some, and wounding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; so that the <hi>Thebans</hi> knowing neither how to go forward nor backward, were in great distresse; and that which aggravated their misery was, that their victuals
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55026:50"/>
were almost spent. Being thus almost out of hope e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to get home in safety, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> being at that time a common Souldier amongst the Foot, both the Captaines and Souldiers earnestly intreated him to help to redresse this disorder. He thereupon chose cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Footmen that were light armed, and all the Horsmen, and with these putting himself into the Rere of the Army, he so lustily repulsed the Eenemy, that the rest of the Army afterwards marched in great safety,<note place="margin">His Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</note> and still making Head, as occasion served, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Troops in good order, he at last brought them all well home.</p>
            <p>This brave Act Crowned him with new Glory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded his enemies, and made him well spoken of every where, and by it he obtained the love and good will of the Citizens, who set great Fines upon the heads of those Captaines who had behaved themselves so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily in that expedition. And now the People see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by so many worthy deeds he had stoped the slanderous mouths, and confuted the accusations of his ill willers, they chose him again their Captain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to conduct a new Army into <hi>Thessaly</hi>: At his coming all the Country wonderfully rejoyced, only the Tyrant with his Captaines, and Friends were exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dejected, and possessed with feare, being Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struck with the fame of so Noble a Captaine, and his subjects had a good mind to rise up against him, hoping that they should shortly see the Tyrant fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced for all the wicked and cursed deeds that he had done amongst them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> when he came into <hi>Thessaly,</hi> preferred the safety and deliverance of his Friend <hi>Pelopidas</hi> before his own honour and Glory,<note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and fearing lest <hi>Alexander</hi> when he should see himself and his State in danger to be overthrown, should in his rage revenge himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> he therefore purposly drew this War out in length, marching often about him, but never setting upon him in good earnest, often seeming to make preparations,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55026:51"/>
and yet still delaying: and this he did, to mollify the heart of this Tyrant, and not to provoke (to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Friend) the inhumane and unbridled pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this cruel Bloudsucker. Yet he being a Monster compounded of cruelty, and cowardlinesse, was so afraid of the very name and reputation of <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas,</hi> that he presently sent some to him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse his fact, and to crave Peace. But <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was not willing that his <hi>Thebans</hi> should make Peace and Alliance with so wicked a man, only he was content to grant him a Truce for thirty Dayes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pelopidas</hi> released.</note> upon the delivering to him <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and <hi>Isme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So with them he returned back to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continued a faithfull Friend to <hi>Pelopidas</hi> so long as they lieved together: Yet would he never share with him in his Riches, but did still perseveare in his former strict poverty and Discipline. He was very bold, and yet it was mingled with a winning sweetnesse and a livly grace, as may appear in sundy Examples. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his bold speech to <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> mentioned before: At another time the <hi>Argians</hi> having made a League with the <hi>Thebans,</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> sent their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors into <hi>Arcadia,</hi> to see if they could gain the <hi>Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to be their Friends. And these Ambassadors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan roundly and hotly to charge and accuse both the one and the other, and <hi>Callistratus</hi> speaking for them, reproached them with <hi>Orestes,</hi> and <hi>Oedipus: Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> being present at that Assembly, stood up, and said, <hi>My Lords,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His witty speeches.</note> 
               <hi>we confesse that in times past we had a man that killed his Father, and in</hi> Argos, <hi>one that killed his Mother, but as for us now, we have banished all such wicked murtherers out of our Country, and the</hi> Athenians <hi>have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaned them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time when the <hi>Spartans</hi> had laid many great and grievous imputations to the charge of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> he said, <hi>If they have done nothing else, my Lords of</hi> Sparta, <hi>yet at least they have made you forget
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55026:51"/>
to speak little.</hi> But that which was most excellent, and observable in <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> and which indeed did stop the mouth of envy it self was his moderation, and temperance, knowing how to use any state or condition, and never to rage either against himself or others, alwayes bearing this mind, that howsoever they took him, and in what place soever they set him, he was well contented, so that he might but advance the good of his Country: As may appear by this Example: on a time his evil-willers, thinking to bring him into disgrace, and meerly out of spite, made him superintendant or overseer of all the customs, whilst others of his inferiors,<note place="margin">His Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility-</note> unworthy to be compared with him, were placed in the most honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Offices: Yet despised he not this meane Office, but discharged it very Faithfully: For (said he) <hi>the Office or Authority shewes not only what the man is, but also the man what the Office is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was returned out of <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the <hi>Arcadians</hi> were overcome by <hi>Archidamus</hi> and the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who in the fight lost not a man, and therefore they called this journey the <hi>tearlesse Battel</hi>: and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> forseeing that the <hi>Arcadians</hi> would yet have another storme, he gave them counsel to fortifie their Towns, which they did accordingly, and built that City which afterwads was called <hi>Megalopolis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Megalope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> built.</note> situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a very convenient place. Whilst the <hi>Thebans</hi> made War with the <hi>Elians,</hi> their neighbours, the minde of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was alwayes lifted up to high en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes for the good of his Country, wherefore in an Oration which he made to his Citizens, he preswaded them to make themselves strong by Sea, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to get the principality, and to make themselves the Lords thereof. This Oration was full of lively reasons whereby he shewed and proved unto them, that the enterpize was both honourable, and profitable, which he made out by sundry Arguments, telling them that it was an easy thing for them, who were now the stronger by Land, to make themselves also the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55026:52"/>
stronger by Sea: and the rather, for that the <hi>Athenians</hi> in the War against <hi>Xerxes,</hi> though they had armed and set forth two hundred Gallyes, armed and well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with men, yet they willingly submitted themselves to the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> He alleadged many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whereby he prevailed so far, that the <hi>Thebans</hi> were willing to undertake the enterprize, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gave present order to build an hundred Gallies, and an Arsenall with so many rooms that they might lay them under covert in the Dock:<note place="margin">The <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> build a Navy.</note> They ordered also to send to them of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and of <hi>Chio,</hi> and of <hi>Byzanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> to desire their furthrance in this enterprize: for which end <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was sent with an Army unto these Cities: In his Passage he met with <hi>Leches</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> with a number of Ships in his Fleet, who was sent on purpose to hinder this designe of the <hi>Thebans</hi>: Yet <hi>Epaminondas</hi> so affrighted him, that he made him retire back again, and holding on his course he brought the aforenamed Cities to enter into League with the <hi>Thebans.</hi> Shortly after the <hi>Thebans</hi> fell out with the City of <hi>Orchomene,</hi> which had done them great hurt, and mischiefe, and having won it by assault, slew all the men that were able to bear Armes, and made all the women and children Slaves.</p>
            <p>Some time after the death of <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> certain private Persons of <hi>Mantinea,</hi> fearing to be called to an account for their bad behaviours, and robberies which they had committed, if the <hi>Arcadians</hi> and <hi>Elians</hi> should agree, they so brought it about, that they raised a new quarrel in the Country,<note place="margin">New Wars.</note> which was divided into two Factions, whereof the <hi>Mantineans</hi> were the chief on the one side, and the <hi>Tageates</hi> on the other. This quarrel went so far, that the Parties would needs try it by Armes. The <hi>Tageates</hi> sent to request aid of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who accordingly chose <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> their Captain Generall, and sent him with a good number of men of War to aid the <hi>Tageates.</hi> The <hi>Mantineans</hi> being terrified with this aid that came out
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55026:52"/>
of <hi>Boeotia</hi> to their eneemies, and at the reputation of their Captain, they immediatly sent to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> the greatest enemies of the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> for their assistance, which both the Cities granted. Upon this there fell out many and great skirmishes in diverse parts of <hi>Peloponnesus</hi>: and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> being not far off from <hi>Mantinea,</hi> understood by some of the Country men, that <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> and his <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> were come into the Field, and that they wasted all the Territories of the <hi>Tageates</hi>; whereupon, judging that there were but few men left in the City of <hi>Sparta</hi> to defend it, he undertook a great exploit, and dangerous, and had certainly effected it, if the marvelous good Fortune of <hi>Sparta</hi> had not hindred it. His designe was this:<note place="margin">A notable atempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> He departed from <hi>Tegea</hi> by night, the <hi>Mantineans</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of it, and taking a by way, he had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surprised <hi>Sparta</hi> without striking a stroak, had not a Post of <hi>Candia</hi> speedily carried word of it to <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> who immediatly dispatched away an Horsman to give intelligence to them of <hi>Sparta</hi> to stand upon their guard, and he himself speedily hasted after, and arrived there a little before the coming of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near the City a little before day, they gave an assault to them that defended it. This made <hi>Agesil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>us</hi> to bestir himself wonderfully, even beyond the strength of so old a man: But his Son <hi>Archidamus,</hi> and <hi>Isadas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Phaebidas</hi> fought valiantly on all parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> seeing how prepared the <hi>Spartanes</hi> were to oppose him, began then to suspect that his design was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; yet notwithstanding he left not off to force them all he could, though he fought with great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, considering the places wherein he was: yea, he continued fighting courageously, till the Army of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> came on, and till the night approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereupon he sounded a retreat.</p>
            <p>Then being informed that the <hi>Mantineans</hi> came on also with their forces, he withdrew his Army somewhat farther off from the Town, and there Camped. After
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55026:53"/>
which he caused his men to refresh themselves with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and leaving certain Horsemen in the Camp, he commanded them to make fires in the morning, and in the mean time himself with the rest of his men, went to surprize <hi>Mantinea</hi> before any should discover that he was departed.<note place="margin">An other but fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</note> Yet herein also he failed of his purpose, the prosperity of the <hi>Thebans</hi> being come to its height, and the course of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> his Life drawing neer to an end, whereby <hi>Greece</hi> was deprived of this Noble and famous Captain, from whom was taken a most notable Victory, and that twice, by strange accidents.</p>
            <p>For at the second time, when he was come neer to <hi>Mantinea</hi> that was left without guard and defence, just then, on the other side of the Town there arrived six thousand <hi>Athenians,</hi> conducted by their Captain <hi>Hegele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> who having put sufficient force into the Town, ordered the rest of his Army in Battel array without the Walls, and immediatly also came the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> together, who prepared to put all to the hazard of a Battel, and therefore sent for their Allies from all parts: and when they were come together they were in all twenty five thousand Foot, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse. The <hi>Arcadians, Boeotians,</hi> and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers were thirty thousand Foot, and three thousand Horse. When they came to the Battel, first the Horse charged with great fury,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> and the Horsmen of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> encountering with the <hi>Thehans,</hi> proved too weak for them, not because they were lesse valiant, or hardy than the other, but because they had not so good Chieftains, and had few Archers amongst their Troops. The <hi>Thebans</hi> on the other side were all excellently well appointed, and had <hi>Thessalians</hi> amongst them, men very skilfull in their Bowes, who so plyed the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that they wholly brake them, and put them to the rout, yet in their flight they did not run amongst their Footmen, which made them somewhat recover their Honour which they had lost by running away. On the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55026:53"/>
contrary part, as they fled, they met with some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of <hi>Negropont,</hi> whom the <hi>Arcadians</hi> had sent to take in certain Hills hard by the plain where the Battel was fought, whom they put all to the Sword.</p>
            <p>The men at Arms of the <hi>Thebans</hi> seeing them turn their backs, did not pursue them at all, but presently gave charge upon a great Battalion of Footmen, forcing them all they could to break, and run through them. So the fight was very cruel and sharp, yet in the end the <hi>Athenians</hi> were forced to quit the place: whereupon a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel of Horsemen of the <hi>Elians,</hi> who stood as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to guard the Rere, defended them, and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering with the <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>otians,</hi> he resisted them, and made them give back, which reinforced the fault of the left point of their Army. But in the right point, after the Horsemen had charged one another, the fight was soon determined: For by reason of the great number of men at Armes of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and <hi>Thessalians,</hi> the <hi>Mantine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and their partakers were soon put to rout, and have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lost a great number of their men, they sheltered themselves under the Battalion of their Footmen, and this was the issue of the fight between the Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>As for the infantry, after they came once to the Sword, it was a marvellous bloody, and cruel fight. For never before that time was there so many Greeks in the Field one against another, nor so great and expert Captains, nor such valiant Souldiers as were now. The two Nations that at that time bare the name to be the bravest Footmen in all the world, to wit, the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> were now set in Front one against the other, and they began to charge, neither sparing Life nor limb. The first charge they gave was with their Pikes, which being soon broken with the huge blows they gave each other, then they came to it with their Swords, and lustily laying about them, Body to Body, Death raged in every place, and there was a mighty carnage made: for neither part shrunk back, or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55026:54"/>
gave over with wearinesse, but stood to it like undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. And so continued this dangerous Fight for a long time, by reason of the valiantness of either party, the victory stood doubtfull for a great while, and it could not be judged which side was like to have the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand. For every one that fought, had this resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his heart, not to fear Death whatsoever befell them: But rather desiring to make proof of their utmost Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they willingly parted with their lives to lye in the Bed of Honour. By reason whereof, though the fight was sharp and cruel, yet the event remained for a long space so uncertain, that it could not be discerned to which side the Victory should fall</p>
            <p>But at last, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> seeing no other remedy, but that the issue of this doubtfull fight depended upon his own virtue and valour, he resolved with himself to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture his life upon it: and presently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gathering about him all the best, and choisest men of his Army, and of them having compounded a Company of stout and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Blades, he ran with great fury into the thickest, and greatest press of all his enemies, marching himself the foremost man in all his Troop, with a Spear in his hand, with the which at the first blow he gave, he slew the Captain of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and straightway the rest of his company began to assail their enemies. But <hi>Epaminondas</hi> laying about him like a Lion, slew so many in the place where he stood with his own hands, that at last he opned the Battel of the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> whom he pursued &amp; laid on them so lustily, that they being unable any lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger to defend themselves against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> irristable fury of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his followers, were enforced to give back and leave the place to the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> who yet followed them at their heels, beating them down so eagerly, that in a short space the whole Field was covered with dead Bodies, lying on heapes one upon another.</p>
            <p>But in the end, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> seeing that they could no way save themselves, gathered courage out of despair, and a Company of them joyning together, all
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55026:54"/>
set upon <hi>Epaminondas</hi> throwing an infinite number of Darts at him, of which some he avoided, others he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon his Target, but yet there were many that stuck in his Body which he pulled out, and fought with the same weapons against those that had thrown them at him. At last, when he had done more than a man, and beyond all humane strength, thereby to win Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his Country by gaining them the victory, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d.</note> he left the iron Head sticking in his Body. Having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this deadly wound, he fell immediately to the ground: But then was there a more cruel fight about him than ever there was before, which occasioned great slaughter on both sides, till the <hi>Thebans</hi> by fine force made their enemies to flie for their lives, and when they had pursued them a while, they returned back to their Camp that they might keep the dead Bodies in their power, which was a certain signe that the victory was theirs, and then they sounded a retreat, and so the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel ended.</p>
            <p>Both sides challenged the victory and made Triumphs for it. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did it,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.</note> because the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had slain those of <hi>Negropont</hi> that were sent to seize upon the Hils before mentioned, and kept their Bodies in their power. The <hi>Thebans</hi> on the other side having overcome the <hi>Spartans,</hi> had the Bodies of them that were slain in the Battel, in their power, which was by far the greater number, wherefore they said, that they were the Victors. Thus both standing upon their tearms, it was a good while before either would send a Trumpet or Herauld to the other for leave to bury their dead. Yet at last the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> sent first, and then they all betook themselves to give the dead an Honourable Burial. And as for him that had killed <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> he was highly esteemed and honoured for his valiant act, and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> gave him many rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, and made him and his Posterity free from
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55026:55"/>
all publick Taxes and contributions in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Epaminondas</hi> he was brought yet alive into his Tent; how beit his Physitians, and Surgeons being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together to dresse his wounds, they all concluded that so soone as they plucked the head of the Dart out of his Body, he must needs die. And truly he made a most noble and worthy end. For first he called for his Target-bearer, who was alwayes at his hand in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and asked him: <hi>Is my Target safe</hi>? He brought it strait. Then he asked, <hi>who had the Victory</hi>? The <hi>Boeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> answered, the Target-bearer. Then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to bring to him <hi>Diophantus</hi> and <hi>Jolidas</hi>: they told him they were both dead: Upon this he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised his Citizens to make Peace with their enemies,<note place="margin">His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans.</hi>
               </note> for that they had not any Captain of skill to lead them to the Wars. <hi>And now</hi> (said he) <hi>it is time for me to die, and therefore pluck the Dart Head out of my Body.</hi> At this word all his Friends that were about him fetched grievous sighs, and even cryed out for sorrow: and one of them weeping, said unto him: Alas <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das!</hi> Thou diest now and leavest no Children behind thee: <hi>Yea</hi> (said he) <hi>that I do: Eor I leave two faire Daughters behind me, whereof the one is the Victory at</hi> Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctres <hi>and the other, this of</hi> Mantinea. So they pulled out the Dart,<note place="margin">His death.</note> and immediatly he gave up the Ghost, without shewing any signe that he was at all troubled at it.</p>
            <p>He used often to say, <hi>That War is the Bed of Honour, amd that it is a sweet Death to dye for ones Country.</hi> He was one of the bravest Captaines that ever we read of:<note place="margin">His cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> For whereas others excelled in some one or two Virtues by which they made their Fame great and glorious, he excelled in all the Vertues and good Parts that could be desired in a Grave, Politick and Great Captain, to make him compleat in all things that could be expected in an Heathen.
