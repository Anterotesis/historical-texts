         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Ariſe, Oh Virgin, who art not defiled, who could not joyne with the Daughter of <hi>Babylon</hi> in her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; Therefore they have mocked thee, and wagged their heads at thee, and hath ſaid in their hearts, who ſhall deliver thee? Ariſe, ſhine forth, put on thy beautifull garments, behold thy King cometh in his glory, who will adorne thee and crowne thee with a royall Diadem, in the ſight of thine enemies, who have reproached thee; and thy reproach ſhall be taken away, for thy Seed ſhall be as the ſtarres in multitude, yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they that have ſpoiled thee, ſhall be ſpoiled, and they that have deſtroyed thee ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, for the King is coming out of his Tent, yea he hath lifted up his Standard againſt all that have ſpoiled thee, yea, the deſtroyer is come up againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> ſhall tremble, and the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> hearts ſhall faile for feare, and all the <hi>Canaanites</hi> ſhall be caſt out, and this ſhall be performed by the Lord of Hoſts, the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who is now ariſen in his Jealouſie and it burnes as fire, againſt all the Inhabitants of the earth, and the Sea, who hath joyned their ſtrength together againſt the inheritance of the Lord, rejoyce for evermore all that love his appearance, and who have waited for him, he is come, and coming to take vengeance upon his, and you adverſaries, for he hath a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in <hi>Babylon</hi> to performe, even to cut off all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; who hath deſpiſed thee, Oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Awake, Oh Arme of the Lord, and put one ſtrength as in the dayes of old, to redeeme thine own inheritance, which hath long been by the heathen laid waſt, and hath been trampled upon by the uncircumciſed, art not thou he, which was, and is, and is to come? who wilt not give the glory to another, ariſe and ſhine forth in thy bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thou Starr of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and Sun of Righteouſneſſe, and let the earth be filled with thy Light and glory, that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to come may call thee bleſſed. Dry up the tongue of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Sea, confound the wiſdome of this world which never knew thee, neither would owne, nor receive thee, make the Diviners and Sorcerers mad, who have ſcattered thy ſheep from the everlaſting fold, and have healed the hurts of thy people deceitfully, and have cauſed them to erre, in telling them, thy power, nor thy Arme was not to be looked for now, as in the dayes of old, nor thy immediate voyce, nor word was to be looked, or waited for now in the earth, and ſo have deceived the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with their lying divinations, which they have ſpoken from the imaginations of their owne hearts, and have laid a ſtumbling block in the way, as the Sonne of <hi>Nebat</hi> did who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin.</p>

            <p>From twelve yeares old I ſet my heart to know that God which the world profeſſed, and which I did read of in the Scripture, which <hi>Abraham, Noah, Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, and the reſt of the Fathers worſhipped, and I did fall into the ſtricteſt worſhip that was in that part wherein I lived, and often I deſired to be alone, and attended much to reading, and meditation, and then as I was ſober, and ſerious alone. I began to ſee that all the ſports and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes, and ſuch as youth delights in naturally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and they laſted but for a moment, and while I was in folly and wantonneſſe, doing of them, the nature which was run into tranſgreſſion, had pleaſure in them, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as I was come from among them, I was judged in my ſelfe, for what I had done, and often made me weepe, then I reſolved in my will, that I never would doe ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and for ſome time did reſtraine from the common practiſe of thoſe things that I had walked in; but aſſoone as I came amongſt thoſe againe, I acted thoſe things againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which before I did ſee to be vanity, but long before that I was checked for many things; and ſo I walked, often
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119728:5"/>
condemned in my ſelfe, when I was ſerious, and had no peace, and then not knowing what to doe in much ſorrow when I was alone, I had a deſire to be alone where I might not heare nor ſee any folly acted, and did not goe to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exerciſes, although ſom thing in me hanckered after it, but when I yielded not unto it, I was glad, and had peace, and then I began to oppoſe my fellowes with whom I had walked in wantonneſſe, and then they began to revile me, and hate mee, and ſcorne me. Yet notwithſtanding I mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered not, then I read much and prayed in words often, three or foure times a day, but I knew not where God was, but in my imagination, imagined a God at a diſtance, and ſo went on; and then I began to grow in knowledge, without (which is ſenſuall) and then I was puffed up, for the world admired me; but ſtill I was condemned for vaine words and actions, and the roote of iniquity grew in me, and then I followed a more ſtrict courſe; and often went five or ſix miles, to heare ſome more excellent meanes (as they called it) and ſo did get more words, but ſtill I was the ſame, nay worſe, for knowledge puffed me up; Then along to about fifteene yeares of age, I poſted up and downe after the moſt excellent Sermons, ſo called, and ſo became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the eminent Chriſtians ſo called in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where I lived, and I was deſpiſed of my parents, and of the world made, and great reproach came upon me, but ſtill I ſaw they knew nought, and it was no matter, and ſo much ſorrow fell upon me, foure or five yeares, and when I was turned within, I was judged for all myiniquity former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſtill my heart was ſhewed to me, that it was corrupt, but as I kept whithin to the light in my conſcience, I was reſtrained from many actions, which I had a will to doe, and in the inſtant when I have been doing any unrighteouſneſſe in actions or words, in many things I was often ſtopped, and when I ſaw that I did it not, a great joy aroſe in me, and when I had done any thing forwardly and raſhly, I was judged, but this the teachers ſaid was a naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that kept from ſin, and did reſtraine it, and ſaid, he that had but reſtraining grace, (as they called it) he was but a tame Devill.</p>

And they ſaid, I muſt believe he ſuffered for me; and I believed all that they called faith, but yet I could not ſee how he dyed for me, and had taken away my ſin, for the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in my conſcience told me I was a ſervant of ſin, whilſt I committed it. And they told me I muſt not omit that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, for thereby ſtrength was confirmed, and faith ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; inſomuch, on the one hand they preſſing it as a duty, and on the other hand I ſaw that the Scripture ſaid, <hi>He that eates unworthily, eates damnation to himſelfe;</hi> I was in fear, notwithſtanding none could accuſe me without: yet then afterward a great fear fell upon me, and I thought I had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and great trouble fell upon me.</p>
            <p>Then they ſaid, I had not come prepared; and yet I had all the preparation that they had ſpoken of, But ſtill they were all Phiſitians of no value.</p>
            <p>Then I faſted, and prayed, and walked mournfully in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and thought none was like me, tempted on every hand; ſo I ran to this man, and the other, and they applyed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to me, but it was onely words, for the witneſſe of Chriſt ſhewed me that the root of iniquity ſtood, and the body of ſin whole; notwithſtanding I was kept by a ſecret power from groſſe evills: but ſtill ſorrow compaſſed me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and I queſtioned all that ever I had; which they ſaid was grace, and repentance, and faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:119728:6"/>And then I told them there was guilt in me: And they ſaid, ſin was taken away by Chriſt, but the guilt ſhould ſtill remaine while I lived, and ſo brought me the Saints conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who were in the warfare, to confirme it: and ſo I ſaid in my ſelfe, this was a miſerable ſalvation, that the guilt of ſin and condemnation ſtill in me ſhould ſtand; and ſo I was toſſed from mountaine to hill: And I heard them preach confuſion, and ſo I matterd not for them, and ſaid, ſure this is not the Miniſtry of Chriſt, and ſo I ceaſed long by fits and did not mind them, but kept ſtill at home, and in deſart pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſollitary in weeping; and every thing that I had done was laid before me, inſomuch that every thought was judged, and I was tender, and my heart broken, and when I could ſorrow moſt I had moſt peace, for ſomething ſpoke within me from the Lord, but I knew him not then.</p>
            <p>And they ſaid, that it was hereſie to look for the word of the Lord to be ſpoken now in theſe dayes, but onely the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and ſo I regarded it not much: yet often I was made to doe many righteous things by the immediate power and word of God, and then peace and joy ſprung up in me, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes was ſpoken, that he would teach me himſelfe, and be my God; and often I did obey contrary to my will, and denyed my will: but they told me, this was legall to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey out of fear, and that was ſlavery; but there was an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall obedience (as they called it) ſo I got above the fear, and yet acted the former things, which they called Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and they ſaid that was ſon-like obedience, and Chriſt had done all.</p>
            <p>Then there appeared more beauty in them called Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants, and I loved them, and ſo joyned my ſelfe to them, and all the money that I could get I purchaſed books with, and walked with (and owned) them as more ſeparate from the world; and they preſt ſeparation, but at laſt I ſaw it was but in words, that they would doe things, and chuſe officers, and members of themſelves, and ſo made themſelves an Image, and fell down to it; yet there was ſome tenderneſſe in them at the firſt, but the doctrine was the ſame with the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119728:6"/>
worlds words without, of others conditions.</p>
            <p>Then they whom they called Anabaptiſts appeared to have more glory, and walked more according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, obſerving things written without; and I went among them, and there was ſomething I loved among them; but after they denyed all but ſuch that came into their way, as out of the fellowſhip of the Saints and Doctrine of Chriſt, I ſaw the ground was the ſame, and their Doctrine out of the life with the reſt of the Teachers of the world, and had ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves, and made another likeneſſe; but ſtill all ſaid, the letter was the word and rule, and Chriſt at a diſtance without had done all; and ſome of them holding freewill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers oppoſing, and all in the will.</p>
            <p>But ſtill I loved them that walked honeſtly amongſt all theſe, but though I had ſeen and owned all that I had heard (except the figure which I ſaw was outward, and that was their greateſt glory; and I ſaw they would have all fall down to it, elſe no communion; in the midſt of all theſe, and much more, which is death to ſpeak on: but onely that all honeſt hearted may ſee themſelves where they have reſted and alſo may not truſt any more to a reed of <hi>Egypt</hi>) after all this no peace nor no guide I found. And then the Doctrine of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace (as they called it) ſome preach't, that all ſin was done away, paſt, preſent, and to come, and ſo preached ſalvation to the firſt nature, and to the Serpent that bore rule, onely believing this, and all was finiſhed; to this I hearkned a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſo loſt my condition within: But ſtill whither ever I went; this was ſpoken in me, <hi>His ſervant thou art to whom thou obeyes;</hi> and ſo I being overcome by ſin, I had no juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication witneſſed in me, but condemnation.</p>
            <p>Then ſome preached Chriſt within, but they themſelves were without, had but words, and yet they ſaid all muſt be within (unto which my heart did cleave) and ſpoke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and juſtification, and all within, and of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in man, and overcoming the power of the Devils, and then that in my conſcience bore witneſſe it muſt be ſo, and I was exceedingly preſſed to wait to find it ſo, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119728:7"/>
breathed after the living God; and a true love I had to all that walked honeſtly in what profeſſion ſoever, and I hated reviling one another, and that they ſhould ſmite one another, and perſecute one another, and with the ſufferer I alwayes took part: But ſtill I ſaw though they ſpoke of all things within, and of a power to come, that they enjoyed not what they ſpoke, for the ſame fruits was brought forth; till at laſt, I ſaw none walked as the Miniſters of Chriſt, nor none that pretended to the Miniſtry had any ſuch gift, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſtour, nor Teacher, nor any ſuch Members as was in the Apoſtles time.</p>
            <p>So at laſt, having paſſed up and down, hurried here and there, I ſaw all the Teachers of the world, that they ſought themſelves, and fed poor people with dead names, and deceit and that they were not the Miniſtry of Chriſt: and ſo I ſaw them all in deceit who did not abide in Chriſts Doctrine, and ſo I got my ſelfe quit of moſt of them, for ever as I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from their judgement, they hated me, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me.</p>
            <p>So at laſt, there was ſomething revealed in me, that the Lord would teach his people himſelfe; and ſo I waited, and many things opened in me of a time at hand: And ſometime I would have heard a Prieſt, but when I heard him I was moved by the Lord, and his word in me ſpoke to oppoſe, and often as a fire, I burned, and a trembling fell upon me, yet I feared reproach, and ſo denyed the Lords motion: and it was revealed in me to waite, and I ſhould know his counſell, and the word of the Lord was in me, the time was at hand when the dead ſhould hear the voyce of the Son of God, and it burned in me as fire, that the day was near when it ſhould not be, Loe here, nor there, but all his people ſhould be taught of the Lord: But ſtill my mind ran out, and out of the fear into careleſneſſe, for the Croſſe of Chriſt I knew not; And yet this I ſay, I was wiſer then my Teachers I met with in that Generation, I doe not glory in it, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is paſt on it all for ever; yet ſtill I had ever as my mind was turned to the light, pure openings and Propheſies
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119728:7"/>
to come, &amp; a belief that I ſhould ſee the day, and ſhould bear witneſſe to his name; and ſo when things opened ſo faſt, the wiſdome of the fleſh catched them, and ſo I went up and down preaching againſt all the Miniſtry; and alſo run out with that which was revealed to my ſelfe, and preached up and down the country of the fulneſſe that was in the old bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſo was wondred after, and admired by many who had waded up and down as my ſelfe had, and we fed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with words, and healed up one another in deceit, and all laid down in ſorrow, when the day of the Lord was made manifeſt; for I was overthrown, and the foundation ſwept away, and all my righteouſneſſe and unrighteouſneſſe was all judged, and weighed, and all was found too light.</p>
            <p>And immediately aſſoon as I heard one declare (whoſe name is not known to the world, but written in the Lambs book of life for ever) in eternall record for ever; aſſoon as I heard him declare that the light of Chriſt in man was the way to Chriſt, I believed the eternall word of truth, and that of God in my conſcience ſealed to it; and ſo not onely I, but many hundreds more, who thirſted after the Lord, but was betrayed by the wiſdome of the Serpent, we were all ſeen to be of the foundation, and all mouths was ſtopped in the duſt, and ſo we ſtood all as condemned in our ſelves, and all ſaw our nakedneſſe and were all aſhamed, though our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was great in the worlds eye, but all was vanity.</p>
            <p>And then after all this, I was ignorant what the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of true Religion was: but as I turned my mind within to the light of Jeſus Chriſt wherewith I was enlightned, which formerly had reproved me for all vanity, and alſo as I did own it, it led me into righteouſneſſe, and when I turned to it I ſaw it was the true and faithfull witneſſe of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and then my eyes vvas opened, and all things vvas brought to remembrance that ever I had done, and the Ark of the Teſtament was opened, and there was thunder, and lightning and great haile, and then the trumpet of the Lord was ſounded, and then nothing but war, and rumour of war, and the dreadful power of the Lord fell upon me, plague, and

And I ſought death in that day, and could not find it, it fled from me, and I ſought to cover my ſelfe any way, or with any thing, but nothing could, for the indignation of the Lord was upon the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet; and <hi>Babylon</hi> came into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance in that day, the mother of harlots, and the Sea dryed up, and all the Merchants that had traded with her ſtood aſar off, for the cup of fury was poured forth, and <hi>Cain</hi> was ſeen, and <hi>Judas</hi> that had betrayed the Lord of life: and I would have run any way to have hid my ſelfe, but nothing but weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, and ſorrow, and terror, and I roared out for the diſquietneſſe of my heart, and the kingdome was full of darkneſſe, I knew not the right hand from the left, I became a perfect fool, and knew nothing, and as a man diſtracted; all was overturned, and I ſuffered loſſe of all: in all that ever I did, I ſaw it was in the accurſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then ſomthing in me cryed, <hi>Juſt and true is his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> my mouth was ſtopped, I durſt not make mention of his name, I knew not God, and as I bore the indignation of the Lord, ſomthing rejoyced, the Serpents head began to be brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Witneſſes which were ſlain, were raiſed, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Heave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

doe you, and cannot own that of him in you, to be lead by it, and ſo followes ſtrangers, and ſtill are complaining, and puts redemption to another world, and ſo Satan hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived you in looking abroad, and therefore that at home is of no price unto you, and ſo you run away from the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the father, and from his dwelling, where the leaſt in his houſe hath bread enough; but to the carnall mind, which is at enmity with God, who ſeeks him in the fallen wiſedome, he is of no value, and that which was the Saints Rule is too low for you, and yet you ſay the Sons of God are lead by his Spirit. Now I ſay, where doth the Spirit ſpeak? doth it not bear witneſſe either with or againſt our Spirits? and ſo all mens ſpirits, and ſo that nature in you which is one with the Serpent, and nouriſheth the Harlot, is exalted, and lives, and hath preheminence, and yet you will talk of being reconciled unto God. Now conſider, while you ſtand not in the Councel of God within, and wait to hear his word, you know not the word of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, for he takes none into union with himſelf, but they that follow him, and doth what he commands, and are his fruit and off-ſpring. And therefore, O fooliſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, how long will you feed on a dream that you are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when your rebellion is open to your own ſight? To that of God in your conſciences I ſpeak.</p>
            <p>All therefore, that ſee your darkneſſe that you lye in, return home, and that which is low, mind, the meek ſpirit, and be not forward nor raſh, but ſtand ſtill in quietneſſe and meekneſſe, that the ſtill voyce you may hear which till you come downe low within, you cannot hear; for the loud voyces of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and Inchanters is ſo many, and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> voyce, and <hi>Herods</hi> is ſo loud, and you whoſe minds are abroad, you think as they thought its the voyce of God. But I ſay be ſtill, he ſhall not cry, nor lift up his voyce in the ſtreets who you muſt hearken unto, in you, that your ſoules may live, and ſo be low and ſtill if you will hear his voyce, and wait to hear that ſpeak that ſeparates betwixt the precious and the vile. Now that which you
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119728:11"/>
muſt wait in, is neer you, yea in you, the eye that ſeeth, and the ear that heareth that, is of the Lord, for that which is viſible, is naturall and carnall, and the naturall ear cannot hear the word of the ſpirituall God, for that which hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens without, that ear muſt be deaf, and that eye blind. Now that which reveales the pure ſpirituall God muſt be in you pure and ſpirituall; for none knowes the things of God, but by the Spirit of God, and did not his Spirit bear witneſſe alwayes unto their ſpirits? and doth it not ſo now to all that know him? So in the light wait which comes from God, who is light, and dwells in the immortall light, which the mortall eye cannot behold, and it will lead you to know Chriſt who is immortall, and not carnall, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and eternall. And as you love the light, and keep your minds inward, then you will hear the motion of Chriſt Jeſus in you; and ſo loving it, the good you will come to ſee from God, which will lead out of ſin, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie you, and the acceptable year you will ſee, and the day of vengeance, and this is he whom the father hath given for a Covenant, to bring man out of the alienation to himſelf again and to reconcile man unto himſelf even by the blood of the Croſſe; and he who is the light is the Covenant; and he who is the Covenant is the light, for they are one in him; and this Covenant of peace is tendred unto you who are afar off: And herein is the eternall love of God made manifeſt to the <hi>Jew</hi> and the <hi>Greeke,</hi> and the life of his Son to be the light of the world, and of men; and ſo in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of light abide, and you will ſee he is neer you, the Peace-maker, the gift of God which preſents you perfect in himſelf to the father, and this gift is free, and offered free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to all that will receive it; and yet you cannot receive the gift in your own wills, but through the deniall of your own wills, for the light is contrary to the will; and ſo you will ſee the will of the earthly man and Gods will contrary, and as you receive the will of God, you deny your owne wills, and ſo doth the will of another, and another guides you, and leads you, and this is Gods alone work, not of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119728:12"/>
your ſelves, but wrought by Chriſt, in his owne way and truth and ſo the Covenant of God comes to be eſtabliſhed to the ſeed, and the foundation ſtands ſure, and his promiſe is fulfilled in you, as you come to witneſſe the ſeed which is one, in whom the promiſe is fulfilled.</p>
            <p>And friends, Thus muſt you wait to have judgement ſet up within you and this is he who is the Judge and the light of the world; and ſo wait to ſee the Law ſet up within, which is added becauſe of tranſgreſſion to cut down, and the unjuſt deſtroyed in you, and the rebellious nature yoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which hath had its liberty in the earthly, where the Beaſts of the field dwells, and ſo it will come to decay and the Law works wrath upon the deceit in you, which hath had preheminence, and ſo you will ſee the thunder as the Seale is opened, and the earthquakes, and lightning, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as you cannot behold and live. But the tranſgreſſor, and the tranſgreſſion, which is contrary to the Law is cut down, and when there is a time of great ſorrow, and great trouble, and tryall, and temptation, wait in patience in the judgement, and let the Lords work have its perfect opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in you, and ſo as you turn unto him that hath ſmitten and wounded you, he will bind up and heale, and give up all to the great ſlaughter of the Lord unto the Croſſe, all that which is diſcovered by the pure Law of God; and as the earth comes to be plowed up, the ſeed which is ſown comes up, and the Rocks broken, the water guſheth out, and ſo you will ſee ſome promiſes will ariſe in you, to the ſeed which is coming up out of the grave, and ſo the love of God will appear in you, and you will be ſtayed, and ſee hope in the midſt of calamity.</p>
            <p>Then take heed that the Serpent get not that which is to the Babe, and ſo the carnall come to be exalted; but as you wait, you will ſee the ſubtilty of the Enemy; and ſin and death rules till <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was a faithfull ſervant in his houſe, and brings to the Law of God revealed in you, then ſin comes to be crucucified, and to looſe its dominion over you, and in you, and ſo you will ſee one brought
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119728:12"/>
forth under the Law, who fullfilled the Law, and now full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fills it in all thoſe who walk after him in the ſpirit, and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fills not the deſires of the fleſh and wait, and you will ſee ſome Prophecies opened in you, and the day-ſtar in your hearts, which leads to where Chriſt is, and openings of the inheritance which is to be received, and the promiſe is to the ſeed. And all wait in the light, and keep in your minds to it and you will ſee <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſtry, the water which waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and he is the preparer of the way, and turns to God, leſt he ſmite the earth with a curſe, and his Miniſtry breaks down the mountaines, and removes them, and makes a plaine way, and your minds being turned to the Lord, and as you own the gift of Chriſt given you, repentance you will ſee, unto life, and then you will ſee ſomething ariſing and ſhine in you, opening your hearts, and there will be a breathing after the Lord and his righteouſneſſe, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in obedience in the Croſſe, the vayle you will ſee rent, and you will ſee him that hath turned you from ſin by his free gift made manifeſt in you; and he which is the gift ſaves you from ſin, and ſo the ſeales will be opened by the Angel of the Covenant, and the Lamb. So all in patience wait, and keep in the living principle of life, and things will open in you, even the dark ſayings of old; and that which ſpake Parables to the Serpents ſeed, will open the Parables to his own ſeed, then you will ſee him whom you have pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, even the Lamb who hath been ſlain ſince the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, and your hearts will be boken, and water will guſh out of the Rock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo love will encreaſe in you, who abide faithfull in your meaſure, and the good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift of God will be made manifeſt in you, and the hope upon which the ſoule comes to be anchored, will come to be witneſſed, which hope purifies the heart; and as you ſtand in the perfect Law of liberty revealed in you revealed by the Spirit which cuts down the oppreſſor, and gives li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to his ſeed, unto which the Covenant is, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for ever; and this ſeed Chriſt took, and takes upon him to redeem, even the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> unto whom the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119728:13"/>
promiſe was made; and ſo wait, that the pure Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, which is life to the righteous, and ſo the ſeed may be ſet up, and you will ſee all chained under, and this binds and fetters the unclean ſpirits, and ſhuts up them into utter darkneſſe for ever.</p>
            <p>And as you come to be redeemed from under the bondage of ſin, and come above the bonds of death, &amp; the pure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple lives in you, there will be a delight in you to doe the will of the father, who hath redeemed you from ſin and its Law, unto righteouſneſſe and its Law. And all who hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, wait in that which thirſteth, that the gift you may receive, which perfects for ever them that receive it, and believe in it, and cleanſeth and purgeth you from unrighteouſneſſe; and this being revealed in you, as you obey it, it leads to true peace, and will reveal in you the immortall ſeed which came not by the will of man, but is contrary, and revealed out of mans will which all muſt witneſſe to be born of, that inherits the Kingdome of God; and this is he who is begotten of the incorruptible ſeed, which the promiſe is unto, and are in him fullfilled Yea, and Amen, come out of time before all time, the Son of God, which leads out of time; and this is he whom the father revealed in <hi>Paul;</hi> and this is he of whom I am a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in whom I have redemption by the blood of the Croſſe, and he is my Sanctification, Juſtification, and Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who is the Son of God, who came to doe his fathers will, and now doth, where he is witneſſed, who by his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall word of life hath begotten me, and made me a partaker of his eternall inheritance which never fades away; <hi>Glory unto him for evermore,</hi> who is life, and tranſlateth all that believeth and follow him in the work of Regeneration un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>So ſilence all you Diviners and Sorcerers for ever, who believe with a faith, and teach a faith, that none can be ever cleanſed from ſin while they are here, you and your faith is denyed, for it is not the ſame which was once delivered to the Saints, which gave them victory over the world, and by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119728:13"/>
which they overcame. <hi>Paul</hi> a Miniſter of Chriſt by the will of God, ſaid, the <hi>Coloſſions</hi> were tranſlated into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, where nothing that is imperfect can come or enter, your preaching is vaine, your hope and faith is vaine, and all your hearing is vaine, while the perfect gift of God is not witneſſed, nor the everlaſting offring which perfects for ever them that are ſanctified by him, even by his word of life and his will, which ſanctifies and makes perfect the commers thereunto, and preſents all that believe and receive him without ſpot.</p>
            <p>And therefore all you that love the Lord, and wait for the coming of the kingdome of Chriſt, feed no longer upon imaginations nor vaine words; ceaſe from looking, loe here and there, for the kingdome of God will the Father reveal in you, as you waite in the meaſure of the light in you, by which he reveals himſelfe in his ſons and daughters, and will bring them to his everlaſting fold and true reſt, all who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes him through the denyall of all, and to the looſing of all for him, ſhall come to witneſſe an incorruptible inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which never fades away.</p>
            <p>And now a few words to you who would thruſt your ſelves into the kingdome, and would be called Chriſts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, and Church members, who are gathered into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies, and makes a likeneſſe unto your ſelves, and are now profeſſing the Saints conditions in words. How come you hither, to climb up ſo high in words, when as you are what you were before, if not worſe? Think it not a hard ſaying, for it is ſo among many of you, and in the light which is pure you are weighed, and when one comes to try you your language bewrays you that you are not what you profeſſe, for when you are tryed by the Saints practiſes and life that was in them, and the injoyment they had with God, you are found ſo far from being any ſuch that you even op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the faith they believed in: as ſome of your Paſtors o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to my face in the hearing of two hundred people, ſaid, all the Saints dyed ſinners, and ſo was ſo far from owning the perfect righteouſneſſe of Chriſt that he even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119728:14"/>
it and ſaid it was hereſie; and others of you ſay, you believe that all the graces the Saints enjoy are imperfect, yea even faith is imperfect; and others ſaying, that all the righteouſneſſe that was wrought in them by faith was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; and others ſaying, while the light of Chriſt Jeſus condemned them, yet Chriſt juſtified them, and yet that which was wrought in them there was failings in it, and ſo you have imagined a faith and righteouſneſſe of your own, and ſuch a Chriſt to talk on, and a redemption as you may live in luſts, and be men pleaſers, and in the cuſtomes and faſhions of the world, and coveteouſneſſe, and pleads for ſin, and puts perfect righteouſneſſe to another world, and thus the Devill hath deceived you, and ſo you ſet up, and makes covers, but all will not hide you in the day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, for God joynes not to that which is imperfect, neither is that true faith which is imperfect and which layes hold upon an imperfect righteouſneſſe, that is ſuch a faith as never was profeſſed by ony of the Saints, whoſe words you profeſſe, for they had received faith the gift of God, the leaſt meaſure of which was perfect, and as they ſtood in it, though it was but as a graine of Muſtard-ſeed, they ſaid to this mountaine be removed and it was ſo; and that which was in them reveald by the Son, led them that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in it to lay hold upon Chriſts righteouſneſs, which was and is perfect, which had (yea hath) no ſpots, nor wrinckles, nor ſtaine, and this righteouſneſſe was made manifeſt in them by the faith of the Son, by which they were juſtified in the ſight of God, and came with boldneſſe before the throne of Chriſt, for in them there was no condemnation, neither guilt, but became one with the Judge, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto him and his throne, and to the Lamb by him who is the Midiator, and hath made peace betwixt them and the Father, and ſo were juſtified in the ſight of God, and this witneſſe they had in them, that they pleaſed God, and were accepted of God, and this righteouſneſſe was wrought in them, and is now the ſame which is wrought in the Saints, by him who is their light and life, and this was the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119728:14"/>
of faith, and that which was wrought by Chriſt in the Saints, as they believed in him, and in the meaſure of grace received from him, which ſaved them from ſin, which vvas not of themſelves, he perfected his ovvn vvork in them, through and by faith, and juſtified them, and ſanctified them and became their vviſdome, by vvhich they vvere led into all truth, out of failings and imperfection; and vveakneſſes, and he became their ſtrength and rock and they vvere buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon him, and as they ſtood upon him the rock, they vvere preſerved vvhen the vvaves did beat, and vvhen temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations came, and vvere ſure and ſtedfaſt, and immoveable, and ſo overcame the Armies of Aliens, and quenched the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of fire, and reſiſted the Devill, and quenched his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery darts, and had victory over the Heathen, and reigned as Kings over the Beaſts of the field, and over the deceit, and by the receiving and believing of the word of him, who was and is called Jeſus, by which faith came by the hearing of, they overcame the enemies of their ſoules, and him who hath the power of death: and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the blood of him who is eternall, who is Jeſus the Midiator of the new and living way, they overcame the Dragon, even by the word of his teſtimony, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in them; which word of faith <hi>Paul</hi> vvho vvas a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter preached unto them, even to them vvho had the vvord in them and turned them to it, and as they believed in it, they were ſanctified by it, and cleanſed by it, and made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and then they witneſſed the bringing in of a better hope, which perfects and makes perfect as pertaining to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which while they ſtood without, looking at Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary things, and divers waſhings, and thoſe things which were figures of the true Tabernacle made without hands which ſtood untill the time of Reformation, and then done away, to wit the hand writings, and them that witneſſes the new Covenant now, they ſee them done away, and the time of Reformation is come, the ſame which they witneſſed, <hi>Glory for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore all you profeſſors, who have builded high
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119728:15"/>
Towers and Caſtles in your imaginations, and hath told of Reformation theſe many years; but you have nothing but a hand-writing to eſtabliſh your building upon, and all your Reformation hath been but the waſhing of cups, and pulling down one thing, and ſet up another beggerly Elementary Images and doe not witneſſe the better hope brought in, nor the time of Reformation, nor cannot abide that any ſhould declare it unto you, nor believe it, nor hear it, nor while your eyes are without and not in the head you cannot ſee when good comes, but are as Heathens in the deſart, and although you are among the brambles and bryars, yet you would be counted Kings and Heads over others, and one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Image in this manner, and another in that, of all ſorts high and low, but all ſtands in the earth, and all in one ground, and what doe they availe you? for they cannot ſave, for your higheſt enjoyment is imperfect (you ſay) what then ſerve theſe for? onely for you to talk on, and this is all they ſerve for, and to contend and ſtrive about one with another, and all in your wills, while the will of God in you is not hearkned unto, but caſt behind your backs, and ſo the way of true peace you never come to attaine unto.</p>
            <p>Oh, when will you be weary of feeding upon the wind, and of husks among ſwine, and upon that which dies of it ſelfe? and when will you enquire after the living God who is power? how long have you talked of his power to come many years? and you are ſtill as far off, if not further than you were before, and hath told of the glory of the Lord to be revealed, and of his Law being written in the heart, and of God teaching his people himſelfe, and of his Spirit being poured out upon his ſons and daughters, and you cannot ſee that you have obtained nothing; and you have prayed, and what have you obtained nothing? for you have asked amiſſe, and one comes hungry, and is ſtill complaining, and then you that are full feeds them with the old dregs and lees which you are ſetled upon, and the old leaven of aiery noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conceptions, and wine of the ſowre grape, which ſets on edge the childrens teeth and fills them to full, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119728:15"/>
when the living bread is broken, they cannot eate nor reliſh it nor taſt, and ſo cannot enter your ſelves, nor ſuffer others to enter, and when theſe things are witneſſed in the life which you have talked on ſo long, you cannot own them that doth declare it, and when the power of God is declared unto you what it is, and where it is to be waited for, you cannot own it, this is too low for you and except the Lord will come in your way, that you preſcribe unto him, you will not look upon him, but as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did whoſe eyes were without, and your fallen wiſdome cannot receive him, nor compaſſe his eternall wiſdome.</p>
            <p>And yet you will ſay, the <hi>Jewes</hi> did require a ſigne, and were in the adultery; and the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſought after wiſdome, and they ſtumbled: and yet you cannot ſee your ſelves in the ſame ſtate: Did ever God reveal himſelfe to the fallen wiſdome, which is learned from that principle which is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and gone out from God? or to the will of man which is at enmity againſt God? Nay, nay, He never did, nor will reveal his counſell, but to that which is of himſelfe, which is the leaſt of all ſeeds in the world, and it is he that is borne of God, that heareth Gods word, and what is borne of the Spirit is Spirit, and is nouriſhed by the Spirit, and led by it, and ſo the ſpirituall God reveals his Law and his Statutes to him, and his teſtimony which is ſure. How long have you talked of the Spirit, and worſhipping in Spirit? and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed denies its leading and teaching, and lives in the oldneſſe of the letter, and crying up, and ſetting up things that are carnal, and viſible, and Elementary, and waſhing is not known from ſin, nor cleanſing; and ſo you may ſee what operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Spirit you have talked on, hath, when you are ſtill what you were.</p>
            <p>Now the Spirit of God is operative, and works a change in the ground, and tranſlateth all that follow and hearken unto it into its own nature, when all thoſe things you ſo much ſtrive about were but a ſhadow, for the vvord vvas in the beginning and gave life, and is ſpiritual, and vvhen its knovvn and vvitneſſed vvithin in the heart, it ſeparates from death
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119728:16"/>
and gives life to all that hear it and believe in it: What Chriſt is this you preach? and what Goſpel is this you preach vvhich ſaves you not from guilt and condemnation? for the vvord of the true Chriſt vvhere it is ovvned, cleanſeth and takes avvay ſin, and condemns it, and blots it out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the root from vvhence it flovvs forth, and vvorks a nevv creation, in righteouſneſſe, and the Lamb of God takes avvay ſin, in which the Churches of Chriſt believed, and is glad tidings to all that doe receive it: now none can witnes gladneſs of ſoul where there is guilt, which (you all affirm) is in every Chriſtian, while in this world, and ſo you might ſee that its not the true Chriſt nor the everlaſting Goſpell you preach, but this you cannot bear: Yet you ſay, he hath taken away your ſin; How much is ſin taken away? if you ſay all, how comes the guilt and trouble that is in you? for if it be taken away, and his juſtice ſatisfied, this were to make God unjuſt to charge it upon you againe: But I tell you when his witneſſe in your conſcience convinceth you, and manifeſts unto you that you commit it, and reproves for it, I ſay, you cannot witneſſe his juſtice ſatisfied, for the light is juſt, which is one with God, and when this condemns you, there is no God that will juſtifie you: But you uſe to ſay, Its all done in Chriſt; I ask, where? if it be not taken away, and unleſſe you have the witneſſe of it in you, your faith is vain; for he that believes hath the witneſs in himſelfe, which none hath who walks contrary unto the light the pure vvitnes of Chriſt, for this convinceth you of ſin, and bears witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you: Now ſhew your witneſſe within you, and your aſſurance; I ſay unto you, while the teſtimony of Jeſus bears teſtimonie againſt you it bears not witneſſe unto you, and ſo ſee your confuſion. But after you have believed in Chriſt (as you ſay) and have received all his Ordinances, if any thing after did judge you and bring trouble upon you, this you u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call a temptation, and ſo put light for darkneſſe, and darknes for light; I ſay, there is no guilt where ſin is taken away, and crucified, but peace and reſt in the holy God, who is unchangeable, and ſo is his witneſſe unchangeable, which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119728:16"/>
judgeth and condemnes the changeable. But you uſe to ſay, <hi>His love is unchangeable, and whom he loves once, he loves to the end;</hi> Yea, but it is him who is begotten by the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall word, which was in the beginning, and which word leads to the beginning again, before the Hatred was, the Promiſe is to this ſeed, not ſeeds as to many, but the ſeed of the Covenant, there he loves from the womb, yea, the womb that bears the ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the paps that gives them ſuck, and where this is known, as to enjoyment, <hi>Eſau</hi> is caſt out, and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> inherits the Promiſe, and <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Moab</hi> is laid waſt, and <hi>Amaleck</hi> is ſlain by the edge of the ſword, and the ſeed of evil doers cut off, bleſſed are they that can witneſſe this in truth, and till this be known, the everlaſting love of God is not known, which is ſtronger then death, and ſin is death, and where it is acted &amp; conceived, love is not witneſſed, nor its ſtrength, but wrath comes upon the Children of diſobedience, and are you not Children of diſobedience while you break the holy Law of God, in which is power, which is in the heart, and it bears witneſſe againſt you, and in you, and yet ſay you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe that ever you ſhall be able to fullfill it; if you fullfill it not, you break it, and then the wrath abides upon you. But then you ſay, if we muſt fulfill the Law, what uſe is Chriſt of?

            <p>Oh fooliſh people and unwiſe! when will ye ſeek after wiſedome, and hearken that your ſoules may live?

if them who had profeſſed no love to God had done thus, it might have been born, but ye treacherous hearts, your ingratitude and hypocriſie cannot be born, but the Lord God will viſit for theſe things; that you ſhould now act by thoſe Lawes which you cryed out of as oppreſſive, and ſhould deliver your brethren up to the devourer and ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who have born a part of the ſuffering in the Nations diſtreſſe and grief, in the greateſt calamity, would you thus be done by? would you bear it well?

            <p>Have not many of you in <hi>England</hi> been acting in the ſteps of the prophane? when the Lord hath given you what you ſought after, liberty and freedome in thoſe things; and now you labour by all your ſtrength and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to oppreſſe them who walk blameleſſe before the Lord and men alſo. Oh, what? is all your preaching, and praying, and fighting, and warring come to this, that none muſt declare the mind of the Lord, except it be in your way, or will, or time, under paine of bonds, and baniſhment fines and impriſonment, ſtocking, whipping, ſtoning? and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you that have been ſufferers your ſelves, now comes to be chief oppreſſors and oppoſers of the Lord in his way, and all manner of lyes and reproaches you caſt upon the truth, and you take part with the reſt of the Prieſts and deceivers in the Nation, which take part againſt you when you was for the Lord, and numbers us among tranſgreſſors, of every hand to make the truth odious to all. Theſe things and much more are found among you, from the leaſt to the greateſt, and yet you would be accounted Chriſtians; and if you ſay, you have thus learned Chriſt, I ſay you know him not: Can you limit the Ocean from flowing? or can you command the wind that it blow not? or can you ſtop the windowes of Heaven that it raine not upon the Earth? if you cannot at all doe it all, lye down, he that reproves

God let him anſwer it: Have you given counſell to the Lord? or have you been his Inſtructer? or can you limit him in his way? if you cannot, no more ſhall you be able to ſtop his way, who is riding on in his power, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns all the worlds wiſedome, and power, and ſtrength, and who is able to reſiſt him, who dryes up the face of the deep and ſaith to the Sea, be ſtill, and to the mountaines be removed, and they are ſo; and he vvill advance his ovvn glory and povver againſt all mens vvills and Lavves, vvhich ſtands in mans vvill, and vvill break all your cords as a Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſh, and overthrovv all your counſell, and make it even vvith the earth, and ſhame ſhall cover all his oppoſers, and therefore learne wiſdome, Oh ye Potſheards of the earth, and ceaſe to ſtrive againſt the Lord, and his power which will be too ſtrong for you, and you ſhall not be able to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him, nor ſtop him in his way, who runs his courſe as a Gyant, and bruiſes all his enemies heads, and cuts them in peece by the two edged ſword of his mouth, which he hath put into the bands of his Saints who follow him in the Warr, and our conqueſt is through ſuffering, <hi>Glory unto him for ever,</hi> who hath counted us worthy to ſuffer for his names ſake, and to be brought before Rulers and Councels for his names ſake that the Scripture might be fullfilled in us in this day, as it was upon our Brethren who went before us.</p>
            <p>And Oh ye Rulers and Officers of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who have been Profeſſors and affecters of liberty, and for ſuppreſſing of Tyranny, behold now the Lord hath ſent to try you, and you are found in the ſame footſteps when you are tryed, as them that the Lord caſt out before you; and in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the chief Prieſts, and Elders, and Councels, who breaths out threatnings, and ſends out your Warrants, and Inquiſitions to bind all, and to ſend up all bound too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, that ſo evill (you ſay) may be prevented in time, and takes reports from the Prieſts and falſe Prophets of the Nations, who are liars, evill Beaſts, whoſe mouths the Lord will ſtop, and bring ſhame upon; who are flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,

and have flattered the Powers and Rulers before you, till they were all cut off, and now they flatter you, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold up their Divination without you help them, what Goſpel is this they Preach? when a few poor deſpiſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are hated of the World, that the ſound of them makes them afraid, Oh that ever you ſhould be ſo ignorant to joyn to <hi>Baal,</hi> but let him plead for himſelf and they ſtand by their God, and their Goſpel, and if they be not able to defend themſelves, let them periſh, let them periſh. But them who comes in their own name, you receive but them who comes in the name of the Lord, and ſeeks none of your Tithes, nor Augmentations, nor your advance, them you cannot bear ſhould be in the Nation, who are not troubleſome to any, nor deſires to eat any mans bread for naught, and theſe you call of an evill life.

            <p>And theſe Pariſh Teachers which you hold up in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge them all in the name of the Lord who lives for ever, that in all their publick worſhip (as they call it) and them alſo, that they are not like God, nor any of his Miniſters, nor any thing that ever they practice. And therefore I ſay, Come forth and vindicate your practice, and let your God come forth, and be tryed, and lay open your practice, and your Principles to the world, and ſtand by them if you can, and for ſhame never run to the Magiſtrate to help; you learned Rabbies, you great Orators, come forth, and ſtand and prove your ſelves before the people, and manifeſt your ſtrength, and your weapons, and that God that anſwers by fire, let him be God, you have confeſſed our God anſwers by fire, for its kindled among you, and the word which is fire we have declared, and many hath heard it, and have believed, and anſwered it, and now it burns, and you ſhall not be able to quench it; poſt and run as faſt as you can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dig as deep for Councel as Hell, call up all the powers of darkneſſe, you ſhall not be able to quench the fire that is kindled.

            <p>And therefore I ſay unto you, all you Pariſh Teachers, and all you that uphold them, arm your ſelves with all your ſtrength, call your Diviners together, for we proclaim in the Lords name (who hath rent the Heavens, and is come down, and his Tabernacle is with men) open War we declare, and ſounds the Trumpet of our God, out of the holy mountaine, all the earth ſhall tremble before him, and the mountaines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall melt before him, why ſhould we be undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered

            <p>
               <hi>And now a few words unto you, O yee heads and Rulers of the people in</hi> Ireland, who ſit in Judgement, remember from whence you are ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and how great deliverance you have had, and how manifeſt the Lord hath appeared for you, to deliver you out of the hands of blood thirſty men, and your enemies, who deſpiſed the Lord, and all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and they were numerous and great, when you have been in great ſtraits, and they ſaid in their hearts, we will ſwallow them up, and then the Lord in the day of your diſtreſſe delivered you, and hath given you their poſſeſſions, and dominion over them, and hath ſetled you in peace, and you that hath been but low, hath he exalted to bear rule, and expects from you righteouſneſſe, and juſtice, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to be as ſeet to the lame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtrength to the weak, and to break off every yoak of oppreſſion from the neck of the poor, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and to relieve your brethren, and to entertain ſtrangers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring you were many of you ſtrangers in this Land, which now is given you to poſſeſſe; I ſay, take heed unto your ſelves, how you act according to the cuſtomes of the Nation, and your own wills, nor the cuſtomary worſhip of the Nation, which the Lord laid by, and waſt, and ſcattered all them that pretended themſelves Teachers of the people; was there any of them that ſtood in the gap, or turned people from their iniquity? till the Lord broke out in his wrath as fire, and laid the Land waſt, and the houſe of their God waſt, which you burnt up; and will you now joyn with <hi>Moab?</hi> and will you build again thoſe things which you have once deſtroyed? then you make your ſelves tranſgreſſors. Think not thus in your hearts, that the Lord hath given you dominion over the Nation to walk after your own wills, and joyn unto deceit, and that you may eſtabliſh thoſe things again, which the Lord was wroth with. And if you hold up thoſe by your Lawes, and your power, and your priſons, and your ſword, which is the people of the Lords curſe, I ſpeak of the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers

who are in <hi>Balaams</hi> way; and greedy dumb dogs, who can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have enough; and beſtow the Nations Tythes, and Lands, and riches, which is the Lords treaſure, upon them, that they may cry up deceit, and flatter you, both you and they will fall together.</p>
            <p>And friends I am plaine with you, The hand of the Lord is againſt them, and all the power of the Nations ſhall not ſave them from his indignation.

            <p>And if they were to depart from the preſence of God, who fed not the Saints, neither clothed them, nor vſited them in priſon, but were to depart with the Devill and his Angels into everlaſting fire; what will become of you who inſtead of clothing incourageth the people to rent them off us, and inſtead of feeding us, gives command to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part becauſe we are ſtrangers, and inſtead of v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
