            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat was more to bee wiſhed on earth then the great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe this day wee enjoy, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſee his Royall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty our Native Sovereign and his loyall Subjects of both his Kingdomes ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally united, That his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty is piouſly pleaſed to grant unto us his Subjects our lawfull demands concerning Religion and Liberties, and we his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of both Nations cheerfully rendring to his Majeſty that dutie, affection, and aſſiſtance, which he hath juſt cauſe to expect from good people, and each Nation concurring in brotherly amitie, unity, and concord, one towards the other.</p>
            <p>Oh, what tongue is able to expreſſe the honour and praiſe due to that great and good God, who in theſe late Commotions ſuffered not the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of either Kingdome to deſpaire of the ſafetie of either Common-wealth, but through his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to their painfull and prudent endevours hath
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111028:3"/>
wrought ſuch an happineſſe for us, That now after the great toyle and trouble which we have on both ſides ſo long endured, wee may each man with his wife, children, and friends, under his own Vine and Fig-tree (and all under his Majeſties protection) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelfe, with the ſweet fruits of peace, which I beſeech the Lord of peace to make perpetuall to both Nations.</p>
            <p>And to that end my earneſt deſires are, that all our beſt ſtudies and endeavours may bee employed (for ſome time) in contriving and eſtabliſhing ſuch wholſome Laws in both Kingdomes whereby (as much as in us lyes) the opportunity and occaſion of producing the like calamities as lately threatned both Nations may for the future be prevented, if in any age hereafter ſuch Miſcreants ſhall goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to attempt it.</p>
            <p>It is (my Lords) notorious, that the late Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries that occaſioned the great differences betwixt his Majeſty and his Subjects took much advantage &amp; courage by the too long intermiſſion of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſtitution of Parliaments, In the vacancie of which they by falſe informations incenſed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty againſt his loyall Subjects, and by their wily inſinuations extorted from his Highneſſe Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations for to yield obedience to their innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Kirke, and Patents for Projects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the poore Subject was both polled and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his eſtate, and enthralled in his conſcience:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111028:3"/>
and thus by their wicked practices, his Majeſtie was diſtaſted, and his Subjects generally diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, in ſo much, that had not the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God prevented them, they had made an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction betwixt his Majeſtie and his liege people, and had broken thoſe mutuall and indiſſoluble bonds of protection and allegiance, whereby, I hope, his Royall Majeſtie, and his loyall and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Subjects of all his three Kingdomes, will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bound together. To which let all good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lords, the diſtaſte of his Majeſty, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of his Subjects, could never have come to that height they did (nor conſequently have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſuch effects) had not there bin ſuch an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, by theſe Innovators and Projectors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Majeſtie our glorious Sun, and us his loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Subjects, that his goodneſſe appeared not (for the time) to us, nor our loyaltie and obedience to him. For no ſooner was that happy Conſtellation (the Parliament in <hi>England</hi>) raiſed, and thereby thoſe vaporous clouds diſsipated, but his Majeſties goodneſſe, his good Subjects loyalty, and their treachery, evidently appeared.</p>
            <p>Our Brethren of <hi>England</hi> (my Lords) finding the intermiſsion of Parlaments to be prejudiciall and dangerous to the State, have taken care, and made proviſion for the frequent holding of them: whoſe prudent example My Motion is may be our pattern forthwith to obtaine his Majeſties Royall aſſent,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111028:4"/>
for doing the like here in this Kingdome. By which meanes his Majeſty may in due time heare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe the grievances of his Subjects, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (as neede ſhall require) chearefully aid and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his Majeſty, And nor only the domeſtique peace and quiet of each Kingdome bee preſerved, But likewiſe all Nationall differences (if any hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen) may be by the wiſdome of the Aſſemblies of both Kingdomes, from time to time compoſed and reconciled to the perpetuating of the happie peace and union betwixt both Nations.</p>
