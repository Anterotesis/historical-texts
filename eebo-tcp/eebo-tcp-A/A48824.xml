            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> and Embassador in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> for <hi>Maximilian</hi> II. Emperor: In an Epistle to the said Emperor (wherein he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his Judgment about granting the Cup to the Laity, and the Marriage of Priests) writes thus of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>:</head>
            <p>WHat good could be done in that Council, where voices were taken by number not by weight? If argument, if reason, might have prevailed, if we had had some, and those not many, to take part with us, though we should have been but a few, yet had we overthrown the great forces of our Adversaries: But when all stood upon number, wherein we were much inferior, we could not get the better, the Pope was able to set an hundred of his against every one of ours: And if an hundred were not sufficient, he could upon a sudden have created a thousand to succour them that were ready to faint and perish. Therefore we might see every day hungry and needy Bishops, and those for the most part beardless yonkers, and wastfully riotous, come in flocks to <hi>Trent,</hi> hired to give their voices according to the Popes humour: unlearned indeed, and foolish, but of good use to him for their audaciousness and impudency. When these fellows were joined to the Popes old flatterers, then Iniquity got the upper hand and triumphed: neither could any thing be decreed but according to their liking who thought it the highest point of Religion to defend the power and riot of the Pope. There was in the Council a grave and learned man, who could not endure this indignity; but the Council by terror threatning and baiting him, as one that was <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> good Catholick, drew him to yield to that which he did no way like of. In a word, things are brought to that pass by their dishonesty who came thither prepared and made for the nonce, that it seemed to be a Council not of Bishops but of Puppies; not of Men but of Images, who (as it is reported of <hi>Daedalus</hi> statues) were moved not by their own, but by other mens nerves and muscles. Those hireling Bishops most of them were like Country Bag-pipes, which must have breath blown into them before they can sound. The Holy Ghost had nothing to do with that Conventicle all things were argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by humane policy, which was wholly employed in maintaining the immoderate, and indeed most shameless Lordship and Domination of the Popes. From thence were Answers looked and waited for, as it were from the Oracles of <hi>Delphos</hi> or <hi>Dodona</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From thence the Holy Ghost, who (as they brag) is President of their Council, was sent shut up in the Carriers budgets and packs, who (a thing worthy to be laught at) when the waters were up (as it falls out many times) was fain to stay till they were down again before he could repair to the Council.</p>
            <p>By this it came to pass that the Spirit was not carried upon the waters, as in <hi>Genesis,</hi> but along beside the waters. O monstrous and incredible madness! nothing that the Bishops, as it were the body of the Church resolved of, could be of any force, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it came first from the Pope as the head of the body.</p>

               <note place="margin">4. <hi>Of the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
               </note> and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by the said <hi>Pius Quartus,</hi> it is expresly declared, That if the Holy Bible were allowed to all indifferently in the Vulgar Tongue, there would come more hurt than good of it. This is an express and direct opposition to our Lord Jesus Christ, who saith to all indifferently, <hi>Search the Scriptures for in them you think to have eternal life; and they are they that testifie of me.</hi> And to his holy Apostles, who address their Epistle not only to Bishops, but also to all those that call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, and not only to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61320:4"/>
men, but also to women, young folk, and children, adjuring them by the Lord, that they be read to all the holy brethren. Whence we argue thus, All who forbid Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people to read the holy Scripture, do directly and formally oppose Jesus Christ and his holy Apostles: But the Pope and his Creatures forbid Christians to read the holy Scriptures, therefore they directly and formally oppose Jesus Christ and his Apostles.</p>
            <p>But doth not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> own the holy Scripture to be the word of God?</p>
            <p>Nevertheless she hath falsified and corrupted it in many places. As for example, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.21. It is said, <hi>that</hi> Jacob <hi>worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff,</hi> but the Romish Bible saith, <hi>that</hi> Jacob <hi>worshipped the top of his staff,</hi> thereby to confirm the adoration of creatures, which is the same abuse which is found in <hi>Psal.</hi> 132. where <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>worship at his footstool,</hi> the Romish Bible says, <hi>worship his footstool.</hi> Jesus Christ when he gave the Cup, said, <hi>This Cup is the New Testament of my blood, which is shed for you</hi>; but the Romish Bible reads it, <hi>which shall be shed for you,</hi> left it might be perceived that Jesus Christ speaks of the effusion of his Sacramental blood: For he did not then really shed his blood, which he began to shed in his passion. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. God says, <hi>that the seed of the woman</hi> (which is Jesus Christ) <hi>shall bruise the serpents bead</hi>: The Romish translation saith, <hi>The woman shall bruise the serpents head</hi>: attributing that to the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> which belongs to <hi>Christ.</hi> To establish the uncertainty of salvation, the vulgar translation reads the first verse of <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. thus, <hi>man knows not whether he be worthy of love or hatred, but all things are reserved in uncertainty for the future.</hi> But the Hebrew Text is this, <hi>No man knows either love or hatred by all that is before them.</hi> To establish mans merit, the Romish Bible corrupts the 13. verse of <hi>Heb.</hi> 16. And to the same purpose they have curtail'd the 6. verse of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. leaving out two links for these words of the Apostle, (<hi>If it be of Works, then it is no more of Grace, otherwise work is no more work</hi>) are rased out, and omitted in their vulgar translation. A great collection might be made of many other passages, and of <hi>Romes</hi> enormities in her like practices.</p>
            <p>Yet is not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the mother and mistress of all Churches?</p>
            <p>No, For the preaching of Christ was to begin at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in the Prophesie of <hi>Isaiah</hi> 2.2. <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.2. and in the completion in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47.<note place="margin">

                  </note> First, They worship Angels, contrary to the express prohibition of Saint <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> 11. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They adore the Cross, and the figure of it, with adoration of <hi>Latria,</hi> (which is the term whereby the soveraign Adoration, wherewith they adore God, is expressed; which is directly and formally against the express words of our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, They make graven Images; and resemblances of things in Heaven, and bow down to them, and worship them; beside they make Images of God himself, and represent him both in carved work and painting, which are used in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and are received almost everywhere, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confesseth in <hi>lib.</hi> 2. of <hi>Images, c.</hi> 8.

                     <hi>Popish presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi>
                  </note> The Romish Church commands (under pretence of Religion) on certain days to abstain from certain meats, and forbids Marriage to Priests, and thus directly opposes St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and expresly teaches what this great Apostle calls a doctrine of devils, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Popish Church professes to believe that Jesus Christ is on earth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his humane nature, which is contrary to what he himself saith in St. <hi>John ch.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. and contrary to the express words of St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3. <hi>That the Heaven must receive him, until the times of the restitution of all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Romish Church teaches that Christ is offered often in the Sacrament of the Ma's, which directly contradicts the Apostle, who expresly saith, and without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That he is not offered often.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, Papists teach the Mass is an unbloody sacrifice, and yet propitiatory for the remission of the sins of the quick and dead; which directly opposeth the Apostle, who saith in express words, <hi>without shedding of blood there is no remission.</hi> And where there is remission of sins, there is no more offering for sin, but in the sacrifice which Jesus Christ offered to God on the Cross, there is remission of sin, therefore there is no more offering for sin, and consequently it is false that the Mass is an offering for sin, and a propitiatory sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Our Lord Jesus Christ in the Institution of his holy Supper, presents the Cup to all those to whom he had distributed the bread, saying to them, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> &amp;c. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> forbids the people the use of the Cup of the Lord, and therefore directly and formally opposeth our Lord Christ, and his Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ordains in express words, <hi>Let a man examine himself, and so let him drink of that Cup.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>The Popish Church ordains a prodigious number of Festivals,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9 10, 11.</note> against the express clause of that Law which the Soveraign Law-giver hath given. <hi>Six days shalt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>; whence we argue thus, Whosoever forbids people to work six days of the week on pain of a mortal sin, doth manifestly set himself above God, who expresly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us to work six days: But the Pope and his Prelates do forbid people to work six days of the week on pain of a mortal sin. Therefore the Pope and his Prelates do manifestly set themselves above God.</p>
               <p>Papists say that the works of regenerate men are Christs works in them, not their own, and as Christs they save, and so are saved by Christs merits: Whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, we are not saved by such works as God hath ordained regenerate men should walk in, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> opposeth all works done in matter of Justification and Salvation to the Grace of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27.</p>
               <p>This their finest web being so clearly cut in sunder by those plain texts, they grosly dare avouch and teach, that a man is saved by works, and can merit the eternal feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Heaven, and degrees of glory and bliss, and thus directly fight against the doctrine of the Son of God, and of his blessed Apostles, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. <hi>When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say we are unprofitable servants</hi>; we have done that which was our duty to do. And <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. <hi>By grace ye are saved through faith, and that not of your selves, it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast.</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61320:7"/>
And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. <hi>The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. And if it be by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace; but if it be of works, then it is no more of grace, otherwise work is no more work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus Papists works become not only unprofitable unto them, but plainly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, yea and blasphemous, because they ruinate the very foundation of our faith, and make frustrate the all and alone sufficient sacrifice of our Redemption, <hi>viz.</hi> the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

So the Pope pretends to be the Vicar of Christ, though his enemy, and the more wicked, because he pretends to be Christ's Vicar. So the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a Church, and the Pope Antichrist who hath impudently pearched, and with all ungodliness erected his seat therein.

               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>In merit, mediation, satisfaction, supererogation, and pardon, which is an humane invented Religion, or an Antichristian superstructure, to undermine, and as much as possible, to overthrow all that is truly Christian.</p>
               <p>This Popery, the very word of a Mediator, doth sufficiently refute; for if a man can merit, mediate, satisfie, supererogate, pardon, and do all himself, what needs he either Saviour or Mediator?</p>
               <p>Beside, the Holy Scripture gives us a general Rule, which is alone sufficient to make us reject the Mass, Purgatory, Papal Indulgences, Invocation of Saints, Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reliques, Adoration of Crosses, and all Humane Invented Traditions.

               <p>Thus their Church flies to their invented Traditions for bottom, and their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Pope the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Romish Faith.</hi>
                  </note> Church and Faith fly to the Pope to center all in his personal Infallibility, and notwithstanding one Pope can condemn another for an Heretick, and yet every Pope must be still Infallible! and as Dr. <hi>Harden</hi> avouches, can dispense with all things against the Law of Nature, against the Apostles Creed, against the New and Old Testament, and above General Councils.</p>
               <p>So that the Pope exalts himself above all that is called God, for God in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made but creatures, but the Pope can make as many Gods as he list. Secondly, he make himself of more authority then God, because he will not have Gods word to be authentical without his allowance; but what he saith, however contrary to the Text, must be <hi>ipsissimum Dei verbum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beside this head of Antichristian Heresies assumes to himself the Title of Universal Pastor,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Rex regum, Dominus dominantium, Admirabilis, Leo de Tribu Judae, Radix David.</hi> His doctrine is also that <hi>Papa habet Imperium in Angelos &amp; Daemones</hi>; and is not this to make himself a God?</p>
               <p>Is not this that Beast full of the names of Blasphemy?</p>
               <p>And as his Majesty of blessed memory observed most prudently, that there is no Church, State, nor Man that hath been since the penning of the Revelations, to whom those things foretold by the Apostle from the mouth of the Lord Jesus, can in any reasonable fort agree, but the Church and Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>I might add much, but will only instance the sayings of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> (recited by <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> à Lap.</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.11.) When I was first in Orders, I had some good hopes of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61320:8"/>
salvation; when I was made a Cardinal, I doubted; but now that I am made a Pope, I do almost despair. And that saying of Pope <hi>Marcellus</hi> the Second, wherein he seems to be pretty ingenious for striking his hand upon the Table, he uttered these words, <hi>Non video quomodo qui hunc locum altissimum teneant, salvari possunt,</hi> I see not how any Pope can be saved.</p>
               <p>Now let us cast our eyes upon Gods word and promise, and firmly believe if <hi>Agag</hi> be to be slain, God is raising up some <hi>Samuel</hi> to do it; yea let us cast our eyes upon Gods work already, and we shall see him gone a great way in the accomplishing of his word, whereby we may strengthen our Faith in that which remaineth. For how hath the word preached discovered him to be that man of sin? detected his frauds and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures, with which for many Ages he deluded the blind world.</p>
               <p>How are his Bulls and Excommunications esteemed as wind? How do all Reformed Churches detest his Antichristian usurped power over the Scripture, Churches, and Mens Consciences? How do many Princes despise his claws over them? How weak are all their Popish endeavours to prevent final ruine? viz. Sophistry, knotty distinctions to hide and delude the plain sense of Scripture, threatnings, treacheries, Machivilian contrivances, wars, treasons, murders, massacres, powder-plots, firing of Towns and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lo these are the inseparable marks of Popery, and the brands of their devillish Religion. And these do but hasten their incurable destruction, rendring them odious to Christian States, Princes and People, yea and to Turks and Infidels. Certainly the date of her reign is almost out, and the time draweth on apace, wherein both she and her King <hi>Abaddon</hi> shall be laid in the dust. That man of sin, the son of perdition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he is as God, sitteth in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>The Gospel now being so restored, and that Antichrist of <hi>Rome</hi> so clearly manifested, wo be unto them that delight in the whore, <hi>They shall be tormented with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone before the holy Angels and the Lamb, and the smoke of their torment shall ascend for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and they shall have no rest day nor night who worship the Beast and his Image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then the followers of Antichrist shall be damned, let not our souls enter into their secret. As the wicked man shall not meddle with a Christians joy, so let not a good man meddle with Antichristian wo.</p>
               <p>But what are the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that are against the Foundation of Truth and Salvation?</p>
               <p>They are all those which draw from Jesus Christ that honour that is due unto him as Saviour of the World.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Popish doctrines against the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Truth and Salvation.</hi>

               <p>Justification by Merits, Adoration of the Mass, and all other Idolatrizing points of Antichrist, these undermine and oppose Christs Priestly Office.</p>
