            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>1 COR. vi. 14.</bibl>
               <q>God <hi>hath both Raised up the Lord, and will also Raise up Us by His own Power.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>BOTH this great Festival of the Catholick Church, and the special occasion of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary Meeting, have directed me to the Choice of these Words for my present Subject.</p>
            <p>A Discourse on that greatest Article of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, <hi>Our Lords Resurrection,</hi> you need not be told, is what this <hi>Festival</hi> calls for; and a Discourse on <hi>our own future Resurrection,</hi> and the Life to come, as we shall now Apply it, you will be satisfied is no less suitable to the design of this Meeting.</p>
            <p>And in speaking to the <hi>Former</hi> of the Propositions which our Text consists of, I shall with all possible brevity lay the <hi>Evidence</hi> before you, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our Belief of Our <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Resurrection</hi> from Death to Life.</p>
            <p>That He was <hi>put to Death,</hi> is no more to be doubted than that such a Person once <hi>lived;</hi> nor did either the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105354:5"/>
               <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> who lived in those days, ever que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion it. He was Publickly Crucified, and in the sight of a <hi>Great</hi> Multitude, between two Thieves; and not taken down from the Cross, till after the Spear had pierced His Heart: And all the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were so satisfied He was <hi>dead,</hi> that they <hi>brake</hi> not His Legs, as they did His Fellow sufferers; where by a Prophecy concerning Him, was, unawares to His Enemies, fulfilled by them. After which His Body was Buryed, and the Sepulchre watched till the <hi>Third</hi> Day by a Guard of Souldiers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> His Inveterate Enemies, do to <hi>this</hi> day upbraid Us <hi>Christians</hi> with His Death, and scoff at us for Believing in a Crucified Saviour: And His Ignominious Death is <hi>the</hi> great Scandal which hath hitherto prejudiced them against the Christian Faith. <hi>Christ Crucified,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>is to the Jews a Stumbling - block, and to the Greeks Foolishness.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> indeed say, that Our Saviour did <hi>not</hi> dye, but was Translated, <hi>Mahomet</hi> having told them, that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was Crucified in the place of <hi>Jesus.</hi> But if the Followers of that Great Impostor were not miserably Bewitched, they could never have rested on <hi>his</hi> sole Authority, about a Matter of Fact of <hi>six</hi> Ages stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, against the Evidence of Universal Tradition. And besides, what Blindness are they under, who prefer <hi>Mahomet</hi> before <hi>Christ,</hi> whilst they believe <hi>Christ</hi> so dear to God as to be received up into Heaven, when they acknowledge <hi>Mahomet</hi> not only to have dyed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105354:5"/>
like other Mortals, but likewise still to remain among the dead! There were also those in the Primitive Times among the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> who to their other mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Forgeries, added <hi>this,</hi> That <hi>Simon,</hi> who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to bear Christ's Cross, being changed into His likeness, was Crucified for Him; Christ himself stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Crowd looking on him, and deriding him, But <hi>S. Irenoeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> who lived in their Time have given us such an Account of these People, as speaks them scarcely otherwise distinguishable from the <hi>Devils,</hi> than as they had <hi>humane</hi> Bodies.</p>
            <p>And as it is no less Evident that our Lord was <hi>put to Death,</hi> than that he once <hi>lived,</hi> so 'tis as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that He Rose again, as that He Dyed and was laid in the Grave. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Those who bare <hi>witness</hi> to His Resurrection, were themselves at first most <hi>averse</hi> to the Belief of it. Notwithstanding His having plainly told them, that after He was put to DEATH, He would rise again, yet (as if they thought those Words were not to be taken in a <hi>Literal</hi> Sense) they had no Expectation of any such thing. And whereas the Two <hi>Maries</hi> and <hi>Salome</hi> went Early, on the Third Day, to His Sepulchre, their design was so far from being to be satisfied whether He were <hi>Risen</hi> or no, that it was to <hi>Embalm His Dead Body:</hi> Which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone was a Demonstration of their not imagining it should Rise again till the Last Day; the end of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105354:6"/>
being to preserve Bodies from Putrefaction. Nay, when they <hi>missed</hi> His Body in the Sepulchre, this did not at all incline them to think 'twas Risen, for they concluded upon it, that it was <hi>taken away. Mary Magdalen</hi> makes her Complaint to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>they had taken away the Lord out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, and she knew not where they had laid Him.</hi> And the other <hi>Mary</hi> stood weeping at their Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and made the same Complaint to the <hi>Angels,</hi> whom she took for <hi>Men;</hi> and immediately after to her <hi>Lord</hi> Himself, whom she supposed to be the Keeper of the Garden where the Sepulchre was, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly taxed Him with taking Him away. <hi>If thou hast born him hence,</hi> said she, <hi>tell me where thou hast laid him and I will take him away:</hi> Or I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide some <hi>other</hi> Burying Place for Him, if He mayn't lye <hi>here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when these Women had informed the rest of the Disciples, that the Body was not in the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre; and how that <hi>Two Men in shining Garments said unto them, why seek ye the Living among the Dead? He is not here but is Risen. Remember how He spake unto you, when He was in</hi> Galilee, <hi>saying, The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be Crucified, and the third day Rise again,</hi> they could by no means perswade them to give them Credit. <hi>Their Words,</hi> it is said, <hi>seemed to them as idle Tales, and they believed them not,</hi> Luk. 24. 11.</p>
            <p>And when their Lord <hi>Appeared</hi> to them, as He
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105354:6"/>
quickly after did, they took him for some <hi>Spectre,</hi> and were <hi>Frighted</hi> at the sight of Him; so far were they from being hereby convinced that He was Rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Life. And when He <hi>spake</hi> to them, and told them that it was <hi>He Himself,</hi> and moreover, <hi>shewed them His Hands and Feet,</hi> or the <hi>Wounds</hi> in them, we read that <hi>they believed not for Joy and Wondered;</hi> they thought 'twas infinitely too good News to be true. So that He was fain to <hi>Call for Meat, and did eat before them,</hi> for their full satisfaction that what they saw, was not a Phantastical but His Real Body.</p>
            <p>And after all this, <hi>Thomas,</hi> being then absent, when he was told these things by the Eye-witnesses, would not believe them, but roundly Answered them, That <hi>except he not only saw in His hands the Prints of the Nails, but also put his Finger into them, and thrust his Hand into His Side, he would not believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, I say, the <hi>Witnesses</hi> of our Lords Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection were at <hi>first</hi> most averse to the Belief of it. They were so far from being <hi>Credulous,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were there more unreasonably <hi>incredulous</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They would not believe the Resurrection of their Lord, till invincible irresistible Evidence had compelled them to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> These Witnesses had not onely the <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,</hi> but all <hi>imaginable</hi> Evidence given them of His being Risen. As some of them were informed thereof by <hi>Two Angels,</hi> and as they all <hi>saw</hi> Him, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105354:7"/>
heard Him speak, and He shewed them His Pierced Hands, Feet and Side, so they farther <hi>Handled</hi> Him, they <hi>Ate and Drank with Him,</hi> they <hi>Conversed with Him;</hi> and that not once or twice, but, at times, for <hi>fourty days</hi> together. So that well might S. <hi>Luke</hi> say, That <hi>He shewed Himself alive after His Passion, to the Apostles, by many infallible Proofs,</hi> Acts 1. 3. And at last, after He had given them Commission to Preach and Baptise, and promised to be <hi>with them to the end of the World, they saw Him ascend towards Heaven, till a Cloud received Him out of their sight.</hi> And therefore S. <hi>John</hi> begins His first Epistle with these powerful Words: <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our Hands have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the Word of Life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you.</hi> And those Words of S. <hi>Peter</hi> do well deserve to follow <hi>these,</hi> tho' they chiefly relate to what he and two other Apostles saw <hi>before Christs Death,</hi> viz. <hi>We have not followed cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly devised Fables, when we made known unto you the Power and Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; but were Eye-witnesses of his Majesty. For He received from God the Father Honour and Glory, when there came such a Voice to Him from the excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. And this Voice which came from Heaven we heard, when we were with Him on the Holy Mount,</hi> 1 Ep. 1. 16, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nor was He onely seen by the Eleven Apostles,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105354:7"/>
and the forementioned good Women, but <hi>by above five hundred Brethren at once;</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> adding, That the <hi>greater part of them</hi> were at <hi>that</hi> time living. And after His <hi>Ascension,</hi> He was seen by <hi>this</hi> Apostle too in his Journey to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus;</hi> and that in so astonishing a Brightness, as both blinded his eyes, and struck him to the Ground. And He farther spake audibly these Words to him, <hi>Saul, Saul, Why persecutest thou Me? 'Tis in vain for thee to kick against the Pricks.</hi> And asking Him who He was, he received this Answer, <hi>I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</hi> So that <hi>He</hi> who was an outragious Persecutor of the Witnesses of our Lords Resurrection, was <hi>now</hi> compelled to be one of that Number, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as Couragious an Attestor of it, as any of those he before had persecuted.</p>
            <p>And many years after <hi>this,</hi> our Lord appeared to His beloved Disciple in the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Patmos,</hi> in the most Glorious Form. <hi>His Countenance being as the Sun, when it shineth in its strength.</hi> And so terrified was he with the sight, that he <hi>fell as dead a! his feet,</hi> Apocal. 1. 17. <hi>And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead; and He laid his Right Hand upon me saying unto me, Fear not, I am the First and the Last; I am He that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive forevermore: And have the Keyes of Hell and Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Lastly, His so abundantly performing His promise of <hi>Sending the Holy Ghost,</hi> was so great an
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105354:8"/>
Evidence of His Resurrection and Ascension too, as a greater was not possible to be given. He made this Promise not only before His <hi>death,</hi> but likewise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before his Ascension: Some of his last words to His Apostles being <hi>these,</hi> That <hi>they should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>but wait for the Promise of the Father which they had heard of Him.</hi> And they waited no longer than <hi>ten</hi> days, for the Accomplishment thereof. For on the <hi>tenth</hi> Day, <hi>there came a Sound from Heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and filled all the House where they were sitting. And there appeared Cloven Tongues like as of Fire, and they Sate upon Each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 2. beginning. And v. 43. We read, that <hi>many wonders and signs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that of <hi>Speaking all Languages</hi> for the Preaching of the Gospel throughout the World, <hi>were done by the Apostles.</hi> Nor did the Miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost <hi>quite</hi> cease, for at least the <hi>three</hi> first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or till Christianity became the Religion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; when it was protected by the Emperours Sword and Encouraged by their Laws. By which means the Church was under no necessity of the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Continuance of those Gifts.</p>
            <p>To our Lords Accomplishment of this Promise may be added the wonderful fulfilling of his Threats against the Jewish Nation for their Obstinate persist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Unbelief, and His prediction of the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105354:8"/>
of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> which came to pass within <hi>fourty Years</hi> after his death. And 'tis marvellous to see, what an Exact Agreement there is betwixt <hi>Josephus</hi> his History of the Miserys that then befel that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with divers Circumstances relating to them, and our Blessed Lords Predictions of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Apostles Witnessed most <hi>boldly</hi> their Lords Resurrection before His Crucifiers and most deadly Enemys; Nor could they be deterred from it by all their Threats, nor by the Executions of them neither: And therefore Chose to Suffer, not onely the greatest Shame and Ignominy, but all manner of Calamitys, and the Cruellest deaths, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than desist from Preaching this Doctrine. He who had been so great a Coward, as to deny Him in his very presence, and to be scared thereto by a silly Maid, had the Courage to Own him even in the midst of His Murtherers, after the Descent of the Holy Ghost. <hi>Ye men of</hi> Israel, said He, Acts 2. 22, &amp;c, <hi>hear these words, Jesus of Nazareth a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God among you by Miracles, Wonders and Signs, which God did by Him, in the midst of you, as you your selves also know. Him being delivered by the determinate Counsel and fore-knowledge of God, ye have taken and with wicked hands have Crucified and slain: Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the bands of death, because it was impossible He should be holden of it,</hi> &amp;c. And in the next Chapter, he and S. <hi>John</hi> having cured a Cripple before a great Confluence of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105354:9"/>
People, at one of the Gates of the Temple, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately declared to them, that <hi>this</hi> they had done by the Power of that Jesus whom they had Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. <hi>Ye men of</hi> Israel, said he, v. 12. <hi>why marvail ye at this? Or why look ye so earnestly on us, as tho' by our own Power or Holiness we had made this Man to walk? The God of</hi> Abraham, Isaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>hath glorified His Son Jesus, whom ye delivered up and denyed Him in the presence of Pilate, when He was determined to let Him go. But ye denyed the Holy one and the just, and desired a Murtherer to be granted unto you; and killed the Prince of life, whom God hath Raised from the dead, whereof we are Witnesses. And His name, through faith in His name, hath made this man strong,</hi> &amp;c. And we find that by the Sermon of which <hi>these</hi> words are part, there were Converted to the faith of Christ about <hi>five thousand</hi> Souls; and by the foregoing Sermon about <hi>three thousand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Captain of the Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Saducees</hi> being Enraged at this Boldness of theirs, with the Success thereof, laid hands on these two Apostles; and the next day being brought before the <hi>High-Priest,</hi> with the <hi>Rulers, Elders,</hi> and <hi>Scribes,</hi> and being asked by them, <hi>by what Power they had done this Miracle, S. Peter</hi> declared to <hi>them</hi> as he had done before to the <hi>People</hi> with the Self-same Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Ch. 4. 10. <hi>Be it known unto you all, and to all the People of</hi> Israel, <hi>that by the Name of Jesus of Nazareth, whom ye Crucified, whom God hath rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:105354:9"/>
               <hi>from the dead, Even by Him doth this man stand before you whole. This is the Stone which was set at nought by you Builders, which is become the Head of the Corner. Neither is there Salvation in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It would take up a long time to shew, with what Admirable Resolution these and the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and especially <hi>S. Paul,</hi> persisted to the death in Preaching the Resurrection of Jesus, with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christian Doctrines; and what Miserys they Underwent, because they would not be taken off from this Work. So that who is able to suspect such Witnesses as <hi>these,</hi> who is not as hardned an Infidel as the most Obdurate of our Lords Enemies?</p>
            <p>That they could not be deceived <hi>themselves,</hi> we have seen is as apparent as the Light, and (setting aside the Consideration of their most Exemplary Goodness) 'tis impossible that any Interest could prevail with them to deceive <hi>others:</hi> Except we should suppose them so unlike all other of their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Creatures, as to be in love with <hi>Ignominy, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are some who Object, that Our Lords Resurrection would have been more Unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, had he at least <hi>shewed Himself alive after His Passion</hi> to <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Chief Priest,</hi> and the great <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> that Condemned Him.</p>
            <p>In answer here to I will say these <hi>four</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:105354:10"/>
1. That this is most impudently to prescribe to the Great God. Was not He who is infinitely Wise the best judge, what Evidence was fittest to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this Case? And shall not <hi>He</hi> chuse His own Way and Method?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Those most perverse and Obstinate Infidels had rendred themselves utterly Unworthy of so great a Favour, who would not be Convinced by such an Abundance of most Miraculous Works, which <hi>Jesus</hi> had wrought before their Eyes; but still followed Him with the most horrible Calumnies, until they had put Him to the most horrible death. It seems <hi>Unworthy</hi> of Almighty God thus to neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate and extort by main force Belief from those, who had so maliciously shut their Eyes against the Clearest Light, and had in the most insolent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Rejected the Counsel of God against themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In that those who were chosen to be Witnesses of Christ's Resurrection, were indued with such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, and did such Mighty Works for the Confirmation of the truth thereof, there was every whit as Effectual a Course taken, for the Conviction of all not utterly incurable, as if He had appeared to every one of them, and Suffered Himself to be Handled by them. And they might as reasonably have Questioned their own <hi>Senses,</hi> as the <hi>Truth</hi> of those who did so admirably Confirm their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Had He shewed Himself alive to His <hi>Enemys,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:105354:10"/>
they might have Objected that it was not <hi>He,</hi> but the <hi>Devil</hi> in His likeness, with as great an Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Reason, as they could before impute His <hi>Casting out Unclean Spirits,</hi> and His other most Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Works, to the power of <hi>Belzebub the Prince of the Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will make a very short <hi>Application</hi> of what hath been delivered on this <hi>former</hi> Part of the Text, and then proceed to the <hi>latter</hi> Part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We hence Learn the Strange Force and Power of <hi>Prejudice.</hi> A rooted Prejudice is so Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly, so Unruly a thing, that there is no <hi>dealing</hi> with it. The Rulers and Generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strongly prejudiced against our Saviour, chiefly upon the account of His being in diverse Respects, quite a different person from what, without ground, they expected their <hi>Messias</hi> should be: And because He declared that He came upon as different a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign from <hi>that</hi> which they vainly fancied, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised themselves, He <hi>would</hi> come upon, <hi>viz,</hi> Not to deliver them from the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, but from the Power of incomparably worse Enemys, <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan:</hi> Not to bless them with a great Affluence of Worldly Wealth, and a Mighty Dominion in the World, but to purchase Eternal Happiness for them in the Life to come, and to Qualify them for it: I say this great disappointment of their Carnal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, did make them Conclude it impossible that <hi>He</hi> of all men should be the <hi>Messias.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105354:11"/>
such Sensual Wretches as <hi>they</hi> were, could not bear the thoughts of <hi>His being</hi> so, His giving them the greatest Demonstrations imaginable that He <hi>was</hi> so, was <hi>labour in vain,</hi> they were all <hi>lost</hi> upon them.</p>
            <p>Not only the most <hi>Rational</hi> Evidence in the World, is Ordinarily compell'd to yield to the Power of Prejudice, but even <hi>Sensible</hi> and <hi>Ocular</hi> Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have Submitted to it. Our Blessed Saviour having had such sad Experience hereof among the <hi>Jews,</hi> it is said, not only that he <hi>Bewailed,</hi> but also that He <hi>Marvailed, at their Unbelief.</hi> And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Experience assures us, that the greatest strength of Argument signifies nothing to those, who come with Byassed and Prepossest minds to the hearing of Truth: Who judge of what is offered to them by their Wills, not by their Understandings. Nay, the clearer and more irresistible the Evidence is, the more are the Prejudiced incensed against the Proposer of it, if they have but <hi>Ill Will</hi> equal to their <hi>Prejudice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We learn from what hath been discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That we ought exceedingly to admire, and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be affected with the Divine Goodness, in that there is given us such Wonderful Evidence of the Truth of the Gospel. <hi>This</hi> none can call in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who believe <hi>Christs Resurrection</hi> (as I <hi>need</hi> not though I had <hi>time,</hi> stand to shew) and it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what hath been said, that God hath done much <hi>more</hi> than barely <hi>enough,</hi> to remove from us
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105354:11"/>
all Uncertainty concerning <hi>this</hi> great Point. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt but that the <hi>quarter Part</hi> of the Evidence for it he hath vouchsafed us, would be sufficient to prevail on the Minds of all such, as can perswade themselves to be impartially considerative. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how utterly inexcusable must those, who are made acquainted with the <hi>Whole</hi> of it, needs be, if they continue not withstanding Unbelievers! And by <hi>Unbelievers</hi> we are to understand, not only those who <hi>disbelieve</hi> the Gospel, but such also as yield so <hi>weak and feeble</hi> an Assent there to, as not to govern their lives by it. For we had every jot as good give no Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit <hi>at all</hi> to our Lords Doctrine, as refuse to live in Obedience to it.</p>
            <p>We now come to discourse a while on <hi>our own fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Resurrection,</hi> expressed in the <hi>following</hi> Words of the Text, <hi>And will also raise up us by His own Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</hi> And <hi>two</hi> things are herein implyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That God will not suffer our <hi>Souls,</hi> when our Bodies dye, to go out of Being.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That our dead Bodies shall be raised to Life again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That God will not suffer our <hi>Souls,</hi> when our Bodies dye, to go out of Being; or to dye with them. For as much as to <hi>Sense,</hi> the <hi>Man</hi> seems to dye, and not his meer <hi>Body,</hi> (and therefore we always
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105354:12"/>
say such a <hi>Man</hi> is dead, not such a ones <hi>Body)</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation of the Soul, which alone is truly the Man, to the Exercise of its Faculties, after the Stound of Death is over, is in several places of Scripture exprest by the Word <hi>Resurrection.</hi> Our Saviour proves the <hi>Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> Mark 12. 26. from Gods say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to His Servant <hi>Moses, I am the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</hi> But this saying did imply <hi>necessarily</hi> no more than <hi>this,</hi> that they were not gone out of Being, but that their Souls were still alive, tho' their Bodies were dead, and crumbled to dust. And so much is intimated in the <hi>next</hi> Words: <hi>He is not the God of the Dead, but the God of the Living.</hi> And 'tis plain, that the Word Resurrection is taken in the same sense, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 8. where we read, That the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces say there is no Resurrection, neither Angel nor Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but the Pharisees confess both.</hi> And (to name but <hi>one</hi> Place more, as we might do divers) it is so to be understood too, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 32. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, <hi>If after the manner of men, I have fought with Beasts at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?</hi> Would onely the Resurrection of S. <hi>Pauls Body</hi> have made him an amends for all his Sufferings? Would not his <hi>Souls</hi> Enjoyment of his dear <hi>Jesus</hi> to all Eternity, have been an abundant Recompence, though he never had seen his Body more? Yes undoubtedly; and therefore by these Words, <hi>If the dead rise not,</hi> he meant, <hi>If there be no Life after this.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:105354:12"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By <hi>He will also raise up us by His own Power,</hi> is especially to be understood, <hi>He will raise up our dead Bodies as He did our Saviours.</hi> Our Souls and they shall be <hi>re-united</hi> by the Divine Power.</p>
            <p>There is no Doctrine more clearly or fully reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than is <hi>this</hi> of the <hi>Resurrection of the Body.</hi> We have a very Particular Account thereof.</p>
            <p>We are informed, <hi>who</hi> shall rise again. Not some <hi>few,</hi> or so <hi>many,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> without Exception. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> saith that, That, <hi>The Hour is coming, in the which, All that are in the Graves shall hear His Voice, and shall come forth.</hi> John 5. 28. And S. <hi>Paul,</hi> That <hi>there shall be a Resurrection both of the just and of the unjust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are told in what <hi>Order</hi> they shall rise, The <hi>dead in Christ,</hi> or True Christians, <hi>shall rise first.</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
            <p>We are told by <hi>whom</hi> they shall be <hi>immediately</hi> raised, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> or by the Power of <hi>God the Father</hi> given to Him. By which Power He is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so again and again said to have raised <hi>Himself.</hi> We now heard that it is <hi>His</hi> Voice that shall raise us: And He saith, <hi>John</hi> 6. 40. <hi>This is the Will of Him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have eternal Life, and I will raise him up at the Last Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we see we are informed too, of the <hi>Time when</hi> the Dead shall be raised, <hi>viz.</hi> at the <hi>Last Day;</hi> And <hi>in the end of the World;</hi> as our Lord saith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 39.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:105354:13"/>
We are told for what <hi>End</hi> Christ will raise the dead, <hi>viz. That they who have done good, may come forth to the Resurrection of Life, and they that have done evil, to the Resurrection of Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> We read also, what <hi>Kind</hi> of Bodies the <hi>Rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones</hi> shall be: 1 Cor. 15. 35, &amp;c. <hi>But some man will say, how are the dead raised up, and with what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy do they come?</hi> Or, how can it be that Dead Bodies being Putrified and Rotten should be made to Revive, and what <hi>Kind</hi> of Bodies may we suppose they will be? It follows, <hi>Thou Fool that which thou sowest is not quickned except it dye.</hi> Or, is any thing more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, than things rising to life from Putrifaction? Don't we see that the <hi>Rotting</hi> of the Corn is so far from making it impossible that it should Spring up again, that 'tis <hi>necessary</hi> thereto? <hi>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that Body that shall be, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, bare</hi> meer <hi>Grain, it may Chance of Wheat or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grain.</hi> Or, thou sowest not the Grain with the <hi>Ear</hi> or <hi>Blade,</hi> but it comes up again with <hi>both. But God giveth it a Body as it pleaseth Him, and to every Seed its own Body.</hi> A Body of the same <hi>Kind, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> and Form.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All Flesh is not the same Flesh,</hi> &amp;c. There are various Sorts of <hi>Flesh,</hi> as there are of <hi>Grain.</hi> And there is great variety of other Bodies, as it follows, <hi>There are Bodies Coelestial and Bodies Terrestial, but the Glory of the Coelestial is one, and the Glory of the Terresti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:105354:13"/>
               <hi>is another,</hi> &amp;c. And our Bodies, when <hi>raised,</hi> shall be of a different <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> from what they were when laid in the Grave; as we see v. 42. <hi>They are sown in Corruption, they are raised in Incorruption: They are sown in Dishonour they are raised in Glory; they are sown in weakness they are raised in Power: They are sown Natural Bodies,</hi> or <hi>Animal</hi> ones, which need to be sustained and nourished with meat and drink, <hi>they are raised Spiritual Bodies,</hi> or such as need <hi>neither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I given you the substance of what we find in Scripture upon this Argument; and if we can be satisfied with the <hi>Scriptural</hi> Account of the <hi>Resurrection of the Body</hi> (and he is a Wanton Wit that cannot) it will not appear to be so Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictious or impossible a thing, as many have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make it; or <hi>at all</hi> Contradictious, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to the infinite Power of God. We find in the Holy Scriptures that the Bodies <hi>Raised</hi> are in <hi>some</hi> sense the same with the Bodies <hi>buried,</hi> and in <hi>some</hi> sense <hi>not</hi> the same: And we find their Sameness il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated, by the Sameness of the Corn <hi>Sprung up,</hi> with the Corn <hi>Sown.</hi> And those who affect not to be wiser than the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this matter, are not at all Concerned to trouble themselves with the Cavils which have been often raised, against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Body; they all supposing such a Sameness, as is no where to be found in the sacred writings; nay the <hi>Contrary</hi> to which the Apostle, in the fore-cited words, hath at least intimated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:105354:14"/>
And the Argument taken from our Bodies being such Fluid things as we know they are, do nothing hinder, but that the Dead may rise with as much the <hi>same</hi> Bodies with those that were Buried, as the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried are the <hi>Same</hi> with those they were <hi>Born</hi> with, or that they had but a few years before they dyed.</p>
            <p>But, in short, we shall doubtless Rise with as much <hi>the Same</hi> Bodies, as it can be our <hi>Interest</hi> to desire we should; and he who believes <hi>this,</hi> needs not fear in the least, that he believes too little relating to this great Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection of the dead.</hi> And tho' he may not have so <hi>large</hi> a Faith as some others, yet if it hath its due Influence upon his Practice, he hath every whit as <hi>good</hi> a one to all Intents and Purposes.</p>
            <p>Now as to our <hi>Evidence</hi> for the truth of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, we have the greatest that can be, since our Lord did so plainly Reveal it before His death, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the truth of all His Doctrines by His Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Or, which is the same thing, demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hereby that He was no Imposter, in having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Himself to be <hi>Sent of God, and the Son of God.</hi> We are therefore altogether as certain of our <hi>own</hi> fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Resurrection, as we can be of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> And from what hath been said we may be assured, that we can be certain of no matter of fact, which we have not beheld with our own Eyes, if we are not sure of <hi>this.</hi> But the Apostle doth not stick to say, that <hi>if there be no Resurrection of the dead, then is not Christ risen,</hi>

And he both <hi>repeateth</hi> this and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth</hi> upon it, v. 15, 16. <hi>Yea,</hi> saith he, <hi>and we are found false Witnesses of God, because we have testified of God, that He raised up Christ, whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ risen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And farther, Christ in rising again is declared by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to be the <hi>Representative</hi> of all true Christians. He saith, <hi>Now is Christ risen from the dead, and is become the First Fruits of them that Slept.</hi> Now the <hi>First Fruits</hi> under the Law did represent the whole Harvest; and their being offered to God brought a Blessing on all the Other Fruits; and <hi>by the offering of them</hi> (as he also saith) <hi>the rest were sanctified;</hi> or Consecrated to God. And so is the whole Church both in Soul and Body by Christs Resurrection. And I add, by His presenting Himself to His Father in Heaven, upon that very day, on which the First Fruits were offered according to the Law. And so, <hi>His</hi> Resurrection to Glory, was a proof and pledge of all His <hi>sincere Disciples</hi> rising to Glory also. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Apostle tells the <hi>Ephesians</hi> that, as <hi>they who were dead in Sins were quickned together with Christ,</hi> or raised from the death of Sin to the life of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, so likewise <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>raised them up together, and made them sit together, in Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus.</hi> That is, in Christ their Head their dead Bodies are <hi>already</hi> raised, and with their Souls may be said to be <hi>at present</hi> Glorified in <hi>Him:</hi> in Him, I say, considered as their Head or Representative.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:105354:15"/>
And <hi>thus</hi> we see there is a necessary Connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Propositions in our Text: <hi>God hath raised up the Lord,</hi> and <hi>He will raise up us by his own Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, to make <hi>Application</hi> of what hath been said on <hi>this</hi> Part of the Text;</p>
            <p>In the <hi>First</hi> place, Is it so certain that <hi>God will raise up us by His own Power,</hi> even <hi>as</hi> certain as that He hath raised up <hi>Christ,</hi> then are we not all of us infinitely concerned, to make it our greatest Business, while we remain in these Bodies, which is our state of Probation and Tryal, to be found in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those, <hi>who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that World</hi> (to use our SAVIOURS own Words) <hi>and the Resurrection from the Dead, and to stand before the Son of Man?</hi> That is, to attain a <hi>Glorious Resurrection,</hi> and to stand with <hi>Courage and Confidence</hi> before the Son of Man. And how should we <hi>Watch and Pray always,</hi> that we may escape those dreadful things which shall come upon the wicked. S. <hi>Paul</hi> having said, That <hi>he had hope towards God, that there shall be a Resurrection both of the just, and of the unjust,</hi> immediately adds, <hi>And herein do I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise my self to have always a Conscience void of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, both towards God and towards men.</hi> And no man can be perswaded of <hi>this,</hi> and withal consider it, but it must of necessity have <hi>this</hi> effect upon him. Especially since, though the <hi>Resurrection of the Body</hi> may still be at a great distance, yet the <hi>other Life</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:105354:15"/>
is at the door, and near at hand, as to each of us: The Doctrine of the <hi>Soul-sleepers</hi> being plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed both by our blessed Saviour, and the now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned great Apostle. And <hi>indeed</hi> that Doctrine is no better <hi>Philosophy</hi> than <hi>Divinity,</hi> it speaking great Ignorance of the Nature of <hi>Souls.</hi> Nor have I ever met with a Philosopher, who believed a Future Life (as they all did, or were inclined to do, except the profest, or the sly Atheists) but took it for granted, that humane Souls are so far from being deprived of all <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Consciousness of Being,</hi> that they gain much the <hi>freer</hi> use of their Faculties, by their leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>these</hi> Bodies: They looking upon them as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and dark Dungeons to Souls, in which they are miserably straitned and pent up. And they were so far from thinking, that Bodies do give Life and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to Souls, that they held the quite contrary. And not onely that the Life and Activity of Bodies is wholly from their Souls, but also that Souls can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be so truly said to <hi>live,</hi> as when they are <hi>let loose</hi> from these Bodies. And the <hi>Book of Wisdom</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents us with the same Doctrine, <hi>Ch.</hi> 9. 15. Where 'tis said, That <hi>the Corruptible Body presseth down the Soul, and the earthy Tabernacle weigheth down the mind, that museth upon many things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in saying, that we are all upon the Borders of the other World, I say we are very near to great Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness or great Misery. Good Souls in the separate State being very Happy, by their having got rid of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105354:16"/>
that <hi>Body of Death,</hi> with which they were <hi>here</hi> so clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and by the free Exercise of Love to God, and to one another, and of all the Divine Virtues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obtained; in which their Bodies, to their great grief, miserably interrupted them. As also they must needs feel great Happiness, from comfortable Reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions on the good they <hi>did,</hi> or <hi>endeavoured</hi> to do, in these Bodies; and the joyful Foresight of that <hi>Crown of Righteousness,</hi> which their <hi>Righteous Judge</hi> hath declared He will confer upon them, <hi>at the day of his appearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And wicked Souls must necessarily be as mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this separate State, by reason of as bad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they shall be confined to; and the evil Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and corrupt Habits they carry out of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with them; which are mightily disquieting in <hi>this</hi> Life; and must much <hi>more</hi> be so in the <hi>other,</hi> through the want of those Satisfactions of inordinate Appetites this World abounds with. And their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition must needs be extreamly sad too, through the Lashes of their Guilty Consciences, and their <hi>certain looking for of Vengeance, and fiery Indignation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then what inexpressible Folly is it, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in us <hi>Christians,</hi> who profess to believe the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Body, and the Life everlasting,</hi> so to dote upon these vile Bodies, and this vain World, as generally we do! As if our inward thought were, that there shall be <hi>no</hi> Resurrection, that there is <hi>no</hi> Life to come. This is great Folly even in those who
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105354:16"/>
are utter Strangers to the <hi>Christian</hi> and all <hi>Revealed</hi> Religion; but that they who are acquainted with the Doctrine of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> with <hi>His</hi> description of the Future State both of the Good and Bad, and with the abundant, the superabundant Evidence He hath given us of the Truth thereof, with all His <hi>other</hi> Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that <hi>they</hi> I say should be so Unconcerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>these</hi> things, is most amazing. This is such Madness as no Tongue can give it its due Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Let me address my self to those who remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Guilt hereof, in the Words of the Prophet, <hi>Remember this, and shew your selves Men; bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to mind O ye Transgressors.</hi> Let it appear that you are a sort of Creatures superiour to the Brutes, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer only affected with present things, and those which can signifie nothing to you one <hi>moment</hi> longer, than while you continue in <hi>these</hi> Bodies. Let this appear by your so laying to heart what you have now been minded of, relating to the Doctrine of the Resurrection, as in all your Actions and inward Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to be powerfully influenced thereby, for the time to come. But to be more particular,</p>
            <p>In the Second Place, Let me commend to you those Words of our blessed Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 9. (a <hi>Text</hi> which I formerly discoursed on to you upon this same Occasion) <hi>viz. I say unto you, make to your selves Friends of the Mammon of Unrighteousness, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> The Argument I have now been upon contains, one would think, an irresistible Motive to abound, during our stay in these Bodies, in Works of Piety, Mercy and Charity, according to the Ability God hath given us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:105354:17"/>
This is evident from too many Texts of Scripture to be now recited, in which the Happiness of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life is intitled to the sincere Performance of such Works as <hi>these.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord doth <hi>particularly</hi> assign no other Reason, for the pronouncing of that most joyful Sentence to the <hi>Sheep</hi> on His Right Hand, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the Foundation of the World,</hi> but <hi>this, I was an hungred, and ye gave me Meat, I was thirsty and ye gave me drink,</hi> &amp;c. Or my <hi>Brethren</hi> were so, and you Reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, as He explains Himself in the Words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nor doth He express any <hi>other</hi> Reason, for the fearful Sentence which shall be pronounced against the <hi>Goates</hi> on His Left Hand, <hi>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> but their Averseness to Works of Mercy and Charity. Tho' there will be <hi>many</hi> other Reasons for each of these Sentences, yet <hi>these</hi> onely are <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly</hi> mentioned, to shew what a mighty Weight shall be laid upon them, at the day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>And He declares, <hi>Matth. 5. 7.</hi> That <hi>Blessed are the Merciful, for they shall obtain Mercy.</hi> And <hi>Luk. 6. 35.</hi> That <hi>The Reward of such shall be great, and they shall be the Children of the Highest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He likewise calls the imploying of Riches in the fore-mentioned good Works, <hi>laying up a Treasure in Heaven,</hi> in Opposition to <hi>Hoarding them up,</hi> which He calls <hi>laying up Treasures upon Earth,</hi> Mat. 6. 20, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And He commands His Disciples, as poor as they were, to <hi>sell what they have and give Alms,</hi> Luk. 12. 33. And farther expresseth this Injunction of <hi>Giving Alms</hi> by such Words as these, <hi>Provide your selves Bags which wax not old, a Treasure in the Heavens which faileth</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:105354:17"/>
               <hi>not; where no Thief approacheth, neither Rust corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>being Rich in good Works, laying up in store for our selves a good Foundation against the time to come, that we may lay hold on Eternal Life.</hi> And <hi>that</hi> is the Motive with which he backs the Charge, which he requires his Son <hi>Timothy</hi> to lay upon Rich Men, 1 <hi>Ep. 6.</hi> 17. <hi>Charge them who are Rich in this World, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain Riches, but in the Living God: Who giveth us all things richly to enjoy. That they do good, that they be rich in good Works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And S. <hi>James,</hi> having divided <hi>Pure Religion</hi> into <hi>Two Parts,</hi> makes <hi>visiting the Fatherless and Widows in their Affliction,</hi> or being bountiful and compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the <hi>whole former</hi> Part, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. 27. And he puts this Question, <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>What doth it profit, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if a Man say he hath Faith and hath not Works? Can Faith save him?</hi> That is, it can <hi>not</hi> profit a man to <hi>say</hi> he hath <hi>Faith,</hi> when <hi>he hath not Works;</hi> no nor to <hi>have</hi> Faith neither without Works, such a Faith <hi>cannot save him.</hi> And the next Words tell us <hi>what</hi> Works he means, without which Faith cannot save, <hi>If a Brother or Sister be Naked and Destitute of daily Food,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And S. <hi>John</hi> hath pronounced <hi>him</hi> a false Hypocrite in pretending to be a Lover of God, who makes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Conscience of these good Works: For saith he, <hi>Whoso hath this Worlds Goods, and seeth his Brother hath need, and shutteth up his Bowels of Compassion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God in him?</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi>

            <p>So that we see, there is nothing more indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Necessary to our Resurrection to a Blessed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, than is our being indued with such a Love
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105354:18"/>
of God and Goodness, as powerfully inclineth us, and makes us forward, to works of Mercy and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>There is no duty more Earnestly Pressed, nor the Recommending of which is inforced with more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, nor <hi>so many</hi> neither (as may be shewed out of the <hi>Old</hi> as well as <hi>New</hi> Testament) than is <hi>this</hi> of <hi>being Charitable,</hi> and <hi>doing good</hi> with this Worlds Goods, in proportion to the Share of them wherewith God has blest us.</p>
            <p>I might shew also, how greatly this Grace of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is perfective of our Nature, how it dignifieth and Beautifieth our Souls, and so is not only a necessary Condition of, but likewise as necessary a Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for, that Blessedness which Consists in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that God, who is Goodness and Charity it self, alwaies showering down Bounty and Mercy on the whole Creation.</p>
            <p>I might Shew too, that nothing is so Amiable as this Vertue in the Opinion of the World, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing procures such Love and Esteem, and how it Perfumes mens Memories, like Precious Oyntment, when they are dead and gone: Of which I need not tell you there are Innumerable Examples.</p>
            <p>And it is impossible to Recount, how many of <hi>these, This Renowned</hi> City may make her Boast of, whose greatest Renown is Owing to the great Numbers of most Exemplarily Charitable Christians, <hi>who will be had in Everlasting Remembrance,</hi> which from Age to Age She hath produced.</p>
            <p>And, thanks be to the Divine Grace, <hi>This City,</hi> with the <hi>Sub-Urbs,</hi> is Blest at <hi>present</hi> (as lamentably degenerate as the Age is grown) with <hi>not a few,</hi> whose works both of Piety and Charity <hi>do praise them in the Gates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:105354:18"/>
I am sure our persecuted and distressed Brethren of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well as Multitudes of Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Families in Our <hi>Out-Parishes,</hi> have great cause to Praise God for them; and to Remember <hi>them</hi> and <hi>theirs</hi> in their dayly Prayers. For Abundance of them, notwithstanding the Publick Collections, and their Majesties Exceeding great Bounty, must have Perished, had it not been for the private Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of these good Christians.</p>
            <p>And by the way, I must needs put in a <hi>word</hi> here, for our <hi>French</hi> Brethren, whose Extreme sufferings you know are for the Best of Causes. I Certainly inform you, that their Condition is so deplorable at <hi>this</hi> time, by the means of the <hi>Ceasing</hi> of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Charity, that between <hi>three</hi> and <hi>four thousand</hi> of them (and among these, many <hi>Ministers</hi> and Persons of Quality) must <hi>Starve,</hi> or Beg about our Streets, if Extraordinary and Speedy Care be not taken of them.</p>
            <p>There is a Noble project newly set on foot, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain worthy and Excellent Persons, for their dayly Relief; and I promise my self that all <hi>those</hi> will glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to their Power, close with it, who are Sincere Lovers of our Blessed Lord, whose Suffering Members <hi>they</hi> are, and of His Religion, for which they are <hi>next</hi> to Martyrs.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, There is <hi>One Sort</hi> of Charity which <hi>This City</hi> is deservedly very Famous for, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Occasion requires my particular Taking Notice of; namely, That of improving, and from time to time Supplying, Ancient Hospitals. And most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Instances of this Nature, are presented to you in this Paper.</p>

               <hi>A True Report,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WE see by these <hi>Reports,</hi> Which have for a long time been Published Every <hi>Easter,</hi> what a Vast Treasure of Charity hath been Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited in Each of these Hospitals; and Especially in that of <hi>Christ's Church.</hi> As also how very faithfully and prudently it hath still been Employed, by the <hi>Respective</hi> Governours.</p>
            <p>We have a yearly Account of great Numbers of poor <hi>Orphans,</hi> Extraordinarily well Maintained and as well Educated, both in Learning and Piety, and afterwards put forth to good Callings, and the best Qualified sent to the <hi>Universities,</hi> by that most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hospital of <hi>Christ Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have the like Account of Abundance of <hi>Sick, Lame</hi> and <hi>Wounded</hi> People, Restored to their Health and the use of their Limbs, in the Hospitals of S. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholmew</hi> and <hi>S. Thomas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of Many poor <hi>Lunaticks,</hi> whose Case is the most Compassionable of all Mortals, Restored to their <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings</hi> in the Hospital of <hi>Bethlem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of many <hi>idle and Vicious People</hi> taken out of Harms way, and kept to Work, and indigent Vagrants taken in and Relieved, in order to their being returned to their Proper Homes; as also <hi>poor Youths</hi> well brought up and Bound to Honest Trades, by the Hospital of <hi>Bride-well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All <hi>these,</hi> I need not say, are great Works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and works, most of them, of the <hi>greatest</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; being so no less to the <hi>Souls</hi> than to the Bodies, of Helpless Wretches.

            <p>But to come to a Conclusion, The only thing that can make more than a meer <hi>Competency,</hi> for our selves and Families, in the least desirable, is the Advantage that's gotten by <hi>Riches,</hi> of having the great Pleasure in <hi>this</hi> World, of being Benefactors, and of Encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our Happiness in the World <hi>to come.</hi> And 'tis a Wonderful thing, that so few mens Observation and Experience should convince them, that nothing besides these two things can make <hi>any</hi> amends, for the innumerable Troubles and Vexations that attend Riches. And that Spending them in the Gratifying of Fleshly Lusts, or on Pride and Vanity, will make them far more Unhappy Even in <hi>this</hi> life, than they can be made by the <hi>Want</hi> of them. But 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that those should not be perswaded, to Employ themselves in doing good, Suitably to the Talents they are intrusted with, who do so firmly believe, as to bestow Every day a few Serious Thoughts on, Such Texts <hi>as this, God hath both Raised up the Lord, and will also Raise up Us by His own Power.</hi>
