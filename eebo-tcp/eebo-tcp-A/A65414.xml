            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
ANSWER
To the LATE
K. JAMES's
Last Declaration.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T seems we are yearly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a New <hi>Declaration</hi> of the
Late King's, and ev'ry one of
them is to be of a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Strain from another. In
that published the last Year, K.
<hi>Iames</hi> was pleas'd to pull off the Mask, and
give us his own genuine Intentions what he
had a mind to do with us, when once he
came to be our Master. Then he was firmly
resolved <hi>to remount the Throne by force of Arms,
and to sap its new foundation with</hi> English <hi>Blood.</hi>
This Kingdom was adjudged a <hi>Hecatomb</hi> to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60534:3"/>
his Revenge; And indeed the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was by a fair consequence excepted out of
his Indemnity, and nothing but Axes and Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets
were to Attone for the Wrongs we had
done him; but now it's thought fit the Mask
should once more be put on, and the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Last Year be hush'd up in the Serene
Temper of This. Here he <hi>desires rather to be
beholding to his Subjects Love to him, than to any
other expedient whatever, for his Restauration:</hi>
But the last year he was to use no gentler me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to regain us, <hi>than a</hi> French <hi>Army sent him
by his dearest Brother the</hi> French <hi>King,</hi> that is in
plain <hi>English, He was to render us Slaves in the
Right of Conquest.</hi> A wonderful change in
Stile! And <hi>the first Essay in Politicks of a New Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
at St.</hi> Germains.</p>
            <p>But Good God! What a low Opinion must
the Contrivers of this Declaration entertain
of the whole Nation of <hi>England,</hi> if they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
in good earnest such a gross Sham could
take with them! When these Kingdoms have
so severely felt <hi>the overthrow of their Laws, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Liberties, brought upon them in spight of
the most solemn Promises, and the Sanction of an
Oath to the contrary;</hi> when an unexpected Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
had broke the Yoke from off our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60534:3"/>
Necks, and <hi>secured to us all those valuable things
we were upon the point of losing for ever, by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our King, without changing the Line or the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;</hi>
to imagine that after all this, they can
be wheedled in to trust the same Prince once
more with their <hi>All,</hi> meerly because forsooth
He, or some in his Name, emits a kind of
faint Promise to do otherwise than we know
to our Fatal Experience he did before, is at
the same time to suppose this Island to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by a Herd of Brutes, and not Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thinking Creatures.</p>
            <p>I challenge all the Late King's <hi>Declaration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,</hi>
and even the suppos'd Contriver of
this last, for whose Parts I have a just Esteem,
to give me but one single instance from Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
<hi>That ever a free People, who from a just
and recent sence of an Invasion made by a limited
Monarch upon their Laws and Fundamental Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
had thereupon withdrawn their Allegiance
from him, and confer'd it upon another, did ever
afterwards willingly and tamely submit to His
Government again.</hi> No, there is not one
instance of this kind in all the Records of
time: For tho' scarce one Age has past with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some remarkable Revolution in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and States, yet a thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60534:4"/>
was never yet heard of since the World
was.</p>
            <p>This appears one of the most universally
received Principles of Humane Society, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to trust the Promises of one that has broke with
us before;</hi> especially if those former were
back'd with the Religious Sanction of an Oath.
To break through this Principle in <hi>some trivial
matter,</hi> may be perhaps pardonable in a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,
or some good-natur'd man that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
thereby no more than what he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to lose.</p>
            <p>But to submit <hi>the dearest and most sacred
things that Men can possess on Earth, the Liberties,
Laws, and Fundamental Constitutions of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
all that either he, or his Children after him,
can call, or wish their own:</hi> To submit all these,
I say, to a few feeble Promises of one <hi>that has
broke to us much more solemn ones before,</hi> were a
madness that never a Nation under Heaven
was yet guilty of. As it is the easiest thing in
the world to promise largely, when a man
finds it his interest so to do; So it is ordinarily
the last Refuge weak minds have their recourse
to, when all other means of compulsion or
persuasion fail. But at the same time, he
that threatens highly, when he thinks he has
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60534:4"/>
power in his hands to make his Threats good,
and comes thereafter to cajole with soft Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of good Treatment, when that Power
is gone; one must divest himself of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sence, if he believe that that man's mind
is really chang'd to the better, and does not
ascribe the change of his manner of treating
with us, to the change of his Fortune.</p>
            <p>To bring this close to King <hi>Iames's</hi> Case;
Last year all things were in a readiness in
<hi>France</hi> for a formidable Descent upon us, and
indeed it was within an ace of taking effect.
We were ev'ry minute in hazard of seeing a
<hi>French</hi> Army land upon our Coasts, and King
<hi>Iames</hi> with them. Matters were so ripened
for them in the Neighbouring Kingdom, that
an Insurrection was to break out <hi>there,</hi> as soon
as they set foot ashore <hi>here.</hi> In a word, The
great Design of carrying a War into the Bowels
of this island by the Power of <hi>France,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with our Malcontents at home, was
well enough laid, and wanted but little of
Execution. Then was a time for a Generous
Prince to tell the People of <hi>England, He desir'd
rather to be beholden to his Subjects Love, than to any
other expedient whatsoever for his Restauration.</hi> This
had look'd plausible indeed, and one would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60534:5"/>
have been tempted almost to believe he was
in earnest. But alas! the Late King thought
there was no obligation upon him <hi>then</hi> to hide
or dissemble his Intentions. Buoy'd up with
the hopes of an Infallible Success, he spoke
his mind plain out, and in his <hi>Declaration</hi> at
that time emitted, (to which I refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for brevity sake) he talk'd in a loftier
strain from St. <hi>Germains,</hi> and <hi>his Camp in</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,
than ever yet he had done at the top
of his Glory at <hi>White-hall.</hi> Full with the
mighty things he was to do at the head of a
<hi>French</hi> Army, he was pleas'd not <hi>to treat with
us,</hi> but <hi>to treat us as Slaves he had a mind to
conquer with his Sword:</hi> Nor could we have
expected higher Language if we had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
lying groveling at a Conqueror's Feet.</p>
            <p>But, God be thanked, the Scene is much
alter'd with respect to King <hi>Iames</hi> since
last Year. All the Designs of the <hi>French</hi>
Court for this Year, are levell'd else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and we know of no Preparations
for invading <hi>England</hi> this Summer. <hi>Scotland</hi>
has not only put it self into a posture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
but the whole face of Affairs there are
wonderfully changed by this Session of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the better, and the Late King's Party
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60534:5"/>
sufficiently humbled. It's from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this change of Affairs in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> the Late King has been induc'd to
change his Stile: And to this alone, instead
of the Threats of the former, we are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for this last Whining Declaration.</p>
            <p>But to come to the Declaration it self,
to let the World see how little we fear its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
capable to influence any body of common
sense to their Party; we shall give the express
words of it Paragraph by Paragraph, with
some short Reflections on ev'ry one of
them.</p>

                        <p>Strange! Might not one have reasonably

and his Peoples Miseries?</hi> And is he yet
to learn what all <hi>Europe</hi> is long since sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
persuaded of? If he has, We have not yet
forgot, <hi>the breach of reiterated Promises, and a
Coronation Oath, the setting up a Dispensing Power
above, and contrary to Law; the bringing over an
Army of</hi> Irish <hi>Papists amongst us; the employing
those, and almost only those that by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were incapable; the turning men out of their
Freeholds for not obeying Commands directly contrary

made, and methods us'd, for overturning the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
establish'd by Law, and bringing in another by

All these were not <hi>the Calumnies of

to a wilful and formed Design of bringing all

sent he that Loyal Parliament a packing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
upon the back of this Address; And
told them plainly, he would do the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what they advised him? Was this to be
<hi>most willing</hi> to give the <hi>fullest satisfaction</hi> to his
People? When he would needs invade the
uncontroverted Rights of <hi>Magdalen Colledge,</hi>
there was not wanting some, even then, to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60534:7"/>
advise him of the danger and Illegality of that
Design. How <hi>willing</hi> he was to hear any
Terms of Moderation in that Affair, all the
World knows; And the thrusting out the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and Fellows of that House, merely because
they would not comply with an illegal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
is not yet quite lost in the memory of
man. The sending the Bishops to the <hi>Tower</hi>
was another convincing Evidence of <hi>his being
always most willing</hi> to give <hi>the clearest prospect</hi> of
<hi>the greatest Security</hi> to all Ranks and Degrees
of People. And to add one Instance more
to a great many others that might be nam'd,
His refusal afterwards to call a Parliament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Address of the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, in his greatest Exigence, and
when his own Affairs most requir'd it, did
scarce bespeak him a Prince <hi>most willing</hi> to give
his People Satisfaction. So that if one had
been to advise the Contrivers of this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which way to make the whole look more
ridiculous, it had been to put in this Period,
That he <hi>still is most willing</hi> to satisfy all Ranks
and Degrees of People, in the same sense <hi>he has
always been so,</hi> which we are very inclinable to
believe: And so in that point we are agreed.</p>

And because we desire rather to be beholding to our<note place="margin">Declarat.</note>
Subjects Love to us, than to any other expedient what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
for our Restoration; We have thought fit to
let them know before-hand our Royal and sincere In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;
and that whenever our Peoples United De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and our Circumstances give us the opportunity
to come and assert our Right, We will come with the
Declaration that follows.</p>

            <p>The Writer has stumbled here upon two
unlucky Expressions, <hi>Our Sincere Intentions,</hi> and
<hi>our Peoples United Desires.</hi> When he fell upon
the first, it seems he had in his thoughts how
naturally the people of <hi>England</hi> would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to doubt the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of those Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
he makes them in the late King's name;
and even the very moment the Words were
dropping from his Pen, he himself was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how little credit they would obtain. By
this he can scarcely be judg'd a fit <hi>Amanuensis</hi>
for a King. It is infinitely below the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and Honour of a Monarch to use the word
<hi>sincere</hi> in speaking of his <hi>Intentions.</hi> Among
Gentlemen <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> interlarding their Discourse
with such an expression, <hi>As what I say is true,</hi> is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60534:8"/>
not fashionable; for the very saying so, dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
from that just sense every virtuous man
has of his own Honour and Veracity, which
puts him beyond the suspicion of telling an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.
But for a Minister to tell the people in
his Prince's Name, That his Master's Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards them are <hi>Sincere,</hi> is yet more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
by how much more the Word of a
Prince ought to be more Sacred, and less liable
to be suspected than that of private men.</p>
            <p>The other Expression, <hi>The united Desires of his
People,</hi> is as unluckily chose. If the late King
come not to assert his Right till his People's
<hi>United Desires</hi> give him an opportunity, we are
in no great danger of seeing him in <hi>England,</hi>
or of making a trial how far he has a mind to
keep his Word. <hi>United Desires</hi> is a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
Word; and it must be some Ages
hence that such a thing can happen: For it
will be hard enough for the Teeth of one Age
at least, to eat out the Remembrance of the
late Reign; and while that is not forgot, there
is no great probability of the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's
Uniting</hi> in their Desires to bring back
King <hi>Iames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that we have hitherto given of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi>
being it seems intended only for a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60534:8"/>
Preface to another within the Belly of it; the
other follows thus:</p>

                        <p>WHEN We reflect upon the Calamities of<note place="margin">Declarat.</note>
our Kingdoms, We are not willing to leave
any thing unattempted whereby We may reconcile our
Subjects to their Duty; And tho' we cannot enter into
all the particulars of Grace and Goodness, which We
shall be willing to grant; yet we do hereby assure all
our Loving Subjects, that they may depend upon every
thing that their own Representatives shall offer, to
make our Kingdoms happy. For We have set it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Eyes, as our Noblest Aim, to do yet more for
their Constitution, than the most Renowned of our
Ancestors; And, as our chiefest Interest, to leave no
umbrage for Iealousy, in relation to Religion, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Property.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> has all the reason in the world
to reflect upon the Calamities of these
Kingdoms, since He was so very careful
to bring them upon us. The Calamities
we groan'd under in his Reign, have been
hinted at before. Where to lay the causes of
the Calamities of this Reign (which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
is principally, if not only here meant),
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60534:9"/>
is worthy of our Enquiry; and we need not
go far to find them out. It must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that War in it self deserves well the
name of a Calamity, and a great one too. But
this we are at present engaged in, is a War of
Necessity, and to save us from Calamities
vastly greater than it self. It's a War for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of our Countrey, our Religion, our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and all that can be dear to us in the
world; all which must stand or fall by the
Success of it. If the exorbitant Greatness
and Power of <hi>France</hi> should happen to prove
fatal to us in the upshot, (which Heaven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid!)
We know whom to thank for it: And
all <hi>Europe,</hi> even those of the late King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
lay both it and all the direful effects of
it, with heaviest Execrations, at his door.
It's a truth as conspicuous as a Ray of the
Sun, That the two great Designs which took
up the thoughts of a certain Prince both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after his Accession to the Throne,
were, <hi>How to make</hi> France <hi>formidable abroad,
and these Three Nations Slaves at home.</hi> It's on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in these two Noble Designs, he can yet be
call'd a <hi>Successful Prince;</hi> and for the first, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of a Sanctuary in <hi>France,</hi> he deserves
well the best Province of that Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60534:9"/>
He tells us, <hi>He is not willing to leave anything
unattempted whereby he may reconcile his Subjects to
their Duty.</hi> So we find neither foul nor fair
means have been neglected, that's certain.
Sometimes we have been tryed with Threats,
and now there's another tryal how far Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
may work upon us. Sometimes the Late
King has a mind to reconcile us to our Duty
by an Army of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish;</hi> even those
generous Gentlemen that have Signaliz'd
themselves in their own Country for their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
kindness to those of our Religion: And
sometimes when the other fails, he designs
<hi>to be beholding only to his peoples Love for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation,</hi>
and to come over, it seems, with only
a few <hi>that shall be thought necessary to attend his
Person.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But we are fairly told, We have been, and
are still out of our Duty; otherwise there
were no need of <hi>Reconciling us to it.</hi> That is
in plain <hi>English,</hi> We are in his sense a pack of
Villains and Traytors, <hi>That would not timely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our Religion, Laws and Liberties to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
at his caprice, nor yield up our selves Slaves
at discretion: But quite contrary, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
with, or accepted of our Deliverance, when
Heaven was pleased to bring it home to our door.</hi> By
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60534:10"/>
this we may clearly judge of the Late King's
Opinion of us, and be better able to make a
shrewd conjecture of the <hi>sincerity</hi> of his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi>
towards us. In this word <hi>of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
us to our Duty,</hi> is still <hi>the old Passive-Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
Principle</hi> trump'd up upon us, which was
once within an ace of ruining us all. And
King <hi>Iames</hi> being still of Opinion, that we
fail'd in our Duty when we left that Principle;
It was not only altogether needless for him
to make all those Promises, but we are Knaves
if we receive him not again without them;
since according to that Doctrine we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to submit to him to day, though we
were sure he would sell us all for Slaves to
morrow.</p>
                        <p>We are told, <hi>We may depend upon every thing
that our Representatives shall offer to make us happy.</hi>
How willing the Late King was to Grant what
our Representatives did offer to him for
<hi>our necessary security only,</hi> I have mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
He kick'd them out of doors merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they presum'd humbly to Advise him
to Govern according to Law; that is, <hi>To
Employ only those the Law capacitated for Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
With what sort of <hi>Representatives</hi> he
aim'd afterwards during the whole course of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60534:10"/>
his Reign, to fill St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Chappel, <hi>The
Regulations of Corporations, the Closettings of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
the Questions put to almost every man in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>that had a Voice in Elections;</hi> and all the
rest of the means us'd to get a pack'd
House of Commons, were too publick wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
So that indeed King <hi>Iames</hi> may safely
enough promise to grant what our Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
shall offer, if he means such Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
<hi>as those he was once minded to palm upon the
Nation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But he tells us, <hi>He has set before his eyes as his
noblest aim, to do yet more for our Constitution than
the most Renown'd of his Ancestors.</hi> This is not
the first time we have been told so: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
these words appear to come of course.
For in a <hi>Speech</hi> he made to the Parliament in
<hi>May</hi> 1685. he thought fit to tell them, <hi>That
he pleas'd himself with the hopes, that by God's
Blessing, and their Assiistance, he might carry the
Reputation of this Nation higher in the world, than
ever it had been in the time of any of his Ancestors.</hi>
The truth is, it was a severe proof enough of
our Faith, even then, to believe the days of
King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> should come to eclipse
those of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> or <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> and
it will be yet much more so now. Every
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60534:11"/>
body was at that time upon the enquiry, How
his Late Majesty's hopes were then grounded,
and what were the wonderful steps by which
he expected to arrive at so high a pitch of
Glory. We have been sufficiently enabled
since to unriddle the Mystery: For instead of
Conquests abroad, which has render'd the
Reigns of some of his Ancestors so illustrious
to Posterity; he had hopes to perpetuate the
Memory of his, by much more remarkable,
and in his opinion, much more glorious
Conquests at home, <hi>even those he had a mind to
obtain over our Laws, Religion, and Liberties.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this design was he altogether inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable;
since upon his Principles, to subdue
the Northern Heresy, carry'd more of true
Glory along with it, than the Conquest of
any one side of the Globe. If then he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily
fail'd at that time to surpass the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
of his Ancestors by making the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
I have hinted at, it's not to be doubted
but he will push the harder for it the next
time we give him an opportunity of doing it.</p>
                        <p>And to encourage all our Loving Subjects,<note place="margin">Declarat.</note> of what
degree or quality soever, to set their Hearts and
Hands to the perfecting of so good a Work, and to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60534:11"/>
unite themselves in this only means of Establishing the
future Peace and Prosperity of these Kingdoms, We
have thought fit to publish and declare; That, on our
part, We are ready and willing wholly to lay aside
all thoughts of Animosity or Resentment for what is
past; desiring nothing more, than that it should be
buried in perpetual Oblivion.</p>
                        <p>They must indeed be his <hi>Loving Subjects</hi>
that set their hearts and hands to the perfecting
the work of the Late King's Restoration;
for none that have a true love for their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
will venture upon it. If this work of
Restoring him to the Throne, be <hi>the only means
of establishing the peace and happiness of these
Kingdoms;</hi> Then Popery and Slavery must be
quite other things than we took them to be.
We fondly imagin'd our Lives and Estates
could not be better bestow'd than in warding
off from our selves, our Country and Posterity,
those two. But now our late Declaration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
have found out the secret; for instead
of being such affrightful things as we believ'd,
they are the only means to establish our peace
and happiness; and indeed they, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
of King <hi>Iames</hi> are reciprocal, and must
of necessity go hand in hand together.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60534:12"/>
                           <hi>He is ready and willing to lay aside all Resentments
for what is past, desiring nothing more than that it
should be buried in perpetual oblivion.</hi> It's hop'd
we may without offence believe him <hi>to be
willing to lay aside all Resentments,</hi> in the same
sense as we believe him <hi>to have been always most
willing to condescend to such things as might give
fullest satisfaction to his people;</hi> and the rather,
that in believing this last, we arrive at the
highest pitch of Faith, even <hi>that of belieivng
against sense.</hi> But does he really desire that
all that's past should be buried in oblivion?
Certainly he has all the reason in the world so
to do; and they deserve to be branded for
fools that doubt his Sincerity in that point.
But though the Late King should, yet its
hop'd the people of <hi>England</hi> are not yet willing
to bury in oblivion what's past. The sense
of the hazards they were in, was too great
to be so soon forgot: And yet we are heartily
content they should be no otherwise remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
than as the Shipwrack'd Mariner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the impression of the Shelve on which
he once was in danger to split; that is, in
order to shun it for the time to come.</p>

                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60534:12"/>
And do therefore by this our Declaration,<note place="margin">Declarat.</note> under

oppose Us and those we shall think necessary to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
our own Person in this just attempt to recover our
Right; or (in such a number of days after our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as we shall hereafter express) shall not resist
those who in any parts of our Dominions shall accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Duty assert and maintain the Iustice of
our Cause: Beseeching God to incline the Hearts of
our People, that all effusion of Blood may be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Righteousness and Mercy take place. And
for that end, We further promise to all such as shall
come to, and assist us, That We will reward them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their respective Degrees and Merits.</p>
                        <p>Here is a touch of that mighty Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity
we are to be blest with, upon the late
King's Restoration. An Indemnity which it's
hop'd we shall never stand in need of, and yet
one express'd in such words, as would stand
us in no stead, tho we should come to plead
it. He pardons all but such as <hi>shall oppose him
by Sea or Land.</hi> A comprehensive Exception,
and fully as wide as that Universal one men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60534:13"/>
in his Declaration last year. The word
<hi>Oppose,</hi> may receive a thousand different Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
at the Bar; and God have mercy
on us, if ever it come to that! For the late
King was always careful enough to pick out
Judges sufficiently inclin'd to put what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
on Words or Things best plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their Master. However it be, we know
above One hundred thousand people excepted
by this Clause at one blow, all our Army by
Land, and all our Fleet at Sea: They will
certainly fall under the word <hi>Oppose,</hi> tho they
should never strike a stroke in the Quarrel;
the receiving a Commission to Oppose Him,
among the rest of Their Majesties Enemies,
will admit of no favourable sense in the case.
How far all the rest of the Nation may fall
under the Exception, it's only to stretch the
meaning of the words a little, and they are
all in the same Category with those that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in Arms against him; for there is an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of him <hi>in the Parliament-House, in the
Pulpit, in one's Chamber,</hi> and in a thousand other
ways which a clear witted <hi>bene placito</hi> Judge
can easily find out.</p>
                        <p>As to his Promise of <hi>Rewarding those that shall
come in to him,</hi> he has been always very careful
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60534:13"/>
that no body repent their good Service to him.
Witness the Parliament that had stuck so close
to him in the affair of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Insurrection,
whom he turn'd out of doors when the Danger
was over; and the Prelates of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> who had adher'd to his Interest in
the matter of the Bill of Exclusion, upon
whom afterwards he rubb'd all the Affronts
were in his power; and, in fine, witness a
great many Protestants that had serv'd him ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
against <hi>Monmouth,</hi> in keeping the
Crown on his Head, whom he afterwards
turn'd out of their Employments, to make
way for his Rascally beloved <hi>Irish.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We do further declare,<note place="margin">Declarat.</note> That we will, with all
speed, call together the Representative Body of our
Kingdom; And therein will inform our selves what
are the united Interests and Inclinations of our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and with their concurrence will be ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
all their Grievances, and give all those Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of which they shall stand in need.</p>
                        <p>What sort of <hi>Representatives</hi> the late King
aim'd at, when he sat on the Throne, we have
hinted at before: They were only such as
would break in upon our Laws and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60534:14"/>
to favour those that were design'd to be
our <hi>Executioners,</hi> at least the <hi>Instruments of our
Slavery.</hi> A Principle to have such and only
such Representatives, was so rooted in the
breast of that Prince, that even when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
danger came afterwards to threaten him,
he could not bring himself to the Temper of
calling any other, tho most of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal begg'd him earnestly
so to do, as the only means to settle the then
troubled state of his Affairs. The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that then environ'd him, forc'd from him
indeed a faint kind of Compliance with their
desire at first; he made a show of Issuing
out Writs for calling a Free Parliament; but
so strong was his Inclination to have none but
such a pack'd House of Commons, as might
serve the Great Turn he had so long aim'd at,
that before half the Writs were sealed,
all the Scheme was altered in a moment,
and things went on in the old channel again.
Here was a demonstration with a witness,
how far the late King was inclin'd to <hi>call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Representative Body of the Kingdom:</hi> And
he that could not be brought to it at <hi>so pinching
a juncture</hi> as that was, can never in reason be
thought a hearty Friend to <hi>Free Parliaments.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60534:14"/>
Upon calling this <hi>Representative Body,</hi> he
will <hi>inform himself what are the United Interests and
Inclinations of his people.</hi> Sure he cannot be yet
to learn what those are; and he has had too
many and too remarkable occasions not to be
ignorant of them. He could not but be so
much acquainted with the Interests and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of the People of <hi>England,</hi> as to see a
rooted Principle of Liberty in opposition to
Slavery, predominant in every <hi>English</hi> breast;
and yet all that did not hinder him from a
form'd Design of overturning the very funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Constitution that rendred that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of theirs warrantable. He could not but
know that the Inclinations of the Generality
of the People of <hi>England</hi> were averse to the
Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that their Interests
were quite opposite to that Hierarchy: Yet
this did not dissuade him from making more
steps in four years time towards the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
this Nation (as the then Court-Phrase
was) to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than was made
in <hi>France</hi> it self from the Death of <hi>Henry 4th.</hi>
till about three years before the <hi>Edict of Nants</hi>
was revok'd for good and all.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>with the Concurrence of this Representative-Body
he will be ready to redress all Grievances, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60534:15"/>
give all those Securities of which we shall stand in
need.</hi> There was a time when scarce one single
step was made in the Government, but what
deserv'd well the name of a <hi>Grievance;</hi> and
how well these <hi>Grievances</hi> were redress'd, is
worthy of our Enquiry: The late King was
not warm in the Throne when he ventur'd
fairly to give us a taste of what he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to do: <hi>He order'd a part of the Revenue
that expired with his Brother's Death, to be levied for
his own use;</hi> and that by virtue of his own
Edict, without an Act of Parliament. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after this, he would needs <hi>send a solemn Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy
to</hi> Rome, <hi>to lay his Crown and Kingdoms at
the Pope's Feet:</hi> A Compliment few Kings
ever made, lest it should be taken in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.
The Slights his Ambassador met with
there, were not able to mortify his Zeal in the
least degree: As he had sent a Splendid Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy
to the Pope, so he could not rest till he
obtained the <hi>Glory of seeing a Nuncio sent hither,
whom he not only caressed himself, but made it a
Crime even in the greatest Peers of the Kingdom,
to refuse to attend at his Publick Entry, a Minister
whose Character was in it self High-Treason by the
Law of</hi> England. After the Storm rais'd by
<hi>Monmouth</hi> was over, he plainly tells the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60534:15"/>
then sitting, <hi>That he will employ</hi> Roman-<hi>Catholicks
in his Army;</hi> that was as much in plain
<hi>English,</hi> as if he had said, <hi>Gentlemen, I judge it
fit to tell you, I think not my self obliged to govern
any longer according to Law, now that by your kind
Assistance I am rid of a Competitor in the Throne.</hi>
After this we were not to expect any fair
Weather; all that followed was Thunder and
Lightning: <hi>The Penal Laws and Test must be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off;</hi> and the Dissenters cajol'd to consent to
what at last was to ruin them as well as the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> Till a <hi>packt Parliament</hi>
could be got to do this Job, <hi>a Dispensing Power
was set up, that upon the matter was to supply the
place of an Act of Parliament.</hi> This devouring
Monster, altogether unknown to our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
was not only to swallow up all Laws
that stood in the late King's way towards the
<hi>Grand Design,</hi> but was to have the Force of a
Law in it self as strong as any ever made by
<hi>King, Lords, and Commons.</hi> It was this <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,
All devouring Power,</hi> claim'd by King
<hi>Iames,</hi> that produc'd afterwards the <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Commission; the Suspension of the first Bishop of</hi>
England; <hi>the dashing in pieces the Ancient Rights
of</hi> Magdalen <hi>College; the Imprisonment of the
Bishops in the Tower;</hi> and a great many other
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60534:16"/>
things too long to be mention'd here. All
these were Grievances of a deep dye, and
yet neither Prayers nor Tears, Submissions
nor remonstrances could prevail with him to
mitigate the weight of any of these blows.
They were heavy Grievances, and he knew
and was told every day they were so; And
how ready he was to redress them, the whole
course of that Reign testifies.</p>
                        <p>In the same sence <hi>he is willing to redress our
grievances,</hi> he may perhaps be <hi>willing to give us
those securities we stand in need off.</hi> Thanks to
his love for what we do not want. We
know no better, nor more natural securities
than our Laws are; they are the only sence,
next to Providence, we trust in; and while
they are not violated, we are safe. But had
not we those Securities before; and did not
the Late King break through them? Could
any Law in the world be exprest in more
positive terms than that of the Test? And
yet this well-twisted rope, like that of <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s
of old, <hi>prov'd but a thred of towe, when the
fury of King</hi> James<hi>'s Zeal came to touch it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We likewise declare, upon our Royal Word,<note place="margin">Declarat.</note> that
We will protect and defend the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                           <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60534:16"/>
as it is now established by Law; And secure to the
Members of it, all the Churches, Universities, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and Schools, together with their Immunities,
Rights, and Priviledges.</p>
                        <p>This is not the first time the Late King has
promis'd all this, and done quite otherwise.
King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> was scarce yet cold clay,
when in the speech he made to his New
Councel, He told them, <hi>He would make it his
endeavours to preserve the Government both in Church
and State as it was then established by Law:</hi> And
afterwards adds, <hi>That he shall always defend and
support the Church of</hi> England <hi>and the Members of
it.</hi> I cannot see how larger promises could
have been made: And this last is but a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of the former. Yet how well they were
kept, we have number'd up instances enough
already. Thanks to Heaven, and to the
Laws already made, the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and the Members of it, are much better secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
than King <hi>Iames</hi>'s <hi>Royal word</hi> can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
do it, though he had never given us
ground to call the truth of it in question.
Having so strong Barriers already, we were
errant fools to trust our safety to so weak props
that have fail'd us so often before.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60534:17"/>
We also declare,<note place="margin">Declarat.</note> We will with all earnestness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to that Parliament such an impartial Liberty
of Conscience, as they shall think necessary for the
Happiness of these Nations.</p>
                        <p>We have not altogether forgot what kind
of <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> the Late King always
aim'd at; a Liberty fatal to, and inconsistent
with the safety of the Protestant Religion, and
infallibly destructive to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
A Liberty that was to end in the exalting the
<hi>Romish</hi> Religion to a pitch in <hi>England</hi> that was
not even the interest of wise <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholicks
themselves to wish. But why recommend to
a Parliament Liberty of Conscience? Might
not <hi>the Dispensing Power</hi> supply all defects as it
did before: And if the Late King has an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>question'd
right to emit <hi>a Declaration for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conscience</hi> when and how he pleaseth,
which was Treason in effect to Controvert
some years ago; then it's altogether a piece of
folly to trouble a Parliament with it. This
one Engine was like <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword, has none
like to it, and it would indeed be a disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to use any other when that is so ready at
hand on all occasions. But alas! the word
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60534:17"/>
                           <hi>Impartial Liberty</hi> has unluckily slip'd in in the
Declaration. How came any body to dream
that an <hi>Impartial Liberty</hi> of Conscience would
ever please the Protestants of <hi>England?</hi> An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Liberty, is <hi>a Liberty of equal extent to
all:</hi> And does King <hi>Iames</hi> think the people of
<hi>England</hi> would be willing there should be a
Liberty of Conscience granted to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholicks, equal to what the Laws have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
secured in favour of the Protestants? In
this sence all the Bishopricks and Livings of
<hi>England</hi> must be divided <hi>Impartially</hi> into equal
parts; we must have one <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholick
Archbishop, and the other a Protestant, and
thus it must be with the rest of the Dignities
and Livings of the Church. The truth is, when
King <hi>Iames</hi> comes back, we shall be heartily
content with this division, and think we well
escape too, if he takes no more than one
half: But who shall be security to us we shall
lose no more?</p>
                        <p>We further declare,<note place="margin">Declarat.</note> We will not dispense with, or
violate the Test. And, as for the dispensing power
in other matters, we leave it to be explained and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by that Parliament.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60534:18"/>
A very Gracious Promise, and a mighty
Condescention <hi>He will not dispense with the
Test,</hi> as he did before, tho still he has a Right
so to do if he pleases; for we were often told
in the last Reign, That this Dispensing Power
was <hi>one of the brightest Iewels of the Crown;</hi> and
in a Royal Declaration for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to the Neighbouring Kingdom, he
told them plainly he dispensed with all Laws
to the contrary, <hi>by virtue of that Absolute Power
every body was obliged to obey without reserve.</hi> So
that here is indeed no more than a simple Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
not to make use of that Power to dispense
with the Test, which he has an undoubted
Right to still; whereas the Law and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>England</hi> say, there is no such Power
lodg'd any where; and nothing but an Act of
Parliament can suspend or make void an Act
of Parliament in this case: But pray how does
this Promise, <hi>Not to violate the Test,</hi> agree with
the Notion the late King always express'd he
had of it? He was pleas'd in his <hi>Closettings</hi> of
Gentlemen, constantly to inculcate into them,
<hi>the unjustness of the Test in it self, how contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
it was to that Christian Charity which ought to be
among his Subjects; how contrary to the very Law of
Nature it self, that any body should be incapacitated
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60534:18"/>
to serve their Countrey upon the account of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
These were the Common Places the late King
had constant recourse to, in all his Arguments for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
off the Test: And in a great many Papers pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
at that time by Publick Authority, the same
frightful Ideas were again and again represented. If this
Test then be such an unjust thing in it self, if it be so
contradictory to the Rules of Charity and the Law of
Nature, how comes it about now, that he is resolv'd
not to violate that, which according to his Principles
he is indeed obliged to abolish? But Promises cost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
especially when the Performance is never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                        <p>We declare also,<note place="margin">Declarat.</note> That we will give our Royal Assent to
all such Bills as are necessary to secure the frequent calling
and holding of Parliaments; The free Elections, and
fair Returns of Members; And provide for impartial
Trials: And that we will ratifie and confirm all such Laws
made under the present Vsurpation, as shall be tendred to
us by that Parliament.</p>
                        <p>Here is a very comprehensive Paragraph, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
well to be taken into consideration by pieces.
<hi>He will give his Royal Assent to all such Bills as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to secure the frequent Calling and Sitting of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</hi>
We all know the reason of putting in this
Clause at this time: But instead of frequent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
if King <hi>Iames</hi> were once again upon the
Throne, we would rather there were none at all;
Since nothing can be of more dangerous consequence
to <hi>England,</hi> than the sitting of such kind of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as that which King <hi>Iames</hi> always aim'd at.
Doubtless we should then have a <hi>Representative Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
(to give it in his own Words) that would render
all Representations of the People in Parliament for the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60534:19"/>
time to come utterly needless. We might expect to
see our Liberties and Laws given up to the Will of a
Prince all at once, and all the struggles between the
Prerogative and Rights of the Subject put an end to
at one blow, in the entire resigning up all Pretences
to these last for ever. So far then would the calling of
Parliaments be a terror to us, that ev'ry Session of
them would be but so many new Links added to our
Chain, till all remaining impressions of our former Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
were intirely swallowed up in an irrecoverable
Slavery.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Freedom of Election,</hi> and <hi>fair Returns of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
are two things diametrically opposite to the late
King's former Measures: And he does, or at least may
know the Temper of this Nation better, than to hope
to succeed in his Designs by the means of a Parliament
<hi>freely constituted of true Englishmen.</hi> Slavery is a Pill
will never go down with them; And it's only to
a pack't House of Commons that those of King
<hi>Iames</hi>'s Religion can ever owe their long experienced
Triumphs. That he will provide for <hi>Impartial Trials,</hi>
we do not at all doubt, if he mean <hi>Trials without favour
or prospect of mercy;</hi> for of those, the last Reign was but
one continued Instance; and indeed no body can blame
the late King for not executing Justice to the full.</p>
                        <p>But this is not all; There are yet greater Blessings in
store for us; <hi>He will Ratify and Confirm all such Laws
made under the present Vsurpation, as shall be tender'd
him by that Parliament.</hi> Good God! where have we
been all this time with our distinction of <hi>a King de
Facto,</hi> that some People have coin'd to save both their
Credit and Estates! Our Law says expresly, <hi>That
whatever is done by a King in Possession, is sufficiently
valid.</hi> But here the late King at one dash (and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60534:19"/>
without thinking on what he had promis'd us a
few lines before) does plainly insinuate, that he is
resolv'd to stand to what has been Enacted by a King
in Possession, not <hi>because it's Law, but out of meer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
to his new Parliament.</hi> So we have here a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Law since the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> torn up by
the Roots, and one of the most necessary provisions
for the Publick Safety unhing'd: And if this be not
all over the Dispensing Power, or rather worse, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to every body of common Sense. However, if
if it be any mitigation of sorrow to have Companions
in it, we shall have the pleasure to see <hi>our de Facto
Gentlemen</hi> come in for their share of a Publick Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
in which their nice distinction will stand them
in no stead, as probably some of them vainly hop'd.</p>
                        <p>And in that Parliament We will also consent to every
thing they shall think necessary,<note place="margin">Declarat.</note> to re-establish the late Act
of Settlement of <hi>Ireland</hi> made in the Reign of our Dearest
Brother; And will advise with them, how to recompence
such of that Nation as have followed us to the last, and
who may suffer by the said Re-establishment, according to
the degree of their Sufferings thereby; Yet so as that the
said Act of Settlement may always remain Intire.</p>
                        <p>And, if Chimny-money, or any other part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of the Crown, has been burthen some to our Subjects,
We shall be ready to exchange it for any other Assesment
that shall be thought more easie.</p>
                        <p>There was certainly a great measure of confidence
requir'd to mention the first part of this period with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Blush. <hi>The Abolishing the Act of Settlement in
Ireland</hi> was the Late King's Master-piece. In <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
he made only <hi>one step after another</hi> in order to
overthrow our Legal Constitution: But in <hi>Ireland</hi> he
was pleas'd, and that in a Parliamentary way at one
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60534:20"/>
blow to overturn the <hi>Great Charter</hi> by which the
Protestants of that Island enjoy'd their Estates. The
true reason of this difference in his treating them and
us, was because <hi>here</hi> he had not yet been able to get
a Parliament according to his mind; but <hi>there</hi> he
found just such a one as he wish'd for. They went
thorough-stitch without the least hesitation, and
struck home at the Root of the <hi>English</hi> Liberty, in
making void the <hi>Act of Settlement,</hi> which was the
only Pillar it lean'd upon. But now <hi>he will consent to
the re-establishing that Act of Settlement.</hi> Very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
the only best time for a man to shew his real
Inclinations is, when he is Master, and may do it
without controul. By what the Late King did in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> we may best judge what he inclines to do <hi>of
himself;</hi> for there he was Master of his own designs,
having few or none but those of his own Religion and
Principles about him, and consequently none to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him. If <hi>then</hi> it was that he shewed such an open
Hatred against the Protestants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as at one
dash to send some Hundred Thousands of them a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by making void the Fundamental Law to which
they ow'd their Bread, what are we justly to expect
from him in <hi>England</hi> if we by an unexampled piece
of Folly bring him back to be our Master here?</p>
                        <p>But tho he designs to re establish the Act of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Ireland, He will not permit his dear</hi> Irish <hi>to
suffer by it, no, they are to be recompenced according to
the degree of their sufferings.</hi> This period must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be a very reli<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Protestants of that Kingdom who have been ruin'd
by the <hi>Irish,</hi> and who cannot think of them without

the two last Rebellions. We are to have Golden
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60534:20"/>
Days, when those whose Hands are yet reeking in
Protestant Blood, are to be recompenc'd for shedding
it: Strange! We must be the most abject Slaves that

gross stupidity, that incouraged the Contrivers of this
Declaration to banter us at this rate? it had been time
enough to have told us this, when the wreath is about
our Necks, and we groaning under the weight of
our Chains; but beforehand, while we are yet free,
to entertain us with such a dismal prospect, is a piece
of Policy I believe very few are able to fathom.</p>
                        <p>He puts a mighty Obligation upon us in <hi>being ready
to exchange the Chimney money for any other Assesment
that shall be thought more easy.</hi> The truth is, this is
wisely enough propos'd, and upon a very reasonable
foresight. If ever the Late King return, Chimney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money
must certainly sink; no Protestant that can
flee, will be very desirous to stay in <hi>England,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
from that and a thousand other Calamities
wasting us, there must necessarily come to be a vast

                           <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60534:21"/>
We have a great many too too recent grounds to
know the late King's <hi>Royal Intentions</hi> towards us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
running to this Declaration to search for them. The
truth was, he could not in some sense be call'd a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Prince, as people are inclinable to call those
that hide their Designs from publick view. He was
open enough in all he aim'd at; and whether it was
from his Natural Temper, or that he thought himself
sure of Success, he was never at much pains to disguise
his Intentions, but instead of working under ground
our ruin, he push'd it on with a high hand, and like
<hi>Alexander the Great</hi> (tho upon a more ignoble occasion)
<hi>he scorn'd to steal upon us a Victory.</hi> But all this openness
was only when he was upon the Throne, at the Head
of a good Army; now the case is quite alter'd, and a
little disguising is thought proper in his present Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>
                        <p>We know of no <hi>Oppression and Slavery</hi> we lye under
at present. If our Taxes be thought heavy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they are not so, if we consider they are given
to ward off the greatest Miseries that can befal a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and we must be a base People indeed, <hi>if we
think our Religion and Liberty can be too dear bought.</hi>
Now, we pay a <hi>part,</hi> and we have a right to call the
<hi>rest</hi> our own; but if our Enemies had their Wills of
us, instead of a <hi>Part,</hi> they would make themselves
Masters of our <hi>All.</hi> Herein we make a Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that a great many of our Neighbours envy us
for, who would be heartity willing to part with the
Quota of their Estates we retain, provided they
might be suffer'd to enjoy the Proportion but of what
we pay.</p>
                        <p>And whereas our Enemies endeavour to assright our
Subjects,<note place="margin">Declarat.</note> with the apprehensions of great Sums which must
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60534:21"/>
he repaid to <hi>France;</hi> We positively assure them, That
our Dearest Brother, the Most <hi>Christian King,</hi> expects
no other Compensation for what he has done for us, than
meerly the Glory of having Succor'd an Injur'd Prince.</p>
                        <p>To tell us at this time of day of <hi>the Generosity of his
dearest Brother, the Most Christian King,</hi> is news in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
All <hi>Europe,</hi> and his own Subjects, are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
sensible how well that Name becomes him.
Tho he had mortally hated the late King, he did no
more but what his own proper Interest obliged him
to, in protecting him: And never had a Prince a
larger prospect of Advantage, than the <hi>French</hi> King
has at present from King <hi>Iames;</hi> since it's by his
means he intends, if possible to make these three
Kingdoms slaves to <hi>France.</hi> But how comes the Late
King to make us so large Promises for his dearest Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Is it because he supposes no body will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
with to believe the <hi>French</hi> King upon his own
word; and if so, he is much in the right on't: Or
is it, that he expects we will rely more upon his word,
when he promises for another, than for himself: If
so, he is mistaken, for we believe 'em both alike. The
King of <hi>Spain</hi> has more reason on many Accounts to
call the <hi>French</hi> King his dearest Brother, being indeed
so, in more senses than one; And yet he has found
to his sad experience, that no Oath nor Treaty could
tie him up from Pretentions less plausible then those
he has against <hi>England</hi> upon the Account of King
<hi>Iames.</hi> He renounc'd again and again by his solemn
Oath, and upon the Sacrament, all Pretences to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
in right of his Mother or Wife; and yet every
time he swore so, he broke it as soon as he was in a
Condition so to do. Shall King <hi>Iames</hi> or we expect
better Treatment from the <hi>French</hi> King, than the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> his Cousin-German, and Brother-in-law, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60534:22"/>
never wrong'd him, has met with? We to whom he
imputes his having been put to the Charges of a long
War, and King <hi>Iames</hi> who has been upon the matter
the Original Cause of it?</p>
                        <p>We only add,<note place="margin">Declarat.</note> That We come to vindicate our own Right,
and to establish the Liberties of our People. And may
GOD give us Success in the prosecution of the one, as We
sincerely intend the Confirmation of the other.</p>

            <p>The Contrivers of this Declaration have made pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
bold with the Late King, in palming upon him a
kind of Oath or Execration, that it's probable he
knows nothing of. Methinks they deserve but little
thanks that put thus upon their Master, what they
themselves believe he would not approve of; unless
they think, after the breach of a Coronation-Oath,
all other Promises may be broken of course; and so
they may coyn as many Oaths and Promises in his
Name as they please, if it serve their turn. Well!
for our part, we are once willing to say, <hi>Amen</hi> to the
late King's Prayers; and so perswaded are we of his real
Intentions towards <hi>England,</hi> That in his own words,
<hi>We wish him Success in the Prosecution of his pretended
Right, as he sincerely intends the Confirmation of our Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I fought with a Phantosm, appearing
in the likeness of a Declaration from K. <hi>Iames,</hi> but for
ought I know, <hi>A Paper contriv'd, writ, and printed here
without his direction, and perhaps his knowledg.</hi> I pretend
to no Honour in so inglorious a Cause; tho I must
acknowledge the decency that's due to a Prince whose
Name is affixt to it, has hinder'd me from treating
the Party that contriv'd it, so ill as they deserve.</p>
