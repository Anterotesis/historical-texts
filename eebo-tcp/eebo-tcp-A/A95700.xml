            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THINGS
JUST and NECESSARY,
WHICH THE
PARLIAMENT
Muſt do if ever they would Proſper.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, They muſt be humbled for, and repent of that woful Violation, and Contempt of that Solemn Covenant which they made
and ſwore, with hands lifted up to the moſt High God, and cauſed the People to enter into it; and yet have ſince commanded them
to enter into Engagements, in ſome Points clean contrary to this Covenant: And let them well conſider, whether it be not for this
very ſin that God hath ſhaken them out from their Houſe, and from their labour twice, according to that direful, but juſt impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
<hi>Nehemiah 5. 13. Alſo I ſhook my Lap, and ſaid, ſo God ſhake out every man from his Houſe, and from his labour, that
performeth not this promiſe, even thus be he ſhaken out, and emptied: And all the Congregation ſaid Amen, and praiſed the Lord,
and the people did according to this promiſe.</hi> Let them beware the third time, and let them never look to proſper as a Parliament, till this be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
bewailed, turned from, till the Covenant be reſumed, and more religiouſly obſerved: Let them never think to proſper, unleſs they
can cancel that Text, <hi>Ezek. 17. 15. Shall he proſper that doth theſe things? or ſhall he break his Covenant, and be delivered?</hi> Till this be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed
and reformed, they cannot do God right.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They muſt call in all thoſe Members that have by the Armies force violently been ſecluded, ſince the firſt ſecluſion of the eleven
Impeached Members; elſe they do not the Nation right, but apparently wrong and injure many Counties and Burroughs; and let them conſider,
whether their being now twice turned out by the Army, be not a juſt retaliation from God upon them for their conſenting to, or conniving at the
like violence offered to their Fellow-Members; according to that, <hi>Matth. 7. 2. For with what Judgement ye judge, ye ſhall be judged; and
with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi> And with what face or ſhadow of Juſtice can they condemn this violence againſt
themſelves, and yet abet it againſt their Fellow-Members. <hi>Rom. 2. 1. Therefore thou art inexcuſable O man, whoſoever thou art that judgeſt;
for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf; for thou that judgeſt, doſt the ſame things.</hi> Rom. 14. 22. <hi>Happy is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
not himſelf in that thing which he alloweth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, They muſt own Chriſt as King and ſole Law-giver in his Church, or elſe they cannot do Chriſt right; and conſider whether one
reaſon, why God hath ſuffered their ſervants, the General and his Officers to Rule over them, be not, becauſe they were unwilling to acknowledge
and ſubmit to the Rule and Government of Chriſt; and whether the Parliament ever proſpered ſince they refuſed to eſtabliſh Doctrine, Diſcipline,
and Government according to the Word.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They muſt paſs an Act of Indemnity, or elſe they cannot do the Army right, who have, as to the generality of them, followed
their Officers, as the people followed <hi>Abſalom, in the ſimplicity of their hearts:</hi> And yet they muſt exempt ſome of the Principal of the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both in the Army, and out of the Army from pardon, or elſe they will never do themſelves right, nor reſtore the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> to
their Priſtine and Native Terror, Majeſty, Glory; no, nor to their Due and Juſt Liberty.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They muſt ſo provide for liberty of tender conſciences, as withall to tender the ſafety of Religion, or elſe they cannot do Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
right; That Vote they had paſt in their Committee for Religion, when they laſt ſate, was ſuch, as all that love the true Proteſtant Religion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but abhor; and before they could paſs it in the Houſe, they were broken up, betrayed, deſerted, even by thoſe very men whom they ſought
to pleaſe in it. Let them conſider the remarkable juſtice of God againſt them therein; yet mercy to the Nation, in preventing ſo great a ruine to
Religion, as that Vote did portend; and mercy to themſelves too, if they repent, and turn from their wicked deſign.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, They muſt have their eye upon them that are faithful in the Land, by this time they have learned to diſcern of men: There are ſome
in the Land that profeſs very high to Religion, and ſtyle themſelves the Godly Party, that have very expanſive conſciences; that can take as many
Covenants, Engagements, as any change of powers ſhall put upon them, and break them all as faſt as they take them: Are ſuch men fit for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Council or Truſt? how can they be faithful to men, that are not faithful to God? There are beſides others in the Nation, fearing God, and
fearing the Oath of God, who have layen by for many years, and been caſt aſide as Veſſels of no pleaſure, only becauſe they dare not ſwim with the
Stream, or ſhift Sails with every wind, as the manner of too many is: Theſe, if they may be gained in, to ſerve the Publick, as ſometimes they did,
and would do again upon terms of Honour and Conſcience; might be a bleſſing to Parliament and Nation, and things might yet go well with
<hi>England.</hi>
