         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And further, whereas in these Theologicall discourses, published in the vulgar tongue, the profite of the vnlearned is cheifly intended, whereas the learned may helpe themselues with treatises in other languages, I thought it not needefull cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously to handle obscure and difficult questions, but in such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and plaine manner, as might best serue for the instruction of all.

               <p n="1">1. BEcause giuing of thanks is a kinde of praier, and in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thankes, praier also is included; as the Pharisie is saide to haue praied, when he gaue thankes, Luk. 18. shee is saide in giuing thankes also to haue praied. <hi>Genev.</hi> 2. And further as shee giueth thankes for Samuel her sonne, whome shee had receiued, so also shee further commendeth him by her praier to the blessing of God. <hi>Vat.</hi> 3. As also this song beeing propheticall concerning the Messiah, and the encrease of Gods people, and the destruction of their enemies, shee praieth also, that in good time the Lord would effect all his gratious promises toward his Church. <hi>Bor.</hi> 4. By Hannah, let women learne to lay aside all wanton and vnwomanly songs, and sing onely to the praise of God. <hi>Pellican.</hi> 5. <hi>R.

Now whereas the Apostle forbiddeth a woman to speake in the congregation, 1. Cor. 14. this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Hannah was extraordinarie, as likewise of Deborah, Iud. 5. as of the prophet Huldah in Iosias time: the Apostle meaneth, that ordinarily women should not speake in the Church:<note place="margin">Reconcil.</note> but extraordinarie prophesying is not forbidden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: as 1.

               <p n="1">1. Some expound thus; that whereas in trespasses com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted betweene men, the Magistrate may intercede, and take vp the matter: in sinnes committed against God, there is no mediatour, but onely Christ: <hi>Osiand.</hi> but this is not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as may appeare c. 3.14. where the Lord saith, that the sinne of Eli his house <hi>shall not be purged with sacrifice for euer:</hi> therefore the difficultie of forgiuenes of such sinnes is here shewed: for euen other sinnes also, are remitted by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Christ. 2. Wherefore here is a distinction of sinnes set downe, which are committed either against man, or against God: and of this sort is that sinne, which is called in the newe Testament, sinne or blasphemie against the holy Ghost. <hi>Bor.</hi> 3. For if any wilfully and malitiously doe sinne against God, contemning his word, there is no mediation or intercession left for him, how much more, if the Priest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who vseth to pray for others, shall with an high hand sinne against God. Of this sinne of obstinacie and malitious contempt speaketh Moses, that, he that doth any thing with an high hand, and blasphemeth the Lord, should be cut off from among his people: Numb. 15.30. that is, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Such are saide to prouoke the Lord to anger, Ier. 7.18. for such the Prophet is forbidden to pray, Ier. 11.14. and 14.11.<note place="margin">Of sinne against the holy Ghost.</note> And this is that sinne, which the Apostle calleth a <hi>treading vnder foote</hi> the sonne of God, and a despiting of the spirit of grace, Hebr. 10.26. <hi>Iun.</hi> for which the Apostle would not haue one to pray: 1.

the dishonour of God: 2. it must be committed by such as haue knowledge, and so sinne against their iudgement and conscience: 3. the manner must be respected: they sinne with an high hand, of malice, obstinacie, and contempt: in all these three were the sonnes of Eli found guiltie.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Some referre this to the absolute decree of God, whereby he had ordained the sonnes of Eli to destruction, which went before their rebellion and obstinacie; and they adde further, that as of saluation, so of condemnation, there are two causes: the first, which is the decree and will of God: the second, of the one faith, and the grace of God, of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, contempt and disobedience: and that herein no reason can be yeelded of Gods will, which is most iust: <hi>but he hath mercie on whome he will, and whome he will he hardneth. Bor.

Esech. 18.23. God out of his owne will electeth whome he will, and reiecteth the rest: and those so reiected, he ordaineth vnto condemnation, but iustly for their sinnes. 2. Wherefore the will of God is here rather referred to Gods setled and determinate purpose, arising from their obstinacie and impenitencie, whereby he had set it downe with himselfe to punish them by death, and so to denie them grace of repentance, as beeing giuen ouer to a reprobate sense. <hi>sic Iun.

                  <hi>10. Quest. v. 25.</hi> Whether any may be said to sinne with the will of God.</head>
               <p>This question is mooued by occasion of these words; they obeyed not the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them: as though God should be the cause, why they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beied not the voice of their father. 1. First, here the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees did most impiously affirme, that there were two begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and two chiefe princes, one of light, and an other of darknes: from the one proceeded good, from the other euill: but this is directly contrarie to the Scriptures, Psal. 135.6. <hi>That God doth whatsoeuer pleaseth him in heauen, &amp; in earth:</hi> therefore there is no contrarie power against God. 2. Some thinke, that God suffereth sinne to be done onely in the world, and otherwise concurreth not, then in leauing and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering sinners, which was the opinion of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Pelagian against whome <hi>Augustine</hi> writ: but if God be saide to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and suffer, as he doth (for by his absolute power he could hinder, that no sinne should be committed) he either suffereth sinne against his will, which cannot be saide, for nothing can resist his will; or with his will: if he willingly permit, then there is more then a bare suffering: likewise, the phrase of Scripture, when he is said, to harden Pharaohs heart, to bidde Shemei curse Dauid, to giue ouer to a reprobate sense, doe shew more then a permission. 3. Therefore, although sinne may be saide in some respect to stand with the will of God, as shall be shewed, yet God is no way the author or cause of sinne: but euery man is tempted and lead aside of his owne concupiscence, Iam. 1.14. but how sinne standeth with the will of God, it now followeth to be declared.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God concurreth in euery action as a generall cause: for whatsoeuer is wrought by the second causes, proceedeth ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from the first cause: for in him we mooue, we liue, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20715:12"/>
haue our beeing, Act. 17. but the euilnes of the action issueth from the second causes: as the rider is the efficient cause of the going of the lame horse, but his lame going is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God also concurreth in subtracting and denying his grace: where he giueth grace, it is of mercie; where he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth, it is iust: for none are depriued of his grace, but the vnworthie, and such as refuse: but why God giueth not like grace to all, there is no other reason but his good pleasure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sinne as it is sinne, standeth not with Gods will, but as it is the punishment of sinne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God is willing sinne should be done, because he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to vse it to his glorie; as the fall of Adam was the occasion of the redemption of the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God concurreth in the actions of sinners, as a supreame iudge, and ouer-ruler: sometime staying sinne before it be done, by punishing it, when it is done, and in the wicked by drawing forth their malice, and causing it to appeare, as in this sense he is said to haue hardned Pharaohs heart.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Yet Gods will is to be considered two waies: there is his secret, and reuealed will: as when he bid Abraham sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his sonne, his reuealed will was that he should slay him, his secret will, that he should not: so Gods will reuealed is against sinne; but it standeth with his secret will, as is before shewed. <hi>Martyr.</hi>

Therefore the more probable opinion is, that here reference is had to the first election of Aaron and his seede to the Priesthood, Exod. 29.9. that his whole seede should haue enioyed that priuiledge: but now part of Aarons house, such as came of Ithamar, for the sinne of Eli his house, are cut off. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <p>Here ariseth a great doubt, seeing Gods promises are most certaine, and his decree immutable; how the Lord here is brought in, saying and vnsaying againe. 1. The answer is, that Gods promises some are absolute without any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as was the promise of the Messiah; some are propounded vnto vs conditionally: especially the temporal promises made vnto the Israelites, depended vpon the condition of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, so was the Priesthood promised to this familie of Eli: <hi>Mar.</hi> so now life euerlasting is promised to the faithfull and beleeuers. 2. But will some say, doth then Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depend vpon our workes, or beleefe? No: in no wise: for God as he hath promised the reward, so also, to those whome he purposeth to make heires of his promise, he hath likewise ordained the meanes, to giue them faith, and all other graces, to apprehend and lay hold of the promises: which are deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto those, that are depriued of the promises. 3. Gods promises then are onely effectuall to those, which by a liuely faith, doe apprehend them: the rest, which by their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience doe fall off from Gods promises, doe not worke any alteration in the purpose of God, who foresaw both their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and that his promises belonged not vnto them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Because that there were fewe Prophets in those daies, there was no manifest vision, c. 3.1. it was therefore necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that this Prophet should confirme this prophesie by a signe: which kind of demonstration by signes, of it selfe doth not giue credit and authoritie to the prophesie, but as the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, working by the signe as the instrument, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the heart. 2. The signe is, by the accomplishment of a part of the prophesie, to shew the certentie of the rest: so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause whatsoeuer God hath heretofore promised to his Church is performed, as concerning the incarnation, passion, resurrection, ascension of Christ: we thereby are assured, that God will performe the rest, as of the destruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, the generall resurrection, the day of iudgement. 3. Now because signes also may be wrought by the operation of Sathan, as the Egyptian sorcerers did, and Sathan may sometimes foretell things: these differences are to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, betweene true and false predictions. 1. The signes, which the true Prophets gaue, did alwaies take effect, and neuer fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: Sathan sometime speaketh true, but more often lyeth: 2. the propheticall predictions were propounded manifestly and plainly, the oracles of Sathan were doubtfull and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous: 3. the propheticall tended to a good ende, for the maintenance of true religion: the diabolicall to the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of superstition and false religion: which is the true marke to discerne true propheticall signes from false.

               <p n="1">1.

Some of the Hebrewes thinke, that though their sinne could not be purged with sacrifices, yet they might by praier, almes deedes, and keeping of the lawe: but sinnes are not purged or redeemed by good workes, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are pleasing vnto God, as proceeding from a liuely faith: but sinnes are onely purged by faith in Christs blood, who was prefigured in the sacrifices. 2. The sacrifices then if they were not offered in faith, did not purge the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: they might be thereby externally purified, and by that outward rite continued in the societie of the people of God: but inwardly they were not purged, but by faith in Christ. 3. And that Christs death was shadowed forth in the sacrifices, it is euident: for the sinne of man deseruing death, could not be satisfied by the death of any inferiour vnto man, as were the bruit beasts: therefore it was necessarie, that thereby
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20715:17"/>
should be shadowed forth the death of him, that should make a full and perfect sacrifice. 4. And this was the faith of all the holy men vnder the law, who vrging so often the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and couenant made to Abraham, looked vnto the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah: but such as were carnall, saw not this mysterie. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. Now two waies the sinne of Eli his house is said not to be purged: in respect of the personall sinne of his wicked sonnes, which was a sinne of that nature, that their impenitent heart could finde no remission, as is shewed before, c. 2. q. 8. <hi>Iun.</hi> and in regard of the punishment, that howsoeuer his posteritie vpon their repentance might be forgiuen, yet the sentence of God concerning the losse of the Priests office should neuer be reuersed. <hi>Mar.

               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that whereas yet the Tabernacle consisted of courtaines and couerings, and so had vailes in stead of doores: that the house of God, and the Tabernacle were not the same, as the Arke was in one place, and the Tabernacle in an other in the time of Dauid and Salomon, before the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was built: <hi>Pellican.</hi> and hereunto this giueth some proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, because it is called here not the Tabernacle, but the Temple of the Lord, v. 3. and the house of the Lord, v. 15. But this is not like: for the Tabernacle was set vp in Shiloh in Ioshuahs time, c. 18.1. and so it had continued in the time of the Iudges, Iud. 21.19. and there it was now in Helies time. c. 1.9. 2. Therefore it is more like, that though the Tabernacle, while it was in the desert, for the better transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and carying from place to place, had vailes onely hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the entrance in stead of doores: yet now beeing setled in a certen place, it might also be made sure with doores. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siand.</hi> 3.

               <p>Three things are expressed, wherein the excellencie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels gifts, and the prerogatiue of his calling appeare. 1. The
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20715:17"/>
certentie of his predictions, and prophesies, that they all came to passe, none of them were spoken in vaine: so that Samuel needed not any other signes or miracles for the demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his calling, the effect and accomplishment of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies beeing a sufficient approbation. <hi>Pellic.</hi> 2. He was faithfull, without any partialitie or accepting of persons, in deliuering the word of God to Israel: <hi>Osiand.</hi> as Moses is said to haue beene faithfull in the Lords house, Numb. 12.3. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord had thus begunne to reueale himselfe to Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, he proceeded still and added further to reueale vnto him his will, and to appeare vnto him, v. 21. <hi>Iun.</hi> 4. Samuel therefore was an honourable Prophet, because in him the word of prophesying decaied, was reuiued: and therefore it is said, 2.

               <p>There are fowre expositions of these words: 1. some thus interpret: <hi>the word of Samuel was knowne to all Israel: C. Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic.</hi> and so referre it to the latter ende of the former chapter, v. 20. how all Israel knew that faithfull Samuel was the Lords Prophet.

Others expound it of Samuels speaking to all Israel, that the warre should be vndertaken by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Samuel: <hi>sic Vat. Genev.</hi> but the Philistims, as it appeareth, first prouoked the Israelites to battell: &amp; it would haue somewhat derogated to Samuel at the first, if he should haue beene the perswader of such an vnfortunate battell. 3. Some then vnderstand it of Samuels admonitions and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings to the people, to draw them to repentance. <hi>Osiand.</hi> 4. But this, going before the lamentable euent of the battell with the Philistims, as a preface vnto it, rather signifieth, that the word of Samuel came to passe in this manner to all Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el: for he had prophesied not onely against Helies house, but had shewed, that all Israel should tast of the same iudgement: their eares should tingle, when they heard the heauie newes.

               <p n="1">1. Their presumption appeareth, in commanding as it were the Arke of God to be brought vnto them, causing it to be fet without any pompe, or due reuerence, by the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the prophane and vngodly priests the sonnes of Heli. <hi>Pellic.</hi> 2. Further, they did it presumptuously, in aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thus to doe of their owne head, neuer consulting with Samuel, nor hauing any such warrant, or commaundement from God. <hi>Osiand.</hi> 3. Their carnall confidence is manifest, in trusting to the Arke of wood, hauing God their enemie, who, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, was greater then the Arke, which was to be reuerenced for him: they seeke not to amend their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, nor to be reconciled to God by repentance, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue the wicked priests. <hi>Pellic.

Much like here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto was the superstitious practise of the Papists, who in the time of common calamities, as of the pestilence, and vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable weather, would goe about in procession, in the streetes, with their pix and the host: as though there were vertue in such ceremonies, to appease the wrath of God. <hi>Osiand.

               <p n="1">1. The principall cause was the iustice of God, in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this temporall iudgement, the negligence of Eli and remissenes, in not correcting his sonnes: that as he bowed not the necks of his sonnes to the yoke, so his necke as a iust recompense, is now bowed and broken. <hi>Borr.</hi> 2. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate cause, was the lamentable report of so many calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which fell out together, Israel fled, his sonnes slaine, and the Arke taken, at the which he grieued most of all: the messenger maketh no pause at all, but vttereth all his heauie newes at once, as it were of purpose, to oppresse and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load him with griefe; whereas, if he had taken time, to tell it by degrees, his griefe might haue beene somewhat allaied. 3. The instrumentall cause, was his falling from his seate: which was not a low stoole, but an high throne, as <hi>Iosephus,</hi> as meete for the person of the high priest, and chiefe Iudge: so he fell high: and he was also very old, almost, of an hundred yeares, and so his bodie was grosse and quarrie, and he not nimble to shift for himselfe. <hi>Vatab.</hi> Adde also hereunto, that he was very dimme sighted, and so could not see which waies to helpe himselfe.</p>

                  <hi>7. Quest. v. 18.</hi> What is to be thought of Helies case before God.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Temporall corrections, though they be vnto the death of the bodie, are not signes that a man is cast off and forsaken of God: as Ionathan and Iosias were cut off suddenly in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, yet both of them good men. 2. Neither yet is sudden death to be taken alwaies as a forerunner of euerlasting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: Moses died in his strength, and without sicknesse: Sampson ended his daies all at once, when he pulled downe the house vpon his head and the Philistims: sudden death to the children of God, is but as the translation of Henoch and Elias, which was in a moment: therefore Heli is not to be condemned, because this iudgement of sudden death fell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. 3. But it may rather be gathered, that Heli was (notwithstanding some infirmities) a good man: and though he could not escape this temporall punishment, which for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample sake, the Lord had purposed to bring vpon him; yet it may safely be thought, that he died in the state of grace, in respect of euerlasting life. 1. This may be gathered by his innocencie, and honestie of life, who misliked the sinnes of his children, as it may appeare by his reprehension of them, though it were too milde and fauourable: neither doth the Scripture obiect any crime of note vnto him, but that of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and remissenes toward his children. 2. His patience is euident, that when Samuel had declared vnto him the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God, in iudging his house, he meekely made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, as submitting himselfe to the will of God, v. 18. <hi>He is the Lord, let him doe what seemeth good:</hi> as comforting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in God, though he could not auoid that outward cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement. <hi>Osiand.

Further, his zeale and loue vnto religion appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, who tooke more grieuously the losse of the Arke, then the death of his sonnes, and desired no longer to liue, the Arke beeing taken. 4. Lastly, that saying of Ecclesiasticus may be applied vnto Heli: <hi>Concerning the Iudges, euery one by his name, whose heart went not a whoring, nor departed from the Lord, their memorie be blessed:</hi> Ecclesiast. 46.11. for of this number was Heli, one of the Iudges, who is not found to

               <p>The Bethshemites diuers waies offended. 1.

Some thinke that they offered sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of themselues, neither the priests, nor Samuel beeing consulted with. <hi>Pellican.</hi> But that is not like: for seeing it is directly mentioned, that the Leuites, that is, the priests of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi (for Bethshemesh was a citie of the priests of Aaron, not of Leuites onely, Iosh. 22.16.) tooke downe the Arke, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arke was taken downe, they could not cleaue the cart for wood, nor consequently offer their sacrifice: therefore it is not like, that the Bethshemites did presume to offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice without their priests. 4. The true cause therefore, why the Lord did smite them, was, as is here expressed, v. 19. <hi>because they looked into the Arke:</hi> where we neede not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with the Hebrewes, that they opened the Arke to looke into it: but it was contrarie to the law, to looke vpon the Arke bare or vncouered, Numb. 5.20. as the men and citizens of Bethshemesh, such as were not priests, did gaze vpon the Arke, either beeing brought naked by the Philistims, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered

by them: for so it is before shewed, v. 13. that they reioyced, or tooke delight in beholding the Arke, that is, in gazing and looking vpon it. <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh, they did also handle it vnreuerently with their hands: but it was sufficient to procure this iudgement, that such, as were not priests did gaze vpon it.

But <hi>Iunius</hi> himselfe in his latter editions reuerseth this opinion, and thinketh, that this number of fiftie thousand and seuentie men, was partly of such of the Israelites, as came flocking from all parts to see the Arke, partly of those which kept their garrisons and stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to defend their coasts from the inuasion of the Philistims:

So is <hi>Bethel</hi> taken for the house of God, Iud. 20.18. as it is called <hi>beth Iehovah,</hi> the house of Iehouah, c. 3.15. so also c. 10.3. three men are saide to goe vp to God to <hi>Bethel,</hi> that is, to the house of God: for seeing the people had recourse and flocked to that place, where the Arke was, it is not like,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20715:29"/>
that Samuel would omit to visit it in his circuit. This reading for these reasons is to be preferred, before the vsuall interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which taketh Bethel for a proper name here.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Some read for Ramah, <hi>Ramatha, Chald. Lat.</hi> some <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathaim, Sep.</hi> but the name of the citie is <hi>Ramah,</hi> Iosh. 18.25. <hi>Ramatha</hi> is the Hebrue inflexion of the word in constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the paragogical addition of the letter <hi>he,</hi> in the ende. 2. But here this doubt ariseth, how Samuel could absent himselfe from the Lords house, &amp; keepe at Ramah, seeing he was consecrated vnto God by his mother, during his life, c. 1.28. Some thinke, that it was lawfull for Samuel, when the time of his ministerie and seruice was ouer, to goe vnto his owne house: <hi>Pellican.</hi> but Annahs vow was more strict, for she did giue him so vnto the Lord, that he should abide there for euer, c. 1.22. and if he had departed from the Lords house, when his course of seruing had beene past, he had beene no more tied, then other common Leuites. 3. Therefore the better solution is, that so long as the house of God was knowne to be at Shiloh, Samuel was bound vnto that place by his vow: but now Shiloh beeing desolate, and no certaine place appointed of God, where the Arke should be setled, Samuel in that behalfe was freed of his vow, with the which, necessitie in this case dispensed. <hi>Borr.</hi> The like we read of the sonnes of Rechab, who were bound by their fathers vowe to dwell in tents: yet in case of necessitie, when the host of the Chaldeans had inuaded the land, they went to dwell in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem for feare of the enemie. Ierem. 35.11. 4. Further it may be answered, that vowes so long hold, till Gods pleasure be otherwise knowne: Samuel beeing now called to be a Iudge, could not be confined to a certaine place: God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dispensed with that vow. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <hi>17. Quest. v. 17.</hi> Where Samuel built the altar.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Because it was not lawfull by the law to offer any sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but before the Lord, in the place which the Lord should choose, Deut. 12.14. and consequently to build no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20715:29"/>
but there: therefore <hi>Iunius</hi> referreth these words, <hi>also he built an altar there vnto the Lord,</hi> vnto the antecedent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest of, namely, the house of God: as the like is found in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse places of the Scripture: as Gen. 10.12. <hi>Resen also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Niniveh and Caleh: this is a great citie:</hi> that is, Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh: and, 1. Sam. 27.8. <hi>Then Dauid and his men inuaded the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites: for they</hi> (that is, the two first named) <hi>inhabited the land from the beginning.</hi> But against this exposition, these reasons may be alleadged: 1. because in none of these places giuen in instance, nor in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, which can be produced, the further antecedent, is so farre remooued, by so many clauses comming betweene, as in this place, two whole verses almost beeing inserted betweene <hi>Bethel,</hi> or <hi>the house of God,</hi> and these words. 2. for that in those places, the necessitie of the sense enforceth such relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be had to the precedent part furthest off: but there is no such necessitie here. 3. the restrictiue or limiting particle <hi>shun</hi> there, beeing twice repeated before in this verse, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to Ramah, sheweth that it should be so take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here: <hi>there was his house, and there he iudged Israel, and he built an altar there vnto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Therefore the best answer is, that because there was yet no certaine place appointed, where the Arke should continue, it remaining at this time in a priuate mans house: <hi>Pellican.</hi> and for that the Tabernacle, to the doore whereof the sacrifices by the law were appointed to be brought, Levit. 17.3. and the Arke were now asunder, and in diuers places; Samuel might haue this libertie to build an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar at Ramah: especially considering that he was a Prophet, and did it by a propheticall instinct: <hi>Osiander. Mar.</hi> as Elias the Prophet built an altar, 1. king. 18. And seeing the Arke was remooued from place to place, as appeareth c. 14.18. if an altar could not be built, but where the Arke was for the time present, it is not vnlike, but that the Arke of God might be sometime remooued to Ramah: as Saul hauing the Arke in the campe, there erected an altar. c. 14.35. But I rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist vpon the two former answers, the divulsion and seperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Arke from the Tabernacle, no certen place beeing yet appointed for the resiance of the Arke, and the propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and extraordinarie direction, that Samuel had.</p>

                  <hi>1. Quest. v. 2.</hi> Of the place where Samuel appointed his sonnes to be Iudges.</head>
               <p n="1">1. BEcause <hi>Beersheba</hi> onely is named, some thinke, that both his sonnes were appointed to be Iudges; either because that citie was in the remote corner in the South part of the land, whether Samuel by reason of his old age could not trauaile in person: <hi>Borr.</hi> or for that it was situate in the confines and borders of the Philistims, and so had more need of the presence of the Iudge: <hi>Osiand.</hi> or they beeing vniust Iudges, might choose that place to wearie the people with long trauaile. <hi>Pellican.</hi> But seeing they were deputed by their father, it is like that he would haue assigned them to some conuenient place, whether the people might resort with more ease, and not set them in the vtmost corner of the land: and to what ende should his two sonnes be limited to one place? they beeing diuided, might better dispatch the causes of the people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Iosephus</hi> therefore thinketh, that one of them was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Iudge in Bethel, the other in Beershebah: but seeing no mention is made of Bethel in the text, that coniecture hath no warrant or certentie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore <hi>Iunius</hi> opinion is more probable, that the meaning is, they were set Iudges ouer the whole land from Dan to Beershebah, which were the two extreame townes of the land: and Dan is to be supplied out of the like place, Iud. 20.1. here beeing omitted, by a certaine <hi>synecdoche,</hi> one op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite part comprehending the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Samuel in making his sonnes Iudges, offendeth two waies, both because he consulted not with God, and he had no example for it: for neither Moses, nor Gedeon, or any of the Iudges appointed their sonne. <hi>Mar.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. If they had simply desired a King to be giuen them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20715:30"/>
to the law of God, Deut. 17.15. that should gouerne them in equitie, and such an one as feared God, they then had not offended: but now they doe aske a king of a prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous desire, onely that they might be like vnto other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Borr.</hi> 2. Yet God hauing purposed to erect among his people a kingly throne, and to raise vnto them a king, of whose seede the Messiah should come, tooke this occasion to accomplish his purpose, so turning their euill and inordinate desire vnto a good ende: as God can conuert the euill thoughts and actions of men, to serue for his glorie. <hi>Borr.</hi> 3. Now the people in asking a king, failed in diuers circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: 1. in their curiositie, that pretending the iniustice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels sonnes, yet indeede desired an innovation of the very gouernment it selfe: for they might haue otherwise requested of Samuel, to admonish his sonnes, that the fault might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, not the person remooued. <hi>Pellican.</hi> 2. Their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie appeareth toward God, who had hitherto raised vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them Iudges and deliuerers, they beeing not contented therewith, because their Iudges shifted from one tribe to an other, and many times were of meane parentage, and not so fearefull or terrible to their enemies, they desire to haue a certaintie of the kingdome, as other nations had, and so they offended in their distrust and diffidence toward God: <hi>Osiand.</hi> as the Lord himselfe saith, they <hi>had reiected him,</hi> v. 7. 3. Their ingratitude also was great toward Samuel, by whose meanes, they had receiued so many and great benefits, that they would shake off his gouernment, euen while he liued: in these respects, the petition of the people for a King seemed euill vnto Samuel.</p>

                  <hi>3. Quest. v. 7.</hi> Whether by asking of a King, the people indeede cast off the Lords gouernment.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Simply it is not true, that the gouernment vnder kings, is a shaking off the Lords yoke. For the Lord is with kings, and ruleth his people by them: they are the ordinance of God. Wisdome saith, <hi>Proverb.</hi> 8. By me Kings rule. The Lord blessed the gouernment of Dauid, Iehoshaphat, Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, Iosias. But yet the people, as much as in them lay, reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Lords gouernment: because they misliked that form

of administration, which the Lord had set them, and desired a chaunge and innouation, without any direction from God. 2. But it will be further questioned, whether God also doe raigne together with bad kings: the answer is, that euen the authoritie of wicked Kings is of God, which they abuse to tyrannie: and they shall giue account vnto God for abuse of their gouernment. And although the persons be euill, which gouerne, yet the authoritie is lawfull and good: and euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tyrants there are many good things: as enacting of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike lawes, administration of iustice, punishment of offenders. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <hi>4. Quest. v. 11.</hi> Of Samuels description of the King, whome the Israelites desired.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Samuel describeth such manners and fashions, which are incident, not to true Monarchies, but such as decline ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto a Tyrannie: <hi>Osiand.</hi> he setteth not downe here the office of a King, what he ought to be, but foresheweth by the spirit of prophesie, what manner of king they should haue: that they either hereby might be perswaded to desist from their enterprize, or they might more willingly beare these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, when they fell vpon them, beeing thus fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of them, and beeing the cause thereof themselues. <hi>Pellican.</hi> And thus the Lord to their owne cost graunteth their desire, that for the most part, they had such kings, as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned them rather by will, then law, as the kings of the Gentiles did. 2. Samuel sheweth how their King should haue power ouer their children and seruants, their goods and lands. In all which the King hath a soueraigne right: mens seruants and children are to doe the king seruice in time of warre, and of peace: the necessitie of the Crowne is to be supported for the publike good of the Commonwealth: but the manner is vnlawfull: the King must rule by law, not by lust, nor lay vnnecessarie burdens vpon his subiects, knowing that he hath also a Lord aboue him, the great king of heauen, to whome he must giue account. 3. In these three things Samuel sheweth, that their King should faile: first in the manner, that he should not by order or law, but by violence and compulsion take from them their sonnes and daughters, their lands and goods, whereas yet Iezabel, would not but by

(putting them to base and seruile offices) not as free subiects, such as they were in time of the Iudges, and their other gouernours. <hi>Borr.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. God had decreed by this occasion to set a King ouer his people, as he promised to Abraham, that Kings should come of his seede, Gen. 17.17. yet God did not force their wills: but God vseth their wills and desire, whereunto they were enclined, to effect his counsell. <hi>Pellican.</hi> 2. Therefore iustly notwithstanding the Lord by his Prophet telleth them, that he will not heare them afterward, when they shall crie vnto him, because of the oppressions of their King, for that they now wilfully cast off the counsell of God, and refuse to hearken vnto his voice. <hi>Pellican.</hi> 3. And thus we see how many times men are snared in their owne desires, and obtaine their requests vnto their owne hurt: as the Lord tooke the people short in their hastie wishes: Numb. 14.28. <hi>As I liue, saith the Lord, I will surely doe vnto you, as ye haue spoken in mine eares, your carkesses shall fall in this wildernes, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Now in this their petition the people offended, because they asked him after a preposterous manner, not expecting the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of God: therefore the Lord is said, <hi>to haue giuen them a King in his anger,</hi> Hosh. 13.11. their request was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the reuealed will of God, though God in his secret counsell had so determined. <hi>Mar.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Iunius</hi> translateth <hi>zebach</hi> a feast, which word properly signifieth a killing or slaying for sacrifice, and sometime for other vses: his reason is this, because it was against the law to sacrifice in any other place, then before the Lord. Leuit. 17.3. and Deut. 12.5. But hereunto it may be answered, 1. that as Samuel before, by extraordinarie direction, built an altar at Ramah, so it was lawfull for him beeing a Prophet, to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice other-where, then at the Tabernacle: <hi>Osiand.</hi> especially seeing the Arke and the Tabernacle were now asunder, and so no certaine place appointed for the Arke, as is shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, c. 7. qu. 17. 2. It is not vnlike, but that the Arke of God might be remooued hither at this time, at the election of their king, as <hi>Iunius</hi> thinketh it was translated to Gilgal, at his inauguration, c. 11.15. where they also offered peace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. 2. I thinke rather, as both the <hi>Chald. Septuag.</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpreters, <hi>Vatab. Mon. Pag.</hi> doe read here <hi>sacrifice:</hi> so first they offered their peace offerings vnto God, and then of the remainder thereof made a solemne feast. <hi>Pellican. Osiand.</hi> And these reasons, may perswade it: 1. because the word <hi>zebach</hi> more properly and vsually is taken for <hi>sacrifice,</hi> as c. 10.8. and 11.15. 2. the place argueth as much, for if it had beene but an ordinarie feast, Samuel might haue kept it in his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20715:33"/>
owne house, he needed not to haue gone vp to the high place, where they vsed to sacrifice before the Temple was built. 3. The publike fame of this meeting, whereof the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry maidens were not ignorant, sheweth rather that it was a solemne sacrifice, then a priuate feast for thirtie persons. 4. The common vse was, in their solemne meetings, first to offer peace offerings, and to make a feast of the remainder: for of that kind of offerings, the fat was offered to the Lord, the right shoulder and the breast was the Priests, Leuit. 7.31, 32. of the rest the people might eate: so Salomon, of the peace offerings, which he offered in great abundance, euen 22. thousand beeues, and an 120. thousand sheepe, made a royall feast to all Israel. 1. King. 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But it will be obiected, that the shoulder and that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, which were reserued for Saul, were the Priests fee, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. 7.31. whereof it was not lawfull for any stranger, not of Leui, to eate, no not for him that soiourned with the priest, Leuit. 22.10. To this it may be answered: that the right shoulder onely was the Priests, Leuit. 7.32. but here v. 24. it is not named what shoulder it was: and beside, though they did eate of the remainder of the peace offerings, yet they might also in such feasts, eate of other meate, not offered in sacrifice: but howsoeuer it was, it is not necessarie to thinke that this portion, was any of the Priests allowance, nay it is like it was not: but some other portion reserued for Saul. <hi>Iosephus</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, <hi>portionem regiam,</hi> a kingly part: who indeede, calleth it <hi>epulum,</hi> a feast, he nameth it not a sacrifice.

And Christians doe still retaine that commendable vse, which was practised, as <hi>R.

               <p n="1">1. Some of the Hebrewes thinke, that the stone in the Priests breastplate, wherein the name of Benjamin was taken, did shine extraordinarily, whereby they knew that the King should come out of that tribe: but that is not like: for though the tribe were found out by this meanes, yet that serued not to finde out the familie, and the very person: therefore the course here taken was by casting of Lots. 2. It is like that Samuel here followeth Ioshuahs president: first, the tribe is taken by lot, then the familie in the tribe, then the house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in that family, and lastly the person: as Iosh. 7.14. <hi>Iun.</hi> so here the tribe of Benjamin commeth forth, then the familie of Metri, then the houshold of Kish, and lastly Saul of that house. 3. Concerning the manner of casting lots: the names of the tribes were written, and cast into a pot, <hi>Ioseph.</hi> then some one of euery tribe was appointed to draw out the lot for the whole tribe, and so likewise for the family, and house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. <hi>Osiand.</hi> And this was done before the Arke, and with praiers beeing made before, as v. 22. it is said, they asked the Lord againe, that is, praied vnto him: <hi>Iun.</hi> So that this casting of lots, was directed by the prouidence of God: as Salomon saith, <hi>The lot is cast into the lappe, but the whole disposition thereof is of the Lord.</hi> Prov. 16.33. <hi>D.

               <p n="1">1. We finde three kind of lots vsed in Scripture: some for equall diuision, and deciding of controuersies that way: as the land of Canaan was sorted out by lot: some were <hi>sortes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultatoriae,</hi> lots vsed for consultation, as when Mathias was chosen: some, <hi>divinatoriae,</hi> diuining lots, when any hid thing is reuealed, as Achan was taken by lot, Iosh. 7. 2. Now some doe vtterly condemne the vse of lots now, as <hi>Hierome</hi> vpon Ionas: and thinketh that such examples in Scripture were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie, and not to be followed. 3. But <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgement is more probable, who thinketh though the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of lots ought not to be so vsuall, as before: yet that in some cases lots may be cast: as he putteth this case; that in time of persecution, when it is thought fit, that some mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters should be preserued for future times, and all are alike minded to abide the extreamest hazard, and of the like gifts, then they may be chosen by lots. <hi>epist. ad Honorat.</hi> 4. But these conditions must be obserued in lots: 1. that all other meanes should first be attempted, and lots not to be vsed but vpon great necessitie, when no other way is left: so Mathias was elected, there beeing such equalitie betweene him and the other, as that the Apostles could make no difference. 2. they must be vsed not rashly, but reuerently, as the Apostles to their lots ioyned praier. 3. superstitious lots must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned: such as were the lots of <hi>Numerius Suffetius,</hi> whom <hi>Cicero</hi> speaketh of <hi>lib. de Divinat.</hi> that he cut a flint in sunder, and out leaped certaine lots. 4. there must be no deceit v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in lots. <hi>Mar.</hi> These conditions must be obserued in such lots as are vsed in great and waightie affaires: but they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to such kinde of lots, which are ordinarily vsed in some kinde of recreations, where no such waightie ende is purposed.</p>

               <p n="1">1. In this inhumane and hostile condition here imposed, the Ammonites shew their detestable hatred to the people of God: that as they denied them bread and water in the wildernes, so they continue hatefull toward them still, and therefore the Lord knowing their malice against his people, prouided in the law, that the Israelites should haue nothing to doe with them, Deut. 23.6. <hi>Borr.</hi> 2. By the right eye, some Hebrewes vnderstand that text in the law, that the Ammonites should not enter into the congregation till the tenth generation; that they would haue it rased out: but this exposition is ridiculous and fond. Nahash would indeede haue their right eye put out, to make them vnapt for warre, for the left eye was shadowed and hid with the sheild, which they held before it: <hi>Ioseph.</hi> and to make them vnfit either to read or write the law of God, as some Hebrewes: <hi>ex Pellican.</hi> but the reason is here expressed, to bring shame and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie vpon Israel: as the Ammonites had a delight to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch the people of God: as Haman the sonne of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hash did shame Dauids seruants that were sent to him in kindnesse, in shauing their beardes, and cutting off their garments by the middle. 2.

Vnder Iudah also Simeon is comprehended, as Iud. 1.3. for the Simeonites had their possessions and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation within the tribe of Iudah. 3.

                  <hi>11. Quest. v. 13.</hi> Of Sauls clemencie in sparing those, who murmured against him.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Saul herein sheweth his pietie, humanitie, wisedome; the first in not seeking priuate reuenge, the second in bearing with their scruple and doubtfulnesse, that yet had not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him for their king: his wisdome, in seeking to winne them with lenitie: the like is seene in Dauid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Sam. 19.25. in pardoning Shemei, and graunting him his life. <hi>Iun.</hi> 2. Saul giueth this reason, <hi>because this day the Lord hath saued Israel,</hi> he would not haue the ioy of that day obscured, and polluted with shedding of blood: <hi>Pellican.</hi> but as God had shewed them mercie in sending them such a ioyfull deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, so the like mercie he thought fit to be shewed vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>R. Ben Gerson</hi> thinketh, that Saul did not pardon these men, but onely respited their punishment: but that is not like. 3. Hitherto Saul declareth himself an innocent man, &amp; a good Prince: <hi>Pellican.</hi> but afterward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Saul forgot his owne rule, when he would haue killed Ionathan, for ignorantly brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his rash, vow, whome notwithstanding the people saued,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20715:42"/>
vsing the like reason, which Saul doth here: <hi>Shall Ionathan die, who hath so mightily deliuered Israel?</hi> c. 14.45. This mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie in Saul, and changeable nature, in falling from cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie to crueltie, from pietie to prophanes, from a good gouernour, to become a tyrant, doth shew, that these vertues were not throughly grounded in him, but onely superficially infused.</p>

                  <hi>12. Quest.</hi> Whether the Prince may pardon the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment inflicted by the law.</head>
               <p n="1">1. As it is a princely part for clemencie to be extended, where there is place for fauour, so it is acceptable to God, and honourable before men, for iustice duly to be executed: as these reasons doe shewe: 1. the Prince beareth not the sword for nought, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. but if malefactours should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape vnpunished, what vse should be then of the sword. 2. <hi>To iustifie the wicked, and to condemne the righteous, are both an abomination vnto God,</hi> Prov. 17.15. if it be vnlawfull to condemne the righteous, so is it to cleare the wicked. 3. he onely hath power to dispense with the punishment, who first imposed it, but God hath prescribed the punishment for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine sinnes, by him then, and the authoritie of his word, they must be released. 4. where iustice is executed, God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as appeareth 2. Sam. 21. when Sauls sonnes were hanged vp for the slaughter of the Gibeonites. And where iustice is suspended, God is offended, as the land was punished with famine, in the same place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But further to decide this question, and not to shut vp all way vnto clemencie; here are certaine necessarie conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to be weighed. 1. There is great difference between humane and diuine lawes: for in humane, as the law receiueth life from the Prince, so the punishment is arbitrarie in him, to be inflicted, or remitted: but in the execution of the diuine lawes, there is not the like libertie. 2. Concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine lawes, these distinctions must be obserued: first, some are negatiue, <hi>Thou shalt not kill, steale, &amp;c.</hi> which are strictly to be obserued: but in the affirmatiue, as to put the murtherer to death, there is not the like strictnes and necessitie: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where there is no penaltie ioyned to the law, as that they should vse iust waights and measures, but the punishment is not prescribed, and in such like, there was place for fauour:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20715:42"/>
thirdly, where the penaltie of the law can not be inflicted, without greater dammage to the Common-wealth, there it may be respited: as Dauid put not Ioab to death for slaying Abner and Amasa, because he saw he could not do it without great disturbance in the Commonwealth. But for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted by the law of God, to be vpon partialitie and conniuence released (as Dauid suffered Amnon for his incest, and Abshalom for murder to goe vnpunished) hath no good warrant. And though Dauid spared them, yet Gods iustice ouertooke them both. <hi>Mar.</hi> Further, how farre Moses Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials doe now tend, see Hexapl. in Exod. in the question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first chapter.</p>

                  <hi>2. Quest. v. 2.</hi> Of Samuels age: he saith, I am old and gray headed.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Some of the Hebrewes thinke that Samuel exceeded not the age of 52. yeares when he died: but that can not be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if Samuel, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh, liued 18 yeares after Saul was king, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>in fine,</hi> and yet in the beginning of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was gray headed, and had sonnes fit for gouernment, then if his whole age were but 52. we must haue Samuel gray headed at 34. yeares, and then to haue children fit to beare office. 2. Therefore it is more probable that Samuel was at this time 52. yeare old at the least, and that he liued more 18. yeares vnder Saul, and might be about 70. yeares of age in all. <hi>Iosephus</hi> seemeth to fauour the first opinion: for he thinketh that Samuel was but 12. yeare old, when the Lord first appeared vnto him, c. 3. not long after that Eli died: &amp; he saith that Samuel iudged Israel 12. yeares alone, and 18. yeares with Saul, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 14. all makes but 42. yeares. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Eli his death, the Arke was 20. yeares in Kiriathiearim, c. 7.2. not long before Saul was made king: and whereas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Eli his 40. yeares, Samuel and Saul succeeded 40. yeares more, Act. 13.21. if this time be deuided, and halfe of it giuen to Samuel, halfe to Saul: Samuel should not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 32. yeare old, when Saul was desired to be king: but the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20715:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Scripture saith, that Samuel was then become old. chap. 8.1. Therfore it is not probable, that Samuel was then but twelue yeare old: or els we must make a longer space betweene Gods first appearing to Samuel and Eli his death. 3. Here then are some things certen, some vncerten. First, it is vncerten how old Samuel was when Eli died: secondly it is vncerten, how long Samuel and Saul gouerned Israel. But it is certen, that Samuel and Saul betweene them had but 40. yeares, Act. 13.21. as may also be gathered by casting of the yeares from the departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt, which vnto the 4. yeare of Salomons raigne were 480. yeares, 1. king. 6.1. reckened thus: 40. yeares in the wildernes, 17. yeares vnder Ioshua, 299. vnder the Iudges, 80. vnder Eli, Samuel, &amp; Saul, 40. vnder Dauid, and 4. yeares of Salomons raigne: which make 480. yeares. It is likewise certen, that Samuel iudged Israel after Eli before Saul, at the least 20. yeares, c. 7.2. It is like then, that he was more then 12. yeare old when Eli di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; at the least 50. or more, when he substituted his sonnes. His whole age then could not be so little, as 52. yeares, as some Hebrewes surmise. <hi>Pellic.</hi> 4. And further some thinke; as <hi>Peter Mar.</hi> in c. 1. that Samuel was borne in the 366. yeare after the comming of Israel out of Egypt: for whereas from thence to the building of the Temple in the 4. yeare of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, were but 480. yeares, 1. king. 6.1. of which time Dauid raigned 40. saue foure: Samuel and Saul twentie betweene them: whereof giuing vnto Saul 20. yeares of those fourtie, there will be 60. yeares wanting, foure abated of the saide summe of 480. then was Samuel borne in 366. yeare. 50. yeare old at the least when Sauls 20. yeare began, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the 424. yeare: 60. yeares before the building of their Temple by Salomon.

               <p n="1">1.

Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tab.</hi> but it is not like, that Samuel would sende the people for counsell to his sonnes, both because they had now a

Some thinke, that Samuel doth by making this mention, taxe the people for their ingratitude, that might better haue accepted of the sonnes for their fathers sake: and if they were faultie, to haue sought their amendment, rather then a change and innouation of the state. <hi>Borr.</hi> But Samuel then should haue shewed some discontentment, that his sonnes did not succeede him in the gouernment, wherewith notwithstanding he was willing and well pleased, submitting himselfe to Gods good pleasure. 3. Therefore Samuels meaning was this, that now in the determining of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of his house, which he resigned by reason of his age, and his sonnes also were now as priuate men, a king bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed: he is willing to giue vp a reckoning and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as it were of his stewardship among them. <hi>Iun.</hi> As also, as he purgeth himselfe, so he is willing that his sonnes should giue account of their gouernment, who were now in their hands and power, and they might proceede against them as they desired. <hi>Osiand.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

And of all other the omission of these duties is most displeasing to God, discommodious to his Church, and dangerous to their soule, by wome the default is committed. And therefore Samuel saith here in direct tearmes, <hi>farre be it from me, that I should sinne against the Lord, and cease praying for you: yea, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct you in the good and right way.</hi> Samuel confesseth he should haue sinned, if he ceased or intermitted to pray for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and teach them, and to execute his Propheticall office among them: as the Apostle saith, <hi>Woe is me if I preach not the Gospel,</hi> 1. Cor. 9.16. 2. If such necessitie be laid vpon Prophets and Apostles then, and Pastors and Ministers now to preach the Gospel:<note place="margin">Whether the preaching of the word be a necessary part of sanctifying the Sabbath.</note> doth it not follow, that euery Pastor in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar charge, is bound to preach vnto his people continually, and to sanctifie the Lords day with them in preaching the word: and that a Pastor beeing not necessarily letted, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to preach, doth not hallow the Lords day, as the Lord requireth: and will it not follow vpon Samuels conclusion, that whosoeuer ceaseth to pray, and preach for and to his people (especially vpon the Lords day, which is consecrated to those exercises) therein sinneth? This position then, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Pastor, not necessarily absent, or otherwise necessarily letted, is bound to pray with, and preach to his people euery Lords day, and in omitting these duties vnhalloweth for his part, that sacred day: it may be iustified by the word of God, and by the continuall practise of the Church.</p>
               <p>For, the Lord saith by his Prophet, <hi>If the watchman see the sword comming, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned: if the sword come and take any person from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, he is taken for his iniquitie: but his blood will I require at the watchmans hand.</hi> Ezech. 33.6, 7.

Moses was read and preached in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues euery Sabboth day, Act. 15.21. S.

For if parents are bound to whet vpon their children the law of God, Deuter. 6.7. often to inculcate vnto them the Lords commaundements: much more is it the dutie of the Pastor: if bodily almes is not to be deferred till to morrow, if we now haue it, Proverb. 2.28. how much more is not spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall almes to be deferred.</p>
               <p>Further, if a Pastor preach not vnto his people, where he is not letted by necessarie absence, publike imployment, or sicknes and infirmitie, and so is staied by the hand of God, by his priuate necessary affaires beeing abroad, or by the publike busines of the Church: what is the cause of his not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? either it is his want of abilitie, and then he is an intruder, or if he can and will not, it is his want of zeale, and sheweth idlenes and negligence, which in Gods busines is accursed, as the Prophet saith; or he would and can not, by reason of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches, which he hath cure and charge of, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of greedines and couetousnes: so then, which soeuer of these causes is pretended, whether it be the ignorant, idle, or couetous Pastor, he can not be excused in leauing such a principall dutie vndone vpon the Lords day: for euery one according to his place is to sanctifie the Lords day: he that is taught, sanctifieth it in hearing the word reuerently, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with the praiers of the Church deuoutly: but he that teacheth must sanctifie the Lords day, not as one of the sheepe, but as a Pastor, not as an hearer, but as a teacher: or els he sanctifieth it not, as he ought: and his fault and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is so much the greater, because he onely doth not faile in sanctifying the Lords day himselfe, but is the occasion that others sanctifie it not, as they would and might, by hearing the word preached.</p>
               <p>I doe reuerence in this behalfe that worthie Canon of the <hi>Trullan</hi> Councell: <hi>Oportet eos, qui praesunt Ecclesiis, omnibus quidem diebus, sed maxime dominicis, populum docere pietatis eloquia, ex divina scriptura colligentes iudicia veritatis: They which are set ouer the Churches ought vpon all daies, but most of all the Lords daies, teach the people, the precepts of pietie, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering out of the Scripture the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of truth.</hi> Trul. c. 19.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20715:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> hath an excellent reason to shew the necessitie of the often preaching of the word: <hi>Certissime scitote fratres, quia qualis est caro, quae post multos dies percipit cibum, talis est anima, quae non assidue pascitur verbo dei: &amp;c.</hi> Know ye bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren for a certentie, that as the flesh is, which after many daies receiueth food, such is the soule which is not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fed with Gods word. <hi>de Temp.

               <p>Thus it appeareth by the Scripture, and by the practise of the Church, what necessitie is laid vpon preaching, and what curse hangeth ouer them, that are negligent in the Lords worke, &amp; that euery Lords day the spirituall Manna of Gods word should raine downe vpon the people. It pitieth my heart therefore, that some men should so much forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as to call them Sabbatarians, which require this dutie at the Pastours hands, to sanctifie the Lords day continually with the preaching of the word of God: and further are not afraid, to call these positions, and the like, <hi>as that the Lords day must necessarily be kept now of all Christians: that it is not lawfull to vse the seauenth day to any other ende, but to the holy and sanctified ende, to the which the Lord appointed it: that we be restrained vpon the Sabbath day from worke, both hand and foote, as the Iewes were: that the Church hath no authoritie to set vp any day like to the Sabbath day:</hi> these and the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, one is not ashamed to call, <hi>Sabbatarian errors, and impieties: more then either Iewish or Popish superstition: a new Idol: noisome doctrines, tending to schisme and sedition:</hi> yea, <hi>hereticall assertions.</hi> Let such an one take heede, how he raile vpon Gods ordinance and institution, which can not be too much honoured: and howsoeuer he may turne his penne in his heat against his brethren, let him not oppose himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

It must be considered, that before this Samuel and Saul went to Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, where the kingdome was renued, c. 11. and where Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el made his apologie c. 12. but Samuel did not meane that going to Gilgal: for he saith, thou shalt goe downe before me to Gilgal,<note place="margin">Reconcil.</note> c. 10.8. but then Samuel was the first, that made the motion to goe to Gilgal, c. 11.14. and as yet Saul was not fully established in his kingdome: he meaneth therefore, that after he was confirmed king, he should goe downe to Gilgal, Samuel beeing not then present with him: and so beeing in Gilgal, he should stay for the Prophet seuen daies, to receiue further direction from him.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that Sauls sinne at this time was his diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and distrust in Gods helpe and assistance, because the people fell away from him, as though the Lord could not saue as well with few, as with many: for the like fault Moses was not suffered to goe into the land of Canaan, because he doubted of Gods power, and beleeued him not, when he smote the rocke. <hi>Pellican.</hi> but there was an other speciall sinne beside, which Samuel chargeth him with, because he had broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God. 2. Again, it may be thought, that Saul had an euill opinion of Samuel, that he failed in his promise, and forgot the time which he had appointed: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he might haue reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, how faithfull Samuel had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe hitherto, that all which he had said came accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to passe: <hi>Pellican.</hi> but this was not all the cause, vpon the former reason, Saul had transgressed against some speciall commandement of God. 3.

                  <hi>10. Quest. v. 13.</hi> Of these words: for now the Lord had established thy kingdome vpon Israel for euer.</head>
               <p>Seeing according to Iaakobs prophesie, the kingdome was to remaine in Iudah vntill Shiloh came: howe then did the Lord purpose to establish the kingdome in Saul: to answer this doubt: 1. Some answer, that by <hi>euer</hi> is vnderstood a long time, that if Saul had beene obedient vnto Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, the Lord would haue setled the kingdome in his house for a long season: <hi>sic Ben Gerson, Vatab. Osiand.</hi> which might afterward haue come to Dauid: but this can not be said in respect of Gods purpose and decree: for as he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that Iudah should haue the gouernment, so the Lord also had set downe the time, and decreed what person, who, and when should be first king of Iudah. 2. Therefore some by <hi>euer,</hi> vnderstand, during all Sauls life, all his daies, as Hannah saith, that Samuel should abide before the Lord for euer, c. 1.22. <hi>Iun.</hi> But this is not the meaning: for both Saul continued king all his daies, though with much trouble and vexation: and Dauid though anointed, yet confesseth Saul, while he liued, to be the Lords anointed: as also euen in this sense, if it be referred to the externall purpose of God, there should follow an alteration in God, in making Dauid king sooner then he had purposed. 3. Therefore the best exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that God speaketh here to the capacitie, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the sight and iudgement of man, that Sauls kingdom had beene likely to continue, if he had not disobeied God: that then is here propounded as an effect of Sauls disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the losse of the kingdome, which indeede was according to the euerlasting decree of God: so as <hi>Pellican</hi> well saith, <hi>loquitur humano more, &amp; vt videri poterat stabiliri regnum:</hi> he speaketh after an humane manner, and as his kingdome
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20715:51"/>
might haue seemed to vs likely to haue beene established. The like speech we had before, c. 2.30. <hi>I had said, that thine house, and the house of thy father, should walke before me for euer, but now the Lord saith it shall not be so.</hi> As there though God had foreseene and decreed the reiecting of Eli his house from the Priesthood, who was of Ithamar, and the restitution of Eleazars posteritie in Zadock, yet the Lord so propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, as though this alteration had beene procured by the sinne of Eli his house: the very like is here to be saide of the innouation and change of the kingdome. Gods purpose then is to be considered, as decreed in his counsell, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies certaine and vnchangeable, and as it is propounded to vs: absolute and definite in it selfe, but yet offered vnto vs with condition: to God there is nothing contingent or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by chance: to man, whose will is not compelled, but worketh freely, many things seeme to be contingent, which God notwithstanding did foresee should so fall out, and they could not otherwise. 4. Further it is to be considered, that there were two causes of the casting off and reiecting of Saul, the one the immediate and the next cause, which was the sinne and disobedience of Saul; the other, the first cause and furthest off, the will and decree of God: this will and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God, did impose no necessitie vpon Saul, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he forced, but sinned voluntarily: for Gods presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence laieth no necessitie simply vpon mens actions, but by consequent, because whatsoeuer God foreseeth shall come to passe: his prescience can not be deceiued and frustrate.</p>
               <p>Now then seeing the sinne of Saul was the cause of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, which he was not forced by any necessitie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and if he had not sinned, his kingdome might haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: Therefore this is not spoken in respect of Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable decree, but in regard of the outward possibilitie and likelihood, which Saul had to hold the kingdome. So it is said, Apoc. 2.15. <hi>Hold that thou hast, least an other take thy crowne:</hi> where wee are not to vnderstand the euerlasting crowne decreed of God, which none can be depriued of to whome it is assigned: but that crowne, which in respect of their outward profession and good beginning, they might seeme to be appointed vnto: the like occasion there is of Sauls kingdome here. <hi>Mart.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Dauid was a man that fell into tentation, and offence before God, as in the matter of Vriah: for it is saide, that the thing which Dauid had done, displeased the Lord, c. 11.27. This therefore is to be vnderstood, first comparatiuely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Saul:<note place="margin">Reconcil.</note> as Samuel saith, c. 15.28. <hi>The Lord hath giuen it to thy neighbour, that is better then thou:</hi> as also, because Saul was an hypocrite, he had not a sound and faithfull heart vnto God, but all his obedience was in outward pretense and shew, but Dauids heart and desire was set to please God, howsoeuer he failed in some outward acts: therefore this saying must be expounded according to that rule of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle: <hi>if first there be a willing minde, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi> Dauid then had a willing and desirous heart to please God: as he saith, <hi>My heart is fixed, my heart is fixed,</hi> Psal. 57.7. and therefore God accepted of his obedience, though imperfect, according to the desire and meaning of his heart. 2. But herein Dauid was a type of Christ, who was indeed absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to Gods heart, in whome the Lord is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. <hi>Borr.</hi> 3. And in that Dauid of Iudah of deformed Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, not of beautifull Rachel, was chosen to be king, and the Messiah was to come of Dauid of Leah: this shewed the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of Christs deformitie as it were in his sufferings, and specially in his passion vpon the Crosse: as the Prophet Isai saith, <hi>He had neither forme nor beautie, when we shall see him, there shall be no forme, that we should desire him.</hi> Isa. 53.2. <hi>Bor.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh that the Philistims barred the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites from all vse of yron: but the text sheweth, that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto them the vse of yron instruments for their til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and husbandry, as shares, mattocks, pitchforks, v. 21. they onely suffered them to haue no warrelike weapons, nor yron smithes to make them any. 2. And further they allowed them not otherwise then with a file to sharpen their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of husbandrie: <hi>Pellican</hi> so vnderstandeth, that onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Philistims it was lawfull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to file their tooles: but that had not bin possible for them, from all parts of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and vpon euery occasion to goe downe to the Philistims, to set an edge vpon their instruments: therefore when they would new sharpen or point their shares, or mattocks, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther instruments, which could not be done without new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of them, they went to the Philistims, for they had no smiths of their owne: and they bought of the Philistims all their yron implements for husbandrie, but a file to make a shift to sharpen them, they were allowed. 3. Thus we see into what seruitude Israel was brought, altogether destitute of outward weapons, that the glorie of the victorie should onely redound vnto God. <hi>Genevens.</hi> 4.

               <p>The doubt here is, because not long before, c. 11. they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a great victorie against the Ammonites, how the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could be without weapons here. 1. <hi>Chimchi</hi> thinketh, that they had their old weapons, but they made them new. 2.

This mentioning of Ahiah will helpe vs to vnderstand that place, c. 7.2. of the twentie yeares re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of the Arke in Kiriathiearim: that it is to be taken of the time, which went before the election of Saul, and that act of the Prophet there declared in calling the people to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: for Ahiah could not be high Priest vnder 25. yeare old now in the beginning of Sauls raigne: vnder those yeares he was not, but it is likely he was much aboue: for Abiathar his sonne not many yeares after this ministred in the Priests of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. c. 23.9. This Ahiah was nephew vnto Ichabod borne at the death of Eli, c. 4.21. who was then vnborne, or very young: then it must be needs aboue twentie yeares between the death of Eli, and the election of Saul. Further hence it may be coniectured, that Samuel could not be so young, as some Hebrewes imagine, not elder then 52. yeares when he died: for he knew all these high Priests, first Eli, and vnder him Phinehes his sonne, then Ahitub, after him Ahiah, and after him Abiathar, that fled vnto Dauid: all these to haue

Further, there was a spirituall reason hereof: for if they said, <hi>come vp vnto vs,</hi> as in boasting and insolent manner, as insulting ouer them, as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah did ouer Dauid, then Ionathan was perswaded, that God who resisteth the proud, would also fight against them, and abate their pride: <hi>Borr.</hi> and further in that Ionathan taketh their going vp the steepe rockes rather to be a signe of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then the Philistims comming downe to them: it sheweth that the way of Gods seruants is hard, difficult, and laborious, not easie and pleasant. <hi>Borr.</hi> 5. <hi>Iosephus</hi> seemeth to giue an other likely reason of this signe: because the Philistims were confident vpon the defense of the place, thinking that none durst ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>18. Quest. v. 41.</hi> Whether Ionathan sinned in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his fathers oath and vow ignorantly.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that Ionathans offence was for that he went aside from the campe without the priuitie and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his father, which might haue brought the whole hoast into great danger. <hi>Pellican.</hi> But therein Ionathan offended not, because he did it by the extraordinarie motion of Gods spirit, as it may appeare by his confidence and firme trust in God: v. 6. and by Ionathans confession it appeareth, his heart gaue him, it was for that he had broken the oath, and eaten a little honie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others doe altogether excuse Ionathan, that he was not taken for any crime he had committed, but that his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie might appeare, and the vnlawfulnes of his fathers oth: <hi>Borr.</hi> and whereas Saul praieth, <hi>giue a perfect lot; Iunius</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>giue him that is innocent and entire:</hi> and so God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his request, brought out by lot Ionathan that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: so also <hi>Osiand.</hi> But this seemeth not to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: rather, as the <hi>Chal.</hi> interpreteth, that God would giue <hi>sortem veram,</hi> a true lot: to cause it to fall on him that had broken the oath: <hi>Genevens.</hi> the <hi>perfection</hi> or <hi>integritie,</hi> which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20715:59"/>
Saul desireth might appeare, is not referred to the guiltines or clearing of the partie, but to the manifestation of the thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore neither is their interpretation to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that thinke Saul praieth that he which was faultie might come to light: <hi>Vatab. Ioseph.</hi> as though Ionathan had beene more faultie then Saul: which was not like, because Ionathan ignorantly brake the oath and vow of his father, neither gaue consent vnto it. <hi>Osiand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But as Ionathan is not to be held to haue beene the speciall offender, whome God here shooteth at, as he did vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like occasion bring Achans sinne to light, Iud. 7. so neither is he to be altogether excused: for although it be a sinne to make a rash oath and vowe at the first, yet it is a fault also to breake euen such a rash oath, and yet a greater sinne it is to keepe it with greater inconueniencie and hurt: and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance though it doth qualifie the offence, yet it doth not altogether iustifie it: <hi>ignorantia excusat à tanto, non à tot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

We must therefore yeild Ionathan to haue beene somewhat faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in breaking the oath, though ignorantly, because the lots fell out iust, but yet Saul more faultie in making it: for the Lord doth not by this lot shew who was most faultie, but who it was that had broken the oath, which was the thing which Saul earnestly requested. But though Ionathan were somewhat touched in this action, as his owne heart doth misgiue him: (which two arguments of the disposing of the lots, and his owne confession shew, that he was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cleare) yet this was not Gods principall intendiment, to discouer the offence of Ionathan, as to lay open Sauls hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie by that meanes, which had endammaged his owne sonne, and troubled the hoast, and hindred the victorie: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so God by this meanes would humble Ionathan, least he might haue beene puffed vp too much with the ioy of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie: and further it must be considered, that as God by lot brought Ionathan to light, and so into this danger, yet he had prouided also a meanes, whereby Ionathan should escape it, by the mediation of the people.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:20715:59"/>5. But although it be graunted that Ionathan was faultie, yet offending <hi>materially,</hi> in respect of the thing done, not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> in regard of any such minde or purpose which he had: yet this example prooueth not, that rash vowes, as of forced chastitie, and other such superstitious iniunctions, as to goe in pilgrimage to Ierusalem, or such like, are better kept then violated: it is an offence for a man euen to breake a vowe, which is not in his power to keepe, in regard of his rashnes,<note place="margin">Controv. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rash vowes once made, be not better bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken then kept.</note> that made such a vow, and so dallying as it were with God, but it is a greater sinne to keepe such a vow, to greater mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe: as if a man hath vowed not to marrie, if he doe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he offendeth, because of his former rashnes; but he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth double, if keeping his vow, he falleth thereby into adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie. Iipthah had done best of all, if he had not made so rash a vow, to offer whatsoeuer came first to meete him, for a dog or vncleane beast might haue beene the first, as well as his daughter: but the vow beeing made, it had beene better for him, not to haue kept his vowe, but to haue redeemed it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law, which appointeth redemption, both for men and women, that are consecrated vnto God, Leuit. 27.3, 4. yet had it beene an offence also in Iipthah, in not kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his vowe, his former rashnes considered, though his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersight was greater in performing it contrarie to the law.

               <p n="1">1. Some thinke that this was a great preheminence of the Israelites, that God vouchsafed to giue them answers, when they asked counsell of him, which direction Christians now haue not. But their state and ours considered, this was no preheminence, but rather a supporting of their weaknes: for they consulted with God, either for direction, to know what they should doe: but that is not now needefull, seeing the word of God is a sufficient rule vnto vs: or els to know, what successe they should haue in their busines: this was necessarie for them then, that their religion should be confirmed by such signes: and they were but one nation, and all the world was against them: therefore such sensible presence of the Lord among them was necessarie. But now the faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20715:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath beene alreadie sufficiently confirmed by miracles: and some of all nations belong vnto the Church: therefore there is not now such cause of the Lords visible manifesting of himselfe. <hi>Mar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And though the Lord heareth Saul, it was not for any efficacie in his praiers beeing voide of faith: but because the Lord doth challenge vnto himselfe the ordering of lots, as the marriners lots in Ionas shippe, though they were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, fell out iust, when they cried vnto God, because that which they asked, was agreeable to Gods will, and the Lord would reape glorie by it. So in this place the Lord doth that which Saul desired, not because he asked it, but for that God intended some further worke thereby: as the humbling of Ionathan, and the reuealing of the hypocrisie of Saul. <hi>ex Martyr.</hi>

                  <hi>20. Quest.</hi> Whether Saul or Ionathan were the greater offenders, seeing Ionathan was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by lot.</head>
               <p n="1">1. It is cleare, that Saul had trespassed more: in making such a rash vow at the first, giuing occasion to the people to sinne in eating of blood: further, he sweareth thrice vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly: first, when he made the vow, againe, when the Lord would not answer him, and the third time, after Ionathan was discouered: three times did he thus sweare, that he should die. Now Ionathans ouersight is excused two waies, by his necessitie that vrged him to eate, and his ignorance that did hide it from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet it pleased God, that Ionathans slippe should be discouered for these causes: 1. if Saul beeing king had beene pointed out by lot, it would somewhat haue empaired the credit of the king: 2. it was a greater griefe vnto Saul, then if he himselfe had beene taken: for no man could haue execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the sentence vpon him: 3. by this meanes some thinke, that God would establish militarie discipline, that orders made in armies should be strictly obserued: 4. and though Ionathan sinned of ignorance, yet it was fitte it should be purged.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Saul sheweth his hypocrisie, in that he neglecteth Gods commandement, which the people had transgressed in eating of blood: but he presseth obedience to his owne
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20715:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
law euen vnto death. So among the Romanists, he that spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth against their superstitious rites, is punished vnto death: whereas adulterie, blasphemie, and other greater enormities, are either not at all, or very lightly punished. <hi>ex Martyr.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Saul in taking an oath, wishing that God should doe so and so to him, if Ionathan died not: both shewed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane custome of swearing and cursing, to the which it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth he was much giuen: <hi>Iun.</hi> as likewise his vnnaturall cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie ioyned with vaine glorious ambition, in hardening his heart against his owne sonne, whome rather he should haue sought meanes to deliuer from this daunger: <hi>Osiand.</hi> but this oath and curse did in the ende fall vpon his owne head. <hi>Iun.</hi> 2. The people oppose a iust oath against his hypocriticall oath: <hi>Borr.</hi> and doe charge his conscience before God, that he should rather haue respect vnto equitie, then vnto his rash oath: <hi>Iun.</hi> and they vse two reasons, why Ionathan should not die: first that he was found guiltie of no capitall offence, in saying, <hi>shall Ionathan die,</hi> that is, in whome there is found no cause of death: <hi>Borr.</hi> secondly, because he by whom God had wrought such deliuerance, was not worthie of death: <hi>Iun.</hi> it was not fit, that he should die, by whose meanes they were all aliue. <hi>Osiand.</hi> 3. <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh, the people were mooued by pitie and commiseration toward Ionathan, when they saw that he willingly yeilded himselfe to death: but it seemeth rather by Ionathans answer, <hi>I tasted a little honie, and loe shall I die?</hi> that he thought his fathers sentence vniust and hard against him: and was discontented with it. 4. If the people interceded by their praier, they offended not: but if they pressed violently vpon Saul, in making a mutinie, they can not be excused. <hi>Mar.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Some doe number this among Sauls vertues, that he had but one wife: <hi>&amp; fere solus non multiplicasse vxores legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> and he is found alone almost of all the kings not to haue multiplied wiues: <hi>Pellican.</hi> the same author saith, that excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the persecution of Dauid, which was for the kingdome, <hi>meliores Israelitae reges paucos habuerunt,</hi> the Israelites had few better kings. But he faileth in both these commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Saul. First, concerning his wife, though he be read to haue but one, no more is there mention made but of one wife of Ieroboam. 1. king. 14.1. As Ieroboam notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20715:61"/>
with his one wife, is not to be preferred before Salomon with his many wiues, no more doth Sauls monogamie ioyned with many vices, obscure Dauid with his polygamie beeing endued with many vertues: Dauid transgressed in two great sinnes against the second table, but Saul beside his murders and other trespasses against the second table, chiefly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his hypocrisie, disobedience, and rebellion against God in the breach of the first table: so that in these two examples it is euident, that the sinnes against the first table which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth our dutie toward God, are more grieuous in their kind and degree, then the sinnes committed against the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table: but in this comparison, the great transgressions of the first table, must be set against the greatest of the second, not that the least offence of the first table, is heauier then the greatest of the second: as that it is more hainous to worke vpon the Lords day, then to commit adulterie, or to kill a man: but Idolatrie is more grieuous then either: the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison then must be in the same degree, or els it holdeth not. But to returne to Saul, what though he had but one wife, yet he had a concubine beside Rispah, by whome he had two children, 2. Sam. 21.8. which was all one, as if he had two wiues, nay in those daies, when for the carnall generation of that people, polygamie was tolerated, or rather winked at, it was worse.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there were other great enormities in Saul, beside his persecuting of Dauid, as the putting to the sword of the innocent Priests with their whole citie: the seeking vnto witches: beside his hypocrisie and disobedience toward God, that many worse can not be found, setting Idolatrie aside, which Saul was not touched with, in all the ranke of the kings of Israel: there were many morall and ciuill vertues in Saul, his valure and magnanimitie against the enemies of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, his blind zeale for the people of God: so are there to be found among the heathen, many worthie examples of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, iustice, temperance: which were in them but <hi>speciosa peccata,</hi> goodly sinnes, as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: and so were they in Saul: his goodly vertues in shew, were obscured with most foule vices.</p>

                  <hi>1. Quest.</hi> Why God is called the Lord of hoasts.</head>
               <p>GOd is called the Lord of hoasts, whome all the hoast and armies of the creatures, both in heauen and earth doe serue, and are at his becke: as Isa. 40.26. <hi>He bringeth out their armies by number, ond calleth them by their names.</hi> This title is giuen vnto God in Scripture, vpon foure principall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions. 1. To shew, that none other God is to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, beside the Almightie Creator and soueraigne Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all creatures: as c. 1.3. Elkanah is saide to worship and <hi>sacrifice vnto the Lord of hoasts:</hi> and this reason the Prophet Isai alleadgeth, c. 40.25. that they should not liken God to any thing, nor make any similitude of him: <hi>To whome will you liken me, &amp;c. behold, who hath created all these things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is vsed as a perswasion to obedience, that we should serue the Lord of hoasts, whome all creatures readily obey: as the Prophet reproouing the disobedience of the people of Israel, comparing them to a vineyard, that brought forth wild grapes, saith, <hi>The vineyard of the Lord of hoasts, is the house of Israel,</hi> Isa. 5.7. This vineyard should haue brought forth fruit vnto the Lord the husbandman thereof: as the great vineyard of the world, in so many hoasts and armies of the creatures, doth seruice vnto the great Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This title is giuen to God shewing his omnipotencie, and then vsed, when the seruants of God ground their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests vpon his power and abilitie to performe: as deuout Annah beeing barren, praying for a sonne, calleth God, Lord of hoasts, c. 1.11. to whome nothing was hard, or impossible.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This title sheweth the power of God, in iudging of his enemies: as Ier. 11.20. <hi>O Lord of hoasts, that iudgest righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, &amp;c. let me see thy vengeance vpon them.</hi> And in this sense is God called the Lord of hoasts, which now was determined to take reuenge of the Amalekites for the iniuries which they had done vnto his people, when they came out of Egypt. It might also assure Saul of Gods helpe and assistance against these enemies of God, seeing he did fight the battell of the Lord of hoasts.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his traditions, reporteth this to be the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of some Hebrewes, that the Amalekites did set vpon those, which were kept out of the campe for their vncleannes: and that they did cut off their circumcision in derision there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but the Amalekites rage was more generall, then onely to worke vpon a few seperated from the campe, for their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall impurities. 2. Therefore, there was a double assault of the Amalekites vpon the Israelites: one was subtill and secret, by laying waite for them by the way in smiting all the feeble persons among them, the women, children, old and impotent persons, that came hindmost in the campe: <hi>Pellican.</hi> as may be gathered, Deuter. 25.18. The other assault was publike, when they encountred with Ioshuah, and bid him battell, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 17. and so would haue letted and hindred them from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the land of Canaan. <hi>Osiand.</hi> 3. And this their cruell attempt against Israel, is amplified by two circumstances: first, because the Amalekites were not prouoked by any wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g or iniurie offered on the part of Israel: <hi>Pellican.</hi> the other, that they persecuted them, which were alreadie afflicted, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feeble and wearied with the way. <hi>Borr.</hi>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side it pleased God to make this an example of his vengeance vpon those, which deale cruelly with his people: <hi>Genevens.</hi> that as in a Common-wealth seueritie is iustly shewed vpon some, that all may receiue warning by it; so the Lord in the administration of the great Commonwealth of the world, doth exemplifie some for the instruction of others. 3. And as for Saul, it was no crueltie in him to execute Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:20715:63"/>
for although the second table say, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> yet because the second table is subordinate to the first, he is not guiltie of killing, whome the Lord biddeth kill, whom we are commanded in the first table to obey: <hi>Borr.</hi> like as the inferiour minister and executioner of iustice, transgresseth not the law, beeing appointed by the Magistrate to doe it. 4.

               <p n="1">1.

The reason is here rendred, why the Kenites are spared, because they shewed mercie to Israel: for Hobab the Kenite did aid them with his counsell, and guided and conducted them in the wildernesse. Exod. 18. Numb. 10.31. So the Amalekites are bequeathed to destruction for their inhumanitie, and vnkindnes toward Israel, and the Kenites for shewing kindnes are spared. 4.

               <p n="1">1. God properly is not said to repent, as man repenteth, as v. 29. it is said he repenteth not: but this is spoken to our capacitie, after an humane phrase. <hi>Iun.</hi> 2.

Man indeede chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth often, because as he himselfe is mutable, so are his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells: and because things may fall out otherwise, then he thought: but God is both of an immutable nature, and his prescience can not be frustrate or deceiued, neither can any thing fall out otherwise, then he hath decreed. <hi>Borr.</hi>

Sam. 6.23. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.

Of this strangenes betweene them there were two speciall causes: the one in Samuel, because he knew that the Lord had cast off Saul fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beeing king, and therefore he did forbeare to visit him in that familiar manner: <hi>Borr.</hi> the other was in Saul, who hated Samuel, because he had brought him such an heauie message, as the propertie of Tyrants is to loue and reward their flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and to hate their friends, that deale plainly with them, and tell them the truth. <hi>Pellican.</hi> 6. <hi>Iosephus</hi> is here decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, who saith, that Saul after this neuer came into Samuels sight: <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>l.</hi> 6. and yet as forgetting himselfe, <hi>c.</hi> 14. he repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that storie which followeth chap. 19. how Saul came to Ramah, where Samuel was, writeth how Saul prophesied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Samuel: <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de antiqu.

               <p n="1">1. He mourned not so much for Saul, because he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected and deposed from the kingdome, for he knew that the sentence of God was irreuocable, and that had beene, to be

                  <hi>2. Quest. v. 2.</hi> Whether Samuel went to offer sacrifice or to celebrate onely a feast.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Iunius</hi> (all the other Interpreters here translating the word <hi>zabach,</hi> to sacrifice) readeth, <hi>ad celebrandum convivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um: to celebrate a feast:</hi> his reasons are these. First, because in the most corrupt times, it was not lawfull to sacrifice, but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:20715:70"/>
where the Arke was, sauing in the high places: secondly, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were publike, but this was priuate within Ishai his house: thirdly, it may be added, Ishai is inuited to the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, whereat the Priests onely and the Ministers of the altar were present. But to these obiections it may be answered: first, that though ordinarily, and when the Arke was setled, it was not lawfull to sacrifice any where els, then at the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle: yet by Gods extraordinarie direction, the Prophets did sacrifice other where, as Elias did, 1. king. 18. especially in those times, when the Arke and Tabernacle were asunder, as is before shewed: and there was greater libertie for peace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, then other sacrifices. c. 9. qu. 3. Secondly, though the feast after the sacrifice might be in Ishai his house, it is not necessarie to imagine, that the sacrifice also was there offered. Thirdly, Samuel biddeth them not to the sacrifice it selfe, but to the feast after the sacrifice, as the <hi>Chalde</hi> translateth, and <hi>Iosephus</hi> expoundeth, which is called the sacrifice, because the feast was made of the remainder of the peace offerings, and eucharisticall sacrifices. 2. Therefore their opinion seemeth more probable, which thinke that Samuel pretended to offer sacrifice: 1. because it is added, I am come to doe sacrifice <hi>to the Lord,</hi> which phrase sheweth that it was a sacred and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious act: 2. they are bidden also to sanctifie themselues, as by washing of their bodies and raiment, and by taking heede that they touch no vncleane thing, according to the law: <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and.</hi> 3. it had beene no sufficient excuse for so graue a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to say he went to keepe a feast: 4. neither had it beene necessarie for him to carie a bullocke with him to that ende: but to sacrifice with, it was fittest to take a bullocke, which was seperated before and sequestred to that ende: 5. beside the religious vse &amp; practise of the Prophet sheweth as much, whose custome was to begin the waightie and graue affaires of the kingdome with sacrifice, as he did at the first designe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Saul to be King, c. 9. and at his solemne inauguration, c. 11. <hi>Pellican.</hi>

               <p>Three things doe excuse, or rather iustifie Samuels act here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. 1. In respect of the author of this counsell, which was God, who commandeth not sinne to be done, neither is the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20715:70"/>
author of any euill: Samuel therefore no more lied beeing bidden thus to say by the Lord, then he can be saide to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit murther, whome the Lord biddeth to kill. 2. The ende is to be considered, it is vnlawfull to lie or dissemble of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, to the hurt of our brother: but this semblance here vsed by Samuel, brought no such inconuenience with it, none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued any hurt by it. <hi>Osiand.</hi> 3. But most of all, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this action doth make Samuels excuse lawfull: for he telleth no vntruth, but onely concealeth some part of the truth: for indeede he sacrificed, but that was not the chiefe nor onely end of his comming: and thus in great and waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie affaires to conceale somewhat, and not to vtter all, it is prouidencie, not hypocrisie. <hi>Pellican.</hi> So the Prophet Ieremie beeing asked by the Princes what communication he had with the King, onely telleth them, that he had entreated him, that he might not returne to Iehonathans house to die there, but the rest of the conference he vttered not.

Sam. 5.6. But it is not like that Dauid at eight or ten yeare old, could doe such exploits, as the killing of the Lyon and beare, which immediatly followed, and the subduing of Goliah: and not long after this he receiued the sword of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah of the high Priest, to vse as his weapon, which sheweth, that he was both of strength, and stature: he was also the kings sonne in law before Samuel died. c. 22.14. 2. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thinke their opinion more probable, that take Dauid at this time to haue beene about 23. yeares old: <hi>Pellican.</hi> and so would haue as many yeares betweene Dauids first anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by Samuel, and his second anoynting by the men of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah in Hebron, 1.

                  <hi>9. Quest. v. 13.</hi> Whether Dauid were anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before his brethren.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that he was not, and whereas it is saide in the text, that Samuel anointed him in the middes of his brethren, they expound it thus; that he anointed one among the brethren: <hi>Vatab.</hi> that is, the last of all the brethren. <hi>Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.</hi> But beside that the phrase more properly giueth this sense, that in the middes of his brethren, that is, in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and before them Dauid was anointed: so the <hi>Septuag.</hi> translate <hi>bekereb,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the middes, and the <hi>Chald. inter,</hi> among: so much is gathered also out of the text, that all the brethren sate downe together at the feast, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth, as Samuel had said, vers. 11. <hi>We will not sit downe till he come hither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Iosephus</hi> further saith, that Samuel hauing placed Dauid next vnto him at the table, he should round him in the eare, that God had appointed him to be King, and forthwith pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the anointing oyle vpon him: but seeing he was anointed before his brethren, whereby Dauids brethren perceiued, what the Prophet intended, to what ende should he haue concealed the words? And further seeing the Israelites, when they anointed Dauid king, could repeate the wordes which Samuel vsed at his first anointing, which were these: <hi>The Lord hath said to thee, thou shalt feede my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captaine ouer Israel,</hi> 2. Sam. 5.2. it is like these wordes were not whispered in Dauids eare, for howe then should they come to the notice of all Israel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore some thinke it more probable, that Samuel both spak vnto him in the audience of his brethren, &amp; anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in their sight: yet they might not greatly regard it, nor thinke the Prophet did it seriously, but contemned it, as appeareth by Eliabs vnkinde entertainment of Dauid in the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20715:72"/>
campe after this, c. 17.28. Like as Iosephs brethren regarded not his dreames, but Iaakob onely laide them to his heart: neither would the Pharisies and Iewes acknowledge Christ, of whome Dauid was a type, for their Messiah and King. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4.

And if all Dauids brethren had beene acquainted with this secret, it could not haue beene kept from Saul: seeing as it appeareth by Eliab, they were enuious against Dauid. <hi>Mart.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="1">1. Some thinke it is called <hi>the euill spirit of the Lord,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God also was the creator of them, yet not as they are euill: <hi>Vatab.</hi> but whereas two phrases are here vsed, an euill spirit from the Lord, and an euill spirit of God; the meaning appeareth to be, that it is called the euill spirit of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was sent of God. 2. Some here speake of permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that God suffered the euill spirit to come vpon Saul to vexe him: <hi>Vatab.</hi> but the phrase, from the Lord, importeth more then permission. 3. Some doe here vse a distinction, that both the good spirit, and the euill spirit are sent of God, and haue their power and commission from him, but with this difference, that the things which the good spirits of God worke, are of themselues pleasing and acceptable vnto God: but the things which the euill spirit enterpriseth, are not of themselues to Gods liking, as they are wrought by Sathan, but as they make for the manifestation of Gods will, and the reuelation of his iust iudgement: in which respect they are said to be sent of God: <hi>Borr.</hi> so that the very wicked and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill spirits are at Gods commandement to execute his will. <hi>Genevens.</hi> 4. It will be obiected, that the punishing of sinne, and the execution of Gods iudgements, is a thing pleasing vnto God, &amp; therefore Sathans worke and ministerie should be to his liking: to this I answer by a double distinction: first, the worke it selfe is to be considered, then the worker: for the worke, the Lord is more enclined to mercie then to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the works of mercie are more peculiar vnto God, then the workes of iudgement: therefore when the Lord pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth,<note place="margin">Of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the good and euill spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:20715:73"/>
&amp; they are chiefly emploied in punishing of the wicked: but Sathan is vsed both in punishing them, and in chastising also and trying the seruants of God, as we haue <hi>Iob</hi> for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Secondly, concerning the worker, the seruice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is acceptable vnto God, because they doe it both wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and to a good ende, beeing mooued with a zeale vnto Gods glorie, but Satan is forced against his will many times, and what he doth, though God turne it to his glorie, yet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than doth it of malice and enuie vnto man, and therefore his seruice and ministerie is not absolutely accepted and pleasing vnto God. 5. Further, there is a double worke to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the euill ministring spirits, for either they are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of outward punishments onely, as in vexing and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the bodie, so they worke by <hi>immission,</hi> and sending fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, or they also egge and tempt vnto euill, so they worke onely by the <hi>permission</hi> and sufferance of God: <hi>Borr.

               <p n="1">1.

This therfore was Sauls maladie, first the conscience of his sinne troubled him: <hi>Borr.</hi> then he was tormented with the spirit of enuie and ambition, beeing grieued with the losse of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and by this vexation of his minde, he fell into furie and phrensie: <hi>Pellican.</hi> further Sathan thus disquieting his minde, did worke also vpon the distemperature of his bodie, and his melancholy passions might helpe thereunto: <hi>Pellican.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, Sathan as <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh, might vexe for the time and torture his bodie, that he seemed sometime to be as it were

               <p n="1">1. Because it is saide, that Saul should finde ease, by the playing with the hand vpon the harpe, and that when Dauid plaied, the euill spirit departed, we must not thinke, that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall soundes and melodie haue any force to driue away e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills, <hi>Pellican.</hi> no more then it was like, that Tobie draue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the deuil with the perfume of the broyled liuer of a fish: for, as the Apostle saith, <hi>The weapons of our warrefare are not carnall,</hi> 2. Cor. 10.4. spirituall euills are not chased away with carnall meanes. Such a like conceit there was in time of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of bells, that the sound of them was good to purge and cleare the aire of euill spirits. 2. But Musike hath a wonderfull force, in working vpon the affections: either to stirre them vp, if it be loud and running musike, such as is vsed in warre, or to allay them by soft and sober musike: as <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> is saide by such musike to haue restored a frantike young man to his witts: so <hi>Terpander, Arion,</hi> and <hi>Ismenias</hi> the Thebane musician, are reported to haue reduced barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and sauage men, to a ciuill kinde of life. <hi>Borr.</hi> 3. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids pleasant harmonie therefore first naturally allayed Sauls melancholy passions, and cheared and reuiued his dead and pensiue spirits, which were the instruments of Sathans wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. <hi>Pellican.</hi> 4. And beside this, Dauid by his godly songs and praiers did also preuaile to chase away the euill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that concurred with that naturall distemperature in Saul: as <hi>Iosephus</hi> well noteth, that Dauid with his voice and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did sing sacred hymnes: the sound of the musike allaied the naturall passion, the voice of the sacred hymne did cause an intermission of Sathans worke. 4. Here in this Dauid was
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20715:74"/>
a true type and figure of the very Messiah, by whose sweete voice many deuills were cast out in the daies of his flesh, and nowe by the voice of his Gospel Sathan is cast out of the soules and hearts of men: not for a time, as out of Saul, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe, but he is for euer vanquished and subdued vnto vs. 5. But howsoeuer Dauids musike were effectuall for the time present, this was but an easing of Saul for the time, it was no perfect cure: wherein appeareth the carnall counsell of Sauls seruants, that onely prouided for his corporall ease, not seeking for his spirituall comfort: they should first haue sent for Samuel the Lords Prophet, to haue praied for Saul, and comforted him in God, and then haue prouided a musici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an for his recreation. <hi>Osiand.</hi> Much like vnto them, are such carnall friends and assistants of them that are sicke in these daies, who first counsell them to seeke out vnto the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, the Minister and man of God, is the last that is consulted with for the health of their soules. 6. Yet herein they deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued commendation, that though they sawe euidently that Saul was vexed with an euill spirit, yet they did not seeke to expell one deuill with an other, or to runne vnto witches, as many in these daies vse to doe,<note place="margin">Against running to witches.</note> therein shewing their great impietie and infidelitie against the Lord: from which kind of deuillish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> professours Saul was alwaies auerse, and euen after his falling away, did banish such out of Israel: which example may be a good admonition vnto such witchmongers, that if Saul not in Gods fauour, yet hated sorcerers, they can not thinke that they are in Gods fauour, louing those whome the Lord hateth.</p>

                  <hi>5. Quest. v. 10.</hi> Of Goliaths chalenge, that prouoked Israel to fight hand to hand.</head>
               <p>This kind of chalenge is much displeasing vnto God, as proceeding of pride, and tending vnto mischiefe: 1. which vse of putting the triall of the common cause vpon the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of two, or some few, was taken vp first among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: as the Romanes and the Albani did set out each of them three champions, that by their aduenture, the generall cause of both nations should be swaied or carried, which of them should haue dominion ouer the other, and which of them should be in subiection. 2. And for the most part it is found by experience, that they which prouoke and challenge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to such kind of single combates, which are called <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomachies,</hi> are foiled, and goe by the wurse. So Abner prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Ioab to set out some of his men to fight, which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth playing, (and vpon his motion twelue were sent out of each side) was put to the wurse: likewise in the same place and at the same time, Asahel pursuing Abner, and prouoking him, whome he instantly entreated to giue ouer, and not to vrge him, was slaine by Abner. 2. Sam. 2. The like successe had the gyants of the Philistims, which chalenged Israel in the daies of Dauid: Abishai slew Ishibenob: Sibbechai en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred Saph, and Elhanah, Lahmi the brother of Goliath, and Ionathan ouercame a gyant, with sixe fingers and toes vpon each hand and foote, fowre and twentie in all: all which were champions set forth by the Philistims to chalenge Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, 2. Sam. 23. 3. The reasons why such monomachies are vnlawfull, are these. 1. Such doe tempt God, wilfully offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themselues to daunger: as it is found among the decrees ascribed to Nicolaus I. <hi>Monomachiam sectantes tentant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, They which follow monomachie doe tempt God:</hi> and this Canon is repeated in the decrees, <hi>part.</hi> 2. <hi>caus.</hi> 2. <hi>qu.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 22. 2. Such are lifted vp in pride, and doe boast of their strength. 3. Men in this case are hired and waged to be champions, and so they set their life to sale. 4. They encounter together rashly &amp; in rage, and so many times end their daies in wrath and malice, which is a most fearefull thing.<note place="margin">What is to be thought of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomachies, that is, of sole and singular combates.</note> 5.

                  <hi>7. Quest. v. 15.</hi> Why Dauid was sent backe from Saul to feede his fathers sheepe.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Iunius,</hi> who thinketh that this storie is transposed, and that Dauid had first killed Goliath, before he went to serue Saul; thus readeth, that <hi>Dauid went and came from Sauls companie, or retinue:</hi> that is, during this battell he often went and came beeing sent of his father to visit his brethren in the campe. But this is not like, that Dauid was sent vnto the campe before that time, when he encountred with Goliath: for then he could not choose but to haue heard the boasting speeches of the vaine glorious Philistim before, seeing he came forth morning and euening, and all the hoast did ring of it: and the word beeing <hi>meghal,</hi> which signifieth, <hi>de cum, from with Saul,</hi> sheweth rather that Dauid was come from beeing with, or following of Saul. 2. Therefore the meaning rather is, that Dauid who had gone before to Saul, and was entertained of him, at this time was returned home to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which some thinke was done, because Saul was now recouered of his madde fitts, and had no neede of him, and so sent him home againe: <hi>Osiand.</hi> but it appeareth to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, c. 18.10. that Saul was not cured of his fitts, which came vpon him againe: some thinke therefore, that Saul sent Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid away by turnes, as his fits intermitted, and so sent for him againe: <hi>Borr.</hi> but that is not like, for Saul entertained him into his seruice, and made him his armour bearer, which sheweth that he staied still with Saul, and went not away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time: therefore it is more likely that these two were the causes of Dauids returne, first because during this warre, Saul attended rather vpon warrelike feates, then musicall sounds, and therefore was content to dismisse Dauid: <hi>Pellic.</hi> his minde beeing wholly bent vpon warre, was not so much disquieted with other cogitations: As also, because Saul had three other of Ishai his sonnes, beeing content with them, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> noteth, he sent home Dauid to be a comfort to his aged father. 3. Now herein Gods prouidence appeareth, that would not haue Dauid (whom he had appointed for the confusion of Goliath) to be brought vp in the feats of armes, but still to lead a rurall and pastorall life, that this victorie beeing atcheiued by so weake a meanes, might wholly be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed

Some thinke, that Eliab might speake thus of loue to Dauid, that hee should not put himselfe vpon so great a daunger: <hi>ex Martyr.</hi> but by the rough wordes which he vseth, and vntrue surmises, it is euident that Eliab spake of enuie, and with great indignation. 2. And this might
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:20715:80"/>
be the cause, why Eliab enuied Dauid, because he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to the kings seruice and court, and he beeing the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother was neglected. <hi>Martyr.</hi> 3. And Dauid is bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for that, wherein he was to be commended, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his flocke with a keeper for a time, at his fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, he came to visit his brethren: yea, he taketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to iudge Dauids heart and affection, imputing that to his pride and malice, which proceeded from the spirit of God in him. <hi>Martyr.</hi> 4. Thus Dauid first was enuied of his owne brethren, herein beeing a type of Christ, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected of the Iewes, beeing as it were the eldest brethren, and was receiued of the Gentiles. <hi>Pellican.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>15. Quest. v. 28. Of these words of Eliab to Dauid,</hi> With whome hast thou left those few sheepe in the wildernes? vpon what occasion it is lawfull for a Pastor to leaue his flocke.</head>
               <p>This care and charge which Dauid had of his flocke, doth (beeing morally applied) shew, what dutie is required of the spirituall Pastor toward his people, and what causes of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence are allowable, and when he ought not to be absent: First, that Pastors ought not long to absent themselues from their charges, but their necessarie occasions of absence bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once ouer, they are bound in conscience to returne to their places, these reasons grounded vpon the word of God, and agreeable to the continuall practise of the Church of Christ, doe euidently conuince.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Great is the daunger, which accrueth and groweth vnto the Pastors themselues, if any of those soules, which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to their charge, doe perish in their absence through their negligence: as the Prophet Esechiel sheweth, <hi>When I shall say vnto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt die the death, if thou dost not speake, and admonish the wicked of his way, that wicked man shall die for his iniquitie, but his blood will I require at thy hand:</hi> Esech. 33.8. I doe wonder how negligent Pastors, when they doe read this place, can passe it ouer without trembling, seeing what danger they incurre, in omitting to admonish the people committed vnto them: for as <hi>Hierome</hi> well saith, <hi>Detrimentum pecoris, ignominia pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storis:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:20715:80"/>
The losse of the flocke, is the shame of the shepheard:</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. <hi>ad Furiam.</hi> euen his euerlasting shame and confusion, without Gods great mercie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The absence and negligence of the Pastor, proceedeth from want of loue toward the flocke, and he which loueth not the flocke, loueth not him whose flocke it is: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sauiour saith to Peter, <hi>If thou louest me, feede my sheepe:</hi> and therefore <hi>Damasus</hi> said well, <hi>Omnis negligenter pascens toties sibi commendatum dominicum gregem, convinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur summum non amare pastorem:</hi> Euery one negligently feeding the Lords flocke, so often commended vnto him, is found not to loue the cheife shepheard. <hi>Damas. Epist.</hi> 4. And he that loueth not Christ, how can he be assured of Christs loue toward him againe?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the inconueniences be considered, which do grow by the Pastors absence, the people will soone fall away from zeale to coldnes, from vertue to vice: where good seede is intermitted to be sowen, thistles and weedes will spring vp in stead thereof. This the Apostle found by experience in the Church of the Galatians, while he was absent from them: as he saith, <hi>It is good to loue alwaies earnestly in a good thing, and not onely when I am present with you:</hi> and againe, <hi>I would I were present with you, that I might change my voice: for I am in doubt of you.</hi> Galat. 4.18.20. It seemeth, that while the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle was present, the Galatians were very forward and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but in his absence there zeale and first loue abated: and therefore he wisheth he were among them, that he might change and applie his voice to admonition, or exhortation, as euery mans case required. This is that which <hi>Ambrose</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, beeing vpon some necessarie occasion absent from his Church: <hi>Eram de vobis anxius, trepidus ne quis me absente per negligentiam caederet, ne quis diaboli insidijs laberetur:</hi> I was carefull for you, fearing least in mine absence any might fall through negligence, and slippe through the lying in waite of Sathan. <hi>serm.</hi> 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And <hi>Augustine</hi> complaineth, that while he was absent from Hippo, the citizens had lost a certaine godly custome among them, <hi>vestiendi pauperes,</hi> of cloathing and coating the poore. <hi>Epist.</hi> 138. Whereby it is euident, that good things will soone be discontinued, and grow out of vse, where the Pastoris not present to call vpon the people.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:20715:81"/>4. Adde hereunto, that the more diligent the spirituall aduersarie is, to spoile the flocke, the more carefull the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor should be to watch ouer it. Now the Deuill, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> saith, <hi>walketh about like a roaring lyon, seeking whome he may deuoure,</hi> 1. Pet. 5.8. And the wolfe then is most busie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade the flocke, when the Pastor is not neare at hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them. Therefore <hi>Saint Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I know this, that after my departure grieuous wolues shall enter in among you, not sparing the flocke.</hi> Act. 20.29. So <hi>Ambrose</hi> well saith, <hi>Lupi explorant pastoris absentiam, quia praesentibus pastoribus oves Christi incursare non possunt:</hi> The wolues doe watch the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors absence, because while the Pastors are present, they can not inuade the sheepe of Christ. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>in Luc.</hi> And verily what other cause can be yeilded, that in many places of this land, the people are corrupted in religion, and Seminarie Priests, and Iebusite Friers doe creepe in to peruert and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many, then the negligence and absence of many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors in their cures and charges.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Further, how necessarie the presence and residence of Pastors and Ministers in their Churches is, appeareth by the excellencie and price of that obiect, wherein their cure and charge lyeth: for they are watchmen not of mens bodies, but of their soules, and must giue account for them. Hebr. 13.17. If a steward and dispenser of things temporall must be faithfull, as Iacob did watch his flocke by day and night, and whatsoeuer perished he made it good, Gen. 31.39. how much more carefull, circumspect, and vigilant ought the dispenser of things spirituall to be? The Imperiall lawes haue prouided that Aduocates should not <hi>evagari,</hi> stray out of the cities and places where they practised. <hi>Cod. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>tit.</hi> 7. <hi>leg.</hi> 2. and for souldiers it is prouided, <hi>milites non tractent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liena negotia:</hi> They should not busie themselues with other mens affaires, but attend vpon their owne calling and charge. <hi>Cod. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>tit.</hi> 13. <hi>leg.</hi> 7. If they which doe but fight for mens bodies, and such as plead for mens goods, must giue such diligent attendance, much more is the same requisite in those, that are charged with mens soules. But now a daies, this at many hands is counted so ordinarie and easie a thing, to be the Pastor of soules, that a man will require more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence at his seruants handes about his cattell, then many
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20715:81"/>
doe performe in the feeding of soules: God, in his good time, open the eyes of such, that they may see the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which they by their negligence and carelesnesse cast themselues into: and that they may feele the heauie waight of the burthen of soules, that they may deliuer their owne soules.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Lastly, not to heape vp more arguments in so euident a matter: This is not the least thing, which should mooue Pastors to be resident among their people: because they giue great offence by their vnnecessarie absence, to the Church of God, as seeking rather to feede vpon them, then to feede them: as the Prophet Esechiel complaineth of such idle shepheards, <hi>Ye eate the fat, and cloath you with the wooll: ye kill them that are fedde, but ye feede not the sheepe.</hi> Esech. 34.3. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> saith to the Corinthians, <hi>I seeke not yours, but you.</hi> 2. Cor. 12.14. But such as care not for Christs flocke, doe euidently proclaime, that they seeke not them, but theirs. Of this kinde of scandall and offence, <hi>Augustine</hi> had experience in his people of <hi>Hippo:</hi> of whome he thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>Populus Hipponensis cui me deus servum dedit, ita est ex omni parte infirmus, vt pressura etiam levioris tribulationis poterit aegrotare, eum modo cum regressus sum, periculosè scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizatum comperi de absentia mea:</hi> The people of Hippo, whose seruant the Lord hath made me, is so altogether weake, that a little trouble is able to make them very sicke: I found them at my returne, dangerously scandalized with my absence. <hi>Epist.</hi> 7. If the people tooke offence at <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> necessarie absence: for without iust cause that holy man would not absent himselfe: much more grieuous is the offence, which is iustly giuen by vnnecessarie absence.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of lawfull and iust causes of the Pastors absence.</head>
                  <p>Now, whereas it hath been thus shewed, that the presence &amp; reside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Pastors is necessarie, both in respect of the great danger, which they incurre thereby, the cause thereof the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of loue, the inconueniences which growe vnto the people,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:20715:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the vigilancie of the spirituall aduersarie, the price and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of their charge concerning soules, and the publike of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and scandall, yet are there some occasions, which may lawfully draw the Pastor for a time from his people: and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially these fowre.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He may be absent for the publike seruice of the Church, as in beeing present in generall or provinciall Councells, in helping to settle and compound the variances and differences in other Churches, and such like profitable employments. As S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when a man of Macedonia appeared vnto him in a vision, saying, <hi>Come and helpe vs,</hi> tooke it for a sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for him to goe into Macedonia, to pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> the Gospel there, Act. 16.9, 10. So, (although in this behalfe the calling of Apostles and Pastors is much different, the one beeing not limited, the other tied to a charge) yet it is a good occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of absence, when the necessitie of other Churches calleth for helpe at some Pastors hands. As <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Non dubito fratres contristari vos, quotiescun<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> absentem me à vobis necessitas facit:</hi> I doubt not brethren, but that you are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when as necessitie maketh me absent from you. <hi>Ser.</hi> 39. And in an other place: <hi>Alterius Ecclesiae necessitatibus evoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, minime vobis solitum studium dependisse videor,</hi> beeing called forth by the necessarie busines of an other Church, I seeme not to haue bestowed on you my wonted care. <hi>Ser.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An other cause of absence is, when the Pastor perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally is sought for, and can not remaine among his flocke, without perill of his life, and when his sheepe are become wolues, to rise vp against their own shepheard. Dauid though accounted king ouer Israel, beeing personally pursued by Saul, with whome the Ziphims of his owne tribe conspired, 1. Sam. 23. fled out of the land: and <hi>S. Paul</hi> beeing sought for in Damascus, was let downe in a basket by a window. 2. Cor. 11.33. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> (whose life was sought for by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies the Arrians) did leaue his Church of Alexandria, and gaue way for the time, hiding himselfe for the space of sixe yeares in a drie cisterne, and fowre moneths in his fathers tombe: And he himselfe maketh this Apologie: <hi>Quis mihi mirabiliter &amp; divinitus erepto vitio vertat, quod non in manus me quaerentium reiecerim, &amp;c.</hi> Who can blame me beeing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously deliuered, that I did not cast my selfe into their
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20715:82"/>
hands which sought me. <hi>Tripart. hist. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 22. This occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of absence is allowed by the auncient practise of the Church: <hi>Si non suo vitio, sed plebis contradictione aberit à pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochia:</hi> If he be absent not by his owne default, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and opposition of the people. <hi>Antiochen. can.</hi> 18. Who doubteth therefore, but that those holy Confessours in the late daies of persecution in England, which fled out of the land, seeing the life of the Pastors and Ministers was cheifly sought for, therein were warranted to doe as they did, beeing by this meanes preserued by Gods prouidence for the restauration of the Church afterward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third lawfull cause of absence and discontinuance for a time is, for recouering the health of bodie: for many diseases are helped by the change of aire: and in this case it is lawfull for a man, if the place be such, as agreeth not with the state of his bodie, to leaue the charge altogether, beeing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto an other. This cause staied Epaphroditus from the Church of the Philippians, whome, as soone as he was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, <hi>S. Paul</hi> sent vnto them, that they might reioice when they saw him. Philip. 2.25.28. The Ecclesiasticall histories make mention of Sylvanus, who was made Bishop of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippolis in Thracia by Atticus Patriarke of Constantinople, but beeing of a thinne bodie, and not able to endure the colde of that countrey, was remooued from thence to Troas, in an hotter climate. <hi>Socrat. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 37.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A Minister or Pastor may vpon his necessarie priuate occasions lawfully for a time be absent, as in following neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie suits of law to defend his right, which require his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall attendance, or in attending vpon some court of iustice, where he is impleaded. So <hi>S. Paul</hi> by appeale was sent to Rome, there to make answer for himselfe before Cesar. The Canons of the Church were herein at the first very strict: first, it was not permitted that any of the Cleargie, <hi>ne propter cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam suam quamlibet intraret in curiam,</hi> for any cause whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer should goe into any court. <hi>Concil. sub Silvest.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 16. Afterward more libertie was graunted, that they might goe vnto the Courts and places of iudgement, <hi>vt aut viduis &amp; pauperibus succurrant, aut de verbo dei iudices admoneant:</hi> to succour the widowes and poore, or to admonish Iudges of their dutie out of the word of God. <hi>Cabilonens. sub Carol. c.</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:20715:83"/>
11. And this libertie was further enlarged, that one might depart from his cure, <hi>maiorum authoritate inductus:</hi> beeing drawne and fetched by authoritie. <hi>Pelag.</hi> 2. <hi>Epist.</hi> 2. It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so decreed, <hi>Concil. Sardicen.</hi> that Priests and Deacons <hi>in Thessalonicoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> civitate non diutius morentur, quam constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta tempora per Episcopos:</hi> should stay no longer in the citie of Thessalonica, then the time appointed by the Bishops. They were permitted then to stay so long about their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as was thought fit, and was limited vnto them. But as these fowre necessarie occasions premised, doe excuse the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Pastors for a season: so yet they are limited and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined with these fowre restrictions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Pastor must see, that he pretend not a necessitie without necessitie: but it must be indeede a more vrgent cause, that draweth him from his vrgent busines at home: for the attending vpon his flocke is a necessarie thing, and it must not be intermitted but vpon a great necessitie: as <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> sheweth, <hi>Quoniam sic rebus vrgentibus detinemur, vt lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge isthinc excurrere: &amp; diu à plebe, cui de divina indulgentia praesumus, abesse non datur facultas:</hi> because we are so detei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with vrgent busines, that we can not goe farre away or be absent from the people, ouer the which God hath set vs. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>epist.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Pastor must prouide, that when necessitie calleth him from home, his absence may by others for that time be supplied, that the Church be not left destitute. This was <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines</hi> rule, <hi>They which in time of common daunger reserue themselues for better times, doe well; cum alij non desunt, per quos ministerium suppleatur, ne ab omnibus deseratur:</hi> when as others are not wanting, by whome the ministerie may be supplied, that the Church be not forsaken and left destitute of all. <hi>Epist.</hi> 180.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Augustine</hi> in the same Epistle seemeth to giue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caueat, propounding the example of Dauid; <hi>Ne se com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteret praeliorum periculis, &amp; lucerna in Israel extinguere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, à suis hoc petentibus sumpsit, non praesumpsit:</hi> Dauid that he should not offer himselfe to the daunger of battell, and so the light of Israel should be put out, he presumed not of himselfe, but assumed it as desired of the people. In such necessarie ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and discontinuance of the Pastor, the consent of the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20715:83"/>
people were fit to be had, though it be not alwaies necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: that as the Apostle would haue the man and wife, to be sequestred for a time the one from the other, but, <hi>yet with consent:</hi> 1. Cor. 7.5. so a mutuall consent in the absence of the Pastor from his Church, to the which he is as it were married and espoused, were requisite: and so lesse offence would be taken at it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This time of absence vpon the former iust occasions would not be long: as before the Apostle would not haue the married couple one to defraud an other, but <hi>for a time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Paucorum dieru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occupationibus detentus coetui vestro videor defuisse:</hi> beeing deteined from you by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of a few daies, I may seeme to haue beene wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto your assembly. <hi>Serm.</hi> 28. <hi>Sardicen. con. c.</hi> 14. it was decreed, <hi>Episcopus per tres dominicos non amplius absit ab Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia:</hi> that a Bishop, should not be absent aboue three Lords daies from his Church: meaning, whereas <hi>he was not by any vrgent necessitie deteined.</hi> And where there was cause of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the cause ceasing, they were eftsoone to returne to their charges. Now, as these causes before allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, may excuse the necessarie absence of Pastors, not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, but for a time: so these that follow, which by some may be pretended, are no sufficient allegations for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors absence.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Causes pretended by some, not sufficient to warrant or excuse the Pastors absence:</head>
                  <p n="1">1. When there is publike persecution raised against the Church in generall by hostile inuasion, the life of the Pastors beeing not personally sought, when as well the people are persecuted as the Pastor, in this case he is not to flie, and leaue his flocke: as Dauid when the Lyon and beare inuaded his flocke, did not turne his backe, and leaue them to be a pray, but manfully withstood them and deliuered his flocke. But where as our Sauiour biddeth his Apostles, when they were persecuted in one citie to flie vnto an other: <hi>Augustine</hi> wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answeareth, making a difference betweene personall and publike persecution: <hi>Fugiunt Christi servi, quod praecepit, seu permisit, cum eorum quivis specialiter à persecutoribus quaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:20715:84"/>
&amp;c.</hi> let the seruants of Christ flee, as Christ did command or permit, when any of them is specially sought for by the persecutors: <hi>In communi autem omnium periculo, qui indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, ne ab his quibus indigent, deserantur:</hi> but in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon danger of all, let not them which stand in neede be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of them, whome they haue neede of. <hi>August. epist.</hi> 180. For by this marke our Sauiour describeth an hireling, who when he seeth the wolfe comming, fleeth and leaueth the flocke. Ioh. 10.12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An other instance may be giuen of the plague and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence,<note place="margin">Whether it be lawfull for a Pastor in the time of pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to leaue his flocke.</note> when a contagious sicknes hath inuaded the parish, whether the Pastor in this case may not goe aside to preserue himselfe from daunger. In this case a difference must be made betweene priuate men, and such as beare publike of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the one beeing free, the other bound: for they which are not tied by any office or administration to attend vpon the Church or Common-wealth, may as freely escape from the pestilence by chaunging of place, as from the sword: but otherwise, neither the Pastor from his flocke, nor the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate from his gouernment, can with any better conscience flee away, then the husband from the wife, the father from the children: for all these are comprehended vnder the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles rule: <hi>Let euery man abide in the same vocation, wherein he is called,</hi> 1. Cor. 2.20. Therefore he which is called to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, rule, or teach, must not leaue his standing and charge, for that were to depart from his calling. <hi>Gregorie</hi> 3. did giue a good resolution in this case, writing thus to <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> who was desirous to be satisfied, whether in the time of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, they which were yet vntouched, might not escape from the daunger, <hi>fatuum hoc videtur, non enim valet quispi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Dei effugere manum:</hi> This seemeth a foolish part, for no man can escape Gods hand. Ecclesiasticall histories make mention, that in that great and contagious pestilence vnder Galienus, and afterward vnder Maximinus the Emperours, the Gentiles, and Christians were of farre vnlike behauiour: for the Gentiles left their dearest friends halfe dead and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, and suffered them to lie vnburied, and fledde away: but the Christians staied, performing all duties of charitie, not onely to themselues, but euen to the Gentiles, which were
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:20715:84"/>
forsaken of their nearest friends. <hi>Nicephor. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 28. <hi>Euseb. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Cyprian</hi> vpon this occasion, as it seemeth writ his booke <hi>de mortilitate,</hi> perswading Christians not to be afraid of the plague: and among other he vseth these three most notable perswasions. First, <hi>Mortalitas ista, vt Christi hostibus pestis est, ita Dei servis salutaris excessus est:</hi> this mortalitie, as it is a plague to the enemies of Christ, so it is an wholesome departure vnto the seruants of God. It skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, if a man be prepared, what death he dieth of, for he is sure howsoeuer he dieth, that he goeth vnto rest. Againe, saith he, <hi>mentes humani generis examinat, &amp;c.</hi> it examineth mens hearts, and trieth their charitie, whether masters will forsake their seruants, one kinsman an other, the physicians the sicke. God sendeth the pestilence to take triall of mens charitie, and faithfulnesse in their seuerall callings, which if the plague doe fray them from, a greater plague remaineth for them. Thirdly, <hi>Exercitia sunt nobis ista, non funera, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptu mortis praeparant ad coronam:</hi> these are not dead cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but liuely experiments vnto vs, by the contempt of death preparing vs to the crowne of martyrdome. By such and the like perswasions, that holy Martyr dealt with the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not for feare of the pestilence to forsake their duties and calling.</p>
                  <p>Therefore vpon the former reason it appeareth, that the plague or pestilence is no sufficient impulsiue, to driue the Pastor from his charge and calling. But whether the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is bound in particular personally to visit all, which are infected, it is an other question: wherein I incline rather to thinke that he is not so bound: 1. because he is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the whole congregation, which is to be attended vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he cannot doe without great daunger, if he goe to euery infected house. 2. he is to respect his owne fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not to bring them into daunger: which if he should be carelesse of to prouide for the safetie and good of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, herein he should come farre short of the very Infidels, and be much worse herein then they, as the Apostle insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, 1. Timoth. 5. 3. vnlesse God haue giuen vnto him such an especiall confidence and assurance, whereby he fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himselfe as it were called to this extraordinarie worke
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:20715:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of charitie, as some I confesse haue had, and may yet haue, it is presumption for a man to offer himselfe to the stroke of Gods Angel: seeing Balaams asse declined the way where the Angel stoode with a drawne sword: which sheweth, that where our speciall calling and dutie holdeth vs not, we may safely decline all occasions of danger.</p>

                     </gap> of absence is, that a man may haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers cures, and so can not yeeld his corporall presence and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance vnto them all: but this allegation may be retorted: for the hauing of many cures and Churches, doth not excuse the Pastors absence, but for the same cause it is vnlawfull to possesse many Churches, because the Pastor can not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to doe his dutie to all: which reason was vsed in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of Mentz, <hi>c.</hi> 64. <hi>Cum vnus pluribus ecclesiis curam im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendere necessariam nequeat:</hi> seeing one can not sufficiently care for many Churches. But such will aske what Scripture we haue against them: I would therefore that these texts were diligently considered, as first, Esech. 34.4. from whence this argument may be enforced, they are no good shepheards that doe not strengthen the weake, nor heale the sicke, nor bind vp the broken, nor seeke that which was lost: but such as hold many Churches, and attend not vpon the flocke, can not performe these duties: for how can they beeing absent, confirme the weake, restore the bruised in conscience, and bring home them that are seduced? Againe, they are no good shepheards which feede themselues, and feede not the flocke, Esech. 34.8. which liue of the tithes and offerings of the people, but giue them not spirituall foode againe: but such are they which yerely receiue an hundred, two hundred, or more pounds out of a parish, and scarce giue them once a quarter a sermon: what is this els, but, <hi>negotiationis, &amp; turpis luchri proprium,</hi> a kind of merchandise and gaine, as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Nicen. concil.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 15. If such should examine their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, they will finde, that it is not the loue of Christ, or of the flocke, but the loue of lucre and commoditie, and a meere couetous minde, that maketh them hunt for so many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: they are not my wordes, but vttered in the Laterane Councell held vnder Alexander, <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. in very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt times, <hi>Quia nonnulli modum avaritiae non ponentes, &amp;c. plures ecclesias nituntur acquirere, &amp;c.</hi> because some finding
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:20715:85"/>
no measure of their couetousnesse, doe seeke to get many Churches. Further, seeing in Scripture Ministers are called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Eph. 4.11. Pastors, shepheards, the very name shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how vnfit, yea &amp; vnpossible a thing it is, for one to watch ouer many Churches, seeing one shepheard can not feede or keepe more then one flocke. Lastly, Ministers professing the Gospel, should be ashamed herein to come short of that care which the superstitious Romanists haue professed: as in the Synod of Colen vnder <hi>Adolphus, Medium.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 9. thus it was decreed: <hi>Prohibendum est otiosum illud &amp; insatiabile studium coacervandi multa beneficia, &amp;c.</hi> That idle and vnsatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of heaping together many benefices hauing cure of soules is to be restrained: And then these reasons are added, <hi>Vndo populus fidelis graviter scandalizatur, spoliantur Ecclesiae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitis ministerijs, fundatorum frustratur voluntas, qui laborare in Ecclesia volunt excluduntur, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon the faithfull people is grieuously scandalized, the Churches spoiled of the due seruices, the minde of the founders is frustrate, and they which would labour in the Church are excluded. These fowre great inconueniences, or rather annoiances, do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie &amp; follow <hi>non residencie,</hi> and pluralities: 1. The offence and scandall of the people of God, who are much grieued, to see how greedie many are to eate the milke of the flocke, and yet are carelesse to feede them againe: but the Apostle would haue vs to giue no offence to the Church of God, 1. Cor. 10.32. and our Sauiour Christ pronounceth woe vnto those, by whome offence commeth, Matth. 18.7. 2. By this meanes the Churches are not duly serued, but the word of God vpon this occasion is pretious in many places: he that enioyeth two or more Churches, in some of them must needes take wages, and doe no seruice: S. Paul saith in deede to the Corinth. <hi>I robbed other Churches, and tooke wages of them, to doe you ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,</hi> 2. Cor. 11.8. But three things are here to be considered: 1. that Paul was an Apostle, and was not tied to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church: 2. that where he had preached, he left them suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Pastors and teachers of their owne, to water that which he had planted: 3. he robbed them not against their wil, they voluntarily contributed toward the releefe of the Apostle, yet so as sufficient remained for the maintenance of their owne Pastors. But all things are vnlike in this robberie of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20715:86"/>
which is vsed now a daies: so that, what the Apostle said in a good and commendable sense, in these is verified to their reproach, that they robbe some Churches, to doe others seruice: which kinde of robberie, if it be well considered, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth with it a greater inconuenience, then any other wrong in a mans goods: for that tendeth but to the dammage and losse of the helps of the bodily life; but this bringeth with it a worse consequent, in depriuing the soule of the necessarie foode thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third inconuenience is, that the minde of the first founders is frustrate: whether we vnderstand the first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of tithes, which was God himselfe by his seruant Moses; or the late founders since the time of the Gospel, godly and Christian Emperours, and faithfull and beleeuing people, who all gaue tithes to the Church, to this ende, that they might receiue spirituall things for temporall: and as they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vnto the Pastor of their outward goods, so he should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense vnto them of his spirituall graces: therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calleth it a communicating concerning the matter of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and receiuing. Philip. 4.15. 4. Lastly, by this occasion of <hi>non residence</hi> and pluralities, many sufficient and profitable men are excluded, who would labour willingly in the Lords vineyard, but that no man hireth them. It is not in this case, as when the halt and lame waited about the poole of Bethesda to be healed: euery one as he was strongest, stepped in first, and the diseased creeple was excluded, Ioh. 5.7. for many that are lame in respect of their gifts, doe thrust into the poole of the Church, before others that are sounder: And as the fort of Sion, was held by the blind &amp; lame against Dauid, 2. Sam. 5.8. so is the Sion of the Church occupied by some both blind and lame in their gifts, and the Seers are kept out. Thus that saying of S. Paul is fulfilled now a daies: <hi>They exclude you, that you should altogether loue them,</hi> Gal. 4.17. They which appropriate many Churches to themselues, exclude the people from other Pastors, that they should onely depend vpon them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth allegation and excuse will be this, that many doe giue necessarie attendance vpon their Lords, in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and in doing seruice vnto great men, and so are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:20715:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be absent from their Cures. But as the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse sauoured of couetousnesse, so this of ambition. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraieth a discontented and aspiring minde: for if the Apostle Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule were followed, <hi>Godlines is great riches, if a man be content with that he hath,</hi> 1. Timoth. 6.6. such would set vp their rest, beeing thankfull for that lot and portion, which God hath sent them, not ayming at a fairer marke. And, if they which thus alleadge would thoroughly examine themselues, they will finde, that it is not the loue of the seruice or attendance which they giue, but their owne aspiring minde, which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them from their Cures: they seeke with Diatrephes, to haue the preheminence among their brethren, and by their seruice to attaine vnto the auncient places of the Church. Otherwise Noble men might be serued with those, which haue no charges; at the least they might haue their turnes, as the Chaplins of the Kings Maiesties honourable houshold, and so neede not, notwithstanding their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, to be long absent from their flockes: for it seemeth a very vnreasonable thing, that they should receiue their wages in one place, and performe their seruice in an other. Concerning this ambitious desire of men in aspiring still vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to greater places, <hi>Leo</hi> hath a notable decree, <hi>Epistol.</hi> 82. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Si quis mediocritate sedis suae despecta, administrationem loci celebrioris ambierit, non solum à cathedra pellatur aliena, sed carebit &amp; propria, vt nec illis praesideat, quos per avaritiam concupivit, nec illis, quos per superbiam sprevit:</hi> If any Bishop (and by the same rule any other Minister) despising the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:20715:87"/>
charges, to hunt for greater preferment, it affordeth them no excuse, but maketh them more inexcusable: As it was well decreed in the Chalcedon Councell, <hi>Can.</hi> 23. <hi>de Clericis, qui diutius in vrbe Constantinopolitana immorarentur, decrevit sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodus, &amp;c.</hi> Concerning Clergie men, which stay long in the Citie of Constantinople, the Synod hath decreed, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Church of Constantinople, doe command them to depart, &amp; if they be vnwilling, compell them. Thus much by occasion of Eliabs wordes to Dauid, reproouing him for leauing of his sheepe, of these three points: 1. of the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the presence of the Pastors with their sheepe: 2. vpon what iust occasions they may be absent: 3. what excuses of absence are not sufficient. Now further, because it is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Dauid had left his sheepe with a keeper, v. 20. and Eliab asketh with whome he had left his few sheepe, v. 28. as seeming to rest satisfied for that, if he had deputed any in his place to take care of his sheepe: this question also would briefly be touched, whether the Pastors absence may be fully and sufficiently supplied by the deputation of others in their stead.</p>

               <p>Against this custome of substituting others, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Vicars or Curates in the Pastors place: first, that place in the Gospel is vrged by <hi>Damasus,</hi> of the good shepheard, which calleth his owne sheepe by name, and leadeth them out: and the sheepe heare his voice: they know not the voice of a stranger, Ioh. 10.3. and he prooueth the same by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Sauiour, <hi>Ipse, ipse inquam ovem perditam quaesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, iuvenit, &amp; proprijs humeris reportavit:</hi> he, euen he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe I say, did seeke the lost sheepe, and found it, and caried it home vpon his owne shoulders.

               <p n="2">2. An other reason may be grounded vpon the Apostles words, 1. Cor. 9.7. <hi>Who feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:20715:87"/>
milke of the flocke?</hi> A wrong then is done vnto such as are Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars and Deputies, that labouring in feeding of the flocke, they should not eate of the milke of the flocke: they doe the seruice, and an other taketh the reward: wherein a double wrong is committed: for both the people is wronged, who doe giue, and receiue not: whereas the Pastor and the people ought to communicate in the matter of giuing and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, Philip. 4.15. the one to giue spirituall and receiue tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things, the other to giue temporall, and receiue spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: likewise the poore Curate is wronged, that laboureth for an other: he endureth the heat of the day, and the other goeth away with the penie. It would be considered, whether that place of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> touch them not, concerning the keeping backe of the hire of the labourers, which haue reaped your fields: Iam. 5.4. for this is the Lords haruest wherein they labour, and much more worthie are they of their hire, then he that laboureth in the corne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Fathers of the Church haue in times past iudged it an vnnaturall thing, that a Pastor should put forth his sheepe to an other to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Beside this great inconuenience followeth by such substitutions, that Church duties are neglected, spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises intermitted, and Pastors carelesse of their owne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, entangle themselues with other temporall affaires: the Apostle saith, <hi>No man that warreth, entangleth himselfe with the affaires of this life,</hi> 2.

Herein also I could wish, that our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes exceeded the righteousnes of the Scribes and Pharisies: <hi>Espenceus</hi> before named, a graue writer of that side, alledgeth this out of <hi>Eckius,</hi> who though an enemie vnto the truth, yet thus complained of the abuse among them: <hi>Nostrates praela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti Apostolicum ordinem invertere, dum spiritualia graviora, quam quae subeant, rati, in Pontificalibus Suffraganeorum, in Iudicialibus Officialium, in absolve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dis peccatoribus Poenitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ariorum ope vtuntur, in praedicatione Monachum aliquem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferunt:</hi> Our Prelates doe inuert the Apostolike order, while, thinking spirituall things to heauie for them to vndergoe, they vse the helpe of Suffraganes in their Pontificall duties, of Officials in matters of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, of Penitentiaries in absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of sinnes, in preaching they set out some Monke: but if any temporall busines fall out, or matter of profit, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Bishop himselfe. <hi>Eck. hom.</hi> 2. <hi>de Stephan.</hi> And he which seeth not, that such kind of deputations hath done much hurt both in Ecclesiastical discipline, and ciuill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among vs, obserueth nothing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Further, it is very euident and apparent, that the substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Curates and Vicars hath in times past beene the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of bringing in one deuise, that I feare me, will be a baine to the Church, both in our time, and our posterities: I meane, of the founding and erecting of Impropriations: for when the Laitie saw, that Clergie men possessing many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, did substitute in their places poore Curates, for a small stipend or salarie, doing little or nothing themselues, they were glad to take the hint, and deuised to alienate the tithes of Churches to secular vses, and to endow (I might rather haue said vndoe) Vicarages, with some small tithes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Lastly, I would that speech of <hi>Iodocus</hi> a famous prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher sometime of France, were well remembred, who though he spake pleasantly, yet vttered the truth: that such as did feede their sheepe by vicars, <hi>adibunt per vicarios paradisum, in persona inferos:</hi> shall goe into heauen by their vicars, but
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:20715:88"/>
into hell in their owne person: <hi>Espenceus</hi> writeth, that beeing a young man, he had heard <hi>Iodocus</hi> often to inculcate this saying in his sermons: for why is it not as well iust with God to reward idle carelesse parsons by their vicars, as for them to doe their dutie by vicars?</p>
               <p>But this notwithstanding, which hath beene saide, against the perpetuall substitution of Vicars and Curates, yet all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is not to be taken away in the Church: for as in the Commonwealth and Ciuill state, the King and cheife magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate can not possibly doe all himselfe, but must needes haue officers and ministers, to whome we are commanded to yeild obedience, as sent of him, (1. Pet. 2.14.) and he of God: So also in Ecclesiasticall affaires, it is fit there should be subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ministers for the necessitie of the Church. As Moses go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp to the mount, left Aaron and Hur his deputies, Exod. 24.14. So the Euangelists were as the Apostles substitutes, for them and in their place to teach and exhort the people: as S. Paul sent Timotheus to Thessalonica, to stablish and comfort them touching their faith, 1. Thess. 3.2. so he left Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus at Creta, <hi>to continue to redresse the things that remaine.</hi> Tit. 1.5.</p>
               <p>But in these substitutions in Ecclesiasticall duties, these three conditions are requisite: 1. That they should not be perpetuall, but for a time, during the necessarie occasion of the Pastors absence: which necessitie beeing serued, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor should haue a desire to returne and visit his flocke: and to say, as S. Paul to the Romanes, <hi>I long to see you, that I might bestow vpon you, some spirituall gift,</hi> Rom. 1.11. and as Greg. Nazianzen. did write to the Bizantines, <hi>desydero vos filij, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<expan>

                     </expan> à vobis mensura, desideror:</hi> children, I doe long for you, as you in like manner long for me.

               <p n="1">1.

But whereas Dauid hauing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20715:90"/>
of two former deliuerances out of two great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, doth aduenture vpon the third, this example is not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to be imitated by vs, that we should in like manner ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate our selues by former experience, to enterprise things beyond our power: for Dauid beside his experience, had also the word of God for his warrant, both by the Prophet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, that he should be king of Israel, and by the secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of the spirit, which stirred him vp to this action. <hi>Mart.</hi> There be two things therefore which must concurre, to make the argument of experience strong: first, that we haue a good cause,<note place="margin">The argument of experience of Gods mercy, how it doth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vs.</note> as Dauid here had, and that we are warranted by our calling, as Dauid was, beeing appointed to be the captaine of the Lords people: herein the children of Benjamin failed, who maintaining a bad cause, did flatter themselues because they had twice ouercome the Israelites, they should fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them still, Iud. 20.32. secondly, we must also haue the warrant of Gods word, for our faith must be built vpon the word: this Sampson wanted, when he encouraged himselfe in his former experience, when Dalilah had caused his locks to be clipped off, <hi>that he would goe out, as at other times,</hi> but he wanted the assistance of Gods spirit, as before: the text saith, he <hi>knew</hi> not that the Lord was departed from him. Iud. 16.20. 3. Though therefore the argument of experience without the inward motion of Gods spirit, doth not warrant vs for a particular deliuerance, as from the famine, the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the sword: yet generally it is a good perswasion to build our confidence vpon: that we are assured in generall, that God will keepe vs and deliuer vs, as he hath done: as the Apostle saith, <hi>Who deliuered vs from so great a death, and doth deliuer vs: in whome we trust, that yet hereafter he will deliuer vs,</hi> 2.

               <p n="1">1. They which translate, <hi>madav,</hi> his armour, thinke, that it was Dauids armour made fit for him, which Saul had giuen him: because otherwise Sauls armour (who was a very tall man, and Dauid but a youth) was not meete for Dauid. <hi>Iun.</hi> But this is not like, that the armour was fit for Dauid, because as he saith, he was neuer accustomed vnto armour before: and vpon the sudden it is not like, it could be fitted to him. 2. <hi>Osiander</hi> thinketh that this armour, was not that which Saul vsed to weare himselfe, but it was brought out of his armorie or storehouse: so also <hi>Martyr.</hi> But as c. 18.4. Ionathan is said to haue giuen David, <hi>madav,</hi> his attire, that is, which he did weare, so is it to be taken here. 3.

Againe, <hi>Pellicane</hi> thinketh, that in those daies armour was not made so fit or apt for the bodie, as it is now a daies, and therefore a great mans armour might serue a lesse: but, it had beene to combersome for souldiers to weare armour not fit for their bodies: for so it would rather haue beene an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance and impediment vnto them, then an helpe and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance. 5. Therefore I rather approoue their reading, that translate <hi>madav,</hi> vesture, or raiment, <hi>B.G.A.P.C.</hi> but it was not Sauls ordinarie raiment, but his souldiers attire: not the stiffe armour, but some other robes and ornaments, which might serue Dauids bodie, such as Ionathan afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon Dauid, c. 18.4. so <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh, that Saul put vpon him his own brigandine or brestplate: which might be of the fashion of Goliaths, which was of male, <hi>kaskasim,</hi> like vnto fishes skales: which might very well serue for a lesse bodie then Sauls.</p>

               <p n="1">1. If <hi>Iunius</hi> opinion and iudgement be receiued, who thinketh that Dauid was not receiued into Sauls seruice, nor made his armour bearer, till he had done this exploit against Goliath, and so the historie to be transposed: then the soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this doubt is easie, that it was no maruell, that Dauid beeing brought vp among sheepe, had neuer tried to go with armour: but herein I must needes dissent from that reuerent learned writer, as hath beene partly shewed before, qu. 7. and shall be further discussed toward the ende of this chapter, qu. 30. for immediately after this victorie Saul hated Dauid, and suffered him no more to returne, c. 18.2.8. but at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of Dauid, Saul loued Dauid, c. 16.21. and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe to his father. c. 17.15. 2. Therefore the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter answer is, that though Dauid had beene afore appointed to be Sauls armour bearer, yet it seemeth, that he had neuer gone with him to any battell, before he returned to keepe his fathers sheepe, and so had no cause to vse any armour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. <hi>Osiand.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Dauid is confident vpon God, both acknowledging his power, he was the Lord of hoasts, and had all creatures visible and inuisible at his command, to be reuenged vpon his enemies: as also he was assured, as of the power of God, so of his readie helpe, who had entred into a league and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his people, and had in former times wrought won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully with them, and promised to be with their armies. 2. And Dauid confidently vpon this ground, both of Gods power, and gracious assistance, pronounceth three things to fall out: that God will deliuer the Philistim into his hand: some doe translate the word <hi>sagar, shall close thee in my hand: A.V.S.</hi> but it rather signifieth to deliuer, as it is taken, c. 23.11. <hi>Will the Lords of Keilah deliuer me vp into his hands?</hi> and so read here <hi>Chal.

Now Dauid knewe that these things should fall out, partly by ordinarie, partly by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie meanes: the ordinarie were two, the badnesse of Goliaths cause, who had railed vpon the God of the hoast of Israel, and therefore God would not suffer such blasphemie to goe vnpunished: and the ende, that all the world might know that the true God was worshipped in Israel: the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie meanes was the spirit of prophesie, which Dauid was endued with, whereby he could foretell of the manner of Goliaths destruction, and that he should take away his head from him. <hi>sic fere Martyr.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Goliath at the first called Dauid vnto him, but beeing prouoked by his speech, he maketh hast toward him: then
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:20715:93"/>
Dauid speedily put a stone into his sling, and hit him in the forehead, and ouerthrew him: wherein three things are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: first, that Dauid at the first throw could hit so vncerten a marke: for Goliath stood not still, but was in motion: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that with a small stone he did ouerturne such an huge bodie: thirdly, that the same entring into his forehead did slay him outright: <hi>Martyr.</hi> This was done by more then Dauids skill, though he were expert in flinging, as it is saide of the Beniamites, that they could cast a stone at an haires breadth, and not faile, Iud. 20.16. for the Lord directed the stone, and gaue such strength vnto it: <hi>Pellican.</hi> it light vpon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head the place of sense: <hi>Borr.</hi> yea, it pierced into his braine: <hi>Ioseph.</hi> the word <hi>tabah,</hi> signifieth to sinke, as when a thing is drowned in the water: so easily the stone entred, as into the water: <hi>Iun.</hi> and was all hid in his forehead. 3.

                  <hi>29. Quest. v. 54.</hi> What tabernacle Dauid laid vp Goliaths armour in.</head>
               <p>Whereas c. 21. mention is made of the sword of Goliath, which was laide vp in the Tabernacle before the Lord, this doubt ariseth how Dauid is saide to lay it vp with the other armour of Goliath in his owne tabernacle. 1. Some thinke, that he laid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp first in his tent, which he had in the campe: or in his owne house at Bethlehem: <hi>Vatab.</hi> and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from his own tabernacle they were caried to the Lords tabernacle: <hi>Osiand.</hi> but it is not like that Dauid comming as a straunger to the campe, had there any tent of his owne: and to Bethlehem he returned not, c. 18.2. 2. Some take this for the Tabernacle of God, that Goliaths armour was at the first laid vp there: <hi>Pellican.</hi> but it had beene improper to call Gods tent, Dauids tent. 3. Others therefore are of opinion, that Goliaths armour and weapons were diuided, that his armour was kept in Dauids tent, but his sword was laide vp in the Tabernacle of God: <hi>Kimch.</hi> but the word <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee</hi> comprehendeth generally as well his weapons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and therefore it is like, there beeing no speciall menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of Goliaths sword, that it was placed and laid vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest of his armour. 4. Therefore the more likely opinion is,<note place="margin">Reconcil.</note> that this is vnderstood of that Tabernacle, which Dauid prepared and pitched for the Arke at Ierusalem, 2. Sam. 6.17. and 1. Chron. 15.1. which is called his taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, because he prouided and prepared it for the Arke: here then a <hi>prolepsis,</hi> that is, a preuenting of the storie, is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: Dauid is said to doe that here, because it belongeth to the argument of the same storie, which he did afterward, when he brought the Arke to Ierusalem: so the like, Exod. 16.34. whereas Aaron is saide to haue placed the pot of Manna before the Testimonie, which was not yet made; neither did Aaron then place it there, but afterward. <hi>sic Iun.</hi> In the meane time it is like, that the armour of Goliath was laide vp in the Tabernacle of the Lord at Nob, from whence Dauid recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the sword of Goliath, c. 21. which afterward he put in the Tabernacle at Ierusalem.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Iunius</hi> thinketh, as is shewed before, qu. 23. that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter with Goliath went before his first entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with Saul, and so his opinion is, that this storie is transposed: and that Saul had no knowledge of him before, when he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked this question. But this interpretation can not stand: for these reasons: 1. because it is said, c. 18.2. <hi>that Saul tooke Dauid that day, and would not let him returne to his fathers house:</hi> immediatly after this exploit Saul kept him with him: but if Dauid had first encountred with Goliath before his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment with Saul, it had beene vntrue: for Saul sent to his father for him, c, 16. <hi>Iunius</hi> answeareth, that this v. c. 18.2. is to be referred to the storie, c. 16. of Sauls sending vnto Ishai for his sonne, and that day is to be vnderstood: and therefore he beginneth the 18. chap. at that verse. But this construction seemeth very straunge, after so long interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and breaking off, to referre <hi>that day,</hi> rather to the chapter precedent, then to the verse precedent: where mention is made of the knitting of Ionathans heart to Dauid: especially seeing there is no particular mention made of any day, c. 16.19. when Saul sent for Dauid. 2. After Dauids first enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment Saul loued him, c. 16.21. but immediatly after this victorie, when they returned in triumph, and the women commended Dauid beyond Saul, Saul thereupon was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wroth, and beganne to be iealous of Dauid, c. 18.7, 8. <hi>Iunius</hi> answeareth, that this meeting of the women playing and singing, was at some other time, when Saul returned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vanquishing the Philistims, and not from the slaughter of Goliath. But this can not be: for Dauid is saide to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the slaughter of the Philistim, c. 18.6. which <hi>Iunius</hi> translateth, <hi>Philistims</hi> in the plural, otherwise then in the original, to auoide that obiection: and when is it like els, that they should giue the preheminence to Dauid, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the slaughter of Goliath, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet the memorie thereof was fresh? 3. Presently after this triumph Saul beeing afraid of Dauid, put him from him, and made him captaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a thousand, c. 18.13. and he was no more his harnesse-bearer, but he set him ouer his men of warre, v. 5. but after his
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:20715:95"/>
first entertainment he was his armour bearer: therefore Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids first seruice vnto Saul, went before this combate with Goliath. 4. Dauid the morrow after the triumph (Saul bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his fitt) is said to haue plaied with his hand like as at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, c. 18, 10. but if Dauid had not beene before enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, he should not haue vsed to play before Saul at all. 5. We are not easily to admit such disorder and confusion in the sacred stories, without great cause, and some apparent incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience and absurditie, which can not be auoided, without such dislocation of the storie: but no such thing is feared here: therefore vpon these reasons, I can no waies giue assent vnto <hi>Iunius</hi> in this place.</p>
               <p>Therefore holding the order of the storie to haue beene so done in time, as it is set downe: there are diuers solutions of this doubt: how Saul could possibly be so ignorant of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, by whome he had receiued such comfort in his agonies and fitts. 1. Some thinke, that Saul knew Dauid, but not who his father was: but that is not so: for he had sent to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shai by name for his sonne, c. 16.19. 2. Others suppose, that he knew his fathers name, but now enquireth of his tribe and familie: but Saul knew that before also, it was told him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Ishai his father was a Bethlemite. c. 16.18. 3. <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> thinketh that he enquireth after the qualitie and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his father, whether he were a warlike man, hauing such a valiant sonne: but the text sheweth, that he asked simply whose sonne he was, not what manner of man his father was. 4. Some ascribe this forgetfulnes of Saul to the multitude of affaires, wherewith Kings are occupied, and so grow obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>Vatab.</hi> some to the absence and discontinuance of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, who was now againe reduced to his pastorall life, <hi>Osiand.</hi> But it is most like that this is to be imputed to Sauls distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered braine, that was oftentimes molested with madde and frantike fitts, and such persons, as we see by experience grow so obliuious, that for the time they forget their nearest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and friends: and for Abner, it is no maruell, that he beeing a martiall man, and hauing occasion ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be abroad, tooke no such speciall notice of Dauid. <hi>Mart. Pellic.</hi> Any of these, especially the last, may be rather held to be the causes of Sauls forgetfulnes and obliuion, then to imagine the storie to be transposed.</p>

               <p>THree things are expressed in this verse, the occasion of this loue and friendship, the firmenesse of it, Ionathans soule was knit with the soule of Dauid; the faithfulnes of it,<note place="margin">A description of true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note> he loued him as his owne soule: which three are requisite in true friendship. 1. The occasion was generall, the vertue and value of Dauid, and the great grace which was in him, both in his doings, and sayings, and the particular similitude and likenes in them of religion, loue of their countrey, valure: for both of them, Ionathan c. 14. and Dauid here, had aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their liues in the defense of Gods people. There are three things, which engender friendship; profit, pleasure, vertue: the first two doe not beget true friendship, for as soone as the profit or pleasure ceaseth, friendship is gone: but vertue onely maketh loue and friendship to continue. <hi>ex Mart.</hi> 2. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ionathans friendship beeing grounded vpon Dauids ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, remaineth firme, and continueth, their hearts were, as it were, tied and linked together: nothing but death could se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate that mutuall loue: nay, after Ionathans death, Dauid remembred the league betweene them made, in shewing mercie vnto Ionathans posteritie: now whereas two things are required in friendship, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sheweth in his Ethicks, that it should be mutuall, of one toward the other, which is the difference betweene loue and friendship: for one may loue, where he is not loued againe: but friendship alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth the like good will againe: the other thing is, that this mutuall loue be made apparant and professed betweene them: for there may be secret good will, and inclination of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection betweene two, but before it be professed and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted betweene them, it is not properly friendship: both these concurred in this friendship: for Ionathan loued Dauid, and was beloued againe: and they professed this friendship by making a mutuall league. 3. Then the third thing follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth obserued in this loue, that is, the force and efficacie of it:
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:20715:96"/>
Ionathan loued Dauid as his owne soule, that is, wished as well vnto him, as to himselfe: he loued him, not that he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted good from him, but to haue one, whome he might doe good vnto. Therefore <hi>Seneca epist.</hi> 9. <hi>ad Lucil.</hi> doth worthily reprooue <hi>Epicurus</hi> description of a friend: that a man might haue one, <hi>to helpe him when he had neede, to sit by him when he was sicke, &amp;c.</hi> and he well saith, <hi>longe suavior est amicitia, quae prodest alteri, quam quae invatur ab alio:</hi> that friendship is sweetest, which helpeth an other, rather then is helped of an other: so here Ionathan loueth Dauid for his owne sake, that he might shew loue and kindnes vnto him. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in part defineth friendship well: <hi>bene velle alicui, non tua, sed ipsius causa,</hi> to wish well vnto a man, for his cause, not thine owne: as here Ionathan wisheth well to Dauid. But this is not all, yet there is a further thing to be considered: that a friend is not to be loued for his own good, but <hi>propter deum,</hi> for Gods cause: <hi>ex Martyr.</hi> for God was the worker of this friendship betweene Ionathan and Dauid: that he neglecting his owne estate, and the hope of the kingdome, and with the euill will also of his father, yet fauoured Dauid: <hi>Pellic.</hi> wherein Gods prouident care appeared toward Dauid, that he might haue a friend in Sauls court, to reueale his counsels &amp; intendements from time to time against Dauid. <hi>Borr.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that as Ionathan is here said to loue Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid as his owne soule, that is, as himselfe, so we are bound by the commandement euery one to loue his neighbour: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is said, <hi>Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe: Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and.</hi> but this precept doth not take away the degrees of loue: for then their should be no speciall friendship among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: the precept then is to be vnderstood, not of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of loue, that we should loue euery one that is our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in that degree and measure of loue, which we loue our selues: for that were vnnaturall, for a man not to preferre himselfe before an other: but of the qualitie and condition of loue: that we must loue our neighbour with the same simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:20715:96"/>
and true affection, wishing him no more hurt, then to our selues. 2. But that there is euen in Christianitie a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of loue, and that a speciall and peculiar friendship with one more then with an other, may stand with religion, it may be thus shewed: our Sauiour Christ himselfe whose affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were most pure, did loue one of the Apostles beyond the rest: <hi>Iohn</hi> is called the Apostle in the Gospel, whome Iesus loued: further, S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>that men should first learne to shew godlines to their owne house,</hi> and he saith, <hi>that it is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest thing, and acceptable before God,</hi> 1.

               <p n="1">1. Saul is giuen ouer to be tormented of his owne affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: at once he is inuaded with anger, feare, and enuie, which bringeth forth hatred at the last: first, he is angrie with the women without cause: for they had ascribed vnto Dauid no more then he deserued, for in killing Goliath, he had done as great seruice as ten thousand could haue done: and they gaue vnto Saul more then he deserued, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> sheweth, <hi>homil. de Davide &amp; Saule:</hi> for Saul had continued 40. daies in the campe, suffering the Philistim to make his vaunts, and did nothing; yet least they should seeme altogether to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace Saul, they say Saul hath <hi>slaine his thousand.</hi> Next vnto his anger followeth his feare: he beginneth to be iealous of his kingdome, saying, What can he haue more, sauing the kingdome? then he falleth to enuie Dauid, and to be suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of him: <hi>he had an eye vnto Dauid, from that day forward,</hi> v. 9. and last of all he hateth him, and deuiseth mischiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. <hi>Martyr.</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20715:97"/>
submit himselfe to the Lords pleasure, saying, <hi>If he say thus vnto me, I haue no delight in thee, behold, here I am, let him doe to me as seemeth good in his eies.</hi> 2. Sam. 15.26. Secondly, Saul is violently caried with this streame of enuie to hate Dauids vertues, euen that, for the which Dauid was worthie to be loued. Thirdly, this enuie tended vnto Sauls owne hurt, it was as a fire in his bosome, and as a worme continually gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon him, not suffering him to haue any rest: so enuie is a sinne against God, against man, and most of all the enuious person sinneth against his owne soule. <hi>Borr.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Some doe interpret, that he was madde, <hi>Chal.</hi> but to play the Prophet simply is not to be madde. 2. Some thinke he is said to prophesie, because he spake in his fitts he knew not what, he vttered straunge words and phrases, farre from the capacitie of other, as the Prophets vttered parables: as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicenna</hi> noteth, that madde men in their fitts many times vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter straunge languages and words, which they neuer learned, nor vnderstood. <hi>Mart.</hi> 3. Some take it to be spoken accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of the vulgar sort, who when men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied, thought they were madde, as Iehu his companions called the young man, which Elisha sent to anoint Iehu king, madde fellow, 1. king. 9. and those which were madde, they thought did prophesie. <hi>Mart.</hi> 4. Some thinke that Saul here vttered sacred psalmes and hymnes, as the two Prophets vsed to doe: <hi>Osiand.</hi> but Sauls manner of prophesying here, and that c. 10. and 19. when he prophesied among the Prophets, was not all one: for there he did as the other Prophets, the spirit of God comming vpon him: but here the euill spirit vexed him. 5. Therefore, the meaning is no more but this, that Saul was rauished as a man beside himselfe: his speech for manner (though not for the matter) was straunge, and his behauiour outwardly was such, as when the Prophets were stirred by the spirit of God. <hi>Iun.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that is, thought: <hi>Borr.</hi> it appeareth, that though Sauls head were troubled, yet he was not starke madde, but that he knew what he did: some thinke, that as men in their sleepe doe dreame of those things, which they thought when they were awake, so madde men haue reliques of their former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill thoughts remaining: but here Saul saide, that is, thought thus and reasoned within himselfe: he was not then altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depriued of reason: but we see the fruits of this his madd prophesying, as the spirit wherewith he was mooued, was a murtherer from the beginning, so Saul intendeth nothing but murther and mischeife. 2. Gods prouidence appeareth in deliuering Dauid: that as God directed the stone out of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids sling to hitte Goliath, so he guideth the speare out of Sauls hand, that it did not touch Dauid: though he by Gods direction vsed the meanes also in declining the stroake. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</hi> 3.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> here obserueth, that in Dauids time, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:20715:99"/>
before the law the vse was, not for men to take dowries and portions with their wiues, but rather to giue vnto them: and vnder the law he thinketh it was the vse for the women to giue their dowries: and he citeth that place, Exod. 22.16, 17. where the law is this, <hi>If a man entise a maide that is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troathed, and lie with her, he shall endow her, and take her to his wife: if her father refuse to giue her vnto him, he shall pay money according to the dowrie of virgins:</hi> out of this place he seemeth to inferre, that dowries were vsed to be giuen with virgins. But the contrarie is euident by these words: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verse is cleare, that he which lieth with a maide not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troathed, shall endow her: and in case the father of the maide will not consent, then not the father, but the other shall not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding giue the dowrie of virgins vnto the maides fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it appeareth Deut. 22.29. for if the law had beene for virgins to giue and not take dowries, they would not in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise haue gone against the law. And whereas the example of Pharaoh is obiected, that gaue in marriage with his daughter the citie of Gezer vnto Salomon, 1. king. 9.16. it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that Salomon had married Pharaohs daughter long before that, c. 3.1. but dowries were vsed to be giuen before marriage: neither is it called a dowrie, which the Hebrewes call <hi>mohar,</hi> but it was <hi>shilluchim,</hi> a thing sent, or present: and beside Pharaoh was a stranger to Israel, and therefore not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto their lawes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The vse then was both before the law, and after, for men to endowe their wiues before marriage: so Abrahams seruant gaue tokens and iewells vnto Rebekah, but receiued none: Iaakob serued 14. yeares for his wiues: Shechem saith vnto Iaakob, and his sonnes, <hi>Let me finde fauour in your eyes, and I will giue whatsoeuer you appoint me.</hi> Gen. 34.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now the order concerning dowries was this: the man gaue a dowrie before marriage to his wife, which was at her disposing, if her husband died, for her maintenance, or for the education of the children: and such dowries were giuen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mariage, after they could not be giuen, whereof <hi>Plutark</hi> giueth this reason, <hi>in quaestionibus connubialibus,</hi> because then the man and wife were as one, and they occupied their good in common, they could not one giue to an other. <hi>ex Mart.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. First, the priuate reasons, which mooued Dauid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to this condition were these two; his desire to haue Michal for his wife, whome seeing her to loue him, he loued againe, and that by this occasion he might cut off the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, and of Israel. 2. The lawfulnes of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise appeareth, both in respect of the commander, which was Saul the king the cheife Magistrate, by whose authoritie warres must be taken in hand: and the person of the enemies considered, who were professed enemies to the people of God, continually vexing and molesting them. <hi>Mart.</hi> Dauid also might consider his owne calling, who was anointed king, and appointed to be the captaine and deliuerer of his people. 3. Thus through Gods goodnes all things fal out contrarie to Sauls expectation: he thought to make his daughter a snare vnto him, who afterward was a meane to deliuer him: and he exposeth Dauid to the rage of the Philistims, thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make an hand of him; whereas by the iust iudgement of God Saul fell into the hand of the Philistims, but Dauid escaped: nay, he was preserued in their countrey from Saul. <hi>Mart.</hi>

in the text, whether this thing happened in the first yeare of Dauids marriage: <hi>Mart.</hi> it seemeth, rather that the Philistims were prouoked, and exasperated by Dauids hard vsage of them, in cutting off their foreskinnes. 2.

               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that the word <hi>teraphim</hi> here vsed, which signifieth Idols or images, is taken in Scripture sometime in the worse sense, for an idol abused to superstition; sometime for any picture resembling man: <hi>Vatabl.</hi> and that this image might be either some implement in the house throwne into a corner and neglected, or such a mammet, as they make of clouts and ragges to keepe gardens and orchards, commonly called skare-crowes. <hi>Mart.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:20715:101"/>
liuely representation of a man, seeing that Michal thrusteth vnder the head therof a pillow of goats skin with the haire, as the Latine interpreter well interpreteth, <hi>pellem pilosarum ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prarum,</hi> the hairie skinne of a goate: that it beeing put to the head of the image, might resemble a mans haire: beside, to what ende should such an image be kept in the house, and laid aside beeing of no vse? And further, I thinke, it cannot be shewed that <hi>teraphim</hi> is otherwise taken in the Scripture, then in the wurse part, for an image or idol of superstition: as c. 15.23. to transgresse is as superstition and idols, the word is <hi>(te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim)</hi> The same name is giuen to the images, which Rachel stole from her father. 2. <hi>Iosephus</hi> taketh it not to haue beene an image, but the heart of a goate, which lay panting vnder the cloathes: but beside that this is contrarie to the text: so small a thing, could not be taken for the bodie of a man. 3. Therefore the more probable opinion is, that this <hi>teraphim</hi> was some superstitious relique, which Michal vsed secretly, without Dauids priuitie, as Rachel kept hers, Iaakob not knowing, and others in his house, as appeareth, Gen. 35.2, 4. <hi>Mercer. ibid.</hi> for though Saul were an enemie to idolatrie, and so Michal learned no such thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him; yet shee might els where see such superstition: as there were witches in Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, though Saul publikely did inhibite them: thus both the <hi>Lat.</hi> and <hi>Chald.</hi> here read <hi>simulachrum,</hi> but more euidently the <hi>Sept. <gap reason="foreign">

It is written of <hi>Dyonisius</hi> the tyrant, who gaue his sister in marriage to one <hi>Polixenus,</hi> that when he beeing accused of treason, was fled into Italie, the tyrant expostulated with his sister, why shee did not giue notice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him of his flying: then shee made this confident answer, <hi>An ita me degenerem putas, vt si scissem virum fugiturum, non fuissem vna fugitura: Doe you thinke me so vndutifull and out of kind, that if I had known my husband would haue fled away, that I would not haue fled away with him.</hi> Michal herein came short of the example of this heathen woman. <hi>Mart.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. This Naioth, which is said to be Ramah Samuels citie, was not farre from Ramah situate in the fields or territorie thereof: <hi>Vatabl.</hi> the worde properly signifieth, a solitarie place in the pastures and fieldes, where the schoole of the Prophets was: which was fittest for studie and meditation: thither Samuel taketh Dauid, that they might be more safe from Sauls violence, and that Dauid might finde comfort in the exercise and meditation of the Scriptures. <hi>Pellican.</hi> 2. In this place there was a companie of Prophets, and Samuel was cheife ouer them, beeing their instructer and teacher, and therefore els where they are called the children of the Prophets: for though prophesie be the speciall gift, and worke of the spirit, yet it was fit that they which afterward should be emploied in the seruice of God, as it is like, that these were most of Leui, should be prepared by godly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and education, for the further worke of the spirit in them. 3. Thus Samuel though he had giuen ouer the publike gouernment of the Commonwealth, yet exercised himselfe in his propheticall office still: not liuing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as <hi>Sylla</hi> did, when he had resigned the Dictatour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, nor following his pleasure, as <hi>Diocletian,</hi> after he had

practised in this our nation, that the Kings writ should not be serued in Churches and places of prayer, at the least no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent hands to be laide vpon any in Church or Churchyard. 3. But this giueth no patronage to the vnreasonable priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which in time past were challenged vnto Sanctuaries: by occasion of which superstitious immunities, many foule and shamefull enormities were committed: And Popish San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries failed in all these respects: 1. in the number of them, they were exceeding many: euery Monasterie lightly was a Sanctuarie, whereas in all the land of Israel, there were but sixe appointed for the whole nation. 2. whereas the Sanctuaries and cities of refuge were appointed for inuolun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie and the smaller offences, for those which trespassed not of malice, as they which killed any by chaunce without any malice: yet they opened their Sanctuaries to wicked persons, guiltie of wilfull murder, and other most grieuous crimes: whereas by the law of God, it was lawfull to take such euen from the altar,<note place="margin">Contr.

with a full intent to apprehend Dauid, and to take him by strong hand: we read in Scripture of three kind of such inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and changes: some were suddenly stricken with Gods iudgements, and so staied in their enterprise, as two captaines with their fifties, that were sent by the King to take Eliah, which were destroied with fire from heauen: 2. king. 1. some, though they escaped such sodaine iudgement,<note place="margin">Of sodaine changes and innouations of mens hearts.</note> yet were asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and their affections chaunged: as the third captaine which was sent to Eliah submitted himselfe, and besought the Prophet for his life, though he came with an intent to lay violent hands vpon the Prophet, as the other did: so the messengers whome the Pharisies sent to apprehend Christ, had no power to doe any thing vnto him, but returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. Ioh. 7.46. A third sort there is, which beside such sodaine astonishment, haue presently beene rauished with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie motions of the spirit, as Saul of a persecuter was sodainly turned to be an Apostle and preacher of the Gospel: as also in this place, the messengers of Saul prophesied. 2. Such sodaine chaunges, though they are rare and not often seene, yet the Lord to shew the power of his spirit, sheweth sometime such examples in the world: the Niniuites were presently reclaimed at the preaching of Ionas, so were many in the citie of Athens, by the holy labours of the Apostle Paul: <hi>Augustine</hi> was conuerted from beeing a Manichee by hearing of <hi>Ambrose</hi> sermons, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>confess. c.</hi> 3. <hi>M.

               <p n="1">1. When Saul had sent messengers thrice, and none of them returned: beeing there deteined, not for feare, as the messengers which Ioram sent to meete Iehu, whome he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to turne behinde him, but with reuerence vnto the Prophets, and with a spirituall delight for the time in their godly exercises: <hi>Mar.</hi> then he followeth himselfe, not of any deuotion, but of a malitious and hatefull minde to lay violent hands: <hi>Pellic.</hi> euen he himselfe also by the way is chaunged, wherein by experience is found true that saying of the wise man, <hi>The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 24.1. 2. There is great difference betweene Sauls prophesying at this time, and of his seruants: and a greater chaunge in him, then in them: for first he was vexed and inuaded by an euill spirit before, so were not they: then he prophesieth in the way before he came to Samuel, so did not they vntill they came to Samuel, and the companie of Prophets: further, Saul when he came cast off his princely robes, or militarie attire, all the day and the night: which is not expressed of the other: that they prophesied in that manner, or so long. 3. And as Sauls prophesying in this place, was much diuers from theirs; so also he is said here to prophesie in an other manner and sense then he did before in his owne house, c. 18. v. 10. for first the cause was diuers, that proceeded of the euill spirit, this of the good spirit of God, which came vpon him at this time: <hi>Mar.</hi> then the effects were diuers, there he meditateth mischeife, and casteth a speare at Dauid, here Dauid was present, and he hath no power to touch him: further, there he is said to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie onely, because of some likenes in general, in his strange behauiour, as rauished beside himselfe, but here he prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a further degree, communicating with the rest of the Prophets in their propheticall exercises. <hi>Iunius</hi> maketh this prophesying and the other, c. 18.10. to be all alike, and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs here in the marginal annotatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that place, c. 18.10. but I rather subscribe herein to <hi>Pet.

               <p n="1">1. It is not to be imagined, that Saul was indeede altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naked, but he is said to be so, because he had laide aside either his princely robes, as <hi>R. Chimchi</hi> thinketh, or militarie apparell, <hi>Iun.</hi> and was now as an other common person: so Isai. 20.2. the Prophet is saide to goe naked, because he had put off his sackcloath, which he had worne before: so Michal telleth Dauid that he had vncouered, or made himselfe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, 2. Sam. 6.20. because he had put off his princely apparel, and daunced in a linen Ephod. 2. Some thinke that Saul did not onely put off his owne garments, but put on some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kinde of vesture, such as the Prophets vse to weare: and <hi>Osiander</hi> affirmeth that it was certainely so: <hi>Proculdubio ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am vestem, qua Prophetantes vtebantur, assumpsit:</hi> Vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly he tooke an other garment, which the Prophets vsed. <hi>P.

But whence should Saul haue that speciall kind of apparell? for it seemeth that Samuel spake not at all to him, nor gaue any direction for any such thing: and without his direction, the children of the Prophets would doe nothing: therefore his nakednesse consisted onely in laying aside his vpper princely robe, beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing himselfe now as any other common person.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>Septuag. Lat. Genevens.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:20715:105"/>
the ground a whole day and night: and further, whereas their prophesying consisted in singing of Psalmes, &amp; praising God, as the <hi>Chalde</hi> interpreteth, this gesture had not been so meete for that exercise.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some other therefore thinke that Saul did not lie vpon the earth all the day and night, but at certaine <hi>diurne</hi> and <hi>nocturne houres,</hi> appointed for praier and prophesying, he humbled himselfe vpon his knees, as now is vsed to be done in the seruice of the Church: that in reading some Psalmes, they vse to fall vpon their knees. <hi>Osiand.</hi> But who can thinke that this allotting out of certaine houres for prayer by day &amp; night, is so auncient as Samuel; or that such chaunge of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture in praier was taken vp then: beside that, Saul doing thus at times, could not be saide to fall all the day and night.</p>

                  <hi>13. Quest.</hi> Of the difference of true and false prophets, how they differ betweene themselues, and from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, vpon these words: Is Saul also among the Prophets?</head>
               <p n="1">1. The first difference to be considered, is concerning the diuers offices of Prophets, which were either ordinarie, as in praying and interpreting the Scripture, teaching, exhorting, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> taketh the word prophesying, 1. Cor. 14.3. or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie, consisting in the reuealing of hid things, either past, as Moses setteth downe the historie of the creation: Christ told the woman what shee had done, Ioh. 4. or present, as Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha could tell what Gehezi had done beeing absent, Samuel told Saul what was become of his asses: or of things to come, in which sense properly they were called Prophets: in respect of these extraordinarie parts and gifts, a Prophet is now to be considered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second thing to be obserued, is of the diuers waies and meanes, whereby the Lord reuealed himselfe to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which were three: either by oracle, as when the Lord spake by an audible voice, as when the Angel of God spake to Abraham, not to sacrifice his sonne, Gen. 22. or by dreams, as vnto Ioseph, Math. 1. or by vision: which was of three sorts, either by inward reuelation to the minde and vnderstanding,<note place="margin">Of diuers sorts of visions.</note> as to Isaiah, when he was bid to turne backe vnto Hezekiah beeing sicke, 2. king. 20.4. or when some inward demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is shewed, by some representation, as Ieremie saw the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond rod, and the pot, Ierem. 1. and Peter the fowre corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red sheete, Act. 10. or when some visible obiect is offered to the sight, as when the hand writ vpon the wall, Dan. 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Prophets then differed from Priests and other Pastors: the Priests had an ordinarie succession, beeing alwaies of the tribe of Leui: the Prophets were raised extraordinarily, and indifferently out of any tribe: the Priests were tied to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Tabernacle, so were not the Prophets: the Priests
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:20715:106"/>
were subiect to errour in their doctrine, so were not the true Prophets: likewise they differed from ordinarie Pastors, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, Teachers: for the ordinarie teachers obtained their gifts of teaching and exhorting, by studie, labour, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie: the Prophets were extraordinarily inspired of God: though they were prepared by fasting, studie, praier, yet the gift of prophesying came by secret inspiration from God. <hi>Martyr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. There was great difference betweene the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and the false: 1. One note is giuen, that a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet should be knowne, if his prophesie come to passe, Deut. 18.22. 2. But because sometime the Lord to trie his people, may suffer the signes of false prophets to come to passe, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther surer note is giuen, to trie them by their doctrine: for if they shall perswade to any false doctrine, as to Idolatrie, or such like, they are not good Prophets, though the effect of their prophesie follow, Deuter. 13.2. 3. The true Prophets are inspired of God, the false for the most part are led by the false and lying spirit, as Baals prophets were, 1. king. 22. 4. The true Prophets were men of sanctified hearts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and of good life and manners: the false prophets were voide of true faith, and men of corrupt life: as Balaam was corrupted with money, and he gaue counsell against the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. There is also some difference betweene the false prophets themselues: for some of them may haue the gift of prophesie for the time from God, as Balaam, and Caiphas, who are to be discerned by the former notes from true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: some are inspired of Satan, as Simon Magus, which by his sorcerie bewitched Samaria: such was the Pythonisse at Philippi, Act. 16. and at the oracle of Apollo at Delphos.</p>

The true Prophets also differed among themselues: some excelled others in authoritie and greatnes of workes, as <hi>Moses</hi> was preferred before the rest, that there was not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet like vnto him: Deut. 34. some in clearenes of reuelation, as Dauid and Daniel concerning the manifestation of the Messiah: some had the preheminence in regard of their office, as Iohn Baptist beeing the forerunner of Christ, and pointing him out with his finger, is preferred before the rest.</p>

                  <hi>1. Quest. v. 3.</hi> Of Dauids oath: As Iehovah liueth, and as thy soule liueth: whether it be lawfull to sweare by any, but by the Lord onely.</head>
               <p>HEre the question is, which of these was the forme of Dauids oath: for if the whole be Dauids oath, then it would follow, that it is lawfull to sweare by the soule and life of man, as by the life of God. But first it is euident, that it is not lawfull to sweare by any creature in heauen and earth, nor by a mans head. Matth. 36. 1. As it was well decreed in the 4. Councell of <hi>Carthag. Clericum per creaturas iurantem acerbè obiurgandum:</hi> A Clergie man that sweareth by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we doe decree to be sharply reprooued: and if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his fault, to be excommunicate. 2. Yea, it was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an horrible thing, to sweare by any part of God: <hi>Si quis per capillum dei, vel caput iuraverit, vel alio modo blasphemia contra deum vsus fuerit, si Clericus, deponatur, &amp;c.</hi> If any doe sweare by the haire or head of God, or vse any other blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie against God, if he be a Clergie man, let him be deposed; if a lay man, let him be anathematized. <hi>Caus.</hi> 22. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 10. If Christ be not to be dismembred by an oath, which were as a crucifying of him againe: much lesse are we to sweare by any part of a man, as by his soule, or head. 3. For this is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar part of Gods worship, to sweare by his name, Deut. 6.13. therefore it is a robberie vnto God, to giue that which is due to him, to any other. 4. In him by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we sweare, two things
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:20715:107"/>
are requisite: that he should both know and vnderstand the heart, and therefore is called as a witnesse, that in our heart we speake the truth; as also be able to take reuenge of him that sweareth falsly. But these two are onely incident vnto God, to know the heart, and he is the almightie and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudge, able as to conuince, so to punish all false swearers. 5. Wherefore we condemne that superstitious vse of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists, in swearing by Saints,<note place="margin">Cantr. It is not lawful to swear by Saints.</note> for so they robbe God of his honour: <hi>Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus, lib.</hi> 8. saith, <hi>Nec per regem iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus, perinde ac non alium deum crederemus, neque per for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunam, &amp;c. fit vti<expan>

                     </expan> vt nobis potius sit moriendum, quam per daemonis aliquid numen iureiurando confirmemus:</hi> Neither doe we sweare by the King, as though we beleeued no other God, nor by fortune, which is nothing, &amp;c. so that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that we ought rather to die, then to sweare by the power of any spirit. <hi>Plutarke</hi> propounding this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why the Romanes doe not suffer their children to sweare by <hi>Hercules</hi> within doores, but thrust them out, among other yeildeth this reason: <hi>Quia non est Deus indigena, sed peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus &amp; hospes:</hi> because he was not a countrey or natiue god, but a straunge and forren god: and for the same cause they sweare not by <hi>Bacchus</hi> in the house, because he also was a forren god. <hi>quaest. Roman.</hi> 28. The heathen had that light, that they would not sweare by those, whome they tooke not properly, naturally, and principally to be gods. It were a shame therefore for Christians to sweare by them that are no gods.</p>
               <p>Secondly, touching this example, wherein Dauid ioyneth both together, as <hi>Iehouah liueth, and thy soule liueth:</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, because they are both put together, that therfore Dauid sweareth by both. 1. As, Exod. 14.31. <hi>It is said, they beleeued Iehouah, and his seruant Moses:</hi> it can not be hence inferred, that we are to beleeue vpon Saints: to beleeue is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to both, but not in the same manner nor kind: for they beleeued in God as the author and performer of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, they gaue credit to Moses, as the faithfull minister, and seruant of God: so in these two clauses there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: Dauid sweareth by God as a witnesse of his heart, and as the Almightie and immortall Iudge; he onely protesteth by the life of Ionathan, that it was as certen, that he was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:20715:108"/>
as it was certaine he liued. 2. For in an oath there are two things to be considered, the certentie of the thing affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the penaltie, which he wisheth to himselfe, that sweareth falsely: the first may be declared without an oath, by solemne protestation, or liuely demonstration of some thing present, beside God: as when we say, It is as true, as thou liuest: or as the Sunne shineth, or is in the skie, or shall set or rise: which kinde of asseueration the Lord himselfe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, Ierem. 31.35. that as sure, as God gaue the Sunne to be a light for the day, and the courses of the moone and the starres, so surely should Israel be a people for euer. But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in calling him, by whome we sweare to be our witnesse and iudge, cannot be performed but by an oath, and that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the name of God: so that this speech of Dauid, <hi>As Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah liueth,</hi> is as much in effect, as he saith els where, <hi>So and more also doe God vnto the enemies of Dauid,</hi> 1. Sam. 25.22. which forme of oath afterward Dauid altereth thus, v. 34. <hi>As the Lord God of Israel liueth, &amp;c.</hi> 3. And that not this whole sentence, but the first clause of it, is onely Dauids oath it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, because sometimes, these clauses are diuided: the first beeing vsed apart by it selfe, is called an oath in Scripture: as c. 19.6. <hi>As Iehouah liueth, he shall not die:</hi> but the other vsed alone, <hi>as thy soule liueth,</hi> is neuer counted an oath, nor are they said to sweare, that so speake: as Anna, 1. Sam. 1.26. and Abner, c. 17.55.</p>

                  <hi>2. Quest.</hi> In what cases, and how it is lawfull pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, to take an oath.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Hieromes</hi> opinion is, that to sweare, <hi>quasi infirmis le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge fuit concessum,</hi> it was permitted in the law in respect of their weakenesse: that as they did sacrifice vnto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they should not sacrifice to idols and deuills, <hi>sic iurare permittuntur in Deum, non quod recte hoc facerent, sed quia melius est id exhibere deo, quam daemonibus:</hi> so they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to sweare by God, not that they therein did well, but because it was better to exhibite (an oath) vnto God, then vnto deuills: so is <hi>Hierome</hi> cited vpon the fift of Matth. <hi>Caus.</hi> 22. <hi>qu.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8. But if to sweare were an argument of weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and onely permitted in the old Testament; then should
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:20715:108"/>
there be no vse of it in the New: whereas the Prophet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the times of the Gospel, saith, <hi>He that sweareth in the earth, shall sweare by the God Amen,</hi> Isa. 65.16. was the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> weake, when he thus wrote: <hi>I call God for a record vnto my soule, that to spare you, I came not yet to Corinthus,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.23. Indeede to sweare sheweth weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, not in him that sweareth, but in him that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue without an oath: therefore the Lord hath confirmed his promise by an oath, for our more strong consolation: Hebr. 6.18. If not onely the people of God vnder the law, but now also vnder the kingdome of grace, haue <hi>strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation</hi> by the promise confirmed by Gods oath: then there is as well an vse of an oath now, as then.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now concerning the lawfull vse of an oath, as publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may be made before the Magistrate, for the deciding of controuersies, Hebr. 6.16. and betweene Magistrate and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, for the confirmation of some league and couenant, as Iaakob and Laban did sweare each to the other, Gen. 31. and by the Magistrate it may be made to the subiect, for the more securitie and safetie of his life, as Saul sware that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid should not die, c, 19.5. as Princes lawfully sweare at their coronation, for the obseruation of the nationall laws: As also by oath we may binde our selues vnto God, as Abraham did, that he would take nothing of the goods of the king of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>So also there is a lawfull vse of a priuate oath: and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in these three cases.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When in time of daunger a mutuall league and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is made, one not to forsake an other, as Dauid and Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan one sware vnto an other, v. 17. so one souldier may sweare to an other, to be faithfull vnto him in the battell, whether he liue or die.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An oath may be made betweene two priuate persons, for the performance of any seruice of waight and importance: so Eliah sware vnto Obadiah, that he would present himselfe that day vnto the king, 1. king. 18.15. In this case it is lawfull for one leauing the world, to take an oath of his Exequutor for the performance of his will, and testament: as Ioseph sware vnto Iaakob, that he would burie him in his fathers graue. Gen. 47.31.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:20715:109"/>3. Thirdly, a man may sweare priuately for the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or euidence of some truth, to cleare himselfe or to satisfie his brother, where the waight and necessitie of the cause re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it: as here Dauid by his oath doth assure Ionathan of the greatnes of the danger which he was in. And herein <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines</hi> rule is to be kept: <hi>quantum, ad me attinet, iuro, sed quantum mihi videtur magna necessitate compulsus, cum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deam non mihi credi, nisi faciam, &amp; ei, qui mihi non credit, non expedire, quod non credit:</hi> As for me, I sweare, but as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me, beeing forced thereunto by great necessitie, when I see I can not be beleeued vnlesse I doe it, and that it is not safe for him, which is hard of beleefe, that he beleeueth not. <hi>de verbis Apost. serm.</hi> 28. cited by <hi>Gratian. Caus.</hi> 22. <hi>qu.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 14. Both which did here concurre in Dauids oath: for he saw that Ionathan was very confident, that there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger toward Dauid, and therefore he bindeth it with an oath: and beside it was very materiall, not onely for Ionathan in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his loue to Dauid, but vnto Dauid in respect of his life, that Ionathan should be perswaded of this great danger.</p>
               <p n="4">4. First then seeing there is such a commendable, yea ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie vse of an oath, both publikely, and priuately: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists phantasticall opinion falleth to the ground, that allow not a Christian to take an oath before a Magistrate. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in an other extreame they are worthie of reprehension, that vse oathes vnnecessarily and prophanely in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talke: vsing more vnreuerently the name of God, then they would of a mortall man, the Prince, or their father, or of any other, whome they are bound vnto: who remember not the saying of our Sauiour, <hi>That whatsoeuer is more then yea, yea, nay, nay,</hi> (he meaneth in common talke) <hi>commeth of euill.</hi> Matth. 5.37.</p>

                  <hi>3. Quest. v. 3.</hi> Whether Ionathan sinned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in beeing so hard of beleefe, that his father inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mischeife toward him.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Some thinke that Ionathans affection might somewhat abate toward Dauid while he thought of the succession of the kingdome, which he beganne to consider, was likely to come to Dauid. <hi>Pellican.</hi> But no such thing can be imagined
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:20715:109"/>
of that good man: who loued Dauid, as his owne soule, and presently after, v. 4. he promiseth to doe for Dauid, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he desired. 2. Therefore it is rather to be imputed to the goodnes of Ionathans louing nature, who thought the best of his father: as <hi>loue thinketh not euill,</hi> as the Apostle saith, <hi>but beleeueth all things,</hi> 1. Cor. 13.5. that is, taketh and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all in the best part. And two reasons mooued Ionathan to be so confident: first, because his father had once spoken vnto him, to kill Dauid, but made no more mention of it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, which he thought he would haue done, if he had purposed any such thing, because he vsed to conceale nothing from him: <hi>Osiand.</hi> secondly, he builded vpon his fathers oath, which he had made, that Dauid should not die. <hi>Borr.</hi> 3. But Dauid did well, hauing had so often experience of Sauls hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, that he would trust him no further, as the saying is, then he saw him. And though he for the time behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as a Prophet, among the Prophets, yet Dauid not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause did mistrust him still. <hi>Pellican.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that Dauid shewed great weaknes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, beeing in a manner <hi>diuina consolatione destitutus,</hi> destitute of diuine comfort: as when he cried out at an other time, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers therefore doe excuse Dauid altogether, saying, <hi>Non pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat Dauid, etsi timeat,</hi> that Dauid sinned not, though he were afraid. <hi>Mart.</hi> But Dauid cannot here be altogether freed from humane infirmitie, and doubting: as the very words doe shew great passion, <hi>There is but a steppe betweene me and death:</hi> and Dauids doubtfull thoughts at an other time shew as much: when he said in his heart, <hi>I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul.</hi> c. 27.1. 3. Therefore I preferre the meane betweene these two, that as Dauid was not altogether voide of diuine
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:20715:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
consolation, so neither was he free from humane weaknes and infirmitie, yet so, as that he still did comfort himselfe in God, and relied vpon his promises: as it appeareth by the 59. Psal. which he made about this time immediatly vpon his escape, when Sauls men watched his house, and he was let downe by the window, as the title of the Psalme sheweth: in the which he thus professeth his faith and confidence, v. 9. <hi>I will waite vpon thee, for God is my defence.</hi> 4. But yet there is great difference betweene the feare of Dauid here, and the feare of other the seruants of God, and the feare of the wicked: and in these three points:<note place="margin">The difference betweene the feare of the faithfull and vnfaithfull.</note> 1. the one in their feare, yet doe not leaue their faith and confidence in God, though they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

The godly though they be in daunger, attempt no vnlawfull meanes; the wicked in their feare, care not how they may worke themselues out: as Saul fearing the losse of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, seeketh to kill Dauid. 3. The godly are not so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, but that in the middes of their feare, they omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appertaining to their dutie, which may helpe them, as here Dauid vseth Ionathan as a meane: but the wicked are at their witts ende, and knowe not which way to turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, casting all meanes aside, and resolue thus desperately, if we perish, we perish: as Hagar, when the water of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell was spent, sought no further, but in despaire cast the child aside a good way from her, because shee would not see his death.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:20715:111"/>
rather giueth it should be referred to the negatiue clause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going: <hi>if I doe not send and reueale, God doe so and so vnto me:</hi> better then God <hi>doe so and so to me, as I reueale, &amp;c.</hi> 2. An other reading is, to put it likewise in the vocatiue case: <hi>O Lord Iehovah, when I haue groped, &amp;c. if behold, it is well with Dauid, and I send not, &amp;c. the Lord doe so and more also vnto Ionathan, &amp;c.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I here rather preferre <hi>Vatablus</hi> sense: <hi>If I doe not shew thee mercie,</hi> then shew me no mercie, neither aliue nor dead: where the phrase, <hi>if I shew not mercie,</hi> is supplied out of the clause following, which is vsual in the Hebrue tongue, which is very curt and compendious.

                  <hi>12. Quest. v. 18.</hi> Why Dauid should be missed on the feast day, seeing Saul had so lately sought to kill him.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Some thinke that the historie is transposed: and that this fell out before Saul had sent to kill Dauid in his house, or that he had pursued him vnto Naioth where he prophesied: but that is not like: for the storie followeth in order, how while Saul was prophesying before Samuel, Dauid in the meane time escapeth, and goeth to Ionathan, at which time he had all this communication with him. 2. Others thinke, that Saul was obliuious, &amp; very forgetfull, by reason his head was diste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pered, &amp; would aske for Dauid, not remembring that he had so lately sought to kill him: as the Emperour <hi>Claudius</hi> was so forgetfull, that he would aske for them at the table, whome he had commanded before to be put to death: but though Saul might be ouertaken with such obliuion, Dauid was not, who first mooued this doubt, that his father would misse him. v. 5, 6. 3. Others are of opinion, that Dauid might be reconciled to Saul, yet he trusted him not, and therefore desireth that his absence might be excused: <hi>Mar.</hi> but Saul was not yet returned from Naioth, while Dauid had this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with Ionathan. 4. This therefore is more likely, that although Saul diuers times before in his fitts had attempted to kill Dauid, and cast his speare at him, c. 18.10. and c. 19.1. yet Dauid was brought into his presence againe to play be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, c. 19.10. &amp; he knew, that Saul in that regard, would specially misse him vpon the festiuall day: and this was the cause, why he desireth to be excused. And Saul also might i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that Dauid would forget the iniuries, which Saul did toward him, as he himselfe made small account of them: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the verse,

                  <hi>13. Quest. v. 25.</hi> Why Ionathan arose, the King sitting in his seate by the wall.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Some thinke that Abner came somewhat late, and Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan for honour and reuerence vnto him, gaue place, and so he sate next vnto the king: <hi>Vatab. Osian.</hi> but it is not like, that the kings eldest sonne would giue place to the captaine of the hoast, or that he would take it, specially in Sauls presence. 2. The Hebrewes thinke, that Dauid was woont to sit next vnto Saul, betweene Saul and Ionathan, and Dauid beeing absent, he resigned the place to Abner: so the Hebrewes: but it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that Dauid was set before the kings eldest sonne, though he were Sauls sonne in law: neither did any sit in Dauids place, for it was still emptie. 3. <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, that Ionathan sate on the right hand of the king, and Abner at the left: but this is vnlike also: for to giue the right hand was a signe of preheminence, and the cheife place, as Salomon placed his mother at his right hand, 1. king. 2.19. and it should seeme, that the kings seat was vppermost, next vnto the wall, and the rest sate at his right hand. 4. <hi>Iunius</hi> thinketh, that Ionathan in the Kings absence occupied his seate, and now at the kings comming, he riseth, and giueth place: but neither doth this seeme probable: 1. because it seemeth by the order of the words, that Saul was first set in his accustomed place, before Ionathan arose: 2. it appeareth by the wordes of the text, that Saul vsed onely to sit in the seat by the wall, <hi>and the king sate as at other times vpon his seate:</hi> 3. the wordes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Ionathan arose, and Abner sate by the kings side,</hi> shew that Abner sate next to the king, as Ionathan was woont to doe, who now beeing risen from that place, Abner was next to the king. 5.

               <p>Three causes may be rendred thereof. 1.

               <p n="1">1. Some excuse Dauid here that he told the truth, saying, <hi>that the King had commanded him a certaine thing:</hi> for indeed God the great king of heauen, had appointed him to be king: but neither doth it appeare that Dauid had any such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20715:116"/>
and if he had, he had deceiued Ahimelech notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, who vnderstood him to speake of the king. 2. Some doe excuse Dauids fact herein, that he did no more then any man would, that was in necessitie: and that neither he nor the Priest had done any thing vnlawfull: but that Doeg and Saul onely were the causes of the mischeife following: Dauid was the occasion, but taken, not giuen, as Christs fleeing into Egypt was the cause of the death of the infants. <hi>Mar.</hi> But if Dauid shewed some infirmitie in deuising an excuse, which was not true, which can not be auoided, then he must needes be in some fault also for the daunger that followed, seeing the Priest was induced by that pretense to doe as he did, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he came into that daunger. And further, if Dauid had not feared, nor thought of any such perill, that might haue ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had beene cleare: but seeing he himselfe suspected it, as he saith, <hi>he knew the same day Doeg would tell Saul,</hi> c. 22. 22. and yet did it: it can not but shew some infirmitie in him. Christs example is not like: for there Ioseph was admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Angel in his dreame to flee into Egypt: neither was the like daunger there foreseene, which was suspected and feared here. 3. Therefore, as Dauid himselfe confesseth, that he was the cause of the death of those persons: so we neede not feare to affirme it. And though our Sauiour iustifieth Dauids eating of the shew bread vpon this necessitie, as <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> reasoneth: yet euery circumstance of this action is not there iustified: though it were lawfull, hunger compelling him, to eate the shew bread, against the ceremoniall law: yet no necessitie was to compell him to tell an vntruth, against the morall law. I rather therefore herein subscribe to the iudgement of <hi>Pellican. Genevens.</hi> that this was an infirmitie of Dauid, to teach vs, <hi>that none hath his iustice of himselfe, but receiueth it of Gods mercie. Genevens.</hi> 4. And further, that Dauid committed here some ouersight, it may appeare by that place, 2. Sam. 23.15. where Dauid thirsting for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Bethlehem, as here he is hungrie, three men aduentured their liues to breake through the hoast of the Philistims, and brought vnto Dauid of that water, who would not drinke it, because it was the price of their blood, but powred it out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: there Dauid in the like necessitie would not drinke that water, the daunger beeing ouer, much lesse would he

                  <hi>7. Quest. v. 4.</hi> Whether it were lawfull for the Priest to giue vnto Dauid hallowed bread.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Seeing our Sauiour Christ doth iustifie and allow this fact of Dauid, Matth. 12.4. there can be no further doubt or question made thereof, but that Dauid might both safely eate thereof, the necessitie of hunger vrging him, and that the Priest might lawfully giue thereof vnto him. 2. The reason hereof is, that ceremonies and externall rites must giue place to charitie: for as the second table must giue place to the first, as Abraham beeing commanded of God to kill his sonne, (which he did in purpose and counsell) though it be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the second table to kill, yet Abraham was to yeild his obedience to God, which is commanded in the first table: so the ceremoniall law is wholly to giue place to the morall, when as both can not be kept together: as the health, life, and safetie of man, wherein our loue and charitie is seene, is to be preferred before a ceremonie: our Sauiour healed vpon the Sabboth day, because the ceremonie of rest, was to giue way vnto charitie: the Macchabees therefore were in error, that refused, necessitie so compelling, to fight vpon the Sabboth day: so here the Priest and Dauid both should haue sinned, if he should haue suffered Dauid to perish, and Dauid should haue chosen rather to die, then to eate of the hallowed bread. 3. And this libertie, which first was brought in by Christ, and by him communicated to his members, is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the will of the author and instituter of the ceremonies, who would haue all morall duties preferred before them: as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20715:117"/>
he saith, <hi>I will haue mercie, and not sacrifice.</hi> 4. Here then their superstition is reprooued,<note place="margin">The breach of ceremonies not to be more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then the breach of the morall law.</note> which preferre the obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ceremonies, before morall duties, as the Pharisies which neglected Gods commandements, to establish their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as if a Iewe should die, rather then eates swines flesh, in case of necessitie: or among the Papists, a Carthusian should choose rather to starue, then to eate flesh: so in Poperie, they will rather suffer their Priests and Votaries to burne in lust, and to commit vncleannes, then to permit them to marrie: they would punish a man more for eating flesh in Lent, then for committing fornication: which censuring of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of ceremoniall obseruations, beyond the breach of morall duties, is displeasing in the sight of God, wheresoeuer it is practised. 5. But yet this is a different case, when the breach of a ceremonie, carrieth with it the transgression of some morall dutie: for in that case a man ought rather to die, then to be forced to that transgression, where there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie: as the Iewes did well to offer themselues to death, beeing vrged by cruell Antiochus, then to eate swines flesh, because it would haue shewed a renouncing of the law, and flat disobedience to Gods commandement: so for a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to eate things sacrificed to Idols for his necessitie, when it may be done without offence, is lawfull, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, 1.

               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that this was a preposterous and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous question, as <hi>Hierome</hi> calleth it: for what if Dauid had not beene free from lying with women, namely with his wife: (for other women the Priest meaneth not, for Dauid beeing an holy man, the Priest could not suspect of inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinencie) would he haue suffered Dauid rather to starue, then to eate of the shew bread?

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:20715:118"/>
it: But this can not be denied, that by Moses law, there was an imputation of some legall vncleannes vnto carnall copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: as both appeareth by the analogie of that precept, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 19.15. where the people are commanded not to come at their wiues for three daies, beeing to appeare before the Lord in Mount Sinai: <hi>Iun.</hi> as also by that law, Leuit. 15.18. which place is truly translated thus: <hi>A woman, when a man lieth with her by carnall copulation, they shall both be washed with water:</hi> which place, though <hi>Pet. Mart.</hi> contend to be vnderstood of such as had a flux or running of their seede: yet by comparing it with Leuit. 18.20. it will appeare, to be taken in the other sense: where the same words, <hi>shichbath zaragh,</hi> is taken for carnall copulation, <hi>semen concubitus:</hi> But this was no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes in nature, but onely in the ceremonie, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the clensing and purgation, which was onely ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall by water. And the reason of this precept was, that by this meanes, they should liue temperately and soberly in mariage, and not giue themselues ouer vnto fleshly pleasure: seeing after euery such act they were vncleane to the euen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But in the other assertion, that this question propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Priest at this time, was rash and vnseasonable, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consent with <hi>P. Mart.</hi> then vnto <hi>Iunius,</hi> who seemeth to thinke, that the Priest consulted with God herein, and was directed by his oracle to require this preparation. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the Priest consulted with God for Dauid, c. 22.10. and it seemeth by the Lords appointment gaue him the victualls and the sword: but concerning that condition of legal puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Priest required it of himselfe: the Lord knew how it was with Dauid at that time, and what if Dauid had beene vncleane, he must not haue starued: and for as much as laie persons were vncleane by the law, in respect of eating of the hallowed bread, seeing necessitie dispensed with one part of the ceremonie, it might also with the rest.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As they are in one extreame, which will not admit so much as a legall impuritie, which is no disparagement to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, seeing the virgine Marie after that holy birth, was also purified according to the law, from a legal imputation: Luk. 2.22. So they are further wide in an other extreame, that would make it an Euangelicall impuritie, forbidding any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after such carnall knowledge, to communicate in

For if the duties of mariage hindred praier, then they must altogether be omitted, and so consequently mariage it selfe abolished, seeing we ought to pray continually, as the Apostle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, 1. Thess. 5.17. No day nor night is to be intermitted without praier: then by this reason, men that are married should refraine both day &amp; night. Indeed the Apostle would haue them that maried to abstaine for a time with consent, to giue themselues to fasting and praier, 1. Cor. 7.5. but he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth extraordinarie praier, such as is ioyned with fasting, not ordinarie and daily praier, which is not to be intermitted: then as abstinence is to be vsed from meate, to make our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers more feruent, so also from wiues: but the ordinarie exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of praier is no more hindred by matrimoniall duties, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with sobrietie, then by naturall offices in the sober vse of meate and drinke. Concerning the other point of such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence before the receiuing of the Sacrament: as I deny not, but sometime it may be conuenient, not in respect of any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes in the thing, but in regard of that intemperancie and lust, which often concurreth with it, so neither is such absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to be held necessarie for all: for if mariage be in it selfe an holy thing, as beeing of Gods institution, the vse of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in it selfe also is holy, beeing not by mans corruption de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed: as the Apostle saith, <hi>Mariage is honourable among all, and the bed vndefiled,</hi> Heb. 13.5. how then can that which is in it selfe, holy, honourable, and vndefiled, defile a man, and make him vnfit for holy things?

So they which can vse their strength in the other kinde of abstinence, doe therein well: yet here none are to be forced, but to be left vnto their godly discretion. In this point, that resolution of <hi>Gregorie</hi> is excellent: <hi>Si quis sua coniuge, non cupidine volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis captus, &amp;c.</hi> If any man vse his wife, not taken with lust of pleasure, but for procreation sake: <hi>de sumendo corporis &amp; sanguinis Dominici mysterio suo relinquendus est arbitrio, quia à nobis prohiberi non debet accipere, qui in igne positus nescit ardere:</hi> concerning the receiuing of the mysterie of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood of Christ, he is to be left to his owne discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, seeing he is not to be forbidden to take it, who can be in the fire and not burne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the Romanists doe yet presse this place further, that if it were required of Dauid, that he had kept himselfe from women, before he did eate of the hallowed bread: then it is fit that the Priests of the new Testament should alwaies abstaine, and be perpetuall virgins, seeing they continually consecrate the Sacrament: to this purpose <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of <hi>Hierom. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Cler. c.</hi> 19.</p>

Therefore we must not so much consider, what they write according to their owne fansies and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but how it is grounded vpon Scripture, that they write. 2.

                  <hi>8. Quest. v. 5.</hi> What Dauid meaneth, when he saith, The vessells of the young men were holy.</head>
               <p n="1">1. The most doe interpret these wordes of the bodies of the young men: for so are the bodies of Christians called ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells: as 1. Thess. 4.4. <hi>That euery one of you should know, how to possesse his vessell in holines and honour:</hi> and in the same sense, women are called the weaker vessells: <hi>sic Mar. Bor. Pellican. Genevens.</hi> and so they make this to be the meaning, that the young men had kept themselues from women, and so their vessells, that is, their bodies were holy. But Dauid had spoken before sufficiently of the purity of their bodies in that behalf, hauing said, that women had beene secluded from them three daies: for so long it was, since Dauid came from home, it was now the third day: therefore Dauid hauing signified so much in plaine tearmes, there was no cause he should deliuer the same againe in obscure words, seeing he was in hast, &amp; went in danger of his life, and had no time now to speake any thing superfluously. 2. <hi>Vatablus</hi> vnderstandeth their garments by their vessells: but there was no occasion offered for Dauid to speake of their cloathes: therefore <hi>Iunius</hi> better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth here by vessells, the instruments which were necessarie for their iourney, as their bagges and sachels, and such other necessary impleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: so is the word <hi>chelei,</hi> vessels, taken c. 9.7.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:20715:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>bread faileth in our vessells.</hi> Therefore whereas the Priest first asked, whether they were kept from women: Dauid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a full answer, that not onely their bodies were cleane, which should receiue the hallowed bread, but the vessells al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, wherein they should carrie the bread, were kept from pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. And that the vessells are taken in this sense, appeareth by the vse of the same word in the ende of the verse, where the <hi>bread</hi> is said <hi>to be sanctified in his vessell,</hi> that is, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes and instruments, wherein it was put.</p>

               <p n="2">2. But, the words are better translated, <hi>and it is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner common,</hi> that is, <hi>the bread:</hi> 1. for in that sense it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before, <hi>chol lechem,</hi> common bread: it is not like, that the Priest would speake in one sense, and Dauid in an other. 2.

That which is said to be prophane, is the same that is sanctified in the vessells, but the bread is said to be sanctified: for so v. 4. the opposition is
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:20715:121"/>
betweene <hi>chol lechem,</hi> and <hi>lechem kodesh,</hi> common bread, and hallowed bread: this then is the meaning, that <hi>the bread was in a manner common,</hi> that is, vnto the Priests, <hi>specially seeing that</hi> (for so the wordes <hi>veaph chi,</hi> rather signifie, then <hi>how much more: Iun. A.P.</hi>) other bread, <hi>was sanctified in the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells:</hi> that is, vpon the Sabboth new hote bread was consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the old was taken away for the Priests vse. <hi>Iun.</hi> This to be the best interpretation is euident, both by Ahimelechs question before-going, and by the words following: for Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech made two exceptions to Dauids motion: first, the bread was hallowed bread, and so not for any but the Priests to eate of: and then, it might be that they were not cleane from women. Dauid answeareth to both these: for the second which he toucheth first, he answeareth, that not onely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues were cleane in that behalfe, but the vessels also and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of their iourney were pure: for the first he telleth the Priest, that the hallowed bread, when it was taken from the dishes, and other put in place thereof, was in a manner as common bread to the Priests, and so it might be lawfull for Dauid also in respect of his necessitie to eate thereof. The words also following shew this to be the meaning, where mention is made of taking away the shew bread the same day from before the Lord, and putting hote bread in stead thereof. v. 6.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The most doe so take these words, as though the Priest should describe the place, where Goliaths sword lay wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp in a cloath, behinde the place, where the Ephod, the high Priests garment lay. <hi>Genevens.

Dauid tooke it not: which it should seeme he did, if these words did cary any such sense. 2. Therfore the meaning rather is, <hi>after the Ephod,</hi> that is, after he had applied the Ephod and consulted with God: whereof mention is made, c. 22.10. but in no place but this, is it touched, that he consulted with God: beside thus interpret the <hi>Chalde,</hi> and one <hi>Ieshaia</hi> an Hebrew interpreter: the like phrase also see Deut. 24.20. thou shalt <hi>not gather the grapes after thee,</hi> that is, after thou hast made an ende of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering. <hi>Iun.</hi>

But, although it be acknowledged, that it was Dauids o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersight, in the presence of Doeg, whom he suspected, to aske and receiue these things of the Priest, as is shewed before, v. 4. And beside, it might haue giuen occasion also to haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungered Dauids person among the Philistims, when they saw Goliaths sword: yet simply in vsing the sword, there bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other, Dauid is excused by his necessitie, as before in taking of the shew bread. As the Iewes to redeeme their peace, gaue vnto the Chaldeans the vessels of siluer and gold, and were not reprooued therefore by the Prophets. And who doubteth but that the Church may and ought, where there is no other remedie, to sell the Church vessels to redeeme poore captiues. <hi>Mart.</hi> Beside, Dauid tooke this sword the rather, to put him in minde of Gods former deliuerance, that he might by the sight thereof be stirred vp to waite vpon him still. <hi>Osiand.</hi> And further it is not vnlike, but that Dauid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when he was King, restored this monument againe. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:20715:123"/>2. Now to decide this question, whether Dauid did well herein, many things must be considered. 1. There is great difference to be made betweene dissembling in words, which properly is to lie, and in signes: for signes are not so properly ordained to expresse the minde, as words are: it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a man to dissemble in his behauiour, when he can not in speech. 2. There are three things in the act of semblance or dissimulation to be obserued, the minde of him that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth, the thing and subiect wherein, and the ende: for first, if he dissembleth to saue himselfe, of a distrustfull or diffident minde, he sinneth: not, if vsing this as a meane, he still depend vpon God, and trust in him: as Dauid did in this place, as is euident, Psal. 34.6. <hi>He cried still vnto God,</hi> euen when he chaunged his behauiour, as the title of the Psalme sheweth: secondly, in some things it is vtterly vnlawfull to dissemble, as in religious matters: as for a man to make a shew of religion, to aspire to honour, as hypocrites doe: as Simon Magus was baptized: or for one to dissemble his religion, as to bow to an Idol, which he hateth in his heart: thirdly, if his dissimulation tend to an vncharitable ende: as Cain spake faire to his brother, to entise him into the field, there to kill him. If the outward semblance or pretense, which one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth faileth in any of these, it is vnlawfull: otherwise it is not condemned: as Dauid obserued all three: he put his trust in God, it was not in any religious matter, which tended to the deniall of his faith, but in his ciuill behauiour: neither did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny receiue hurt thereby, but he intended his own deliuerance without dammage to any. So our Sauiour vsed a kind of sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, when to take triall of the disciples humanitie, he made shew, as though he would haue gone further: but Peter of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and was iustly reprooued of S. Paul, Gal. 2. that in a religious matter dissembled, withdrawing himselfe from the Gentiles, with whome he had eaten before, for feare of them of the circumcision, and so made a difference betweene the beleeuing Iewes, and the beleeuing Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some to excuse this fact of Dauid, say, that for the time Dauid was striken with a fitt of madnesse or frensie indeede, and so dissembled not: but the text, shewing that Dauid cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his behauiour, maketh it his owne voluntarie act: some say, that Dauid did it by a diuine instinct. <hi>Pellican.</hi> But we
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:20715:123"/>
not seeke any other defence, then this before alleadged, taken from the manner and nature of this dissimulation. Some make herein Dauid a type and figure of Christ, who was counted of the Iewes as a Demoniake, and one beside himselfe: and S. Paul sheweth, that the Gospel was esteemed as foolishnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Grecians. 1. Cor. 1.23.</p>

               <p n="1">1. There are three things which must concurre in the tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a lie: first, that there be vntruth in the matter, which is vttered: secondly, that he which telleth an vntruth, haue a purpose to deceiue: thirdly, that he take a pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it: the first belongeth to the matter of a lie, the other concerne the forme. <hi>Mart.</hi> But these three are thus further to be distinguished: that in euery kinde of lie all these are not necessarie: as the first, and the third: for if a man haue a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to deceiue, though vnwittingly he speake the truth, he is guiltie of a lie: as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

So the third is wanting in some kinde of lie: as when one lieth of necessitie, to saue his owne life, or his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but without the second there can be no lie: as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> saith, <hi>Qui dicit falsum, quod putat verum, non fallit, sed fallitur, non ita<expan>

As if a man receiue a sword of one, and promise to deliuer it againe, and afterward the owner of the sword beeing madde, requireth it, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth to restore it: in this case he is no lyer nor deceiuer: for he did not once dreame, <hi>furentem posse repetere,</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

The sixth kinde is, <hi>quod nulli obest, &amp; prodest alicui:</hi> which hurteth none, and yet profiteth some: which is of three sorts, either when a man by his lie preserueth his owne life, or chastitie, or saueth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers goods or life: so <hi>Augustine</hi> maketh eight kinds of all: the worst he maketh the first, and so the rest in their degree, as they come nearer to,<note place="margin">

But none of them are lawfull: the first is a detestable kind of lying: the second is vnlawfull, because we must not doe wrong to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: the third, <hi>quia nulli cum alterius iniuria consulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est:</hi> we must not prouide for one with an others hurt: in the fourth, the very desire and minde to lie is vitious: and for the fifth, seeing the truth must not be vttered to please men, much lesse must we lie to please men.

               <p n="3">3. But all these kinds are more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pendiously reduced to 3. heads.

A pernicious lie, is either in matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is worst
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:20715:124"/>
of all, as Ananias and Saphira lied vnto Peter concerning such things as was giuen to the religious vse of the Church, Act. 5. and Peter lied in denying his Lord and Master: or it is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humane and ciuill affaires: wherein a lie is pernicious to others, or to the lier himselfe: to others it is more pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when hurt onely commeth by the lie, and no good to to any, as Doeg accusing the high Priest, as though he had conspired with Dauid against Saul, c. 22.1 3. not making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how Dauid induced the high Priest to doe as he did, comming in the Kings name: this lie was mischieuous alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: the lesse pernicious, when good commeth to some, but with hurt and damage to others: as Dauid vttering an vntruth to Ahimelech, that he came vpon the kings busines, did helpe himselfe, but brought Ahimelech into daunger. The lie pernicious vnto a man himselfe is, when he lieth, not for any aduantage, but vpon a custome and delight, which he hath in lying: as the old Prophet lied vnto the man of God, to bring him backe to eate bread: by which lie, no profit or aduantage at all did accrue vnto him. 1. king. 13. The fifth kinde, is <hi>iocosum mendacium:</hi> an vntruth vttered meerely not in earnest, as Iosephs steward, when he had found his masters cup in Benjamins sacke, made them beleeue, that his master could diuine. Gen. 44.5. The sixt belongeth to the officious kinde of lying: whereby either one doth good to themselues, as Rachel by her sodaine and present excuse, (if it were not with her as shee pretended, for otherwise it was not vntruth at all) deliuered her selfe from the blame of her father: or they doe good to others, as the midwiues in preseruing the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes children, and Rahab, in deliuering the spies from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Iosh. 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now euen these two sorts of glosing, which is either in sport, or to doe good, though they be more tolerable then the rest, yet are not simply iustifiable: as may appeare by these reasons: 1. according to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, none must doe euill, that good come may come thereof: for then a man might steale, to giue almes with, as well as to tell a lie to doe good. 2. it hindreth the common societie, when faith and truth is not preserued among men. 3. it bringeth such into euill name, that vpon what good pretense so euer, they sometime tell a lie, they bring themselues into suspition, and loose their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:20715:125"/>
that afterward, when they speake the truth, they can not be beleeued. <hi>Mar. Augustines</hi> resolution is here excellent: <hi>Duo sunt mendaciorum genera,</hi>

               <p n="5">5. So then we may safely subscribe vnto <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgement, concerning the nature of a lie: <hi>quisquis esse aliquod genus mendacij, quod peccatum non sit putarit, seipsum decipit:</hi> who so thinketh there is any kinde of lie, which is not sinne, deceiueth himselfe: which his iudgement is agreeable to the Scripture, for the Apostle saith, <hi>no lie is of the truth,</hi> 1. Ioh. 2.21. This conclusion then is most true, that euery lie is sinne: but euery thing, that may be taken for a lie, is not a lie: wherein these distinctions are to be obserued: 1. that there is great difference betweene semblance in gesture and behauiour, and vntruth in wordes: it may be lawfull to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, when it is not to lie, as is shewed before in the 13. qu. 2. that which containeth some vntruth in words, is not to be held to be a lie, where there is no minde nor purpose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, as is before shewed in the beginning of this question. 3. as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>aliud est mentiri, aliud verum occulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re:</hi> it is one thing to lie, an other to hide and conceale the truth, which at all times, and to all persons, is not to be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: whether by silence altogether to keepe the truth secret, as our blessed Sauiour did before Pilate, beeing asked what the truth was: or in part to forbeare, not vttering the whole truth, as Samuel did, when going to anoint Dauid king in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shai his house, he said he went to sacrifice. 4. the last consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is, that no man take a libertie to lie, by the example of some of the Patriarkes and Fathers vnder the law: for he which pretendeth any such defense, may as well say, <hi>sibi rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum alienarum rerum, &amp; retributionem iniuriae, quae infirmis illis concessa sunt,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. It may well be, that all those, which came flocking to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, to the number of 4. hundreth, came not all with a sincere

Chron. 12.17. that if they came peaceably vnto him, his heart should be knit vnto them; but if they came to betray him to his aduersaries, God would behold and rebuke it: <hi>Iosephus</hi> also saith, that some came, <hi>rerum nouarum cupidi,</hi> beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of chaunge and nouelties. But if any such came vnto Dauid vpon any sinister pretense, it made not Dauids cause the worse: our Sauiour had one Iudas among his Apostles, and some followed him onely to see his miracles, and now many hypocrites seeme to professe the Gospel: yet is not the cause and profession it selfe thereby disgraced. <hi>Martyr.</hi> 2. But howsoeuer some of them might come rather to seeke their owne, then Dauids wealth, yet their cause was good in generall: they were not such a band of ruffians and rakehels, as wicked Ahimelech hired to kill his seuentie brethren, Iud. 9. but such as were oppressed and wronged, and perplexed in minde, and vnder the extortioners hand: the most read, <hi>cui e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat creditor,</hi> he that had a creditor, and was endebted: which some excuse thus, that these indebted could not obtaine their right, and so fell into other mens daunger: or beeing in debt, if they had possessions and lands, those might satisfie their creditors: if they had nothing, their owne tenuitie and poore estate might excuse them. <hi>Mar.</hi> But the word <hi>nosheh</hi> of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha,</hi> signifieth also an oppressour, extortionour: and such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons endebted are vnderstood, which were vnder the extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner and vsurers hand: <hi>Iun.</hi> that were cruelly handled and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted vpon for their debts. 3.

The Church of God was to be nourished in the hope and expectation of the Messiah, by the reuiuing of prophesies: but now Messiah is exhibited to his Church. 2. The visible Church of God then was limited vnto one nation, vnto whome Prophets might be sent, whereas now the Church is dispersed ouer the world. 3. The people of Israel, beeing then the visible Church, and so hated and enuied of the whole world, in that respect had neede of Prophets to be encouraged by them. 4.

They had then onely the fiue bookes of Moses first, and afterward the Prophets: and till the Scriptures were full, a supplie was to be made by Prophets: for after the books of the Prophets were written, and added to Moses, after Malachies time, they had no more Prophets: much lesse now, the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beeing ioyned to the old, to make the Scriptures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, hath the Church of God the like neede of Prophets. <hi>Mart.</hi>

Some read thus, Saul remained in Gibeah vnder a tree in Ramah: making both of them proper names, <hi>Gibeah</hi> and <hi>Ramah:</hi> so read the most: but Gibeah and Ramah were farre a sunder: for Saul dwelt in Gibeah of Benjamin, called also Gibeah of Saul: and Samuel dwelt at Ramah, 1.

This Doeg beeing an Edomite, is an enemie to Dauid a true Israelite, as Esau before was to Israel: wherein he doth shew himselfe to be a right Edomite or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauite. 3. Doeg in this his tale, sheweth his malice: in that he taketh all that Dauid did in the worst part: concealing that which might make for Dauid and Ahimelech, and vrging that which was against him: he maketh mention how Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech consulted with God for Dauid: but sheweth not wherein, as how by Gods direction he gaue him the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, and the sword: <hi>Iun.</hi> beside, he is a manifest lyer, and false accuser, as Dauid chargeth him: <hi>thou doest loue euill more then good, and lies more then to speake the truth,</hi> Psal. 52.3.

But it may seeme strange that Ahimelech made no mention of the excuse that Dauid made, that he came about the kings busines, which had beene a materiall point to cleare the Priest: <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh that Ahimelech did expresse so much: some thinke, that all which Ahimelech spake, is not set downe: some, that Ahimelech suppressed it of purpose, least afterward, if Dauid should haue beene recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled

But whereas the Lord answeareth, that Saul would come downe to Keilah, and that the men of Keilah would deliuer him into Sauls hands, and yet neither of these came to passe, for vpon Dauids departure Saul also ceased his pursuit: hence it can not be inferred, that the predictions of God are vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:<note place="margin">Reconcil.</note> for the Lords answear is here to be vnderstood condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally: that those things should certenly come to passe, if Dauid staied there: so the Lord speaketh of that purpose, which he saw alreadie to be in Saul, not of the act it selfe.

Some would free Dauid here from all doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Gods promises: and thinke he feared either because of the people, which were with him, or in regard of Saul, whom he was afraid, beeing the Lords anointed, to deale against: and whereas the Prophet saith, Psal. 116.11. <hi>I said in my hast, that all men are liers,</hi> they referre it to the treacherie of the Ziphims: and will not haue it so vnderstood, as though Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid beganne to thinke of Samuel, that he was as other men, and might haue deceiued him. <hi>Mar.</hi> But the meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both is best: that Dauid neither despaired of Gods promise: for thus he saith, <hi>I beleeued, therefore I spake,</hi> Psal. 116.10. neither yet was he free from some perplexitie, and doubtfulnes of minde: for he was in feare to be swallowed vp of death, <hi>The snares of death compassed me,</hi> v. 3. and the same word which is here vsed, <hi>chaphaz,</hi> he made hast to escape, Dauid expresseth there: <hi>I said in my hast, all men are liers.</hi> As in his bodie he made hast to escape, so in the heate of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he was hastie, as doubting somewhat of Samuel: <hi>Iun.</hi> but beeing thus plunged betweene hope and feare, he soone recouereth himselfe againe.

               <p n="1">1. Some ascribe this vnto Sauls valiant minde, and the loue of his countrey, preferring the common safetie before his priuate grudge and hatred. <hi>Pellican. Iosephus</hi> also affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the same, that it proceeded from an inward resolution that Saul had, that it was better to goe against the common aduersarie, then in pursuing his domesticall enemie, to leaue the countrey to the spoile of the Philistims. But it appeareth that Saul did it not of any good minde, or care which he had: for before this, when Dauid had rescued Keilah from the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims, and had giuen them a great ouerthrow, Saul tooke occasion presently after that victorie to pursue Dauid: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if he had preferred the publike busines, he should haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after the common aduersarie, and let Dauid alone. 2. Therefore this was rather the Lords worke, that pulled away Saul against his owne inclination, as Senacherib was called by the like occasion from besieging Ierusalem, when he heard that Tirhakah king of Ethiopia was come out against him. 2.

               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:20715:136"/>
this speech of his men, went with a purpose to haue killed him, but that as he went he bethought himselfe otherwise: but it is not like that Dauid had any such cogitation against Saul, both by his answer which he maketh presently vnto them, and by his resolution afterward in the like case, c. 26.10. this businesse required hast, and therefore it is not like, that there was such a sodaine alteration in Dauids minde. 2. Now Dauid might easily cut off the lappe of his garment, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that he had laid it aside, or the tumult of the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers without, might drowne the noise within: <hi>Mar.</hi> or rather, seeing the phrase is, that Saul couered his feete (for it was their vse, when they did their easement, to couer both their head and feete, and all the bodie for comelines sake, <hi>Pellican.</hi> that it was Sauls vpper garment or robe, which he had cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, so that Dauid might cut off the outward lappe thereof, without beeing felt or perceiued. 3. Now concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this fact, because Dauids heart smote him: the Iewes thinke, that Dauid offended therein, and therefore it was laid as a punishment vpon him afterward, that in his olde age Dauids cloathes could not keepe him warme, because he had cut off a peece of Sauls garment: but this is a cold conceit of theirs. Some thinke, that it is the propertie and condition of a good and tender heart, euen to be afraid, where there is no cause: but that is not so neither: for a Christian ought to be assured of all his actions, that they are pleasing vnto God: therefore Dauids heart smote him at the first in these two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, both for that it was his owne priuate cause, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Sauls person, because he was the Lords anointed. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevens.</hi> But afterward Dauid considering, that by this meanes he did both shew his innocencie, and that Saul was thereby reclaimed from pursuing of Dauid, he then vnderstood, that he had not done herein any thing displeasing vnto God. <hi>Mart.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Dauid vseth two reasons to content them, because they looked he should haue killed Saul, both that an ende might be made of their trauaile and warfare, and that Dauid might the sooner come vnto his kingdome: the first is, because Saul
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:20715:136"/>
was his lord and master, and therefore nothing ought to be attempted against him: but the other reason was more force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and therefore he twice repeateth it, he was the Lords anointed. God had aduanced him to that place of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he would not remooue him. Thus did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles behaue themselues vnder the cruell Emperour Nero, and the Christians in the primitiue Church vnder the heathen persecutors: they would not attempt any thing against the life and state of the Magistrates, though they were persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but leaue them to the iudgement of the Lord. Of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spirit are the Romanists now, who haue encouraged subiects to take armes against their Prince, yea to conspire their death. 2. But whereas Dauid so much vrgeth, that Saul was the Lords anointed: the signe is taken for the thing signified: the anointing was a signe of those inward graces, wherewith they which were anointed, were made fit for their gouernment: and it was a signe of their high and sacred au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: But the inward anointing did not depend vpon the outward: God did conferre his spirituall graces, without that ceremonie: as Christ is called the Messiah, the Anointed of God: therefore that externall ceremonie of Anointing is not alwaies necessarie. As then the inward anointing is sufficient without the outward,<note place="margin">Contr. Against the anointing of Popish priests.</note> so the outward is nothing without the inward. Therefore the Papall shauelings, that so much stand vpon their greasing, shauing, and anointing, and therby plead immunitie, doe but deceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues and others, seeing they are not the anointed of the Lord: but enemies vnto Christ the true Anointed, and his Gospel. <hi>Mart.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Some doe thinke, that it had beene lawfull for Dauid, (though they confesse it was not expedient) to haue taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Sauls life: because Dauid was now the Anointed king, and Saul was vnworthie to raigne, hauing executed such cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie vpon the Priests: and because he sought Dauids life, therefore it was lawfull to repell violence by violence. But these reasons shew it not: for though Dauid were Anointed, he was not yet possessed of the kingdome: he was to expect
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:20715:137"/>
till God saw his time to accomplish his promise. Saul had committed many outrages, yet Dauid was not to see him corrected, but to leaue him to the Lords iudgement: and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence is not alwaies to be put of with violence, but when there is no other way to escape. God found out other waies whereby Dauid escaped, therefore he was not driuen vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such straight. 2. It was not therefore lawfull for Dauid to lay violent hands vpon Saul, because he should haue taken reuenge into his owne hands, which belongeth vnto God: he should haue brought the Common-wealth into daunger by ciuill dissension: by this meanes he would haue raised a skan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall against himselfe, that he attained vnto the kingdome by blood: and it would haue beene dangerous to his owne state and person: others would haue thought they might haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the like against him, when he should be King. <hi>Mar.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. As there be many things, which make a man bold, as riches, honour, fauour; so there is nothing which worketh such boldnes and confidence, as the testimonie of ones inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and the witnesse of a good conscience: as here Dauid beeing thus inwardly armed, steppeth boldly out of the caue, and calleth after Saul. <hi>Borr.</hi> 2.

Dauid vseth these arguments to qualifie the rage of Saul toward him: first, his humilitie, which appeared in bowing himselfe to the earth, v. 9. and in his speech, in calling him his lord and king: his innocencie, which against the vaine words of false accusers, he prooueth by his present fact, in sparing Sauls life, when he might haue killed him: which he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate by the lap of his garment, v. 11, 12. then by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he appealeth to the Lords iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, v. 13. by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall fruits, which would haue bin wicked &amp; euill, if he had beene lewdly giuen; which he prooueth by that vsuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, v. 14.

But Dauids meaning is, that Saul was deliuered into his hand, in respect of the opportunitie and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion which was offred, which Dauid in all likelihood might haue taken, if God had not staied him. God then deliuered Saul, not to that ende, that he should lay hands vpon him: but to make triall of Dauids patience and charitie, and to make manifest his innocencie. 4. God sometime is said to offer one into a mans hands, in regard of the present action, as when one is slaine, his life beeing not before sought: Exod. 22.13. sometime in respect of the occasion and opportunitie onely: which opportunitie somtime not to take, is sinne, as in Ahab, who let Benhadad goe, whome the Lord had deliuered into his hand, and appointed to destruction: 1. king. 20. sometime to take it, is imputed for sinne; because such occasion is onely offered for triall and probation: as here Dauid should haue done euill, if he had apprehended this present occasion.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

But it seemeth both by Sauls accusing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, his acknowledgement that Dauid should be king, his instance in making Dauid to sweare vnto him, that Saul was touched in deede. 2. For the wicked though they haue no true feeling of their sinnes, yet may sometime be mooued in conscience, though it continue not long: as Pharaoh confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Moses, that he had sinned, and Iudas also knew that he had sinned in betraying the innocent blood: for by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of nature, the conscience doth in some degree both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse and accuse, as the Apostle sheweth, Rom. 2.14, 15.

               <p n="1">1. THough Saul hated Samuel, because he had told him, that the Lord had cast him off, yet he had no power to hurt him: for Samuel was of great authoritie, both because he was the Lords Prophet, and for that he had beene the Iudge and gouernour of Israel, and had gouerned them iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:20715:139"/>
as also Samuel had giuen vp the politike administration, &amp; betaken him to a priuate life in the schoole of the Prophets: and therefore Saul the lesse regarded him: but most of all the Lord kept Saul from doing any violence to Samuel. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.

But this can not stand: for Samuel was at the least 20. yeares Iudge alone, as it may appeare, c. 6.2. and Saul and Samuel had but 40. yeares betweene them: Act. 13.21. then if Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el iudged Israel 20. yeares, and died in the 18. yeare of Saul, there should remaine yet two yeares of the 40. yeares vnder Saul and Samuel: therefore the opinion of some Hebrewes is false, that Saul raigned but seauen moneths after Samuels death: for after this Dauid soiourned a yeare among the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims, c. 27.7. <hi>ex Pellican.</hi> see more hereof, qu. 2. c. 12. 4.

               <p n="1">1. The people had great cause to mourne for Samuel, the Lords Prophet, and an vpright man: and at this time two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities happened together: the death of Samuel so great a Prophet, and the exile of Dauid: <hi>Mar.</hi> and not long after Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels death, the Philistims preuailed against Saul, when he and his three sonnes died in battell, who were kept vnder while Samuel liued: it is not like that Saul was either present, or mourned for Samuel, as he had done for Saul: yet he did forbeare, in this publike lamentation to pursue Dauid: and therefore he taketh this opportunitie to escape to the vtmost parts of the land, while they were busied about the buriall of Samuel. <hi>Iun.</hi> 2. There was a very great assembly of all Israel to honour Samuels funerall: for the bodies of the Saints are to be interred after a comely sort, and according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts while they liued, to be brought vnto the ground with
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:20715:139"/>
honourable solemnitie. But here therefore two extreames are to be shunned: that neither the bodies of Christians should be neglected, and cast away as vncleane, as among some heathen, which had no opinion of the immortalitie of the soule, they made small account of the dead: and vnder the Pagane Emperours of Rome, they suffered the bodies of Christians to lie vnburied: and the like disgrace vnder the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Popes of Rome, therein following the steppes of their predecessours, hath beene offered vnto Gods Saints, both keeping them from buriall, and raking their bones out of their graues: whereas the bodies of Christians, in hope of the resurrection, as the temples of the holy Ghost, should with reuerence be commended and committed vnto Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an sepulture. 3. The other extreame, is in the superfluous and vnnecessarie cost, which is bestowed vpon the sepulchres of the dead: as the kings of Egypt had their costly Pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and Queene Artemisia made for her husband, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tombe <hi>mausoleum,</hi> famous ouer the world. In time of Poperie they shrined them in siluer, and cloath of gold:<note place="margin">Contr. Against the adoration of the dead.</note> and grew to further superstition to adore the reliques of the dead: to inuocate them, as their patrons: whereas no such seruice was done vnder the law vnto Samuel, or any of the Prophets: neither did Christ, or his Apostles euer command any such thing to be done. This superstition euen <hi>Cicero</hi> misliked, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing onely the instinct and light of naturall reason: for thus he writeth, 1. <hi>Philippic. An me censetis P. C. decreturum fuisse, vt parentalia cum supplicationibus iungerentur, vt inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piabiles religiones in rempublicam inducerentur, vt decerneren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur supplicationes mortuorum: adduci non possum vt quenqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mortuorum adiungerem, cum deorum immortalium religione:</hi> Doe ye thinke, honourable fathers, that I would haue decreed that funeralls should be ioyned with supplications, that inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piable religions should be brought into the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: that the praier to the dead should be decreed: I can not be induced to ioyne any of the dead with the religion of the immortall gods. Thus much <hi>Cicero</hi> one of the heathen Romanists: our Christened Romanists may be ashamed then of their grosse superstition, and wilfull blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse herein. 4. Beside, as they praied not here to Samuel, so neither praied they for Samuel: for the dead are neither to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:20715:140"/>
be praied vnto, nor yet praied for. We read that the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes, Abraham, Isaak, Iaakob, were mourned for when they died: so were the Prophets Moses, Samuel, with others: yet praiers and supplications were made for none of them: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an other superstition of Poperie is discouered concerning Purgatorie: if they answer, that there was no Purgatorie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ;<note place="margin">Contr.

               <p n="1">1. Nabal is described by his place of dwelling in Maon; who kept his cattell in Carmel, where his busines lay: for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Ziph, and Carmel, were not farre asunder, Iosh. 15.53. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel signifieth generally any place tilled or planted: it was the proper name of two places, one in Isachar, where Baals priests were slaine, an other in Iudah, which was this. <hi>Mar.</hi> Further, he is set forth by his name, which signifieth, a foole; by his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, by his qualities, he was churlish, and euill conditioned: riches, where Gods grace is not bestowed withall, make men proud and insolent: by his kinred, he was of the posteritie of Caleb: good men haue not alwaies good issue: parents may leaue vnto their children, riches, and possessions, but they can not bequeath them wisdome, vnderstanding, pietie: for these gifts haue an other beginning, they proceede from God: and if there might be a certaine descent of these spirituall graces, as of temporall, they would be thought to be naturall. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. Concerning <hi>Abigail,</hi> whose name is interpreted the ioy of the father, shee beeing a vertuous woman, was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally matched with a wicked husband: <hi>Ambrose</hi> hereof maketh this allegorie: that this Abigail doth signifie the Church, which first serued vnder a foolish and vnwise hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the Philosophers, and other vaine men among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, but after was ioyned in mariage vnto Christ, as Abigail became Dauids wife. But this figure holdeth not in euery point: for Abigail was a beautifull and wise woman, before

                  <hi>4. Quest. v. 5.</hi> Of Dauids salutation, which he sendeth vnto Nabal.</head>
               <p>First, the word is <hi>lechai,</hi> which is diuersly interpreted. 1. Some read, <hi>to my brethren. L.</hi> but then it should be <hi>leachi,</hi> as Numb. 6.7. not <hi>lechai.</hi> 2. Others thus, <hi>thus say vnto him, beeing liuing,</hi> that is, in good health: <hi>Iun.</hi> that if they found him well, they should then wish continuance of health and prosperitie to himselfe, and all he had: but it is like that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid knew before he sent, that Nabal was in health, because he heard, that he kept a sheepshearing feast, which beeing a time of mirth would not haue beene solemnized, if Nabal the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the house had not beene well. 3. Therefore the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reading is, <hi>per vitam. C.</hi> or <hi>ad vitam. A.P.</hi> that is, during thy life, I wish thee this prosperitie: so also <hi>Ioseph.</hi> and <hi>Vatab. so maiest thou liue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Dauid in this his salutation omitteth nothing, whereby he might insinuate himselfe vnto Nabal. 1. It should be a worke of mercie, to haue compassion on them in their want. 2. It was honest, because they had deserued it in in guarding and keeping his cattell. 3. It was an easie matter for him to doe at this time, seeing he made a feast: and he prescribed not what he should send, but as he thought good himselfe. 4. It would be profitable for Nabal: for they might be a safegard to him and his still. <hi>Mar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, here we may see the fickle and vncertaine state of the world: how fooles are many times rich, and wise men poore: <hi>I haue seene,</hi> saith the Preacher, <hi>seruants on horses, and Princes walking on foote,</hi> c. 10.7. that is, men of small vertue and vnderstanding aduanced, and men of great desert in low and meane estate: as it was strange here, that Dauid should become a suiter vnto Nabal for his releefe: thus we see that Gods fauour is not to be measured or esteemed by riches or pouertie. <hi>Mar.</hi>

So Nabal doth euery way disgrace Dauid: first, he setteth light by his person: saying, who is Dauid: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth him, that was the Lords anointed, that killed Goliath, and had defended the people of God many times against the Philistims, whome Saul himselfe immediatly before had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed should be king: he was also of Nabals owne tribe: and yet he despiseth &amp; contemneth him: and preferreth his sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards and sheepeshearers before him. Then he also slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his cause, making both himselfe and all those which were with him, no better then runnagates from their masters: and secretly taxeth Dauid himselfe for leauing the king his master. <hi>Osiand.</hi> Further, he maketh as though his request were vniust and vnreasonable, because he would haue that which was prouided for others. <hi>Mart.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. It may seeme straunge, that Dauid, who with patience did beare the wrongs which Saul offered him: and afterward the rayling of Shemei: yet could not forbeare at this time, but armeth himselfe to take reuenge: the reason that moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him was both the ingratitude of Nabal, rendring vnto him euill for good, as Dauid himselfe saith, v. 21. and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie and contumelie, which Nabal euill requited Dauid with in words: hereof it is, that men can with greater patience endure violence offered to their bodies, then contumelies and reproches to their good name: because as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, the one concerneth but the outward man, the other toucheth the inward part, the very soule and minde. 2. Yet although such cause were giuen to Dauid, he diuersly offendeth: 1. in his hast, that without any further consultation he purposeth to take reuenge: 2. in his rash oath, that vnaduisedly in his rage bindeth himselfe to finish that, which he had inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately purposed: 3. in that he purposeth to destroy all, euen that pissed against the wall, that is, to the very dogge: for the offence of one he would bring this calamitie vpon the whole

house: for though Nabal had committed this villanie, yet what had the women, and the seruants offended? 3. Some doe excuse Dauid, that he did this by the motion and stirring of the spirit: but we neede not vse any such defense, seeing that Dauid himselfe confesseth therein his ouersight, v. 33.

               <p n="1">1. Some thinke that the wife hath no power to giue of her husbands goods without his consent, but only of such things which are her owne, vnles where the case is extraordinarie, as this was: <hi>Mar.</hi> but then a woman shall giue nothing at all,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:20715:142"/>
where the law giueth vnto the husband the whole right of all such goods which are called moueables, that belong vnto the wife: therefore this were too much to abridge the wife many times in necessarie and charitable duties. 2.

Wherefore a meane way between both is best, that neither the woman should dispose of her husbands goods at her pleasure, nor yet haue no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vpon what occasion soeuer, to haue the disposition of part: for a difference is to be made of the things which appertaine vnto those which are married: the wife must keepe her soule for God, her bodie for her husband: the goods are in some sort common betweene them, by the right of mariage.

               <p>First, herein Abigail, all things considered, did no more then became her, and then was fit to be done. 1. Her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands foolishnes was knowne, in so much that thereof he had his name, so that shee did not reueale his secret infirmitie, but onely speaketh of that, which was in euery ones mouth. 2. Shee was forced so to doe, to deliuer Nabal from this destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction present: as Chirurgians to saue the whole bodie, thinke it best to cut off a part: so shee therein shewed her loue vnto Nabal, that maketh this excuse, in blemishing of his name to saue his life. <hi>Osiand.

               <p n="1">1.

                  <hi>13. Quest. v. 31.</hi> Of the griefe of conscience: and of the difference betweene a troubled and quiet conscience.</head>
               <p n="1">1. The word here vsed, <hi>phukah,</hi> signifieth a stumbling: a metaphore taken from those, which doe dash their foote at any thing, and so are ouerturned, and fall: so the conscience is offended at the remembrance of the sinnes past, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Borr.</hi> 2. Some read, <hi>it shall be no griefe vnto thee, that thou hast not shed blood causelesse: B.G.</hi> but in the originall, it is read affirmatiuely, <hi>that thou hast shed:</hi> for the griefe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science ariseth vpon the guiltines of the things which are past and done: therefore it is better read with an affirmation. 3. Hence it appeareth, what the proper propertie of conscience is, that although it doe not presently smite a man when the sinne is committed, yet it wil sting in the ende: the Latine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter translateth it <hi>singultum,</hi> that as the heart throbbeth and sobbeth after some griefe and heauines, and as the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke riseth after the eating of vnwholesome meates: so the conscience in a man boileth within him, after that sinne is committed. 4. Hereby appeareth the power of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: that it euen smiteth Kings, they are not free from the stroke thereof: for before God, in whose sight they are as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, their conscience accuseth them, as it doth others. God is no accepter of persons. 5. Further, a difference may be made of consciences: there is a troubled conscience, and a quiet conscience: and both these are seene and found, as well in the wicked, as the righteous: but not after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. There is in the wicked sometime a perplexed conscience full of horrour, and terrour, without any comfort, as in Iudas, when he had betraied Christ: and sometime their conscience is quiet, and troubleth them not, no not after they haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted most horrible and hainous sinnes: as we doe not read, that Saul did any thing at all repent him, after he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Priests to be most cruelly slaine: and these are the worst of all. So there is in the righteous sometime a troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led conscience, but not without hope, and it is a degree
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:20715:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnto the peace and quietnes of the conscience, as Dauid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the sinnes of adulterie and murther, was greatly plunged, as the fiftie Psalme sheweth. The peaceable conscience in the righteous is, when hauing wrestled with their sinnes, and iudged themselues, they finde peace with God by faith in Christ: whereof the Apostle speaketh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Beeing iustified by faith, we haue peace toward God thorough Iesus Christ,</hi> Rom. 5.1. which peace of conscience Saint <hi>Paul</hi> enioyed, saying, <hi>I know nothing by my selfe,</hi> 1.

Wise Abigail reseruing this argument, taken from the testimonie of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, vnto the last place, sheweth that there is no greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in this world, then the inward assurance of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: which if it doe cleare vs, we neede not feare what the world can obiect against vs: as Dauid in an other Psalme saith, <hi>This I had, because I kept thy precepts,</hi> Psal. 119.56. This was <hi>Iobs</hi> comfort in his affliction: and nothing is more auaileable to refresh vs in the day of our temptation, yea in the houre of death, then to say with <hi>S.

               <p n="1">1. Dauids modestie appeareth, that at the admonition of a woman, is not abashed to acknowledge his ouersight: so when Nathan reprooued him, he immediately confessed his sinne: so Peter beeing rebuked of Paul, refused not to ioyne with him, the right hand of fellowship, Gal. 2. which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, not to thinke much to be aduertised and aduised by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers when we doe amisse. 2.

This is a speciall fauour of God, when he doth preuent the cause of sinne in his children, which is done three waies: 1. when as God keepeth a man, that he doth not so much as intend or purpose any wicked thing: as Dauid was free euen in his purpose and desire from wishing the death of Saul: 2. when a man is tempted in his thoughts, but yet is preserued from doing the fact, as Dauid here from killing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal: 3. when a man hath committed sinne, if then he haue grace to repent, that he continue not in sinne: so Dauid bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reprooued by Nathan, was yet recouered and restored by repentance. <hi>Mart.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. A rash vowe and oath, (for the same reason is both) are better broken then obserued: the reasons are these: the ende of an oath is to binde vs more straightly vnto Gods seruice, to performe some dutie vnto his glorie: therefore it is a part of Gods worship and honour, to be sworne by: then by an oath we can not binde our selues to doe any thing, whereby
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:20715:145"/>
God is dishonoured. Againe, the breach of an oath is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnlawfull, because it is done with contempt of God, whose name is called vpon: but when an vnlawfull oath is broken, it proceedeth from the feare and reuerence of God. Beside, two sinnes are worse then one: and therefore we are bidden not to ioyne two sinnes together, for one sinne shall not goe vnpunished: but when an vnlawfull and vniust oath is kept, there is a double sinne committed: first, in the rash making of such an oath, and then in the vngodly performing of it. 2. But yet this must be acknowledged, that though it be better to reuerse an vniust oath, then to performe it, as both Iipthah had done better, if he had chaunged his vowe concerning his daughter, and Herod his oath touching Iohn Baptist: yet it is an offence also, to make a rash oath, as Dauid here committed that ouersight; but it is better, the oath bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once made by repentance to heale that soare in reuersing it, then to make the wound greater in effecting it. <hi>sic fere Martyr.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

But Dauid reioyceth, because Gods iustice now appeared in the iudging of Nabal: and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in that regard may reioyce and giue thanks to God, when the enemies of God are taken out of the way, which were impediments to his glorie. 3.

Dauid thinketh it best to send his seruants, and not to goe himselfe, that her loue should not seeme to be forced: and if he had a repulse, the matter would not be so grieuous. 3. Dauid maketh choice of a wife euery way meete for him: for her wisdome, comelinesse, riches, and which was the cheifest of all, her pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: so it was both an honest, pleasant, profitable, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable marriage. 4.

In Abigail there
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:20715:146"/>
is a notable example of modestie, who doth thinke her selfe not worthie to be Dauids wife, but doth humble her selfe to be a seruant, euen to his seruants to wash their feete: the more shee doth humble her selfe, the more worthie shee was to be exalted to be Dauids wife.</p>

                  <hi>20. Quest. v. 43.</hi> Whether Dauid offended in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many wiues.</head>
               <p>Whereas this law is giuen, Deut. 17.17. that the King shall not multiplie many wiues, least his heart turne away: there is great doubt, whether Dauid did not offend against that law, who in this place is mentioned to haue three wiues, and beside these diuers more. 1. Some answer, that as in the same place the King is forbidden to prepare many horses, and yet Salomon before his fall, while yet his wisdome remained with him, had fourtie thousand stalles of horses, 1. king. 4.26. the meaning is, that as it was lawfull for the king to haue a number of horses, according to his state, so that they excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not, growing to an importable and vnnecessarie summe to be kept rather for ostentation, and pleasure, then for neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie: so the King was permitted to haue two, three, or more wiues, so that they were not multiplied out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: which was Salomons fault, and not Dauids. <hi>ex Martyr.</hi> But this answer doth not satisfie: for although Salomon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing three hundred wiues did multiplie more then Dauid: yet he also multiplieth, that encreaseth his wiues aboue one: as Dauid did that had sixe: neither doth the comparison hold betweene the number of horse and wiues: for one wife may suffice, where many thousand horse are not sufficient for the state and seruice of a King. 2. Some therefore thinke that not simply the king is forbidden to haue many wiues, but not to multiplie such, as should turne away his heart from God, as Salomons wiues did, yet Dauids did not. But this answer is not sufficient neither: for the reason is generall for all kings of Israel, as well for them, whose hearts are not turned by this meanes, as for others: for they are all in daunger, though some by Gods grace are kept from that daunger: therefore the occasion of the daunger is to be shunned of all: no man knoweth his owne strength. The like law is prescribed, that
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:20715:146"/>
they should not take the daughters of the strange nations to their sonnes, least they should make them to goe a whoring after their gods, Exod. 34.16. yet was it simply forbidden to marrie any such, though such danger ensued not: as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple confesse that they had trespassed against God, in taking strange wiues of the people of the land, Ezra 10. 2. yet there is no mention made that by them they fell to idolatrie. 3. Some thinke, that the King is forbidden by violence to take away other mens wiues, as they did before the flood: which was Dauids great offence in taking Vriahs wife. <hi>Pellic.</hi> in Deut. 17. If this were the meaning, then Salomon in the great multiplicitie of his wiues, had not transgressed against this law: for we find not that among so many of his Queenes and concubines, any of them was an others wife. 4. Neither yet can it be thought of Dauid so holy a man, that he would apparently transgresse such a manifest law, which he could not be ignorant of, beeing continually exercised therein: and therefore howsoeuer it were a generall infirmitie in those daies, not onely in kings, but in their people to haue diuerse wiues, which it pleased the Lord to vse connivence toward them in: yet it sheweth not to be the meaning of this law, simply to forbid more wiues then one vnto kings: seeing that the Lord gaue power and libertie vnto Dauid to take his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters wiues, <hi>I gaue thee thy lords house, and thy lords wiues into thy bosome,</hi> 2. Sam. 12.8. The Lord would not haue gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his owne law. 5. Therefore in this place, not the thing, but the manner thereof is forbidden: that he should not take many wiues, to giue himselfe to lust and pleasure, and so to neglect the office and dutie of the kingdome: <hi>Borr.</hi> for as the King is forbidden to multiplie horse, and gold, and siluer, so he is restrained from multiplying of wiues: but it was lawfull simply for the King to haue many horse, and to haue much siluer and gold, as Salomon had, but not to trust in them: So was it permitted vnto them, in respect of those times, to haue diuers wiues: so they vsed them not for lust and concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, but for procreation: neither were addicted vnto them.</p>

                  <hi>22. Quest. v. 44.</hi> Of Dauids many wiues: and first of Polygamie in generall, whether it be simply vnlawfull.</head>
               <p>There are two sorts of <hi>bigamie,</hi> that is, the marrying of two, and likewise of <hi>polygamie,</hi> the mariage of many wiues: for either these tearmes are vsed to signifie the marriage of two or more successiuely, one after an other, or when two or more wiues are had together: but the first acception and vse of these tearmes is improper: for he properly by the law is said to haue two wiues, that hath them together: <hi>binas vxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res habere dicitur, qui eas habet simul: he is said to haue two wiues, that hath them at once or together. Cod. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>tit.</hi> 5. <hi>leg.</hi> 1. <hi>Diocletian. In veritate digami non existunt: they which marrie second wiues in truth are not to be said to haue two wiues. decret. Gregor. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. the question is here of the second kind of <hi>digamie,</hi> or <hi>polygamie,</hi> not of the first.</p>
               <p>Now first those reasons shall be brought forth and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which would seeme to prooue that polygamie, that is, the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:20715:147"/>
the hauing of many wiues at once, is not simply vnlawfull.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Holy men, as Abraham, Iaakob, Elkanah, Dauid, had many wiues at once. <hi>Ans.</hi> Holy men might haue their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: God might tolerate it in them, in respect of those times: which maketh it not simply lawfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prophets neuer reprooued them for hauing diuers wiues, as when Nathan came to tell Dauid of his sinne, he spake nothing of that. <hi>Ans.</hi> The Prophets were silent therein, because it was either permitted or tolerated in those times for the procreation of the people of God: and therefore it was no maruell, if the Prophets spake nothing thereof: the people beeing beside enclined to many grosse sinnes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if it were a fault or ouersight in those holy men, they would haue repented them thereof, which we read they did not. <hi>Ans.</hi> In particular they could not repent of a fault, which they were ignorant of: in generall they did repent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of whatsoeuer they did amisse, as Dauid oftentimes asketh forgiuenes of sinnes in the Psalmes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nathan comming to Dauid, saith that God had giuen his lords wiues into his bosome: therefore it was not vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>Ans.</hi> This was but Gods indulgence or permission to Dauid, to vse this libertie, if he would: this onely sheweth a toleration or relaxation of the general law for a time, it proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not simply the lawfulnes of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is no positiue law made to restraine polygamie. <hi>Ans.</hi> Some thinke that God gaue them no direct law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that matter, for the propagation and encrease of that nation, among whome onely the visible Church of God was. <hi>Mar.</hi> But the proposition is vntrue: for beside the generall law giuen in the creation, <hi>They two shall be one flesh,</hi> there is an other particular law, which restraineth marriage of more then one, Leuit. 18.18. <hi>Thou shalt not take a wife with her si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, during her life, to vexe her:</hi> which is vnderstood not of the naturall sister, but of any other woman: for the naturall si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster could not be maried, no not after her sisters death.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the law, which giueth the brother power to marrie his brothers wife, which is deceased, maketh no exception, if he be maried: but absolutely enioyneth him to marie his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife. <hi>Ans.</hi> The Rabbins answer, that shee was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly counted the second brother, but the first brothers wife;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:20715:148"/>
because the seede was also counted his: some answer that this was a speciall prerogatiue, and therefore can not make a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule: <hi>Mar.</hi> an other answer is, that these particular lawes, where there is not some speciall and particular excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, must be vnderstood according to the generall law, Leu. 18.18. that the next brother, which hath no wife of his owne should take his brothers wife: <hi>Iun.</hi> but it should seeme rather to be a speciall prerogatiue, which is the second answer: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the Gospel mention is made of seuen brethren that one after another tooke their brothers wife, Matth. 22. it is not like but some of them had beside wiues of their owne.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If many wiues were allowed, there would be fewer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries. <hi>Ans.</hi> That is no cause: for Dauid hauing many wiues, committed adulterie: it would rather giue further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, for vagrant lust, which hath many obiects, will more hardly be gouerned, then matrimoniall loue tied to one: as a riuer swelling ouer the brookes is not so easily kept in, as a shallow riuer.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Fecunditie is the ende of mariage, which is more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in <hi>Polygamie,</hi> then in <hi>monogamie,</hi> the mariage of one. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Fecunditie simply maketh not mariage lawfull: for then it might iustifie vnlawfull copulations, by which there is procreation: many haue children by whores, that haue none by their wiues: it must be fecunditie then according to Gods institution. 2. Many times there is more fecunditie in the mariage of one wife: as Saul had foure sonnes by his wife <hi>Ahinoam,</hi> when as Salomon had by so many hundred wiues and concubines, but one sonne. 3. Fecunditie made polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie tolerable for those times, but it is not so necessarie now: then the Church of God was tied to one nation, now it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed into all the nations of the world.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If polygamie were not lawfull, what should become of those honouroble Fathers and Patriarks, which came of such mariages, as all the 12. Patriarks; excepting Ioseph and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamin, which were of Rachel the principall and proper wife of Iaakob: were they begotten in adulterie? <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It had bin no disparagement to that nation to come of parents of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous seede, no more then it was for our Sauiour to descend of Pharez, the sonne of Iudah by his daughter in law Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar. 2. Their honour and nobilitie depended not so much
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:20715:148"/>
vpon their externall birth, as vpon the blessing of God. 3. Neither yet doe we say, that they were adulterous mariages, seeing the Lord either permitted, or tolerated them for the necessarie procreation of that people.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Valentinian</hi> the elder beside his wife <hi>Severa,</hi> tooke also her maide <hi>Iustina</hi> to be his wife, by whome he had <hi>Galla,</hi> maried afterward to <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he made a law, giuing the same libertie also vnto others to marie two wiues. <hi>Answ.</hi> So <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour made a law, that a man might marie his brothers daughter: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these lawes of <hi>Claudius</hi> or <hi>Valentinian,</hi> were thought worthie to be inserted into the Code. God did not blesse that mariage of <hi>Valentinian:</hi> for <hi>Iustina</hi> became an Arrian: and <hi>Valentinian</hi> the yonger the sonne of <hi>Galla,</hi> did afflict and persecute the orthodoxal Churches.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>S. Paul</hi> prescribeth, that he that was chosen to be a Bishop, should be the husband of one wife: whereby it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that euen in the Apostles time, polygamie in others was tolerated: as if a Turke hauing two or more wiues, beeing conuerted to the faith, is rather to be borne with, then by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging his libertie, to be driuen to Turcisme againe. <hi>Ans.</hi> The law of monogamie beeing reuiued by Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and brought to the first institution, was to take place, not for the time past, but for the time to come, as all other positiue lawes of nations doe: Polygamie was then tolerated as an infirmitie for a time in those which were newly conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: as it might be in Turkes and Iewes now till such time as they are confirmed in the faith: but this toleration maketh it not lawfull.</p>
               <p n="12">12. One may depart from their right if they will: if then the wife will consent, that her husband may marie an other, why is it not lawfull? as Sarah gaue Abraham leaue to take Hagar. <hi>Answ.</hi> The wife in so doing departeth not from her right, but the diuine right, which shee can not relinquish: for mariage is grounded vpon the will and law of the instituter. Sarah her example can not serue for these times: yet they which tooke a wife or concubine, as Abraham did, that is, for procreation onely, and with consent, not forced, but offered on the wiues behalfe; doe sinne lesse, then they which obserue neither of these circumstances. Other reasons are alleadged

to this purpose: but these may suffice. <hi>consul. Martyr.</hi>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Reasons and arguments shewing that polygamie was neuer simply lawfull.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. God gaue vnto Adam but one helper: <hi>He had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of spirit,</hi> as the Prophet saith, Malach. 2.15. he might haue made more then one: <hi>but yet he made but one, because he sought a godly seede:</hi> and that was not peculiar vnto Adam, but established as a generall law of mariage for euer, <hi>They two shall be one flesh:</hi> which word <hi>two,</hi> although it be not found in Moses, Gen. 2. yet it is sufficient, that our Sauiour, the most perfect interpreter of the Scripture, hath so expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it. Now that which is made one flesh with the bodie, can not be made a member of an other bodie rightly and truly: therefore a man, which is one flesh with his wife, can not be made one flesh with an other. It will be obiected, that he which is ioyned with an harlot, is also made one flesh with her, as the Apostle sheweth, 1. Cor. 6.17. Some answer, that they are one flesh but for a time: but the better answer is, that it is no lawfull coniunction, because it is not after Gods insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Christ alloweth not a man to put away his wife, and to marrie an other, vnlesse it be for fornication: much lesse is it lawfull for one to haue two wiues together at the same time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The first that brought in two wiues was Lamech, who, as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, was the first, <hi>qui vnam costam distraxit in duas,</hi> who diuided one ribbe into two. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> seemeth to commend Lamech, as a good man: but that he doth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his repentance, which in his opinion he shewed, not because of his wiues.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>S. Paul</hi> willeth that euery woman haue <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, her proper husband: but how can he be said to be a proper hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who is common to more then one.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Againe, the Apostle would not haue them to defraud one an other, but for a time: but the man, that hath more then one wife, must needes defraud the one, while he attendeth the other. As Iaakob beeing more addicted to Rachel, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded Lea, when shee was faine to purchase of her sister
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:20715:149"/>
to lodge with her husband for her mandrakes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is a spirituall resemblance betweene Christ and his Church, and the marriage betweene the man and wife: but Christ hath but one Church: therefore the man should haue but one wife.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The greatest vnion and coniunction in the world should be betweene the man and wife: but there can be no vnion, where there is a diuision: and loue is not so syncere and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, where it is diuided.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Salomon saith, <hi>Reioyce with the wife of thy youth: let her be as the louing hind, and pleasant roe,</hi> Prov. 5.18, 19. this counsell, as Salomon himselfe followed not, so neither can they obey, that haue more then one wife of their youth.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Laban required of Iaakob that he should not take o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiues to his daughters to vexe them, Gen. 30. foreseeing the inconuenience of hauing many wiues: how there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually emulation and strife betweene them: as there was betweene Adah and Zillah, Gen. 4.

                  <hi>23. Quest.</hi> Whether polygamie were an infirmitie in the fathers.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that the fathers offended not in the mariage of many wiues: but that God remitted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the seueritie &amp; strictnes of that law, giuen in the creation vnto Adam: both for the procreation of the people of God, who then consisted but of one nation: as also that the spirituall mysterie of the Church of Christ, and the old Synagogue might be represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby: as in Sara and Hagar, Rachel and Leah. Of this opinion is <hi>P. Mart.</hi> consenting herein to the iudgement of some of the auncient Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. If there were any dispensation or relaxation of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:20715:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the law of monogamie, beeing it a written law, it would haue beene expressed in Scripture: for a relaxation or dispensation of a law, must be of the same authoritie and perspicuitie, which the law is of. Now no such relaxation is in any part of the law to be found. 2. Nay the contrarie is extant, that in Moses law there is a prohibition, that a man should marie a woman and her sister, Leuit. 18.18. which is shewed before to be vnderstood not of the naturall sister, but of any other woman. 3. If for procreation this had beene allowed, then it had beene most necessarie to be graunted vnto Adam in the beginning of the world, and to Noah in reuiuing and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the world: it is here answered, that in their time, there was no idolatrie, and so no separation from the Church of God: and therefore for procreation of the people of God it was then so needefull as afterward. <hi>Contra.</hi> But in Cains time there beganne to be a generation of euill seede, and then beganne men to call vpon the name of God, that is, publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their assemblies and exercises, to separate themselues from the prophane and wicked, Gen. 4. and yet no polygamie was brought into the Church of God, it was first found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood in the progenie of Cam: which might haue mooued the godly fathers then, the rather to haue vsed poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamie, that they might haue encreased as fast, as the vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous seede. 4. Neither was polygamie made lawfull for mysterie: for if that mysterie held in the mariage of two: yet there was none in the mariage of sixe, for so many wiues Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid had, 2. Sam. 3. much lesse in Salomons thousand wiues and concubines: what mysterie lay hid in that? 5. And if they will iustifie polygamie in the fathers, how can they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it in Salomon? in whome it is apparent it was a great slippe, and against the law, to multiplie many wiues onely for lust, against the law, Deut. 17. for he did not take so many for procreation: nay, he made himselfe thereby vnfit for procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is euident in his small posteritie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I preferre their answer, that thinke the fathers offended in their polygamie and multiplicitie of wiues: but that it was no great offence, proceeding from ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: there beeing no manifest law to the contrarie, and the generall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of that age bearing them out: and beside the Lord v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this infirmitie vnto their good, thereby encreasing his
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:20715:150"/>
people: yet this offence was pardoned and forgiuen them, with all other their sinnes, by faith in Christ. <hi>Sic Melancthon.</hi> And so the Lord so disposed in his prouidence, that the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hereof should be reserued for the comming of his Sonne: that the second Adam should reduce mariage to the first institution thereof giuen vnto the first Adam: and that the spouse and husband of the Church should giue the rule of carnall mariage, by the patterne of the spirituall mariage betweene him and his Church.</p>
               <p>And least it might seeme straunge, that the fathers should so long continue in an errour of life vnreformed: the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is giuen, Nehem. 8.17. where the people of Israel are said not to haue kept the feast of Tabernacles from Ioshuahs time till then, by the space almost of a thousand yeares.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="1">1. It is out of doubt, that it is not lawfull for any priuate man to lay hands, no not vpon a Tyrant: for if it be not lawful for a priuate man to kill a theefe or murderer, that is but a priuate person, much lesse is it to be permitted, that he should rise against the Magistrate, though neuer so wicked. As Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid would not here lay hands vpon Saul: but leaueth him to God, till he should smite him with some extraordinarie sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as he did Nabal: or his naturall time come to die, or some violent death in battell: for these three kinds of death Dauid here toucheth. 2. But such priuate men are here to be excepted, which are stirred by some extraordinarie motion of the spirit, as Ehud was against Eglon king of Moab, Iud. 3. In which kind of extraordinarie vocation, two things are to be considered: both the ende, that they did it not for their owne reuenge, but to deliuer the people of God, as Ehud here did: and their persons, that though they liued as priuate men before, yet in these extraordinarie acts, they were declared to be publike gouernours and deliuerers: as Ehud was one of their Iudges. 3. But yet Tyrants and wicked gouernours may be remooued by the whole state, as Athens and Rome were deliuered from their cruell gouernours: but this must be vnderstood of such kingdomes where the kingdome goeth by election; as in Polonia, and Venice: for from whom kings receiue their authoritie, by them they may be constrained to keepe within their bounds: but where kingdomes goe by succession, the reason is otherwise: vnlesse the Prince by oath be tied vnto certaine conditions, and so his authoritie be not absolute but conditionall, so long as he obserue and keepe the auncient rites and priuiledges of the countrey: which seemeth to be the question at this day, betweene the Archduke and

From the inconuenience that was like to follow, that they would driue him from among Gods people, and out of his Church, and as much as in them lay, cause him to consent to the Idolaters. 5. If his blood did fall to the ground in the sight of Iehouah, he would reuenge it, v. 20. 6. Lastly, from the indignitie of the fact: Saul was like to get no honour by pursuing Dauid, who was but as a flea or a partrich, in respect of Saul, who was king ouer a mightie people. <hi>Martyr.</hi>

                  <hi>4. Quest. v. 19.</hi> Of the meaning of these words: If the Lord haue stirred thee vp, let him smell the sauour of a sacrifice.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Some doe referre this, as spoken of Saul: that seeing the wrath of God was kindled against him, and had sent an euill spirit vpon him, which vexed him: that Saul should offer sacrifice vnto God, to be reconciled vnto him, that he beeing directed by his spirit, might cease pursuing of Dauid: <hi>Osiand. Pellican.</hi> but that the offering of the sacrifice is vnderstood of Dauid, this <hi>dilemma,</hi> or forked argument, which Dauid vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth two waies, sheweth, if it be of God, let him smell a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, if of men, cursed be they: and the whole sentence still runneth vpon Dauid, because they did cast him out from the inheritance of the Lord. 2. Others doe vnderstand it of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid: and here there are diuers expositions. Some expound it thus: if God haue done it, let him be appeased with sacrifice: if he wil not be appeased, his wil be done: but, if this were the sense, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other part of the <hi>dilemma</hi> were superfluous, the argument beeing both waies inforced alreadie: &amp; in this sense
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:20715:153"/>
Dauid should speake doubtfully, as though God would not be appeased toward him by sacrifice. Others thinke that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid meaneth, that God would by some extraordinarie signe to be giuen by his sacrifice, testifie his innocencie, as he did in Abels sacrifice iustifie him against Cain, and Elias against Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als priests: but the phrase of smelling the sauour of a sacrifice, signifieth nothing els, but the acceptance thereof, and of him that sacrificed: as it is saide of Noahs sacrifice, that the Lord smelled a sauour of rest. Gen. 8.21. <hi>Iunius</hi> referreth it to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids person, that if there were any sinne found in him, he was willing to yeild himselfe to the magistrate to be put to death, and so to be offered vp, as it were in sacrifice: but the phrase, <hi>let him smell the sauour of a sacrifice,</hi> sheweth, that it can not be vnderstood so: for no sacrifice of any man was of a sweete smelling sauour, but onely the sacrifice of Christ, Eph. 5.2. it is therefore vnderstood of the externall sacrifices, which had also a sweete sauour before the Lord, not of themselues, but as they were figures and types of Christ. Dauids meaning is, that he would offer a sacrifice vnto the Lord, that his wrath might be appeased toward him. <hi>Mart. Borr.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. The sacrifices of themselues could not giue remission of sinnes: for, as the Apostle saith, Heb. 9.9. <hi>The sacrifices could not make holy concerning the conscience him that did the seruice:</hi> they therefore did no otherwise sanctifie and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile vnto God, then as they had their force and efficacie from faith in Christ. 2. But yet both the name and the thing is communicated vnto the signe &amp; sacrament, which is wrought onely by the thing signified and exhibited therein: as the lambe is called the Passeouer, Exod. 12.11. and circumcision the couenant, Gen. 17.3. But this coniunction betweene the signe and thing signified, dependeth not vpon any naturall coherence, as the Sea followeth the influence of the Moone, but it standeth by a diuine constitution: so the sacrifices bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sacraments of the passion of Christ, are said to purge and clense, and to be of a sweete smell. <hi>Mart.</hi>

               <p>God stirreth none nor tempteth them to euill, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is not tempted of any: yet the Lord may be said here to stirre Saul vp vnto this action, in pursuing of Dauid three kinde of waies. 1. <hi>Instrumentally,</hi> because God vsed herein iustly the ministerie of the euill spirits, that were the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ministers of God in stirring vp Saul: they were sent of God in iustice vpon Saul, to worke his will. <hi>Osiand.</hi> 2.

               <p>There are three sorts of error. 1. There is a voluntarie or
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:20715:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wilfull error, and an inuoluntarie, which proceedeth of meere ignorance: the first is of two sores, either when there is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the iudgement and vnderstanding: as those of whome our Sauiour speaketh: they shall think they doe good seruice, when they put you to death, Ioh. 16.1. and the Iewes, as the Apostle saith, Rom. 10.2. had zeale, but not according to knowledge. 2. The other voluntarie error is in the will and affection, when the iudgement is not corrupted, but the will consenteth not, beeing caried along as a violent streame, to subscribe vnto that, which the minde seeth to be euill. And this error is of two sorts, when the iudgement is obscured and cast ouer for a time with the cloudes of carnall desire and affection, as Dauid yeilded vnto the temptation of lust, which in his iudgement cleared, though for that time obscured, he condemned: as when one wittingly and willingly against his iudgement and conscience, doth euill; as Saul persecuted Dauid, knowing him to be innocent, onely of malice and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, because he was appointed to the kingdome. This kinde of error excuseth not at all. 3. The inuoluntarie kind of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is, when there is a totall ignorance and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p n="1">1. Some read, <hi>The Lord reward euery man according to his righteousnes: L.B.G.V.</hi> but it is better read: The Lord render vnto euery one his righteousnes: <hi>A.P.C.

The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that as euery one hath behaued himselfe iustly or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly, so he shall receiue at Gods hand. There are two kinde of righteousnes, one is the righteousnes of faith, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto vs, whereby the righteousnes of Christ is made ours; there is a righteousnes of workes proceeding of faith, which is imperfect, of which kind Dauid speaketh here: which is rewarded and crowned in the mercie of God. 3. This righteousnes is called both the iustice and righteousnes of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:20715:155"/>
God, as it proceedeth from him, the fountaine and author of good things: it is also called ours, because it is wrought in vs as the subiect, and by vs as the instruments: otherwise we haue no righteousnes of our selues, for our Sauiour saith, <hi>Without me, ye can doe nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Our works are not the cause of the reward, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the fauour of God: for eternall life is the gift of God through Iesus Christ, Rom. 6.23. but they are the means and the way appointed for vs to walk in: as the Apostle saith, Eph. 2.10. nay, they are not generally <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> the cause without the which a thing can not be: for infants are saued without them: but as <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>via sunt regni, non causa regnandi,</hi> they are the way to the kingdome, not the cause of the kingdome: like as a man can not goe vnto the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie but by the way, nor clime vp into an high place, but by steppes and degrees: yet the way is not the cause of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor the steppes of our ascending: So by good works we must walke vnto the kingdome of heauen: but good workes doe not procure vnto vs the kingdome.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then we refuse vpon these grounds, the Popish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of merits: which is ouerthrowne by these three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. 1. Where merit is, a man must doe some seruice of his owne abilitie, which he hath not receiued of him, of whome he looketh for a reward: for betweene him that meriteth, and him which rewardeth, there must be a giuing and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: but man can giue nothing vnto God, neither can he doe any good thing of himselfe: our good workes, are his workes: then can they not properly merit. 2. Betweene the merit and the reward,<note place="margin">Contr. Against the doctrine of merits.</note> there must be an equalitie, for a man to receiue so much, as he deserueth: but betweene our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, and the infinite reward of eternall life, there is no equalitie: as the Apostle sheweth, Rom. 8.15. <hi>That the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of this present life, are not worthie of the glorie, &amp;c.</hi> 3. He that rewardeth, is endebted vnto him that meriteth and worketh, and is bound in iustice to recompence him: but God is no way endebted or bound to vs: for we doe but our dutie, and when we haue done all, we are found but vnprofitable seruants, Luk. 17.10.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But it will be obiected: 1. why then doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vse this tearme of reward, and recompence, if it be not
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:20715:155"/>
merited. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Because there is some similitude, though no equalitie, betweene our seruice, and Gods reward. 2. In Christ Iesus the reward is indeede merited in respect of his obedience, but in fauour it is giuen to vs. <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith, that the righteous Iudge shall giue him a crowne of righteousnes, 2. Tim. 4.8. the reward then is of iustice. <hi>Ans.</hi> Of iustice indeede, but not with relation to our workes, but in respect of Gods promise, who is iust to performe &amp; keepe all his gratious promises. <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3. Euill workes are meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious of hell, and therefore good workes are also meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of heauen. <hi>Ans.</hi> The argument alwaies followeth not from contraries, where the reason is vnlike: for good workes herein haue a diuers reason from euill works, because the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill are from our selues, so are not the good: the euill are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly euill, but the good are imperfectly good: <hi>S. Paul</hi> also sheweth the weaknes of this consequent: for hauing said, <hi>the stipend of sinne is death:</hi> he addeth, chaunging his forme of speech, <hi>life eternall is the gift of God through Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Lastly, that Popish distinction of the Schoolemen: of merit of congruitie, and condignitie, falleth to the ground: good works, they say, as they proceede from our freewill, doe merit of <hi>congruitie,</hi> it is fit they should be rewarded, as they proceede from the grace of God, they deserue of <hi>condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> they are worthie to be rewarded. <hi>Contr.</hi> 1.

Merit of condignitie the Apostle absolutely denieth: Rom. 8.15. <hi>non sunt condignae passiones: The sufferings of this life are not worthy of the glorie, &amp;c.</hi> Grace maketh not our workes meritorious, but it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them good workes, and acceptable vnto God; which he crowneth of grace and mercie. <hi>sic fere Martyr.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>LYranus</hi> defendeth Dauid herein, that he fledde not, as fearing he should be killed, beeing assured of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but least he should be forced to fight with Saul: but this is contrarie to the text: for he feared least one day he should perish by the hand of Saul. 2. Others thinke that Dauid might so conceiue as though promise of the kingdom were conditionall, if Dauid did not fall into some grieuous sinne: and therefore he fled: but if this had beene so, Dauid offended more in going for succour vnto the vncircumcised, then if he had staied. 3. Some thinke, that Dauid did it not, as doubting of the promise of God, but as a wise and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man, vsing the meanes of his safetie: <hi>Borr.</hi> but his owne words doe shew his infirmitie, that he doubted, least he might perish: he was in deede to vse the meanes, but such as were lawfull and without offence. 4. Wherefore the truer opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that Dauid herein shewed his infirmitie: <hi>Mar. Iun. Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and.</hi> as shall be shewed afterward.</p>
               <p>First, the reasons shall be examined, which are brought in defense of this fact of Dauid. 1. Dauid fled before to the Moabites, and was not reprehended: why might he not as well flee to the Philistims? <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Moabites were not such opposite enemies, as the Philistims. 2. He fled not then to the same ende: then he went onely to succour his father and mother: here to serue as a captaine with his souldiers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Achish. 3. His going then was not very pleasing vnto God, for he was admonished by the Prophet to depart. 4. And then he knew not the Lords pleasure, till the Prophet had spoken to him, as he now did.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But whence should Dauid haue prouided for all his companie, vnlesse he should haue liued vpon the spoile of his owne countrey: and by staying he should haue brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and all his friends into daunger: and he should haue tempted God, if he had refused the occasion offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Dauid needed not haue spoiled his countrey: he
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:20715:156"/>
might haue praied vpon the Philistims, and other enemies adioyning. 2. He was not to doe any vnlawfull thing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for himselfe and his friends, but to depend vpon God. 3. A good occasion and opportunitie is not to be refused: but to let passe occasion and meanes not lawfull, is not to tempt God, but rather to cleaue vnto God: which Dauid should haue done, rather then by vnlawfull waies and meanes to seeme to doubt of Gods deliuerance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Christ fled vnto the Sidonians, Tyrians, and Samaritans. <hi>Ans.</hi> He fled not vnto them to take part with them against the Iewes, but to instruct and teach them: but Dauid went to serue Achish. <hi>ex Martyr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the reasons which shew the vnlawfulnes of Dauids flying, are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He fled vnto those which were enemies of religion: as if now a captaine with his souldiers should flee vnto the Turke: herein he did contrarie to the law, which did forbid the Israelites to make any couenant with the heathen, which were about them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He in a manner runneth from his calling: who beeing appointed king of the Lords people to defend them, goeth to ioyne with their enemies. <hi>Mar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This his flight seemed to proceede from the weaknes of his faith, <hi>Iun.</hi> as doubting of Gods promises.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And many inconueniences followed vpon this his flight. 1. Dauid is driuen to dissemble, v. 11. when Achish asked him, where he had roued to day. 2. By this occasion the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites burned Ziglag, c. 30. and caried away his wife and children. 3. He was like to haue serued the Philistims against his countrey. 4. By his absence the power of Israel was weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ouercome in battell. 5. He made himselfe by this meanes, beeing entertained among the Philistims, beholding and bound vnto them: with whome he knew, when he should be king, he was to haue warre.</p>
               <p>Therefore it must be confessed and yeilded vnto, that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid in comming vnto the Philistims for succour, therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a great ouersight: for herein it is not expressed that he consulted with God, as at other times: but he herein tooke counsell of himselfe, and of the rest of his companie, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth. But this ouersight of Dauid is excused
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:20715:157"/>
by his necessitie, as a theefe stealing to satisfie his hunger, is more to be pitied, then he that stealeth of wantonnes: such was Dauids extremitie at this time. <hi>Martyr.</hi>

Adde hereunto also, that whereas before he went priuily and by stealth, now he goeth with a band of men, able to doe the king seruice, and for that cause he is entertained: as Xerxes receiued Themistocles; the Lacedemonians, Alcibiades; and the Volscians, Coriolanus. <hi>Mar.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="1">1. SOme thinke that Dauid had no purpose at all to fight against Israel, but onely he would haue defended the Kings person: who saith, he would make him keeper of his head for euer: but this agreeth not to Dauids owne words, that seemeth to be discontented, because he was sent backe, and might not goe to fight against the enemies of the king, c. 29.8. it seemeth therefore that he bare the king in hand, that he would goe and fight against Israel. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. Others thinke, that this warre was iust, which the Philistims at this time tooke in hand against Saul, because that therin the Lord pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to punish Sauls wickednes, and beside the kingdome belonged vnto Dauid, and therfore he might seeke his owne. But neither of these maketh this warre iust: for howsoeuer God intented herein to iudge Saul, yet the Philistims did it of a hatefull minde against the people of God: and though Dauid were the anointed king, as it were the apparent heire of the kingdome, yet he had no such commandement to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade the kingdome, but to waite his time. 3. Some are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that Dauid would in the battell haue turned his force against Achish: but herein Dauid beside his deepe dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, should haue shewed great vnthankfulnes vnto Achish with whom he had found such kind entertainment. 4. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the best solution of this doubt is, that Dauid gaue this wise answer vnto Achish, neither directly promising his help, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, he did <hi>prompte polliceri operam,</hi> readily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise his helpe: neither yet denying the same: but he waited vpon God for his direction, praying feruently in his heart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that some impediment might fall out, that he should not be forced to fight against the Israelites, and specially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his louing and deare friend Ionathan. <hi>sic Osiand.

               <p n="1">1. Some doe gather that whereas mention is made here

together of Samuels death, and that Saul had put away the sorcerers, that hereby it is signified, that Saul while Samuel li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vsed to consult with him: and that by his aduice he did according to the law of God expell the sorcerers. <hi>Pellican.</hi> But after that the Lord had reiected Saul, and Dauid was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed king, Samuel went no more to visit Saul, c. 15.35. neither doth it seeme that Saul much regarded Samuel. And it is not like that Saul did this of any good minde, by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels direction: for it seemeth, that at the same time the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites were slaine, 2. Sam. 21. which thing did displease God. 2.

This then is here inserted both of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels death, and Sauls expelling of sorcerers: both to shew, that it was not true Samuel, which afterward appeared vnto him, <hi>Osiand.</hi> and to manifest Sauls inconstancie, in returning to his vomit againe, to build againe what he had destroied: and his impietie in forsaking of God, and crauing helpe of the deuill. <hi>Iun.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. The Romanists opinion is, that Princes are not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with religion, but that it belongeth vnto the Pope to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the affaires of the Church, and such things as concerne the soule: leauing vnto the Prince onely the care and charge of the bodie, and such things as concerne the ciuill and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike state. And here they doe vrge the example of Vzziah, who was stricken with leprosie,<note place="margin">Contr. Of the Princes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical matters.</note> when he attempted to haue sacrificed. But this example is vnfitly alleadged: for Princes are not indeede to meddle with the execution of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call offices, as themselues to preach, to baptize, to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate: as Vzziah would haue taken vpon him the office of the Priest: but it belongeth vnto them, to see that as well Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall persons, and others doe their duties: and by good lawes to command the true religion to be receiued of all. The reasons are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because Princes are in Gods place here in earth, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:20715:159"/>
soule is commanded to be subiect vnto them, Rom. 13.1. then is no soule excepted, whether of Bishop, or of whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer. 2. Their office is to beare the sword, and to see all vngodlines punished, as well the transgressions of the first, as of the second table: as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>bene se res haberet si magistratus adulteria punire posset, animorum scortationes non posset:</hi> It were well, if the magistrate may punish adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and not meete with the spirituall fornication of the soule. 3. As Princes haue the ouersight of other professions, which yet they themselues practise not: as to see that Physitians, and Apothecaries, which attend vpon the health of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, should deale faithfully in their seuerall vocations, so also, seeing there is great necessitie of prouiding physicke for the soule, much more ought magistrates to take care thereof. 4. This appeareth by the example and practise of all godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, Dauid, Salomon, Hezekiah, Iosias, and all the good kings of Iudah, did purge and reforme the Church of God, put downe Idolatrie, and set vp the true worship: so did the good Christian Emperours, Constantinus, Theodosius, Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus. 5. For vnlesse this power according to the word of God be yeilded vnto Christian Magistrates, what remedie should there be to redresse the enormities of the Church, when the spirituall gouernours thereof, become dissolute, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, and corrupt. <hi>sic fere Mar.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Saul is here saide to haue asked counsell of the Lord, and yet 1. Chron. 11.14. it is said,<note place="margin">Reconcil.</note> he did not aske counsell of Iehouah: because he did not seeke vnto God in truth, but in hypocrisie: and therefore the Lord seeing his heart, would not vouchsafe him an answer: and he which had before destroyed the innocent Priests, was not worthie to receiue any comfort by them. 2. Here are three waies expressed, whereby the Lord vsed to make knowne his will to his seruants: by dreames, by Vrim, that is, by the Priests, and by Prophets: there were other waies, as God spake sometime by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, they also sometime vsed lots, but the other three were
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:20715:160"/>
more vsuall in those times. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. There were two sorts of dreames: some good dreames, which were sent vpon the seruants of God, some were but the illusions of Satan: and these two kind of dreames differed in three things: in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, God sent good dreames, the other proceeded from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: the seruants of God, as Ioseph and Daniel, saw good dreames and visions, the false prophets were deluded by the other: the first sort were to good ende, to set forth the glorie of God, the other were to an euill ende, to seduce and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the people, Deut. 13.2. Now God did not reueale his will vnto any by dreames, to haue Saul aduertised of his will. <hi>Borr.</hi> 4. But whereas Saul is said to haue asked counsell of God, and he answered him not by Vrim: some thinke that after Abiathar was gone with the Ephod,<note place="margin">Reconcil.</note> he caused an other to be made; some, that he had sent to Abiathar, to consult for him; some, that he consulted by some of the inferiour Priests which were left: <hi>Osiand.</hi> but the high Priest onely consulted by the Vrim. But the meaning is this, that the Vrim was not now with Saul, but with Dauid, and therefore Saul could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no answer by Vrim, although he had desired it. <hi>sic Mar.

                  <hi>5. Quest. v. 6.</hi> What the Vrim and Thummim were whereby the Lord made answer.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> which signifie light and perfection, were no peculiar thing belonging to the priestly ornaments: but onely signified the light of doctrine, and holines of life, which the Priest should be indued with: so expoundeth the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Septuag.</hi> which interpret these words, <hi>doctrinam &amp; veritatem,</hi> doctrine and veritie: but it seemeth by the description, of putting the Vrim and Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim to the brestplate, Exod. 28.30. that it was some reall thing, that was put thereunto. 2. Some did take them onely for the illuminations and visions which the Priest had: but as is shewed before, it is euident that it was some reall thing. 3. Some take it that these names, <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> were written in the brestplate: but then they should rather be said to be written, then put to. 4. Other thinke, they were two pretious stones shining beyond the rest, that were put into the pectorall: but the brestplate or pectorall beeing made
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:20715:160"/>
foure square, and set with twelue pretious stones in order, could not conueniently receiue them. 5. The opinion of some is, that this <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> was nothing els but the name <hi>Iehovah,</hi> which was written, and put in the duplicature or folding of the brestplate, which was made double: but, the name of <hi>Iehovah</hi> was written in the golden plate of the Priests forehead, Exod. 28.36. therefore it seemeth it was of no great vse to put it secretly within the brestplate. 6. Some further thinke, that the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> was not any of the priestly ornaments, which were made by the workeman, but it was giuen vnto Moses by the Lord, to be put within the brestplate, which may seeme to be the reason, why it was described to be made double, Exod. 28.16. <hi>Iun.</hi> But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position <hi>el,</hi> signifieth properly, <hi>to,</hi> not <hi>in,</hi> that we neede not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> to be put into the brest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, but onely vnto it: and it may be thought to be made double as with a lining, for the strengthening of it, because it was beset with the pretious stones. 7. Wherefore leauing other coniectures, I thinke it most probable that this <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> were nothing els but the pretious stones themselues, which were set into the pectorall: so called of their exceeding brightnes and perfection: <hi>Osiand. Mar.</hi> which may be thought to haue beene more then ordinarie pretious stones, prepared of the Lord for this vse. And this may further appeare thus: because the same title is giuen to the brestplate and to the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim:</hi> the pectorall is called the brestplate of iudgement, Exod. 28.29. and so is the other cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Vrim</hi> of iudgement, or iudgement of <hi>Vrim,</hi> Numb. 27.21. which was so called, because the high Priest consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with God by <hi>Vrim,</hi> gaue direction what was to be don, or not done. Againe, to applie the Ephod, is all one as to aske counsell of God by <hi>Vrim,</hi> as 1. Sam. c. 23.9. and c. 30.7. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid biddeth Abiathar applie or bring the Ephod.</p>

               <p>There are 3. opinions. 1. Some thinke, that by inward illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the mind, the Lord reuealed his wil to the Priest: <hi>ex Vat.</hi> but I take it, that this was the difference betweene the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:20715:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Priests and the Prophets, that these by some secret instinct and inspiration had the will of God reuealed, the other by some outward and sensible meanes. 2. <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh, that when the answer was affirmatiue, the pretious stones did shine extraordinarily: but he addeth further, that these stones had ceased to shine in that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner 200. years before his time, because of the sins of the people: but it may be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they were with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

And againe, this shining of the stones serued onely for affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue and good answers: it still remaineth vncerten how they receiued negatiue and heauie answers. 3. Therefore I rather thinke, that the Lord answered the Priest by some voice and oracle: as the Lord vsed to answer Moses by voice, from the Mercie seate, Numb. 7.89. as it also appeareth, c. 23.7. how the Lord answered Dauids demaunds by voice: <hi>The Lord said, &amp;c.</hi>

Some thinke, that Saul was not so blinde or ignorant, as to imagine, that Samuel could himselfe be raised vp: but that by Gods permission, there might be apparitions of spirits in their likenes: <hi>Pellican.</hi> but this was a greater blindnes in Saul, to goe directly and aske counsell of the deuill: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Sauls reuerent behauiour, he imagined, that it was more then a bare apparition, which was represented vnto him. 2. I rather therefore thinke, that it was Sauls foolish i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, that Samuel might be called vp vnto him: for the spirit of God beeing departed from him, as his bodie was distempered, so also was his minde and iudgement. <hi>Mart. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siand.</hi> And <hi>Augustine</hi> saith well, <hi>neque reprobus factus potuit bonum intellectum habere,</hi> beeing reiected he could haue no good vnderstanding. 3. Now how this woman remained yet in Endor, the rest of the Soothsayers beeing destroied, the cause was not, as some of the Rabbins imagined, that shee was Abners mother, and so spared: for then Saul neede not haue inquired after her, shee had beene knowne well enough: but Saul might thinke, as there is oftentimes negligence, and remissenes in the officers and ministers of the kingdome, that some among the rest, might escape and find fauour. <hi>Mart.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. It seemeth by that Saul asked the woman what shee saw, that Saul saw him not at the first: the Rabbins thinke, that Saul heard onely the voice, and that the woman both saw, and heard, but Sauls seruants neither heard nor saw: some thinke, that the woman onely saw, and Saul onely heard, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tab.</hi> but, though Saul saw not the apparition at the first, the woman beeing apart in an other place, as witches vse not to be seene, when they worke their feates: yet it is like, that afterward Saul was admitted to his sight, both by the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which he yeildeth, in bowing himselfe, &amp; by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between the phantastical Samuel and Saul: it may be gathered also by the text, that the woman heard not the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:20715:162"/>
communication: for v. 21. it is saide shee entred or came in to Saul: it seemeth that shee was gone forth, hauing raised the spirit, and left Saul alone within in the bed chamber, as is expressed v. 23. but the seruants were left without, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heard nor saw: as the like is shewed, Act. 10. how Saul onely heard the voice, they that were with him heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.

               <p n="1">1.

Kimhi</hi> with other Rabbins thinke, that this is to be vnderstood of the happie estate, wherein Saul should be: and that herein nothing was vttered but truth: for they hold, that Saul dying for his countrey, and not giuing ouer the defense of Israel, though he looked for present death, died in the fauour of God: <hi>Iosephus</hi> also commendeth Saul as a worthie man, that died for his countrey. But, this resolution in Saul to die for his countrey, was onely a ciuill vertue: it was farre from pietie: like vnto the fortitude of the heathen, as of the <hi>Decij, Curtij,</hi> among the Romanes, that died for their countrey: and it was Gods iustice rather that forced him to this battell, then his owne will and resolution to defend his countrey. <hi>Borr.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, seeing Saul killing himselfe, died without repentance, ending his daies in despaire, how could he die in the fauour and grace of God, <hi>Mar.</hi> But we will not precipitate our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence concerning his euerlasting reprobation, though he were reiected from the kingdome, leauing him to the iudgement of the Lord. <hi>Borr.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. This could not be Samuel in his owne person, both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and soule: for to raise againe the dead, is the worke onely of God: diuers haue beene raised from the dead: we read of three raised in the old Testament: the widowes sonne by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias, and two by Elizeus, one when he was aliue, the other by touching his bodie, when he was dead: fiue were raised in the Gospel, three by our Sauiour, the rulers daughter, the widowes sonne, and Lazarus: and two by the Apostles, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:20715:163"/>
by Peter, and Eutyches by Paul. But these miracles were wrought for the confirmation of the truth: this miracle if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel had beene raised, had beene for the countenancing of sorcerie and lies: the deuill could not raise Samuel himselfe: and God for the reason aforesaid, would not permit Satan to doe it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some therefore thinke, that it was the bodie of Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, as <hi>Burgens.</hi> saith. But the bodie beeing dead, hath no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuitie, and is vnapt to be vsed as an instrument of action: neither doth it suffice to say, that Sathan might giue action and motion to the bodie: for Satan can make illusions, and counterfeit any shape of himselfe, so that he needed not to haue assumed a bodie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some doe thinke it was the very soule of Samuel, as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus Martyr,</hi> but vnto him I oppose <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>lib. de anima.</hi> that the Deuill deluded both the woman, and Saul, abusing his eies, and her eares. <hi>Augustine,</hi> though sometime he seemeth to doubt, whether it were Samuel, or onely <hi>phantasma,</hi> a phantastical image or apparition of Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el: <hi>ad Simplic. lib.</hi> 2. yet, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de doctr. Christian.</hi> he defendeth and prooueth, that it was <hi>imago sacrilegio excitata,</hi> an image raised by sacriledge. That it was the soule of Samuel, these two reasons are produced to prooue: 1. because thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this storie, he is called Samuel: 2. because that which is here foretold, fell out accordingly. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Scripture calleth things as they appeare, and as they are taken: as Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh is said in his dreame to haue seene seauen kine, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen eares of corne, Gen. 41. because they so appeared: so in this place this apparition is called Samuel, because it seemed so to be, and Saul tooke it to be Samuel. 2. God suffereth the Deuill sometime to speake the truth, and may reueale some things vnto him, as he did to Balaam, for such ende, as the Lord seeth best, for the setting forth of his glorie. <hi>Borr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore the sounder opinion is, that this was not Samuels soule, but a counterfeit representation of him: as may appeare by these reasons. 1. Satan hath no power ouer the spirits of the righteous, neither can their spirits be fetched by enchantments: for then he would abuse the soules of the dead at his pleasure, to deceiue the liuing. Whereas it will be
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:20715:163"/>
answered, that Samuel preuented the witches enchantment, and came before at Gods appointment: this is contrarie to the whole narration: for this Samuel appeared not, till Saul came to the witches house, and Saul had set the witch a worke. 2. It is saide before, that God answered not Saul by Prophets: therefore he by whome Saul now receiueth answer was no Prophet. 3. If God had sent vp Samuel, the dead, to instruct the liuing, why is this reason giuen of the deniall of the rich mans request, to haue one sent from the dead: because if they would not heare Moses and the Prophets, neither would they beleeue, if one were raised from the dead, Luk. 16. in so doing the Lord should seeme to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his owne order. 4. True Samuel would not haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himselfe to be adored: <hi>sic Mart. Borr. Osiand. Pellican. Vatab.</hi> and this is the sentence of <hi>Augustine</hi> in this place: <hi>Indignum esse facinus, si secundum verba historiae commode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur assensus,</hi> it is an vnworthie act, if one presse the meaning of the storie according to the words: and this is cited in the decrees, <hi>Caus.</hi> 26. <hi>qu.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 14. Wherefore this place is friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously alleadged by the Romanists,<note place="margin">Contr. Against <hi>Limbus patrum.</hi>
                  </note> to prooue <hi>Limbus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,</hi> or Purgatorie: that the soules of the Fathers before Christ were in a dungeon of darkenes in the earth, expecting the comming of Christ: or that the soules of the faithfull now goe to a certaine place of Purgatorie vnder the earth: for this counterfeit Samuel, that seemed to ascend out of the earth, which was not the soule of Samuel, but the deuill in his likenes, prooueth no such thing.

                  <hi>13. Quest.</hi> Of the nature of spirits.</head>
               <p>Now vpon this occasion, that mention is here made of the witches <hi>obh,</hi> or familiar spirit, certain necessarie questions doe here offer themselues briefly to be touched: first, of the nature of spirits, secondly of their knowledge, thirdly of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, fourthly whether it be lawfull at any time for Christians to vse the ministerie and helpe of such spirits.</p>
               <p>First, concerning the nature of spirits, called deuills, there are diuers opinions. 1. This opinion is ascribed to the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetikes,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:20715:164"/>
that there are no deuills, or spirits, and that these straunge things, which seeme to be miraculous in the world, are done by the secret and straunge operation of nature, as the loadstone draweth the yron, as also by the phantasie of man, which is very strong: and by the temperature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the bodie: as it is written of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> that he healed a blind man with his spittle, and cured a lame man by touching his foote.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. It will be confessed, that many things vnwoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are caused by such meanes: but there are miraculous and extraordinarie workes, which are aboue the course or stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of nature: as for images to speake, to goe invisible, for vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men to speake Hebrew, Greeke, Latine, and languages which they neuer learned, to stirre things which are a great way off, &amp; such like: of these no naturall reason can be giuen. 2. Sorcerers and Magicians doe vse words, and spells, and charmes, wherein there is no force or power to worke natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. 3. This opinion the Sadduces held, that there were no Angels or spirits: and it is contrarie to the Scriptures, which witnesseth both of the good spirits and elect Angels, and of the reprobate and euill spirits, which we call deuills. As a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spirit was in the mouths of Baals false prophets, 1. king. 22. Satan stirred vp Dauid to number the people, 1. Chron. 21.1. Satan afflicted Iob, and tempted our Sauiour Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The opinion of some was, that mens soules are turned into spirits, the soules of good men into good spirits, and of euill men into euill spirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contr.</hi> But seeing the soules of men and spirits are of a diuers kind and nature, it is no more possible for them to be changed one into an other, then for any other kind of liuing creature to be chaunged and altered into an other kind: and if this should be so, then the soules of men should neuer be reunited to their bodies: which were an impious thing once to thinke or conceiue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Platonists doe imagine, that there are some fierie, some aerie, some watrie spirits, some of a terrene nature: and doe ascribe certaine materiall bodies vnto the spirits. <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. If spirits had bodies, they must be either of a celestiall, or of an elementarie constitution: if any of these, then they should haue either a circular motion as the heauens haue, or an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:20715:164"/>
motion, to ascend, or descend, as the elements doe: but none of these are naturally incident to the spirits. 2. But we neede no further reason to conuince this error, seeing the Scriptures giue testimonie hereunto that the Deuills are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, without flesh and bone, as our Sauiour saith, Luk. 24.39. and in the Gospel, the Deuill is called an vncleane spirit, Math. 12.43. &amp; how could a legion, that is, diuers thousands of deuills be thrust together into one bad man, Mark. 5.9. if they had materiall bodies, and corporall substances. Thus it appeareth, that there are euill spirits, which wander vp and downe in the world: and that they are immateriall, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of a spirituall nature. 3. Lastly, of spirits there are fowre kinds: 1. God is an infinite spirit: 2. the Angels good and bad are spirits: 3. there are the soules and spirits of men: 4. there are also the spirits of bruit beasts. These kinds may be thus distinguished: spirits are either of an infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible nature, as God onely: or of a finite: which are either immortall spirits, and the same either made to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite with bodies, as the soules and spirits of men: or are spirits seperate from bodies, either good, which are the elect Angels, or euill, which are the deuills: or they are mortall, as the spirits of bruit beasts.</p>

                  <hi>14. Quest.</hi> Of the knowledge of Deuills.</head>
               <p n="1">1. That spirits haue a very acute and subtile knowledge, and great insight in things to come, it is euident, seeing that wise and prudent men skilfull in naturall obseruations, can foretell of many things, as of Eclipses, of raine, and such like: yea, the vnreasonable creatures both birds and beasts, by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall instinct, haue a sense of the externall accidents in the aire, before they come: much more haue the spirits more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine coniectures of many things to come: which knowledge of theirs, is diuersly helped: 1. by their subtile and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all nature: 2. their long experience, and continuance: 3. their agilitie of nature, which can in a moment passe from place to place: as <hi>August. lib. de Genes. ad liter.</hi> reporteth of a man that was strangely taken, who refusing to take any suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but at a certaine priests hand, who dwelt fiue miles of, could tell beeing absent, when he came forth of his doores,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:20715:165"/>
where he was, how neere the house: this was done by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilitie of spirits: like as if a watchman should a farre off dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer a band of souldiers comming, and giue notice thereof. 4. The deuill may foretell such things, which the Lord by his ministerie entendeth to doe: as he punished the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by his euill angels: and Satan was here the minister of this iudgement decreed against Saul. 5. The spirits beeing placed in the aire (as the deuill is called the prince that ruleth in the aire, Eph. 2.2.) from thence, as from a watch tower, can more easily see and discerne, the causes of such euents, which happen in the earth. 6. By the writings of the Prophets he vnderstandeth many things: as <hi>Augustine</hi> thinketh, that <hi>Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus</hi> foretelling vnto <hi>Asclepius</hi> the ruine and ouerthrow of Idols, might take that light from the predictions of the Prophets. 7. Satan doth foresee many things by the effects: as when he seeth a man full of good workes, and giuen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion and praier, he can thinke none other, but that such an one is in Gods fauour: <hi>Martyr.</hi> likewise by the contrarie, when he seeth one giuen ouer to all wickednes, he knoweth that Gods iudgements hang ouer his head, as here they did ouer Saul. And therefore it neede not seeme straunge, that the deuill did foretell of his ende. <hi>Augustine</hi> here saith, <hi>quasi magnum sit diabolo ante occasum mortem corporis praevidere, cum signa quaedam soleant apparere morituris,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">cited by <hi>Grat. c.</hi> 26. <hi>qu.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> 
                  <hi>quibus Dei pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectio amota videatur:</hi> As though it were a great matter, for the deuill to foresee ones death before it fall, seeing that they which so die, doe themselues perceiue some signes, that the protection of God is remooued: As Saul gathered by eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent arguments, that the Lord had forsaken him: how then could it be hid from Satan?</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>15. Quest.</hi> What things the Deuill is ignorant of.</head>
               <p>There are fowre kind of things, which Satan hath no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of. 1. He knoweth not things to come, but by conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and the same vncertaine: God onely seeth things to come, as present: for seeing God doth whatsoeuer pleaseth him in heauen &amp; in earth, he can not be ignorant of any of his works: spirits know things to come onely by signes &amp; conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. And Satan is deceiued often in his predictions: 1. either
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:20715:165"/>
because the signes, which he coniectureth by, are vncerten by themselues, as are the signes and prognostications of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and such like: 2. or for that God interposeth himselfe,<note place="margin">How the deuill knoweth things to come.</note> and worketh beyond the naturall and ordinarie course, as when the fire in the fornace had no power to burne the three children: 3. sometime the condition is secret of such things, as are prophesied to come to passe: as when Ionas preached, that within fourtie daies Niniueh should be destroied, vnlesse they repented: 4. the Lord many times either blindeth Satan, that he can not vse the subtiltie of his owne nature, or bindeth his power, that he can not doe what he would. Then it appeareth, that there is great difference betweene the certentie of Angelical, and diabolical predictions: 1. good Angels are more acquainted with Gods will, then Satan is: 2. they are holy spirits, not lead with ambition, enuie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, as Satan is, and therefore their knowledge is not obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or ouercast, with such turbulent affections, as Satans is: 3. they referre all to Gods will, and therefore are not letted, or hindred by the Lord, as Satan is, who aimeth alwaies at a wicked ende.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Satan is ignorant of the mysteries and secrets of Gods counsell: as he was doubtfull concerning Christ, whether he were very God in the flesh: and therfore he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto Christ in an ambiguous tearme, when he tempted him: <hi>If thou be the sonne of God:</hi> he saw many euident argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the diuine power of Christ, and confessed him to be the sonne of God: but he was not certen thereof, for then he would not haue stirred vp Iudas to betray Christ,<note place="margin">Satan did not know certenly, that Christ was God in the flesh.</note> and the Scribes and Pharisies to haue put him to death, if he had knowne that by his death, Christ should haue ouercome him, that had power of death, that is the deuill, Hebr. 2.14. for as the Apostle saith, <hi>had they knowne, they neuer would haue cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Lord of glorie,</hi> 1. Cor. 2.8. which may as well be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of Satan himselfe, as of those which were his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and instruments. The good Angels themselues did not fully comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the mysterie of the incarnation of the Sonne of God, and of our redemption by him, vntill they sawe the same accomplished: as <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith, <hi>To the intent, that vnto principalities and powers in heauenly places might be made knowne by the Church the manifold wisdome of God,</hi> Eph. 3.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:20715:166"/>
10. much more therefore was this mysterie kept hid and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from Satan.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Satan knoweth not what is in the heart of man, but onely by coniectures and signes: directly he neither knoweth the will, nor the vnderstanding or iudgement of man: two waies he soundeth mans heart: either by the precedent causes, the obiects offered outwardly, as when Dauid espied Bersabe, or by the inward imagination or phantasie: yet he is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whether the will shall apprehende such obiects or not: or els he gesseth by the outward signes and impressions of the affections in the bodie: as loue, anger, rage, care, and such like, doe discouer themselues in the countenance, and other parts of the bodie: but where such impressions are not, as wise men can bridle and conceale their affections, there Satan faileth in his coniecture. Further, the Scripture speaketh euidently, that God onely is the knower of the heart: <hi>Thou onely knowest the hearts of all the children of men,</hi> 1. king. 8.39. And the Apostle saith, <hi>Who knoweth the things of a man, sauing the spirit of man which is in him,</hi> 1. Cor. 2.11. Mans heart is knowne to none, but vnto God, and himselfe: but more vnto God, then vnto man himselfe: for both God seeth aforehand, what thoughts are like to rise in mans heart, which man knoweth not himselfe, as Psalm. 139.2. <hi>Thou vnderstandest my thoughts a farre off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and God is greater then a mans heart, that a man can not thinke what he would in good things, but as the Lord inspireth him. Further, if Satan did know mans heart, then would he be more busie in his temptations, and mote dangerous. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is the preheminence which the spirit of God hath beyond the euill spirit: <hi>He that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the meaning of the spirit.</hi> Rom. 8.27.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth thing, which Satan is ignorant of, is of the graces of regeneration, the consolation of the spirit, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a true and liuely faith: the Deuill hath a kinde of superficiall beleefe, as <hi>Saint Iames</hi> saith, <hi>That the Deuills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and tremble,</hi> Iam. 2. he hath an historicall faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Scriptures to be true, and that the incarnation, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, resurrection of Christ, were so done and fulfilled, as they are in Scripture declared: but none of these he beleeueth to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:20715:166"/>
his comfort: neither can he comprehend them, as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doe: so that herein euery faithfull man hath more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by the sense and experience of faith, then Satan hath.</p>

                  <hi>16. Quest.</hi> Of the power of spirits, what they are able to doe by their spirituall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and what not.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Here the power of spirits is to be distinguished: for there is in them a threefold power to be considered; a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power, which they haue by their creation, as they are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; a limited power, restrained by God; and their power augmented and enlarged from God, for some speciall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, wherein it pleaseth the Lord to vse their ministerie. The Deuill, by whome the sorcerers of Egypt wrought, could by his naturall power, produce the similitude and likenesse of serpents: but that power was restrained, when they assaied likewise to counterfeit lice: his power was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, when he was suffered to execute his malice vpon Iob: for <hi>Augustines</hi> distinction is here to be held, that the Deuill otherwise afflicteth the godly, and otherwise punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wicked: <hi>In filijs diffidentiae, tanquam in proprijs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipijs operatur:</hi> he worketh in the children of disobedience, as in his owne vessells: but he hath no power vpon the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, vnlesse it be giuen him: <hi>sicut homo de pecore suo facit, quod vult, de alieno pecore vt faciat, expectat sibi dari potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, ab eo cuius est: ibi potestas, quae fuerat, prohibetur, hic, quae non fuerat, tribuitur:</hi> as a man may doe with his owne beast what he will, but with an other mans he can doe nothing without leaue of the owner: there the power which was is restrained, here the power, which was not is attributed. <hi>Aug. in Psal.</hi> 77. Here now the question is onely of the naturall power of Satan, as he is a spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now concerning this power, some doe extenuate it too much, thinking that neither the spirits, nor those which worke by spirits can doe any thing: but that men are onely by them deluded and deceiued: for Nero, and Iulian, which were Emperours, and sought to suppresse the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith, did confederate themselues with sorcerers and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:20715:167"/>
Magicians, and yet they could effect nothing by them: yet it had beene much for the aduantage of Satans kingdome, to haue aided such speciall instruments, what he could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. That the spirits are able to worke straunge things it appeareth diuersly, both by the diuine lawes, made against them, that they should not suffer a witch to liue, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 22. Leuit. 20. Deut. 18. and by the humane lawes of the Imperiall and other states: which lawes should not haue been made, if such were thought to be able to doe nothing: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the storie of Iob it is euident, that the deuill brought downe fire from heauen, and raised the winds: in the Gospel, the spirits that possessed the bodies of men, did torment the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and cast them sometime into the water, sometime into the fire. Beside, in the Ethnike stories it is recorded, that Tuccia a vestal virgine did carrie water in a siue, and Claudia drew a shippe that stucke in the sand, that could not be remooued by any humane force: <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth how the oliue groue of <hi>Vectius Marcellus</hi> was remooued: to denie that these things were done, it would be thought too great boldnes. <hi>Mart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But touching the examples of Nero and Iulian, who effected little by art Magicke, the cause was not in their want of power, but for that God restrained their power, that Satan did not what he would. <hi>Martyr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Some doe ascribe too much vnto the power of spirits: as that they can <hi>excitare tempestates,</hi> raise tempests: as we read, how the deuill brought downe lightening, and raised the winds, Iob 1. and in Norway, there are certaine called <hi>Lapones,</hi> that haue three knots in their beards, who if they loose one of them, then there followeth a great tempest in the Sea, if the second, then the tempest is encreased, if the third, then the storme rageth, and riseth as though heauen &amp; earth would goe together: this is the opinion of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> therein consenting with <hi>Augustine:</hi> the reason of his opinion is, because, as he thinketh, the deuill can bring and put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the causes, &amp; beginnings, and seede as it were of things: and so his opinion is, that those serpents which the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an sorcerers made to appeare, were true serpents, which the deuill brought forth, beeing not ignorant of what seede and beginnings serpents were made. <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The Scripture ascribeth the power of raine, lightening, and winds, onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:20715:167"/>
God, Ierem. 10.13. <hi>He causeth the cloudes to ascend from the endes of the earth: he turneth lightening to raine, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth the winde out of his treasures:</hi> by these workes of power, the Prophet concludeth, that the Lord was God, and that the gods of the heathen (which were the Deuills, whome they worshipped in their idols) could doe no such thing. 2. <hi>Augustine</hi> is of that opinion, that Satan brought downe fire from heauen, Iob 1. but both the text it selfe is against him, which calleth it the fire of God: it was done then by the power of God: and against <hi>Augustines</hi> priuate opinion, I can oppose the determination of an whole Synod:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Si quis cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit diabolum sua potestate posse excitare tempestates, fulgurae, &amp;c. anathema sit: Let him be accursed, that thinketh the Deuill can raise tempests, lightening, &amp;c. of his owne power.</hi> 3. If the Deuill can make serpents, or bring forth any true liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because he can put together the seedes, and beginnings of things, then why may he not as well helpe the generation of man, and procreate children by humane seede, which were absurd to imagine: as for those serpents, that they were no true serpents, but in appearance onely, I haue shewed else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, in the questions vpon the 7. chap. of Exodus. 4. But thus much further I conceiue of the power of spirits in the disposing of the weather: that although they cannot raise va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours or exhalations, whereof the winds, and raine, and other meteors are engendred, at their pleasure; yet when this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is made by nature, and such things are alreadie in beeing, that Satan can transport the raines, winds, lighetning, from one corner to an other: and this is all he can doe for that matter, as I haue shewed in the place before cited.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now then, keeping the meane way betweene both, though Satan be neither so impotent and void of power, as some thinke, nor yet so potent, as some others imagine, yet many straunge things he is able to doe. 1. The Deuill can mooue or transport from place to place, and that very speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with great agilitie: for if the spirit of man, hath that power to mooue and stirre the bodie, the like power can not be denied vnto spirits of a more powerfull nature: the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture also giueth euidence for this, that Sathan transported the bodie of Christ: it pleased our Sauiour to giue the tempter that aduantage, and to yeild him so farre to be caried of him,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:20715:168"/>
that he might confound him in his owne deuise, and slay him with his owne weapon, as Dauid killed Goliath: so we heard before how <hi>Claudia</hi> by a diabolicall power remooued a ship: so Satan vseth to transport Magicians and sorcerers, and to cause them to ride in the aire: as Simon Magus, as Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call stories make mention, could glide in the aire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Satan can vse creatures as his instruments, whether they be liuing, or voide of life, as he spake out of the serpent vnto Eue:<note place="margin">The deuill can not assume dead mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> and he caused the image of fortune among the Romanes to speake, or he rather spake out of that image. But it is a question, whether he can vse the bodies of dead men, as his instruments, and take and assume them out of their graues: which is rather to be thought that he can not doe: both because the carkesses of dead men falling to corruption, are more vnfit for any such motion, then dead instruments that neuer had life: and for that this is set forth as a peculiar worke of Gods power, in raising the bodies of certaine dead out of their graues, to be a testimonie of the resurrection of Christ. Matth. 27.53.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Deuill notwithstanding may assume vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the likenes of any bodie, either of the liuing or the dead: which yet is no true bodie, but onely in outward shape and appearance: for like as in the cloudes, there are often natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall impressions shewing the similitude of diuers shapes, as of men fighting in the aire, and such like, so we conceiue that Satan by disposing and gathering the aire together, can make a representation of colours and of shapes: as is euident he did, in the apparition of Samuel. But whereas <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> equally attributeth this power to spirits both good and bad, to assume true bodies, which may be handled and felt, therein I can not subscribe vnto him: that the good Angels haue appeared in true sensible bodies, it is euident both by their eating, as the three Angels that came to Abraham, and by the washing of their feete, Gen. 19.2. But these bodies they assumed not by their owne Angelical power, but the Lord the creator so disposing, that they might take such bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, during such seruice and ministerie, and afterward lay them downe againe.<note place="margin">Euill spirits ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer appeare with true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> But we neuer found in Scripture, that euill spirits appeared with true reall bodies, but onely in
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:20715:168"/>
outward shew: and therefore the Apostles, when they saw our Sauiour Christ walking vpon the waters, suspected that it was <hi>phantasma,</hi> a phantasme, Mark. 6.50. that is, a spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing with a phantasticall bodie: our Sauiour also confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth as much himselfe, saying to his disciples, who supposed him to be a spirit: <hi>Handle me and see me, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me haue,</hi> Luk. 24.37. he meaneth an euill spirit, such as they were afraide of: this had beene no good argument to satisfie the Apostles, if euill and wicked spirits could assume true bodies, that might be felt and handled.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Deuill can diuersly delude and deceiue the senses, either the outward with imagined shewes, or the inward, with phantasticall imaginations: those by day by visions, the other by night in dreames, casting them asleepe, whome he seeketh to seduce and deceiue.<note place="margin">How the deuill can delude the sense.</note> He can deceiue the sense with false and vaine illusions diuers waies: sometime by agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and quicknes of motion, as by this tricke iuglers seeme to doe strange feates: sometime he vseth naturall helpes, as there be certaine mettalls and perfumes, which beeing bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, will make all the chamber seeme as though it were full of serpents: as he can cast a myst in the aire, and make a thing inuisible, by thickening and darkening of the <hi>medium,</hi> as it is called, as <hi>Plato</hi> writeth of <hi>Gyges,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> of <hi>Aene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> that they went inuisible: and sometime he can vitiate and corrupt the organe of sight the eye, by tempering the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in such sort, as things shall appeare like as the humour is: as when all appeareth outwardly like blood, when some bloodie humour is mixed with the sight: like as they which are sicke of choler, the tongue beeing infected with that bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter humour, imagine whatsoeuer it tasteth, likewise to be bitter. By these and other such sleights Satan can play the counterfeit, and so deceiue and beguile the sense. Such kinde of cousenage was that, whereof <hi>Philostratus</hi> writeth in the life of <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus,</hi> that a certaine young man was enamoured with a faire rich woman, the mariage feast was prepared, which seemed to be set forth with vessells of gold and siluer: but <hi>Apollonius</hi> desired her to be one of the spirits, called <hi>Lamiae,</hi> and presently all that shewe
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:20715:169"/>
of siluer and gold was turned to coales. The like hereunto was that, which is mentioned in the <hi>Arausicane</hi> councell, of certaine women that imagined they road vpon beasts in the night, with <hi>Diana</hi> the Pagane goddesse, or <hi>Herodias,</hi> beeing accompanied with great troupes: of which vaine apparitions, the Councell giueth this sentence, <hi>Satanas, qui se transfigurat in angelum lucis, transformat se in diversarum personarum species, &amp; mentem quam captivam tenet, in somnis deludit.</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, which can transforme himselfe into an Angel of light, doth transforme himselfe into the likenes of diuers persons, and deceiueth the minde, which he holdeth captiue with dreames. The same opinion is to be held of the spirits called <hi>Incubi,</hi> and <hi>succubi,</hi> some shewing themselues like women, some like men: for the deuill deceiueth his clients in their dreames, with such sights, as though they were set at bankets, and had reall fruition of carnall pleasure. Thus it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for the deuill to transport men into woods, and soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie places, and to shew them strange sights, as of some fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the flames of Purgatorie, and such like, to nusle people in ignorance and superstition.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Here a distinction is necessarie: the ministerie of spirits is vsed, either by authoritie and commandement from God, as our Sauiour, and his Apostles by the spirit of God did cast out deuills: or els by compact and agreement made with them, which is altogether vnlawfull, for that were to fall from God vnto the deuill. 2. And whereas the spirits seeme to be delighted with hearbs, and to be called by certaine rites and ceremonies, that is done but to collude with, and to deceiue men: there is no power in such hearbs, ceremonies, and charmes, but all dependeth vpon the couenant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie, which they haue made with their clients. Like as the Lord hath appointed certaine holy rites and Sacraments, as signes of the couenant betweene him and his people: which outward signes haue no actiuitie or working power of themselues, but from the couenant, wherof they are signes: So Satan, who would herein imitate God, seemeth to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with those superstitious signes, but it is the deuillish
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:20715:169"/>
couenant, that bindeth him vnto his ministers, and yet no longer then he will himselfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now concerning Exorcists,<note place="margin">Of Exorcists.</note> which tooke vpon them to adjure and cast out deuills, this gift and function was of three sorts: 1. one was lawfull and instituted of Christ, hauing both the name and the thing, which was in vse in the Apostles time, and continued some time after in the primitiue Church, so long as the gift of miracles was in vse, and thought by the Lord to be needfull for the planting of his Church. 2. An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Exorcists hath the name, but not the thing, such as yet are called in Poperie: which is a vaine title, that mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gift of adjuring and expelling spirits beeing ceased. 3. There was a third sort of Exorcists, which was among the Iewes before the comming of Christ, and in his time, whereof our Sauiour speaketh, Matth. 12.27. <hi>If I through Beelzebub cast out deuills, by whome doe your children cast them out?</hi> it seemeth that they vsed in the name of God to cast out deuils, as the sonnes of Sceva a Iew assaied to doe, Act. 19. which miraculous worke it pleased God, should take place among his people, to helpe their weaknes and infirmitie vntill the comming of the Messiah: as we read of a greater miracle which continued till Christs time, of the descending of an Angel at certaine times into the poole of Bethesda, Ioh. 5. And this sort of Exorcists, remained still among the Iewes, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> maketh mention of one Eleazar, who in the presence of <hi>Vespasian</hi> and his sonnes, cast a deuill out of a man, and this he testifieth, that he himselfe saw: <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>antiquit.</hi> yet this their exorcising was not lawfull, they abused thereunto the name of God: though the Lord thought good for the manifesting of his power among the Gentiles, that in his name such things should be done.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But now to vse any enchantment to preuent witche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as many things are commonly receiued and prescribed,<note place="margin">It is not lawfull to vse charmes.</note> whereof there is no reason to be giuen, to helpe both men and cattell so bewitched, it is altogether held to be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: many doe vse spells, and charmes, &amp; other obseruations, to cure diseases, and to finde out witchcraft: which <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh in the place before cited, to haue been found out by Salomon for the benefit of men: to the which it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that if such things were found out by Salomon, which

vncertaine, either it was after his fall, when his wisdome was corrupted and prophaned, or the Lord suffered such things to be for the hardnes of the peoples hearts, and to succour their weaknes.

               <p n="1">1. IT is like that in the countrey of the Philistims where Abraham and Isaak sometime had soiourned, and Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedek had dwelt not farre off, that they had learned some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from them concerning the knowledge of the true God, and of his waies: <hi>Mart.

But it will be obiected, that the name <hi>Iehovah</hi> was not knowne in Abrahams time, because the Lord saith, <hi>I appeared vnto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, to Izhak, and to Iaakob, by my name Almightie, but by my name Iehovah was I not knowne vnto them,</hi> Exod. 6.3.

               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that as Dauids flying vnto Achish was lawfull, and done not without the Lords direction: so that Dauid herein, purposing to ioyne with Achish dissembled not at all, yet relying here vpon the direction of Gods spirit, not to proceede to ioyne in battell against Israel, vnlesse it should so seeme good vnto the Lord. <hi>Borr. Contra.</hi> 1. What is to be thought of Dauids rescuing himselfe with Achish from Saul, is shewed before, c. 27. qu. 1. and to thinke that Dauid had any such cogitation to fight with Achish against his people, is to make him an apparent transgressour of the lawes of God, which did forbid all kinde of confederacie with the vncircumcised nations: for if Iehoshaphat were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued for ioyning with idolatrous Ahaziah, onely to make shippes to goe to Tarshish, 2. Chron. 20.37. much more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull was it to ioyne with such against the people of God. Neither would it haue helped Dauid, to depend for this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vpon Gods will: for seeing he was anointed king, to this ende, that by his hand the Lord would deliuer Israel out of the hands of their enemies, 2. Sam. 3.18. he could not make any question, but that this seruice against his countrey and people, was displeasing vnto God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some confesse that Dauid herein dissembled, &amp; spake otherwise then he thought, but excuse this his dissimulation by his present necessitie. <hi>Osiand. Contra.</hi> Although necessitie doe helpe to extenuate a fault, yet it doth not iustifie it: it was a lesse ouersight, that Dauid beeing forced by necessitie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the kings fauour, thus spake; yet it altogether excuseth him not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore we need not be so scrupulous, to yeild some infirmitie to haue beene in the Saints, where the Scripture hath set it downe so plainely: for Dauid in pretending that he desired to goe and fight against the kings enemies, therein apparently speaketh against his owne minde and affection, who was glad of that opportunitie giuen him to be rid of the kings seruice, and he euidently flattereth, and gloseth with the king. <hi>Martyr.</hi>

Now in respect of the ende and intention of flatterers, we may discerne between Christian comitie and gentlenes, and carnall adulation and flatterie: <hi>S. Paul</hi> became all vnto all men, he seeked to please in things, not vncomely but indifferent, and he did it not for any temporal commoditie or aduantage to himselfe, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to winne them vnto Christ. Further, let it be considered, that there are two sorts of flatterers: some are palpable and grosse flatterers, that say and vnsay, to please them, whome they flatter: if they say, nay, they likewise answer, Nay; if yea, then yea also: there is an other sort of flatterers, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a kind of libertie, as though they seemed not to flatter: as here Dauid seeketh to please the king, by shewing his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to the kings seruice, contrarie to the kings determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Mart.</hi>

               <p>Herein Dauid did no more then he might lawfully: Dauid might vse the seruice of this Egyptian herein by a treble right: 1. he beeing an Egyptian, and no Amalekite, was, as it seemeth beeing a poore stranger, constrained to serue an hard seruice vnder an Amalekite: 2. beeing left of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he falleth into the hands of Dauid, and so by the law of battell, he is exempted from the seruice of his former master: <hi>Borr.</hi> 3.

Dauid therefore with whome he might lawfully warre, he might also lawfully kill. 2. But it will be obiected, that the Amalekites dealt not so hardly with them: for they put not any to the sword in Ziklag. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, 1. that there was no resistance against the Amalekites, and therefore they had no cause to put any to the sword: 2. and in that they spared their wiues, they did it rather of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous mind, to haue them raunsomed, then of any mercifull inclination. 3.

A third interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is, that Dauid smote them from the morning, vntill the euening, and so vntill the next day: so the <hi>Septuag.</hi> these doe beginne the time right, but they extend it too farre, vntill the next day: it is like that the night did breake off the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, neither could Dauid and his men haue endured a whole day and night, without any intermission. 4. Wherefore the meaning rather is, that Dauid smote them from the twilight in the morning, vntill the euening of the same day: for <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheph,</hi> signifieth the twilight either in the morning, or eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but here rather of the morning, because an other word <hi>ghereb,</hi> is vsed to expresse the twilight of the euening.

               <p>Saul was reprooued for sauing the best of the Amalekites cattell, and bringing of them away, c. 15. but it was lawfull for Dauid to doe so. 1.

Now they diuided the whole pray into two parts, which consisted either of the cattell, which were taken from Ziklag, which are called his, that is, Dauids cattell, or of such cattell as the Amalekites had robbed and spoiled from other places: and this was driuen before the other, and they called it Dauids pray, not onely for that the praise of the victorie redoundeth to the captaine, <hi>Mart.</hi> but because Dauid was the onely cause of this exploit, in consulting with God, by whose dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction this enterprise was taken in hand, and by this meanes they make amends for their former ouersight, when in their heate they would haue risen against Dauid. <hi>Pellican.</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is called Dauids pray, because the other part of the spoile was to be restored to the inhabitants of Ziklag againe.</p>

Dauid calleth them brethren, either in respect of their nation, and countrey, being all of Israel, or because they were all of one profession and religion: and though they were now euill disposed, yet he perswaded himselfe, that they might come to be of a better minde: whereby we are taught not to be out of hope of any, but that they may be otherwise min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.

               <p n="1">1. Dauid to this equall diuision perswadeth by two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reasons: both because the victorie was not atchieued by their power or strength, but giuen them by God: and for that there was reason, seeing they did their seruice in keeping the stuffe, that they should take part of the spoile with the rest: for they also did warrefare in an other sort. <hi>Iun.</hi> 2. Further, the equitie of this law appeareth, by these reasons: 1. they were wearie, and could goe no further, their will was not wanting, but their abilitie: and therefore their willing minde was to be accepted according to that they had, not according to that they had not, as the Apostle saith, 2. Cor. 8.12. that is, according to their power. 2. they all staied with the stuffe by a common consent of the rest, v. 22. <hi>They made them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide at the riuer.</hi> 3. they also did good seruice, in keeping the stuffe, which otherwise might haue been spoiled by some enemies, if they had not staied by it. 4. if the rest had beene ouercome, that went downe to battell, their daunger should haue beene as great. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. Beside herein Dauid had the example of Abraham, Gen. 14. who reserued vnto Aner, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col and Mamre their parts, though as may be gathered, they went not with Abraham to battell, but were onely confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and assistants, Gen. 14. <hi>Mar.</hi> So likewise Moses diuided the spoile of the Madianites betweene the souldiers and the rest of the Congregation.

               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that an equall distribution was made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Arithmetical proportion, that is, to euery one alike, not by a Geometrical, to euery one according to his seruice: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this victorie was obtained, not by humane strength and policie, but by the diuine assistance. <hi>Contra.</hi> But this was made as a law, not onely for that time, but to continue after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and therfore that was not the reason: and beside, it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enacted for a law, it was iust and reasonable: but to giue vnto all alike, were vniust: for in distributing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, it is agreeable vnto iustice, that respect should be had vnto mens deserts. 2. Wherefore it is rather like, that Dauid made a iust distribution to euery one according to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of his seruice: which may be made plaine by these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. 1. There went downe to battell foure hundred, there staied with the stuffe onely two hundred: an equall diuision therefore betweene them both had not beene iust. 2. In the president, which it seemeth Dauid followed, namely, that of Moses in diuiding the spoiles of the Midianites, the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion was obserued: for although they which went not to battell, had part of the pray, yet the souldiers had the greatest part: for they beeing but 12. thousand, had the halfe part of the pray: and the rest of the Congregation, which amounted vnto 600. thousand, had the other. And againe, of the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers part there was taken but one of fiue hundred both of the men and cattell to be giuen vnto the Priests, but out of the peoples part there was taken one out of fiftie: so it is euident, that the souldiers had a preheminence. <hi>Genevens.</hi> Wherefore although Dauid thought it meete, that they which staied by the stuffe should haue part of the pray: yet it is like that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid made such a distribution, as that euery man was rewarded according to his seruice. <hi>Mar.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Dauid had found entertainment among them of his tribe, there hiding himselfe, while Saul pursued him: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dauid, to shew his thankefulnes, sendeth them presents:

this reason is touched afterward, v. 31. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.

These cities of Iudah also had beene robbed and spoiled by the Amalekites, as the Egyptian told Dauid, v. 14. that they had roued vpon the coast of Iudah, and therefore Dauid thought it reasonable, that some restitution should be made vnto them of their losses. <hi>Pellican.</hi> 4.

               <p n="1">1. The most Interpreters, and all but <hi>Iunius,</hi> doe take Bethel here for a proper name, the <hi>Septuag. Chald. Lat. Vat.</hi> with the rest. 2.

                  <hi>3. Quest. v. 4.</hi> Whether Saul can be excused or iustified for killing himselfe.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Some thinke, that Saul did this of a valiant minde, and therein did choose rather thus to die, then that God should receiue any dishonour by his death: and <hi>Pellicane</hi> doubteth not to say, that Saul taking a sword, and killing himselfe, <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam in manus Domini commendavit,</hi> did commend his soule into the hands of God, <hi>&amp; sacrificium se Domino obtulit,</hi> and offered vp himselfe a sacrifice vnto God: here also the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Sampson is alleadged, that brought destruction vpon himselfe. <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. They which kill themselues, doe it of a cowardly, rather then valiant minde: for if they could with patience beare and indure their troubles, they would not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten their owne death. 2. Saul herein respected more his owne dishonour, then Gods: for he giueth this reason, least the vncircumcised should come and thrust him through, and mock him. <hi>Bor.</hi> 3. Neither could this be a sacrifice vnto God, beeing not offered in faith, for Saul immediately before had shewed his infidelitie in seeking vnto a witch. 4. The exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Sampson is farre vnlike: for the spirit of God came vpon him, but the euill spirit was vpon Saul: Sampson in zeale inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods enemies, &amp; not directly his own,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:20715:177"/>
but as willing to giue vp his life for the glorie of God, in the confusion of his enemies: but all things were vnlike in Saul, he principally intended his owne death, was not therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged vpon Gods enemies, neither died in Gods quarrell, but to redeeme his owne shame. 2. Therefore the sounder opinion is, that Saul died in despaire, and so killed himselfe: and this his desperate death may seeme to be a forerunner of euerlasting destruction. <hi>Osiand.</hi> And that this act of Sauls was vnlawfull, it is euident, 1. Cor. 11.14. where it is saide, <hi>Because he asked counsell of a familiar spirit, and asked not of the Lord, the Lord slue him:</hi> that is, the Lord so disposed, that by the ministerie of Satan working vpon the malice of Sauls heart, he was slaine by his owne hands. 3. Herein Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice appeareth, that as Sauls sword was turned against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Priests, in putting them to death, and against Dauid whome he vniustly persecuted, so now he himselfe should fall vpon the edge thereof: he first spake to his harnesse bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to thrust him through: whome the Hebrewes take to be Doeg, that fell vpon the Priests: but it is like if it had beene that murderous wretch, he would no more haue stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at it, then he had done in killing the Priests: the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is found in the Romane stories of <hi>M.

                  <hi>4. Quest.</hi> Whether it be lawfull for one vpon any occasion to kill himselfe.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Many reasons may be alleadged to shew the vnlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this fact, for any to lay violent hands vpon themselues. 1. The Scriptures doe directly condemne it: it is forbidden in that commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> for he that killeth himselfe, sheddeth his owne blood, and therfore is a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: for if it be vnlawfull for one man to kill an other, much more is it, to take away his owne life, seeing euery man is nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest himselfe: and it is more vnnaturall for one to shedde his owne blood then an others. 2. Our life is the gift of God, therefore it cannot be cast away without great impietie. 3. None of the Saints in their greatest miserie, thought of any such way, to rid themselues out of trouble, as Ioseph, Dauid,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:20715:177"/>
Iob. 4. Our Sauiour biddeth his Apostles to escape trouble, to flee from one citie to an other, he neuer opened any gappe vnto such enterprises. 5. <hi>Plato</hi> vsed this reason, that as soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers doe commit a capitall offence leauing their station, without commandement from the generall: so neither should a man put himselfe out of Gods seruice in this life, to the which he is called. <hi>Aristotle</hi> addeth further, that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to take out of the way a citizen without the warrant of the law, and the consent of the magistrate: so neither should a man displace himselfe, beeing a citizen and inhabitant in this great commonwealth of the world, without the will of the highest and supreame Iudge. Therefore <hi>Hierome</hi> well saith, speaking in the person of God: <hi>Non recipio tales animas,</hi>

                  <hi>quae me nolente exierunt è corpore:</hi> I will not receiue those soules, which against my will goe out of their bodies. 6. The Athenians had a law, that they which killed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, should confiscate all their goods, and not be buried in the fields of Athens. But the Romane lawes somewhat mitigated the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of those which killed themselues: decreeing, that if he that killed himselfe, were not guiltie of any other crime, his fact should not hurt his successours, and posteritie: <hi>Diocles. l.</hi> 9. <hi>tit.</hi> 2. <hi>leg.</hi> 12. and such other lawes there are diuers to the same effect. And the reason why the Romanes gaue greater libertie vnto this sinne, then the Athenians, may seeme to be this: because they had so many famous persons that had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themselues, whome they were loath to count infamous, or condemne, whose examples shall presently be brought forth. <hi>ex Martyr.</hi>
               </p>

doe not much mooue vs, for their actions proceeding not of faith, howsoeuer glorious they seemed to be, were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Some of them killed themselues thorough impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as not beeing able to endure the reproach and shame, with they feared: as <hi>Lucretia</hi> because shee was defloured, and <hi>Cato Vticensis,</hi> for that <hi>Cesar</hi> preuailed, and yet he bid his sonne promise himselfe all good of <hi>Cesars</hi> clemencie. Some of them, (but not many of that minde) did shorten their daies for the desire of immortalitie, as <hi>Cleombrotus Ambraciata:</hi> but this was a preposterous and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous desire in them, to hasten to immortalitie, without the calling of the eternall and immortall God, whose gift it was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the examples obiected out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: as of Sampson we haue seene before, quest. 3. <hi>Razis</hi> is alleadged out of an Apocryphal booke, which is not of canonicall authoritie: in the same booke, 2. Macchab. 12.42. Iudas Macchabeus is commended for sacrificing for certaine idolaters, after they were dead: who hauing idols found about them, died apparently in the state of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie: for such the Papists themselues forbid praier to be made.

               <p n="3">3. And of those which killed themselues to preserue their chastitie, this charitable iudgement is to be giuen, that though the act, which they committed, was vnlawfull, how good so euer the occasion and intention seemed to be: (for we must not doe euill, that good may come thereof) yet God might giue them the sight of their sinne before their soule departed, and so they repenting of it, it was not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them. And here <hi>Augustines</hi> resolution is sound: <hi>Non veneramur eos nomine martyrum, qui sibi collum liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt:</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Some doubt not to affirme, that Saul commended his soule into Gods hands, and obediently submitting himselfe vnto Gods iustice, which inflicted this punishment vpon him: <hi>Hanc domini iustitiam, vbi amplexatus est, post primam temporalem<expan>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. But Saul yeilded not himselfe of an obedient minde vnto the punishment foretold, (for diabolicall predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions worke not obedience, but rather diffidence) but of a desperate minde, forced by Gods iustice, did cast himselfe headlong into present danger. 2. Neither is the first death though it be neuer so fearefull and terrible, an exemption from euerlasting death: for the disobedient in Noahs time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the flood, and yet afterwards were in the prison of hell. 1. Pet. 3.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some therefore doubt not to affirme, that Saul, <hi>post foedam mortem, abiectus est in perpetuos inferorum cruciatus:</hi> after a filthie death, was cast into the perpetuall paines of hell. <hi>Osiand.</hi> But seeing the Scripture doth not directly speake of his euerlasting reprobation, but of his temporall reiection from the kingdome, we are not hastily herein to precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate our sentence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherfore the safer way is, to leaue Saul vnto the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and not without the warrant of the Scripture to giue any sentence of his conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation. And yet by the whol course of the historie, by Sauls wilfull transgressions, his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the Prophet in not staying his comming, falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Lords word in sparing of Agag the king of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malek: in putting to death the innocent Priests: in persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Dauid, and breaking his oath and faith there giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in consulting with a witch, and lastly in his desperate

Further, the Philistims are more cruell in this battel, then they were when the Arke was taken in Eli his time, when Ophni and Phinehes were slaine: for then they did not so rage vpon the bodies of the dead: the reason is, because they had since that time receiued many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfitures by the hand of Samuel, Saul, and Dauid: by which meanes their hatred was more exasperate. 3. They laide vp Sauls armour in the house of Ashtaroth, and his head in the house of Dagon, 1.

               <p n="1">1. Here mention is made onely of the bodie of Saul so hanged vp: but 1. Chron. 11.12. it is gathered, that all the bodies of Sauls sonnes were so serued. 2.

This Bethshan, or Bethshean, Iud. 1.27. belonged vnto the lot of Menasseh: but was not yet recouered from the Philistims, as is noted before of Keilah, c. 27.6. 4. The Israelites by the law of Moses, were not to suffer the bodies of those which were put to death, to hang all night vpon the tree, Deut. 21.23. but the Philistims beeing more inhumane, and reiecting the lawes of
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:20715:179"/>
the people of God, doe expose the bodies of these worthie men vnto derision. And in this kind of death Saul is accursed: for the curse of God is on him that hangeth on a tree: Saul was reiected of God in this life, and accursed in his death. 5. And herein appeareth Gods iust wrath and indignation against him, that doth suffer his owne glorie to be obscured among the Philistims, that he might bring vpon Saul this iust and deserued punishment. When the Lord was angrie with Israel for the golden calfe set vp in Horeb, and would presently haue destroied them, Moses turned the Lords pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by this perswasion, that the Egyptians would haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken occasion thereby to haue blasphemed God, Exod. 32.12. but here the Lord neglecteth, and is carelesse of his owne glorie, that his iustice might take place in Sauls punishment. God receiueth dishonour two waies, either by the euill life of those which professe his name, as Dauid by his sinne cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the enemies of God to blaspheme, 2. Sam. 12.14. or els by the punishment of his people, which is procured notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing iustly by their sinnes: so the people are taught to pray for the turning away of Gods iudgements, saying, <hi>Giue not thine heritage a reproach vnto the heathen,</hi> Ioel 2.17. And thus the Lord sustained some dishonour, in the punishment of Saul among the Philistims: but no dishonour at all among his owne people, which did see that Sauls sinnes did call for vengeance at Gods hands. <hi>Mart.</hi> We learne by this, that sinne is so grieuous a thing in the sight of God, that he will not suffer it to goe vnpunished, though it be with the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for the time of his owne glorie.</p>

                  <hi>8. Quest. v. 12.</hi> Of the fact of the men of Iabesh Gile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad in rescuing the bodie of Saul and of his sonnes.</head>
               <p n="1">1. These men of Iabesh dwelled on the further side of Iordan, whether the Philistims had not approached: therfore by this it is euident, that they are deceiued, which read v. 7. that the men of Israel on the other side of Iorden, when they saw them put to flight, left their cities and fled: so read, <hi>S.C. L.B.G.</hi> for the Iabeshites dwelt on the further side of Iorden, who were so farre from flying and leauing their citie, that
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:20715:180"/>
they valiantly set vpon a citie of the Philistims, and recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the bodies of Saul, and of his sonnes: the meaning then is, that they which were on this side <hi>Iorden,</hi> toward the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims, fled away: for <hi>begheber, in transitu,</hi> indifferently signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, on either side, this, or the other. <hi>Iun.</hi> 2. These men of Iabesh did this exploit to shew their thankfulnes vnto Saul, by whose meanes they had beene formerly deliuered from Nahash king of Ammon, c. 11. <hi>Pellic.</hi> 3. Though Saul died in his sinne, yet they would not be wanting toward him in an office and part of humanitie: for there is a kinde of courtesie and dutie to be performed euen toward the wicked. A child is to shew his reuerence toward a wicked father, not enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him any euill thing, as Ionathan followed Saul to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and would not be wanting in any dutie. So neither are subiects to renounce their obedience vnto an euill Prince, standing vnder Gods curse: when <hi>Ambrose</hi> excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour, he did not free the people of their obedience and seruice vnto him:<note place="margin">Contr.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</note> the practise of the Church of Rome is contrarie, who when they excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Princes, doe absolue their subiects from their fealtie and allegeance. 4. But this is to be vnderstood of humanitie to be performed to such wicked men, where God hath not commanded the contrarie: for Saul sinned in sparing Agag, contrarie to Gods commandement, and Achab in letting Benhadad goe. <hi>Mart.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

Some vnderstand, that they burned odour for them, as they did for Asa, 2. Chron. 16.15. and vsed to doe for the Kings, Ierem. 34.5. But the words of the text are, they burnt them there, that is, their bodies. 3. The meaning then is, that they burnt the flesh onely from the bones, for these two reasons: both because the flesh was now corrupt and putrified, and least their bodies afterward falling into the Philistims hand, might be exposed to derision: <hi>Mar.</hi> and this
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:20715:180"/>
