            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>HIther yee come, dislike, and so undo</l>
            <l>The Players, and disgrace the Poet too;</l>
            <l>But he protests against your votes, and sweares</l>
            <l>Hee'll not be try'd by any, but his Peeres;</l>
            <l>He claimes his priviledge, and sayes 'tis fit,</l>
            <l>Nothing should be the Iudge of wit, but Wit.</l>
            <l>Now you will all be Wits, and be I pray;</l>
            <l>And you that discommend it, mend the Play:</l>
            <l>'Tis the best satisfaction, he knowes then,</l>
            <l>His turne will come, to laugh at you agen.</l>
            <l>But Gentlemen, if yee dislike the Play,</l>
            <l>Pray make nowords on't till the second day,</l>
            <l>Or third be past: For we would have you know it,</l>
            <l>The losse will fall on us, not on the Poet:</l>
            <l>For he writes not for money, nor for praise,</l>
            <l>Nor to be call'd a Wit, nor to weare Bayes:</l>
            <l>Cares not for frownes or smiles: so now you'll say,</l>
            <l>Then why (the Devill) did he write a Play?</l>
            <l>He sayes, 'twas then with him, as now with you,</l>
            <l>He did it when he had nothing else to doe.</l>

            <l>And yet our Author hopes you are pleas'd, if not;</l>
            <l>This having fail'd, he has a second Plot:</l>
            <l>'Tis this; the next day send us in your frends,</l>
            <l>Then laugh at them, and make your selves amends.</l>
            <l>Thus, whether it be good, or bad, yet you</l>
            <l>May please your selves, and you may please us too:</l>
            <l>But look you please the Poet, lest he vow</l>
            <l>A full revenge upon you all, but how?</l>
            <l>'Tis not to kill you all twentie a day,</l>
            <l>Hee'll do't at once, a more compendious way</l>
            <l>He meanes to write againe; but so much worse,</l>
            <l>That seeing that, you'll think it a just curse</l>
            <l>For censuring this: 'faith give him your applause,</l>
            <l>As you give Beggars money; for no cause,</l>
            <l>But that hee's troublesome, and he has swore,</l>

                  <l>Poore Princes, how are they mis-led,</l>
                  <l>While they, whose sacred office 'tis to bring</l>
                  <l>Kings to obey their God, and men their King,</l>
                  <l>By these mysterious linkes to fixe and tye</l>
                  <l>Them to the foot-stoole of the Deity:</l>
                  <l>Even by these men, Religion, that should be</l>
                  <l>The curbe, is made the spurre to tyrannie;</l>
                  <l>They with their double key of conscience binde</l>
                  <l>The Subjects soules, and leave Kings unconfin'd;</l>
                  <l>While their poore Vassals sacrifice their blouds</l>
                  <l>T'Ambition; and to Avarice, their goods;</l>
                  <l>Blinde with Devotion. They themselves esteeme</l>
                  <l>Made for themselves, and all the world for them;</l>
                  <l>While heavens great law, given for their guide, appeares</l>
                  <l>Just, or unjust, but as it waytes on theirs:</l>
                  <l>Us'd, but to give the eccho to their words,</l>
                  <l>Power to their wills, and edges to their swords.</l>
                  <l>To varnish all their errors, and secure</l>
                  <l>The ills they act, and all the world endure.</l>
                  <l>Thus by their arts Kings awe the world, while they,</l>
                  <l>Religion, as their mistresse, seeme t'obey;</l>
                  <l>Yet as their slave command her, while they, seeme</l>
                  <l>To rise to Heaven, they make Heaven stoope to them.</l>

                  <l>Nor is this all, where feign'd devotion bends</l>
                  <l>The highest things, to serve the lowest ends:</l>
                  <l>For if the many-headed beast hath broke,</l>
                  <l>Or shaken from his necke the royall yoake,</l>

With popular rage, religion doth conspire,</l>
                  <l>Flowes into that, and swells the torrent higher;</l>
                  <l>Then powers first pedigree from force derives,</l>
                  <l>And calls to minde the old prerogatives</l>
                  <l>Of free-borne man, and with a saucy eye</l>
                  <l>Searches the heart, and soule of Majestie;</l>
                  <l>Then to a strict account, and censure brings</l>
                  <l>The actions, errors, and the ends of Kings;</l>
                  <l>Treads on authority, and sacred lawes,</l>
                  <l>Yet all for God, and his pretended cause,</l>
                  <l>Acting such things for him, which he in them,</l>
                  <l>And which themselves in others will condemne;</l>
                  <l>And thus ingag'd, nor safely can retire,</l>
                  <l>Nor safely stand, but blindly bold aspire,</l>
                  <l>Forcing their hopes even through despaire, to climbe</l>
                  <l>To new attempts; disdaine the present time,</l>
                  <l>Grow from disdaine to threats, from threats to armes,</l>
                  <l>While they (though sonnes of peace) still sound th' alarm's:</l>
                  <l>Thus whether Kings or people seeke extreames,</l>
                  <l>Still conscience and religion are their Theams:</l>
                  <l>And whatsoever change the State invades,</l>

                  <l>Others may give the fewell, or the fire;</l>

                  <l>Then first I repent that sinne of being a Courtier.</l>
                  <l>And secondly, the greatest sinne one can commit in that place, the speaking of truth.</l>

                  <l>Some few trifles more, not worth the remembring;</l>
                  <l>Drinking, and whoring, and swearing, and such like:</l>

                  <l>Nay Gentlemen, mistake me not,</l>
                  <l>'Tis not that I love you, but because 'tis a thing of course</l>

                  <speaker>Sol.</speaker>
                  <l>First then, if any of you are fooles (as I thinke that</l>
                  <l>But a needlesse question) be fooles still, and labour still</l>
                  <l>In that vocation, then the worst will be but whipping,</l>
                  <l>Where, but for seeming wise, the best is racking.</l>
                  <l>But if you have the luck to be Court fooles, those that have</l>
                  <l>Either wit or honesty, you may foole withall and spare not;</l>
                  <l>But for those that want either,</l>
                  <l>You'le finde it rather dangerous then otherwise; I could give you a moderne</l>
                  <l>Instance or two, but let that passe: but if you happen to be State fooles, then 'tis</l>
                  <l>But fooling on the right side, and all's well; then you shall at least be</l>
                  <l>Wise mens fellowes, if not wise mens masters.</l>
                  <l>But of all things take heed of giving any man good counsell,</l>
                  <l>You see what I have got by it; and yet like a foole, must</l>
                  <l>I be doing on't againe.</l>

                  <l>I am at my full growth, and my joynts are knit; and yet</l>

                  <l>If you but knew how dry a thing this sorrow is,</l>
                  <l>Especially meeting with my constitution; which is</l>

                  <l>Yes, I shall, I shall lay before you all that's within me,</l>
                  <l>And with most fluent utterance.</l>
                  <l>Here's to you all Gentlemen, and let him that's good</l>

                  <l>Nature,</l>
                  <l>How didst thou mocke mankinde to make him free,</l>
                  <l>And yet to make him feare; or when he lost</l>
                  <l>That freedome, why did he not lose his feare?</l>
                  <l>That feare of feares, the feare of what we know not,</l>
                  <l>While yet we know it is in vaine to feare it:</l>
                  <l>Death, and what followes death, 'twas that that stamp't</l>
                  <l>A terrour on the brow of Kings; that gave</l>
                  <l>Fortune her deity, and Jove his thunder.</l>
                  <l>Banish but feare of death, those Gyant names</l>
                  <l>Of Majestie, Power, Empire, finding nothing</l>
                  <l>To be their object, will be nothing too:</l>
                  <l>Then he dares yet be free that dares to die,</l>
                  <l>May laugh at the grim face of law and scorne,</l>
                  <l>The cruell wrinkle of a Tyrants brow;</l>

                  <l>O'recome by passion and misfortune,</l>
                  <l>And still unconquer'd by my foes, sounds ill,</l>
                  <l>Below the temper of my spirit;</l>
                  <l>Yet to embrace a life so poore, so wretched,</l>
                  <l>So full of deaths, argues a greater dulnesse;</l>
                  <l>But I am dead already, nor can suffer</l>
                  <l>More in the other world. For what is Hell</l>
                  <l>But a long sleeplesse night? and what's their torment,</l>
                  <l>But to compare past joyes with present sorrowes.</l>
                  <l>And what can death deprive me of? the sight</l>
                  <l>Of day, of children, friends, and hope of Empire;</l>
                  <l>And whatsoever others lose in death,</l>
                  <l>In life I am depriv'd of, then I will live</l>
                  <l>Onely to die reveng'd: nor will I goe</l>

                  <l>So meere a stranger to my thoughts, I know</l>
                  <l>Not how to entertaine him; but sorrow</l>
                  <l>Ill made by custome so habituall,</l>

                  <l>Her selfe is not so cruell; for my counsels</l>
                  <l>Then may be unsuccessefull, but my prayers</l>

                  <l>I'm sure the engine is better for the purpose, than</l>
