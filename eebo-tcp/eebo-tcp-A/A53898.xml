            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>GIve me leave to let you understand,
That I am by a real and unfeigned
<hi>PROFESSION</hi> a true Son of the
<hi>Church of ENGLAND,</hi> one whom God hath
blessed with a competent Family, of whose e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
welfare I am equally solicitous. We
are seated with many neighbours of the same
judgment and desire of future happiness in a

Countrey Parish with an <hi>ORTHODOX</hi> and
able <hi>MINISTER,</hi> whose age and infirmity
seem to foretell we shall scarse enjoy him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

            <p>Now, Sir, the various Discourses and
<hi>CONTRIVANCES</hi> in this present juncture, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the known Inclinations of our
<hi>PATRON,</hi> threaten us with a <hi>PASTOR</hi> as next
Incumbent, who is not a Pastor Canonically or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
but hath received something which
he calls Ordination, either after a Classical or
Congregational way.</p>
            <p>In this case I apply my self to you, who are
rendred a <hi>MODERATE DIVINE,</hi> desirous to
know whether your Moderation hath induced
you to promote or comply with that which
seems to us so great Confusion; and to declare
how you can answer it to that Church of which
you are also a Member, and what Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
you can give to our Consciences, who are
like to be cast into this Condition.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot take any delight, as to the
<hi>Differences</hi> in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi>
but in the composure of them onely:
and if I understand my self, nothing can
ever alter that temper, by which I have
been so long enclined to a due Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Indulgence for such as are ready
to afford a rational Compliance. But I
hope that no such <hi>Facility</hi> of nature or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
shall ever reduce me to that weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as to betray the great and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Concerns</hi> of the Church, or to give
over the indispensable duty of endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that <hi>Unity</hi> which is necessary to its
<hi>Conservation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Ministry</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the Continuation of the Gospel
according to the Promises of Christ, as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94539:4"/>
it was to the first Plantation of it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Institution, is a Doctrine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable.
That this Ministry is derived
by a <hi>Succession</hi> and constant propagation,
and that the Unity and Peace of the
Church of Christ are to be conserved by
a due and legitimate <hi>Ordination,</hi> no man
who considereth the Practice of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
and <hi>Ecclesiastical History,</hi> can ever
doubt. This way of <hi>Ordination</hi> having
continued so many ages one and the same,
could never be considerably alter'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some great <hi>Commotions</hi> and <hi>Dissentions</hi>
in the Church, and the manifest breach of
Union and Communion in that body;
whomsoever we judg guilty of the breach
of that Union, which is not necessary now
to dispute. And as the first introduction
of <hi>different Ordinations</hi> caus'd a standing
and settled <hi>Opposition,</hi> precluding all ways
of Reconciliation: So they cannot be
brought into any one Church, but they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94539:4"/>
must make such a division and disparity
in the <hi>Administrations,</hi> as will amount to
no less than a <hi>Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However in the peculiar and happy
condition of our Church, these <hi>promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
Ordinations, if all allowed by it, are
most destructive to that which is the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and the Honour of it. We have the
greatest felicity which could happen to a
<hi>Reformation,</hi> as being <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,</hi>
that we have so taken away the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mistakes and errors which had been
introduc'd by a long Ignorance and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation,
as to retain a perfect <hi>Compliance</hi>
with the <hi>Ancient Church:</hi> and therefore
we can boldly and truly affirm, we are the
same with the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
those of <hi>Rome:</hi> and while we hold
and maintain our <hi>Ordinations</hi> legitimate,
we speak the same language with the most
Glorious <hi>Fathers, Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> of
those happy and pious times. But if we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94539:5"/>
once admit a <hi>diversity</hi> in our Ordinations,
we have lost the honour of <hi>Succession,</hi> we
have cast away our weapons of defence, we
have betray'd our own cause and laid our
selves open to the common Enemy of all
<hi>Protestants,</hi> and we shall at last inevitably
fall into the <hi>Socinian</hi> doctrine, to deny all
necessity or use of any <hi>Mission</hi> or <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again though our <hi>Discipline</hi> be much
weakned, and the good effects thereof
obstructed by many Scruples and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
rais'd against it, yet they can be no
just imputation to that wholsom <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
it being sufficiently known from
whence those Obstructions proceed. But
if all <hi>sorts</hi> of Ordination be any way
established by sufficient <hi>Authority,</hi> if what
is so earnestly desired be indulged,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> p. 82.</note>
               <hi>That a man once ordained any way
be still held and retained for a Labourer in
the Harvest,</hi> the most legitimate <hi>Process</hi> in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94539:5"/>
               <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> affairs will become ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and irrational. Many necessary <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
of Enquiry, founded upon the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> will be put off
with such unblameable refusals, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
with so much reason and equity,
that <hi>His Majesties</hi> Ecclesiastical Laws can
be with no conscience put in <hi>Execution,</hi>
when they which are to be prosecuted as
delinquents according to Law, must be
pronounced the most innocent in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and conscience of the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the same Law. What an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
and discouraging <hi>Confusion</hi> is this,
whereby <hi>Presentments</hi> shall be made of
those persons who are conscientiously <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable</hi>
to the Doctrine and Orders of
the Church, for actions or omissions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
solely out of that Conscience and
Conformity, and they who <hi>factiously</hi> or
<hi>erroneously dissent</hi> from that Doctrine and
Order, shall avoid their own and promote
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94539:6"/>
the presentment of others, and in this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
or faction shall be protected and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by a superinduced Authority Thus
by <hi>promiscuous Ordinations</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
the Church will be render'd indefensible,
and the <hi>Discipline</hi> unpracticable.</p>
            <p>Although these evil <hi>Consequences</hi> be of
great moment in the general, and threaten
our <hi>Bethel</hi> with the <hi>notion</hi> of a <hi>Babel,</hi> yet
because most men are more <hi>apprehensive</hi>
of particular mischiefs, and stronglier mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with <hi>Personal Inconveniencies;</hi> I shall
more earnestly apply my self to that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
which you have represented in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to your self, your Family and
Neighbour of the same persuasion: and
even this consideration will be of great
latitude and <hi>concernment,</hi> because it is not
confined to you alone, but all of the same
<hi>judgment</hi> will be subject to the same <hi>unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,</hi>
and lie under the same fears and
<hi>Discouragement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94539:6"/>
If a person onely qualified by a <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational</hi>
Mission should be set over you
<hi>authoritatively</hi> as your lawful Pastor, to
whose <hi>Ministerial</hi> acts it is expected you
should apply your self in all publick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Religion:</hi> you being of a <hi>constant
Persuasion</hi> that the <hi>Validity</hi> of such Acts
hath a necessary relation to the <hi>Legitimacy</hi>
of <hi>Ministery,</hi> &amp; of as certain an <hi>Opinion</hi>
that such a <hi>Mission</hi> cannot amount to a
legitimate <hi>Ordination.</hi> I cannot see what
comfort you take in any <hi>compliance</hi> with
such <hi>Administrations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay further, if a person be said to have
obtained Orders after the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way
in the late times, when he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them from a <hi>Bishop,</hi> &amp; since the
happy <hi>restitution</hi> of publick Order in the
Church, when many of his <hi>Brethren</hi> have
submitted, still <hi>obstinately</hi> refuses to receive
<hi>Ordination</hi> after the <hi>established</hi> way of the
Church of <hi>England:</hi> in this case, if you
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94539:7"/>
doubt whether his <hi>Ordination</hi> be <hi>valid,</hi> or
conclude it <hi>null.</hi> I confess I know no
<hi>argument</hi> to convince you, or to encline
you to another <hi>Persuasion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then I cannot but lament your <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet</hi>
and sad <hi>Condition,</hi> accidentally cast
upon you, for reasons which I take no
delight to consider: and through the short
expression in your Letter, I can easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what Thoughts and Apprehensions
may press and discourage you.</p>
            <p>For as you render your self a <hi>Son</hi> of our
Church, I conceive you are one who va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> thinking it your duty to
give God that Setvice, and taking much
comfort in the <hi>ancient &amp; regular Devotion</hi>
expressed in those Publick Prayers; which
being a mixt Office, and having been so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
since the Apostolical times, wherein
the <hi>Priest,</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and the People
<hi>joyntly &amp; interchangeably</hi> concurr, and the
<hi>Rubrick</hi> directing what words belong to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94539:7"/>
the <hi>Priest,</hi> and can properly in the sense
intended (sometimes at least) be used by no
other; I confess you cannot but abate of
the <hi>devotion</hi> and comfort of your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
when you think the <hi>person</hi> appointed
to read them is no <hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>Presbyter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Administration</hi> of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of <hi>Baptism,</hi> you cannot regularly but
desire to have your <hi>Children</hi> baptized and
received into the <hi>Congregation</hi> of Christ's
Church in that solemn <hi>manner,</hi> and by
such a <hi>person</hi> as is appointed by the same
Church to receive them; and though in
case of <hi>Necessity</hi> this Office may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
with in baptizing for the <hi>benefit</hi> of
the <hi>Infant,</hi> yet it will be very hard to create
any other Necessity than what arises on
the <hi>Infants</hi> part, or to make use of that
irregularity when there is no Necessity,
which is onely indulged to Necessity.</p>
            <p>But as to the other <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the <hi>Supper
of the Lord,</hi> your case is far worse. For to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94539:8"/>
that you are often invited, nay obliged to
receive it <hi>thrice a year,</hi> and I doubt not but
earnestly desire <hi>frequently</hi> to participate of
the body and blood of your SAVIOUR.
Whereas if you be resolved that your
<hi>Pastor</hi> established is not a <hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi>
and consequently hath no power to
<hi>consecrate</hi> the <hi>Elements,</hi> or render them
<hi>Sacramental;</hi> I cannot see how you can
follow him to the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> or with what
<hi>Comfort</hi> or <hi>Conscience</hi> you can bring your
Family, or concurr with your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
to receive the <hi>Elements</hi> from his
Hands. And yet <hi>abstaining</hi> from the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
you are thereby <hi>deprived</hi> of the
Spiritual strength and comfort which you
desire and have cause to expect; and are
moreover <hi>betrayed</hi> to the <hi>Censures</hi> of the
Church, in compliance to whose Doctrine
you are rendred disobedient to her <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94539:8"/>
Lastly, the unfeigned exercize of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
is undoubtedly, as never more Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
so never so Comfortable as upon
the Bed of our <hi>Sickness,</hi> especially upon the
approach of <hi>Death:</hi> wherefore the <hi>Church</hi>
hath taken great care that the <hi>Minister</hi>
shall attend, and how he shall behave
himself in the <hi>Visitation of the sick,</hi> for their
comfort and advantage. This <hi>Comfort</hi> I
confess must be taken from you, who are
of that persuasion concerning your Pastor,
for if upon the apprehension of your later
end, you feel your <hi>Conscience</hi> troubled, and
being observant of the method prescribed,
desire to make a special <hi>Confession,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the benefit of <hi>Absolution;</hi> to which
end the Priest is ordered to use these words,
<hi>By the authority of Christ committed to me I
absolve thee of all thy sins:</hi> you will never
acquiesce in the <hi>Absolution,</hi> where you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
no <hi>Commission,</hi> nor can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any <hi>Efficacy</hi> which dependeth upon
the <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94539:9"/>
These and the like I look upon not as
formal Objections, or cavils, but as real
and severe complaints rais'd upon Sober
and Religious grounds, matter for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Zeal,</hi> rather than <hi>Moderation.</hi> And
therefore I cannot persuade my self that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
person endued with any <hi>Kindness</hi> or
<hi>Care</hi> of the Religion settled in this Nation,
can ever <hi>contrive</hi> or <hi>assent</hi> unto so great a
discouragement to the consciencious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of it, and confusion in the <hi>manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>administration.</hi>
