         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By grave <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as good <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> was Chriſtian Religion in its <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of Faith and good Manners kept alive, to ſome degree of ſaving health and holy Order, amidſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtempers, corruptions, and deformities of thoſe <hi>dark times,</hi> which went before, and followed after the <hi>Norman Conqueſt,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Roman Superstructures, Uſurpations,</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacies.</hi>

            <p>By worthy <hi>Biſhops</hi> was our <hi>Engliſh Liturgy</hi> fitly compoſed, our <hi>Bibles</hi> well tranſlated, our Reformation ſoberly compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our Religion by Law and due Authority peaceably eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; yea, and at laſt, all was <hi>ſealed</hi> and confirmed by many of thoſe godly <hi>Biſhops bonds</hi> and baniſhments, by their Bloods and Martyrdoms.</p>

            <p>How <hi>justly</hi> theſe Afflictions befel very <hi>worthy Biſhops,</hi> and other excellent Miniſters, then flouriſhing to a great number in the Church of ENGLAND, as from the Hand of God, their own Humility and Charity, their Patience and Silence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me, neither to doubt nor diſpute: It befits us all, to <hi>give glory</hi> to God, to take ſhame to our ſelves, to ſay, it is of <hi>the Lords mercy that we are not utterly conſumed,</hi> that there is yet a Remnant that hath eſcaped.</p>

            <p>We have (Right Honourable and Worthy Senators) nothing ſo much to ſay in this <hi>Eſſay of Gratitude</hi> to God, to the Kings Majeſty, and to Your Selves, as to be <hi>abruptly ſilent,</hi> and to ſtand ſtill a while filled with <hi>admiration</hi> and <hi>aſtoniſhment:</hi> What King or Emperour ſince <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and <hi>Charles</hi> the Great (I mean the laſt, who laid down his Life for the <hi>Liberties</hi> of his Church and <hi>Kingdoms</hi>) ever did the like act of Honour, Piety, Charity, Juſtice, and Muniſicence to the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> to the Clergie, to the whole Church, and (if I may ſo ſay) to God himſelf! to whom nothing can be given but of his <hi>own Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence;</hi> as <hi>David</hi> modeſtly and truely expreſſeth his and the Princes liberality to the <hi>Temple.</hi> Thus to redeem the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Gentry, Clergy, and whole Nation, from that <hi>ugly ſin</hi> and <hi>ſhame</hi> of <hi>ſacriledge,</hi> wherewith ſome cruel and covetous men, by their violent illegal and unreaſonable courſes, had ſought to engage, yea, and for ever to <hi>damne</hi> (as much as in them lay) you and your poſterity: Other <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Kingdome, as alſo many <hi>pious Lords</hi> and Gentlemen, have conſecrated many things to God and his Church; but his <hi>preſent Majeſty</hi> hath at once reſtored all; thereby ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be both <hi>Charles le bon, &amp; le grand;</hi> A great and good Chriſtian King.</p>

            <p>Give me leave to tell your Lordſhips, and thoſe other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99484:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not what we would ſay, but what we would do; I am ſure we ſhould do, yea, and we <hi>reſolve</hi> to do, if we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with Gods graces, and favoured with your Chriſtian Prayers.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt, As to God, We do <hi>wholly devote</hi> our ſelves, and all the advantages we have by his <hi>renewed mercies,</hi> to advance his Glory, and the Honour of our Bleſſed Saviour, in the faithful diſcharge of our duties to the Service of this Church, by preaching, praying, writing, living, and governing (our ſelves we mean, no leſs than others) ſo as becomes <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolick Biſhops;</hi> ſo as is on all hands highly deſerved of us, and juſtly expected from us, according to our places and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>As it will be eaſier for us at the great <hi>day of account</hi> to have wanted <hi>theſe honourable Priviledges</hi> than to have abuſed them; ſo we had much rather not <hi>enjoy</hi> them at all, than not have hearts to uſe them aright, as prime <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Patterns</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> that is, <hi>Followers</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>bleſsed Apostles,</hi> in all Piety, <hi>Prudence, Sanctity, Charity, Sincerity.</hi> It argued ſome greatneſs of mind in ſome of our Biſhops, for theſe many years to have lived contentedly without theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and ſecular advantages, not to have ſunk and deſponded under ſo long and importune adverſities; but it will be more of Chriſtian Magnanimity to enjoy them wiſely and worthily, to overcome the temptation of proſperity, to uſe them not to pride and luxury, but to humble and holy <hi>induſtry;</hi> to diſcreet hoſpitality, to cheerful <hi>charity;</hi> to the good of the Church, and to Gods glory; who hath promiſed to <hi>honour</hi> thoſe that <hi>honour</hi> him, and to adde all theſe things to thoſe that firſt ſeek his <hi>Kingdome</hi> and the righteouſneſs thereof: Doubtleſs nothing will be wanting to us, if we be not wanting to God, his Church, our ſelves and our Brethren of the Clergy, who are ſober men, void of depraved opinions, and debauched practices.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In reference to his <hi>gracious Majeſty</hi> our reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, That none of his Subjects ſhall more imitate, and (if your Lordſhips give us leave) cheerfully <hi>emulate</hi> your and their Loyalty, Love and Fidelity to his Majeſties ſafety, peace, and happineſs temporal and eternal, than <hi>we his Biſhops,</hi> who of all

men may leaſt <hi>be traytors</hi> to his Honour, <hi>Conſcience,</hi> or Soul; who having dealt ſo <hi>bountifully with us,</hi> cannot but expect from us thoſe <hi>honeſt and faithful things</hi> which are moſt worthy of his Munificence and our Integrity; So as may moſt conduce to his Majeſties welfare and the publick peace. The firſt we ſhould baſely <hi>betray,</hi> together with our own Souls, if we ſhould ceaſe daily to <hi>pray</hi> for his Majeſties happineſs; if we ſhould fail to ſet forth the <hi>whole truth</hi> of God to him and his Subjects; Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we ſhould ſerve, <hi>ſooth,</hi> or <hi>ſilently flatter</hi> any <hi>known ſin</hi> in our ſelves, or any others whatſoever; and leaſt of all in thoſe, whoſe ſins muſt needs be as moſt conſpicuous and <hi>exemplary,</hi> ſo moſt contagious and dangerous.</p>
            <p>The ſecond (of <hi>publick peace</hi>) we ſhall beſt ſerve and <hi>ſecure</hi> by well and wiſely ordering (as <hi>Spiritual Captains</hi> and <hi>Colonels</hi> of the <hi>Eccleſiastical Militia</hi>) that <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> or great company of <hi>Preachers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> which cannot be leſs then <hi>ten thouſand</hi> men <hi>effectivè;</hi> whoſe number is great, and their influence with their activity much greater, being mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred and in <hi>ſpiritual armes</hi> at leaſt once <hi>every</hi> week; where getting upon the <hi>higher ground,</hi> and being as in Chriſts ſtead, they cannot but have a very great ſtroke on mens (and <hi>more on womens</hi>) <hi>ears,</hi> hearts, and purſes: Theſe had need be well <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined</hi> and governed under Chriſt, and his Majeſty, according to Gods Word, the Laws of this Kingdom, and the Conſtitutions of this Church; which muſt be their and <hi>all our</hi> rules, by which they and we muſt ſerve God and the King; as with truth and holineſs, ſo with <hi>decency, order,</hi> and <hi>uniformity:</hi> Neither <hi>excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> nor <hi>erratick</hi> from our proper <hi>Spheres,</hi> nor yet defective or <hi>deformed</hi> in them: The managing of which great Concern being by his <hi>Majesty</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> chiefly committed to us Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, it will be moſt <hi>our ſin</hi> and <hi>ſhame</hi> to be wanting in our duty; If any man blame us for doing what is lawful and juſt, yea neceſſary for the publick peace, they muſt withal <hi>blame the Laws,</hi> and by a moſt <hi>egregious folly</hi> think themſelves wiſer than the <hi>publick wiſdom,</hi> the Laws and Laws-makers; in which their own conſent is included, and from which no man may lightly be a Renegado.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As to your <hi>Nobleneſs,</hi> no men ſhall more ſtudy your Lordſhips <hi>true honour</hi> and eternal happineſs, the only
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99484:14"/>
ſufficient requital of your meritorious love and favour to us <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have accepted, yea reſtored us Biſhops to be <hi>Partakers</hi> of your honour, <hi>Auditors</hi> of your wiſdom, and <hi>Spectators</hi> of your nobleſt Converſation, in that place where every one ſtudies to put on the <hi>beſt appearance;</hi> We and our Succeſſors muſt for ever be <hi>faithful Counſellors,</hi> Friends and Servants to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and your Noble Poſterity; who poſſibly will bear from our age, place and quality, with greater patience, civility, and acceptance, than from other Miniſters, thoſe <hi>diſcreet monitions, ſeaſonable intimations,</hi> and <hi>wholſome counſels,</hi> which may be ſometimes moſt neceſſary for you and them: It will always beſt become us rather to offend you by telling you the truth in a <hi>decent</hi> manner, than to <hi>betray</hi> you to thoſe ſinful infirmities or paſſions which are your greateſt enemies, next to your <hi>flatterers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No men ſhall be more aſhamed than we, to ſee our ſelves <hi>ſit in Parliament</hi> (that is, in the <hi>Congregation of Princes,</hi> or <hi>mortal Gods</hi>) if we ſhould not behave our ſelves in all reſpects anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your <hi>Illuſtrious Society,</hi> and to your great merits towards us: As we are below the <hi>Objects of your Lordſhips Envy,</hi> ſo we will ſtudy to be above (that is, not to deſerve, and ſo not to fear) <hi>your anger;</hi> Nor ſhall you either love virtue, or your own <hi>ſouls,</hi> or your God and Saviour, if you either hate or deſpiſe us, who intend (by Gods help) to perfect that in <hi>our ſelves</hi> and all <hi>others</hi> (as far as our good counſel, example, and lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority will extend) which ſome men have ſo long, ſo lowdly, and ſo in vain pretended to in point of true <hi>Reformation</hi> both private and publick; Not in <hi>fine fancies, ſuperficial formalities,</hi> and <hi>popular vaporings,</hi> but in ſolidly great, and really good <hi>actions,</hi> in which the <hi>power of godlineſs</hi> doth conſiſt; being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at no mens <hi>ſinful deformities</hi> and <hi>defects,</hi> either <hi>perſonal</hi> or <hi>political,</hi> more than our own: What is wanting in any of us as to <hi>high blood</hi> and extraction, as to Civil <hi>Grandeur</hi> and <hi>Eſtate,</hi> ſhall (by Gods help) be made up in that modeſt wiſdom, ſober learning, hearty loyalty, and unfeigned Religion, which may moſt <hi>counterpoiſe</hi> your other <hi>accompliſhments,</hi> by which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your Lordſhips much <hi>overweigh</hi> us: Indeed nothing can <hi>buoy</hi> up <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> or recover the true <hi>honour</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of ENGLAND to a fixation, ſo much as the primitive great and <hi>good examples</hi> of Biſhops and the Epiſcopal Clergy; as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently

            <p>Theſe ſo peculiar duties, proper offices and uſes of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> (as Church-men) may very well ſeem, I dare not ſay below your <hi>Lordſhips eminent dignity,</hi> (ſince Gods glory and Chriſts honour are ſtamped upon the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Church, but) leſs ſuitable to your many ſecular Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; And I am ſure they are (for the moſt part) much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove moſt <hi>Lay-mens abilities;</hi> as they were ever judged by the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> above the ordinary capacities of <hi>meer Presbyters,</hi> or inferiour Miniſters, who have indeed the ſame <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Indeed in the beginning or infancy of <hi>Churches</hi> (as many learned men have obſerved) the powers or offices of <hi>Deacon, Presbyter, Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtle</hi> might (poſſibly) be reſident in, and exerciſed by one man, where there was but an handful or little flock of two or three gathered together in <hi>Chriſts</hi> name; But when Beleivers and Congregations, and ſo their <hi>Pastors multiplied,</hi> then there was a neceſſity of politie, order and wiſdom to diſtinguiſh and rank theſe offices and Officers into ſeveral politick diſtributions, or <hi>helps of Government;</hi> ſome to be the flocks, others to be the <hi>Pastors;</hi> ſome to be only as <hi>Presbyters,</hi> praying, preaching, baptizing, conſecrating and bleſſing the people; others as Preſidents or Biſhops ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

            <p>Nor may the ſameneſs of the <hi>Names,</hi> or of Naturals, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, or Religion, as to faith, gifts and graces; nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of ſome Chriſtian Priviledges, duties, or offices of charity, theſe may not be pleaded againſt the primitive diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Eminent Honour and Authority among the <hi>Clergy,</hi> any more than all <hi>priority</hi> and <hi>ſuperiority</hi> may be denyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men in reſpect of <hi>Civil Magistracy,</hi> who are of the ſame Nature, Parentage, City, Trade and Country; or among <hi>Souldiers</hi> of the ſame Army; or <hi>Scholars</hi> of the ſame <hi>Colledge</hi> and <hi>Univerſity.</hi>

            <p>An Help, Ornament, and Honour in <hi>Church-Government</hi> which really for our own part, we earneſtly deſire, and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly embrace, as that (<gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Indeed no <hi>wiſe Biſhop</hi> can affect an <hi>arbitrary power,</hi> or an abſolute and ſole Dominion; Nor are we willing to be thus either expoſed to others calumnies, or <hi>betrayed</hi> to our ſelves; becauſe we know our ſelves to be but men, and ſubject to the <hi>ſame infirmities</hi> with other ſinful Mortals: Nor can we be ſo happy as when we are both compaſſed, encouraged, and ſupported with our aged, learned, and reverend Brethren of the Clergy, who may be every way as able and deſerving as our ſelves.</p>

            <p>In the laſt place, as to the great merits of the Honourable <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> and in them of all the ingenuous Gentry, with all the Religious and Loyal People of <hi>England</hi> towards us the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of this Church; We ſhall chuſe rather to dye, or to be again <hi>degraded</hi> by the folly and fury of <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> envy and malice, than not to make good by our actions their good eſteem of us, or to forfeit by any fault of ours their ready ſuffrages for us; We ſhall never think any thing added to us by this great favour and honour ſhewed us, if we do not find in them mighty <hi>ſpurs</hi> and <hi>goads</hi> to provoke us more to our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>ſound preaching, ſober praying,</hi> diſcreet governing, and <hi>holy living;</hi> which are the <hi>ſolid honours</hi> of all good <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and true Miniſters; As they are the debts alſo which we indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly owe to God, to this Church, and to the leaſt Member of it: What may poſſibly be wanting in the <hi>frequency, number</hi> and <hi>tale</hi> of our Sermons, by reaſon of our age and infirmity, ſhall be made up in their weight; and when we ſhall not be able to preach at all, we will ſtudy to live over the beſt of our Sermons, and to preach by our examples, when we cannot by our words.</p>
            <p>God forbid we ſhould ſuddenly forget thoſe <hi>late horrid</hi> and <hi>long conflagrations,</hi> out of which the good hand of God, by the Kings favour, and this <hi>Parliaments</hi> aſſiſtance, hath ſnatched us, and this whole Church; yea, God forbid, that we the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and all the <hi>Clergy</hi> of ENGLAND ſhould not come out of this <hi>fiery furnace</hi> more purged and prepared for our Maſters Service; yea, God forbid, that after ſuch a deluge, and <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> as this, we ſhould ſo forget God, or our ſelves, as to be <hi>drunk</hi> with that <hi>wine of Conſolation</hi> and <hi>cup of Salvation,</hi> which our Merciful God, our Gracious King, your Noble Lordſhips, and our Loving Country-men, the Commons of ENGLAND, have now put into our hands.</p>
            <p>We are very ſenſible how great <hi>ſtimulations</hi> are put upon us as Chriſtians, Miniſters and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> to all Piety, Induſtry, Prudence, Virtue and true honour; which we know do not conſiſt in being either ſo eager for <hi>ſmall circumstances,</hi> and outward <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of Religion, as to be remiſs in its <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi>

            <p>We profeſs to all the world, that we owne God alone in his holy Word (which we call the Scriptures) to be the ſole <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutor</hi> of his own neceſſary Worſhip and indiſpenſable Service; who alone knows what will beſt pleaſe him, and profit us: We think (as we are taught by the Church of <hi>England</hi>) that nothing is <hi>neceſsary</hi> and <hi>eſſential, moral</hi> or <hi>mysterious,</hi> as any means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, conferre, or increaſe grace, or to pleaſe God, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath not in his Word preſcribed, either by ſpecial mandate or general direction, and neceſſary conſequence.</p>
            <p>Yet we believe alſo (as all <hi>Learned men</hi> at home and abroad do agree) That the <hi>indulgence of God</hi> hath left <hi>free</hi> to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and authority of every <hi>National</hi> Church, Chriſtian Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and Community, the particular <hi>appointing,</hi> ordering and <hi>regulating</hi> of all thoſe general and common <hi>circumstances,</hi> which are in nature or civility <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as <hi>time, place, method, manner, meaſure, vesture</hi> and <hi>gesture,</hi> (all which are as unſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from all publick actions under the Sun, as our skins are from our bodies) according as ſhall ſeem to the <hi>ſupreme wiſdom</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> of <hi>that Church,</hi> moſt for its <hi>publick decency</hi> and <hi>ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> for good order and edification; Of all which in their <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances</hi> and <hi>uſages,</hi> every private Chriſtian is Judge and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator</hi> in his cloſet-worſhip; Alſo every chief <hi>Governour</hi> in his family, where, when, how, for matter, method and manner, alſo for meaſure of reading, praying, praiſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſtanding or kneeling; whether in ſordid or decent habits, becoming his preſence and the ſanctity of the duty; And no leſs, without all peradventure, are they left to every <hi>chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> or Ruler in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> within his reſpective Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, for the publick peace, order, decency, uniformity, and ſolemnity of Religion, of which thoſe are the proper Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, Determiners, and Judges, to whom the power is given by God, either private or publick; That Religion may not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feere with the Civil Government, but conform to it in theſe

            <p>Nor hath the Church of <hi>England</hi> ever otherwiſe eſteemed, or impoſed thoſe things of particular <hi>circumstances, rites</hi> and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> which have been ſo long as chips and ſhavings, the caſie fewel of ſo much flame and contention; but hath oft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared its judgment of them, to be according to Gods truth; its choice and injunction of them to be according to that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and authority which God hath given to it, as to every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church within its politie and precinct, ſo to uſe and impoſe them on its own members, without prejudging other Churches their like liberty; Not at all as things pleaſing of themſelves or diſpleaſing to God: He muſt needs be an infant in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, who fancies God is ſcared with white, or pleaſed with black garments in his publick worſhip; that the hiſtorick ſign of the Croſs addes to or diminiſheth ought from Baptiſm; or that the Divine Majeſty is offended at our kneeling, or better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with our ſitting or ſtanding before him in an act of ſo holy a celebration, and humble veneration, as that is of the Lords

            <p>The duty of <hi>Magistrates</hi> or <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> as well as <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Governours,</hi> on all hands, is, in <hi>publick ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities</hi> of Religion to take care, that all things be ſo done in uniformity, order, and decency, as is neceſſary for <hi>publick peace,</hi> and as they think beſt becomes the <hi>ſanctity</hi> of true <hi>Religion,</hi> the Majeſty alſo of that God whom we ought to worſhip and ſerve with all reverence, and with the <hi>beauty</hi> of <hi>holineſs,</hi> both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward, without any impoſing upon the judgment, beyond the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>indifferency</hi> of ſuch things; or upon the practice farther than the God of order, decency, and peace, hath permitted.</p>
            <p>As we and all <hi>this Church</hi> have ſeen and felt upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe things the <hi>outragious zeal</hi> and <hi>precipitancy</hi> of ſome men, who firſt pretending much to <hi>boggle</hi> at and to be grievouſly <hi>ſcandalized</hi> with a few ſuch things of <hi>outward</hi> rite, individuared circumſtance, and <hi>preſcribed ceremony</hi> (to which <hi>conformity</hi> was by Law, that is, by the <hi>publick wiſdom</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> required in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>) have in the purſuit and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of their actions, or <hi>paſſions</hi> rather, evidently declared themſelves to be enemies even to all <hi>order</hi> and <hi>politie,</hi> as well as to <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> and to be friends to nothing but their own private <hi>fortunes,</hi> novel <hi>fancies,</hi> and partial <hi>factions,</hi> guided by no known Law of God or man; and offended with nothing ſo much, as not to ſee themſelves in that place and power, which may force all men to conform to their own poſts, luſts and deſigns; which themſelves followed not by the <hi>true footſteps</hi> and <hi>ſent</hi> of Law and Juſtice, Reaſon and Religion, but by the ſenſible <hi>view</hi> and <hi>ſucceſses</hi> of providences, as they variouſly ſprang up, and appeared either for good or evil: Which ſort of deformed and deforming <hi>Non-conformists</hi> we leave to be puniſhed, not only by their own evil manners, but

alſo by the juſt <hi>abhorrencies</hi> of God and all good men, to whom their folly and fury is now ſufficiently manifeſt.</p>
            <p>So we are neither ignorant nor inſenſible of other mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>diſ-ſatisfactions</hi> in theſe things, who, under the old title of <hi>Non-conformity</hi> (formerly much modeſter indeed, than of later times, being not only civil to <hi>ſetled Epiſcopacy,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout in the uſe of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> but abhorring all <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>) have heretofore, and ſtill do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly plead their own and other mens <hi>weak</hi> minds, and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or tender <hi>conſciences,</hi> as very jealous (forſooth) of ſinning there (in the uſe of ſome <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi>) where the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick wiſdom and piety of this Church and State, grounded on many learned Judgments, and the majority of united ſuffrages according to their <hi>conſciences,</hi> ſees no ſin, ownes no ſin; yea, and openly declares againſt any ſin, both in the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions and Intentions.</p>
            <p>Mean time while theſe milder <hi>Non-conformists</hi> tell us they dare not obey <hi>lawful authority</hi> in things thus dubious to their private dimneſs; yet both they and others dare (even <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi>) diſobey an undoubted lawful authority, meerly upon ſuch private doubts and ſcruples, in ſo ſmall and clear matters; rather ſuſpecting a whole Reformed Church, and all the <hi>ſpirits</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> in their <hi>majority</hi> and <hi>repreſentation,</hi> of errour and miſtakes, even to <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> than their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and poſſibly prejudiced, yea and ſactiouſly <hi>intereſsed</hi> opinions.</p>
            <p>All which ſpecious coverings and pleadings of Conſcience, as weak and tender in point of <hi>conformity</hi> to things ſo oft and fully declared to be indifferent in their nature, and only limited in their honeſt and decent uſe: however they may deſerve <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charity, compaſſion,</hi> and <hi>tenderneſs</hi> from us, as to ſome mens good meanings and <hi>harmleſs converſations;</hi> yet they are (now at laſt) found too narrow to <hi>palliate</hi> or hide thoſe <hi>dreadful diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and cruel deſigns, which ſome mens counſels and actions have of late years been guilty of, if either Gods or Mans Laws may be judges, which do command only <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience, and in that, ſuch a <hi>conformity</hi> to Chriſts example, as where they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not actively obey, there patiently and ſilently to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Non-conformity</hi> in ſome calmer times, and in ſome

neither <hi>Biſhops</hi> nor <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> ſhall be any burthen, but a great bleſſing (as it hath been) to this Church and Kingdome, to King and Subjects, to the good and bad, to encourage the former, and to reſtrain and amend the latter.</p>
            <p>Which happy effects will eaſily be attained,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> If we may be guided and circumſcribed by good <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Canons;</hi> beyond or ſhort of which no <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Biſhop</hi> may go, no not in any exemplary <hi>ceremony,</hi> or <hi>affected novelty,</hi> to a <hi>ſuper-conformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we may be defended in doing our duties by his Majeſties juſt power, without <hi>cramping</hi> or <hi>benumming</hi> the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction by needleſs prohibitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If we may be ſtill aſſiſted and adorned with your Lordſhips and the other Gentlemens love and favour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If we may be duly fortified by the deſired coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and meet aſſiſtance of our aged, learned, and reverend <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If we may be daily commended (as the Church-Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy hath appointed, and for which paſſages it is ſo unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to many, who love Church Lands better than they do the beſt Church men or Biſhops, more devoted to prey upon them than for them) to the <hi>marvellous workings</hi> of Gods grace, by the prayers of all good Chriſtians, which we do not more want than paſſionately and humbly deſire; That ſince we (the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi>) are again brought to this <hi>high mountain,</hi> and thus <hi>transfigured,</hi> our <hi>faces</hi> may ſo <hi>ſhine</hi> in good words and works, that your Lordſhips and all this Church of <hi>England</hi> may glorifie our Father which is in heaven; That we may abhor that <hi>Soloeciſm</hi> of (<hi>Honor ſublimis &amp; vita deformis</hi>) Lordly Titles and Peaſantly actions.</p>
            <p>And ſince there is no greater ſign of a thankful heart for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which our ſelves have received, than a <hi>charitable ſenſe</hi> of our <hi>Brethrens miſeries;</hi> that in the day of our Exaltation as <hi>Biſhops,</hi> to Eſtates and Honours, we may not forget the depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and afflictions of others; Give leave to as many of us as are thus compaſſionate to preſent our ſupplication to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours (the two Houſes of Parliament) and by your mediation to his Majeſty; A great one indeed it is, and therefore worthy of ſo great an addreſs to perſons of large hearts and hands who
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99484:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are ready to anſwer great deſires, and to effect great deſigns.</p>
            <p>It is in the behalf of many of our poor Brethren, the <hi>Clergy of England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> That there may be ſome <hi>effectual means</hi> uſed worthy of the Wiſdom, Piety, and Charity of His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and His Two Houſes of <hi>Parliament</hi> to relieve the meanneſs, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and incompetency of their <hi>ſcandalous livings,</hi> which makes many of them as more needing, ſo leſs capable of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline:</hi> Objects alſo of <hi>vulgar contempt,</hi> depreſſing their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſtarving their ſtudies, diſcouraging them in their duties, betraying them to ſordidneſs of living, expoſing them to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temptations; and laſtly ſubjecting them to all <hi>popular ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, complacencies,</hi> and <hi>dependancies,</hi> which are the neſts and breſts, the ſeminaries and nurſeries of all <hi>faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no way to redeem them, their <hi>Ministry,</hi> and this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, from theſe <hi>burthens</hi> and <hi>chains,</hi> that enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>very ſouls</hi> of many, at firſt <hi>ingenious Scholars,</hi> and <hi>hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters,</hi> but by making <hi>ſmall livings</hi> ſomwhat competent; His <hi>Majesty</hi> hath ſet a <hi>great example</hi> in this kind, commanding augmentations to be allowed out of his own and the <hi>Churches impropriations.</hi> But this bounty cometh ſhort of at leaſt 3000 <hi>livings,</hi> which ſtill remain in ENGLAND and WALES, as Flats or ſhallows in the <hi>Sea;</hi> upon which, when the neceſſities of many <hi>young men</hi> and <hi>hopeful Scholars</hi> once drive them, they ſeldom ever get off, without <hi>ſhipwrack</hi> of <hi>Morals</hi> or <hi>Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls;</hi> However, it is ſuch a ſtop and hinderance to the <hi>proficiency</hi> of their <hi>ſtudies,</hi> alſo to the authority and efficacy of their <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi> that they ſeldom or never make a <hi>Proſperous voyage,</hi> ever conflicting with difficulties, and many times conquered by them, not only to a <hi>meanneſs,</hi> but an <hi>immorality</hi> of living.</p>
            <p>It is a work worthy of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> greatneſs and your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to apply (in Gods good time) ſome meet help to this crying Malady, which firſt began by the Popes <hi>unhappy aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Tythes</hi> from the Incumbents or Rectors, and annexing them as <hi>Impropriations</hi> to <hi>Religious Houſes:</hi> The <hi>Remedies</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by wiſe men, are; Firſt, by uniting ſome <hi>ſmall Livings</hi> that are near adjacent: Secondly, by aboliſhing ſome <hi>injurious Cuſtoms,</hi> where wonted and overawed <hi>compoſitions</hi> deprive the <hi>Incumbents</hi> of the true value of what is their due: Thirdly, by laying ſome <hi>Moderate Tax</hi> on dwelling Houſes in Market Towns
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99484:30"/>
and Cities, or in populous and trading Pariſhes, as 6 <hi>d.</hi> or 9 <hi>d.</hi> or 12 <hi>d.</hi> in the pound, according to the juſt value of their rents, ſo as no houſe ſhould be charged, which is rented under Forty ſhillings a year, nor any that <hi>paies tithes</hi> for lands in <hi>Ferme</hi> or in the <hi>owners hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe helps may relieve ſome, but becauſe the Malady reacheth far beyond theſe proportions, nothing can be ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual as (when the Nation ſhall have <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>plenty</hi>) the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſome <hi>publick ſtock</hi> of <hi>money,</hi> in order to compleate this great and good work, by a publick and <hi>Parliamentary</hi> bounty, or a <hi>National charity;</hi> by which <hi>bank</hi> or <hi>ſtock</hi> rightly managed and improved, a good foundation may be laid for the buying in (not of all <hi>Impropriations,</hi> which is too great a work to be compaſſed, but) ſuch a portion of them, as may in moſt places make the Living or Vicaridge competent, that is 60 <hi>l.</hi> or 80 <hi>l.</hi> or 100 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> according as the dearneſs or cheapneſs of places doth adviſe; Nor may it ſeem heavy to raiſe <hi>ſome Tax or Pay for Chriſts Soldiers</hi> (his <hi>Ministers</hi>) when ſo many <hi>Millions</hi> have been ſpent upon other Soldiers.</p>
            <p>If ſome ſuch eaſie <hi>Tax</hi> or <hi>Subſidie,</hi> as ſhall ſeem moſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable in the wiſdom of His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and the two Houſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> were given to God and the Church for this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent end, to be raiſed in four years, and the matter <hi>publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended</hi> by King, Lords and Commons, beſides the profit of the publick <hi>Contribution</hi> or <hi>Levy</hi> (in which our ſelves as <hi>Biſhops</hi> would be <hi>exemplary</hi> according to our abilities) if it were well <hi>improved</hi> and <hi>imployed,</hi> no doubt many <hi>private perſons</hi> living and dying, would liberally give to ſo noble and pious a work: Some Noblemen and Gentlemen would, after His <hi>Majeſties</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, for ever endow <hi>ſmall Livings</hi> with ſome ſuch <hi>portion</hi> out of their <hi>Impropriations;</hi> eſpecially if they could do it without charge, by reaſon of the <hi>Statute of Mortmaine,</hi> which might, as to this intent and uſe, be for a time repealed.</p>
            <p>But your <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>wiſdom</hi> will beſt underſtand what ways are moſt proper to attain ſo great and good ends, as would follow this excellent deſigne of augmenting <hi>ſmall Livings,</hi> and ſmall Miniſters too; ſo much tending not only to the relief of many honeſt and able Miniſters, to make and keep them ſuch, but alſo to Gods glory, and to the good of peoples Souls, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99484:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Learning, and of the dignity of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> to His <hi>Majeſties</hi> honor, to your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> great <hi>renown,</hi> and to the <hi>lasting peace</hi> both of this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For we have found by our late <hi>experiences</hi> (wherein half a dozen pragmatick, and for the moſt part but poorer Preachers in a County, became the greateſt <hi>Bontefeus</hi> or <hi>Incendiaries</hi>) That <hi>ſettled plenty,</hi> at leaſt <hi>honeſt competency</hi> binds <hi>Ministers</hi> moſt to the peace and good behaviour; That the more the Clergy owe their maintenance to the Law, the more obſervant they are to pay their obedience to the Laws, leſs <hi>pragmatick</hi> and leſs popular, as not ſo much depending on the people; and ſo leſs ſtudious in any ſiniſter way to pleaſe them rather than their ſuperiours.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>ſharp neceſſities</hi> and <hi>poverty</hi> of ſome Miniſters daily provokes them (if they be <hi>men</hi> of any <hi>quick parts</hi> and <hi>unmortified paſſions</hi>) to great inquietudes, hoping by publick commotions to mend their private condition; Then they <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi> moſt ſharply with the <hi>Churches</hi> evil Conſtitutions (as they call it,) when their own, as to their livelyhood is not very good; then they inveigh bitterly againſt <hi>innocent Ceremonies,</hi> and all ſetled Orders of the Church, when their ſubſtance or ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence is moſt unſetled, or too ſmall for their minds and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; every thing then is a burthen to them, when they feel the galling burthen of poverty; and they eaſily run to Arms and Rebellion, who already find that armed man upon them, having much to get and little to loſe in any Troubles: The want of <hi>oyling</hi> or <hi>greaſing</hi> makes their wheels drive heavily, or with a very querulous and ungrateful noiſe, and at laſt to take <hi>fire,</hi> yea, and by popular arts to diffuſe their <hi>ſparks</hi> with their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and their <hi>diſcontents</hi> with their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and their <hi>abuſes</hi> with their <hi>uſes</hi> among the common people; who like <hi>tinder</hi> or <hi>gun-powder</hi> are very prone to kindle againſt their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors; beleiving no men ſo fit to govern <hi>Church</hi> and State <hi>as</hi> themſelves and their <hi>Minister;</hi> though but a poor Vicar, Curate, or Lecturer; having ſuch narrow minds, as they are not able to comprehend or extend their thoughts to the Latitudes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Order and Government; which are as neceſſary as thoſe which they ſo much dote upon in their perſons, families, and Pariſhes, nor will they learn, but by their own and others woes
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99484:31"/>
how much peace with a little, and a good conſcience to boot, is to be preferred before much goods ill gotten by ſequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and plunder, though ſanctified by preaching and praying.</p>
            <p>It is certain no men are more careleſs of <hi>conforming</hi> to the <hi>Laws,</hi> or more <hi>prodigall</hi> of the publique peace, then thoſe Miniſters and people who finde themſelves in <hi>ſhort pasture;</hi> and therefore venture to breake the ſacred <hi>hedge,</hi> and civil bounds which Gods and Mans Laws have ſet; eſpecially where they think the Fence is loweſt and weakeſt; (as it ſeems to be in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Cannons and Conſtitutions; not ſeconded with <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive power;</hi>) Againſt theſe an over ſcrupulous and reſtive ſpirit, or a ſturdie and bayardly conſcience, ſeting its <hi>brest</hi> or hinder part, hopes to carry all before it; that it may by popular <hi>extravagancie</hi> or partiall adherence, advance either its uneaſie eſtate, or its ſmall reputation to a faction, ſide, and party.</p>
            <p>Let there be fitting <hi>provender</hi> for the <hi>oxen</hi> which tread out the Corn, and then we may juſtly exact labour from them, and exerciſe the goad of juſt diſcipline on their neglect. If once the Livings of the Clergy were truly Livings, or convenient livelyhoods, we could with more prudent <hi>ſeverity</hi> look that their labonr and lives ſhould be exactly good; not that poverty is a diſpenſation to impiety; but good men are not eaſily found to accept of thoſe ſmall and ſcandalous Livings out of which thoſe ſorry or ſcandalous Miniſters are ejected, who are not ſo good and able as we could wiſh, and yet better perhaps than none at all; And although the ſmall Living may be too good for them, yet not good enough for a better man; ſince the moſt <hi>learned piety</hi> is ſenſible of all humane <hi>neceſſities,</hi> Virtue it ſelf will be <hi>cold,</hi> and Grace it ſelf <hi>hungry</hi> and <hi>thirsty;</hi> nor can any man of reaſon expect to have <hi>Religion</hi> live like a <hi>Camelion</hi> in this world.</p>
            <p>Having thus preſented with all due reſpects this one Chriſtian requeſt to <hi>your Honours,</hi> in the behalf of many <hi>poor Miniſters,</hi> yea, and of the ſouls of many poor people, nay, in the Name of your and our Saviour, (whoſe work the pooreſt Miniſter of the Goſpel (if able and honeſt) doth perform, and ſo for Chriſts ſake is <hi>worthy</hi> of his <hi>wages,</hi>) and leaving it as a matter of great and publick importance to your pious and wiſe conſideration in due time, I cannot conclude better than as I began, (that ſo I may compleat the circle of our <hi>grateful and just acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>)

with that <hi>eternal veneration,</hi> praiſe, honour and thanke, which from my ſelf, and all my Reverend Brethren the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and all the ſober <hi>Clergy,</hi> are duly and humbly returned, firſt, to the moſt bleſſed God, whoſe <hi>judgments are unſearchable,</hi> and whoſe <hi>mercies are everlaſting: Next,</hi> To His moſt <hi>Gracoius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> for His muniſicent and matchleſs goodneſs to the <hi>Biſhops, Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of ENGLAND: <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To Your moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Selves the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> of this preſent Parliament, who have thus taken away the ſin, reproach, and ſcandal of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, Schiſm,</hi> and <hi>Confuſion,</hi> which were by ſome unhappy men brought upon this ſometime ſo famous Kingdom, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Church of ENGLAND.</p>
            <p>For whoſe <hi>vindication</hi> and <hi>comfort,</hi> as the Author was not wanting in her greateſt agonies and blackeſt afflictions pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to compaſſionate her ſighs and tears, ſo he thought it his duty (upon a publick more than private ſenſe) ſeriouſly to rejoyce, and heartily to <hi>congratulate</hi> with her in this <hi>happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration,</hi> which he hath oft prayed for, and now lived to ſee; becauſe he is perſwaded in his conſcience (if rightly managed with piety and charity) that it highly tends to Gods glory, to the honour of our bleſſed Saviour, to the aſſerting of our true Religion as Chriſtian and Reformed, to the eſtabliſhment of the publick peace in Church and State; and laſtly, to that juſt and <hi>ingenious compenſation</hi> of good for long endured evil, which is highly deſerved and juſtly expected by this Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from all its genuine Children; not only becauſe it was once well reformed and moſt flouriſhing, but alſo becauſe it hath been ſo grievouſly, and as to man, moſt unjuſtly afflicted and deformed.</p>
            <p>For (without doubt) the pious <hi>Intentions,</hi> and prudent <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were ſuch, That nothing was, or now is wanting in it, to make a good Chriſtian <hi>perfect</hi> to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> if he be not wanting in himſelf, and to the <hi>grace of God</hi> offered to him in the Miniſtery of this Church; Every <hi>ſaving truth</hi> being maintained by Her; Nothing <hi>added</hi> to or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed</hi> from the <hi>word</hi> of God as ſaving or neceſſary; Every <hi>holy, Duty,</hi> every <hi>divine Inſtitution,</hi> every <hi>ſacred Myſtery,</hi> every neceſſary part of Gods Worſhip, every <hi>moral</hi> Vertue, every Chriſtian Grace, every uſefully-good Work, is either

celebrated, or enjoined, or taught or recommended to every Chriſtian, both in private and publique, according to their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Nor may any Chriſtian juſtly blame the Church for any defect; but rather their own hearts for want of humility, devotion and gratitude to God and men: There is holy ſap and ſweetneſs in all its <hi>Liturgical</hi> appointments, if men were not ſurfeited with their own fancies, prejudices and pride; All things being ſet forth by the Church without the leaſt <hi>tincture</hi> of any known <hi>Error</hi> in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Superſtition</hi> in the ſubſtance of Religious Duties and Devotion; The <hi>outward</hi> Form alſo, or publique <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Solemnity</hi> of Duties, is no other than what (without queſtion) is left by God to the <hi>Liberty, Prudence</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of every Church and Chriſtian <hi>Politie</hi> as moſt conſonant. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To the Civility and Cuſtome of the Nation: <hi>Secondly,</hi> To that outward Veneration which is accordingly due to the Divine Majeſty: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To the publick Solemnity and Decency of holy Duties in the Church: <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To the ancient Uſe and Cuſtome of the primitive and beſt Churches: <hi>Fiftly,</hi> No where <hi>forbidden</hi> by Gods word, or by any rule of right Reaſon: <hi>Sixthly,</hi> But choſen, uſed and impoſed by this Church, within its own <hi>Precincts</hi> and <hi>Politie</hi> only, under no other <hi>Notion,</hi> than that which is lawful and true. 1.
