            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Then sir, this diuell came vpon me and would not be perswaded but he would néeds carry me to hell, I proffered him a cup of Ale, thinking because he came out of so hotte a place that he was thirstie, but the diuell was not drie, and therfore the more sorie was I, well, there was no remedie but I must with him to hell, and at last I cast mine eye aside, if you knew what I spied you would laugh, sir I lookt from top to toe, and he had no clouen féete. Then I ruffled vp my haire, and set my cap on the one side, &amp; sir grew to be a Iustice of peace to the diuel. At last in a great fume, as I am very cholloricke, and sometime so hotte in my fastin fumes that no man can abide within twentie yards of me, I start vp, and so bombasted the diuell, that sir he cried out, and ranne away.</p>

Alasse maisters, we are commanded by the proclamation to fast and pray, by my troth I could prettely so, so, away with praying, but for fasting, why tis so contrary to my nature, that I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer a short hanging, then a long fasting. Marke me, the words be these. Thou shalt take no maner of foode for so many daies. I had as léeue he should haue said, thou shalt hang thy selfe for so many daies. And yet in faith I néed not finde fault with the proclamation, for I haue a buttry, and a pantry, and a kitchen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me, for proofe, <hi>Ecce signum,</hi> this right slop is my pantry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a manchet, this place is my kitchin, for loe a péece of béefe. Oh let me repeat that swéet word againe: For loe a péece of béef. This is my buttry, for sée, sée, my friends, to my great ioy, a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of béere. Thus alasse I make shift to weare out this fasting, I driue away the time, but there go Searchers about to séeke if any man breakes the Kings command. Oh here they be, in with your victuals <hi>Adam.</hi>

               <l>Whose eyes are blinded with securitie,</l>
               <l>Unmaske your selues, cast error cleane aside.</l>
               <l>O London, mayden of the mistresse Ile,</l>
               <l>Wrapt in the foldes and swathing cloutes of shame:</l>
               <l>In thée more sinnes then <hi>Niniuie</hi> containes,</l>
               <l>Contempt of God, dispight of reuerend age.</l>
               <l>Neglect of law, desire to wrong the poore:</l>
               <l>Corruption, whordome, drunkennesse, and pride.</l>
               <l>Swolne are thy browes with impudence and shame.</l>
               <l>O proud adulterous glorie of the West,</l>
               <l>Thy neighbors burns, yet doest thou feare no fire.</l>
               <l>Thy Preachers crie, yet doest thou stop thine eares.</l>
               <l>The larum rings, yet sléepest thou secure.</l>
               <l>London awake, for feare the Lord do frowne,</l>
               <l>I set a looking Glasse before thine eyes.</l>
               <l>O turne, O turne, with wéeping to the Lord,</l>
               <l>And thinke the praiers and vertues of thy Quéene,</l>
               <l>Defers the plague which otherwise would fall.</l>
               <l>Repent O London, least for thine offence,</l>
               <l>Thy shepheard faile, whom mightie God preserue,</l>
               <l>That she may hide the pillar of his Church,</l>
               <l>Against the stormes of Romish Antichrist:</l>
               <l>The hand of mercy ouershead her head,</l>
               <l>And let all faithfull subiects say, <hi>Amen.</hi>
