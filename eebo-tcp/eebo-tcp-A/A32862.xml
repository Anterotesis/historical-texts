            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Travels of <hi>John Camm</hi> and <hi>John Audland,</hi> thoſe two eminent, faithful and truly honourable Servants of the Lord Jeſus in the Work of the Miniſtry, to which they were called and choſen in the morning and breaking forth of that bleſſed and everlaſting day, in this our Age and Generation; I ſay this concern hath lived with me, though hitherto hath been obſtructed, partly in hope that ſome other might have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the ſame work, whereby I might have been excuſed; and partly through the Service and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels the Lord hath meaſureably concerned me in, on the behalf of his Truth and People in late years.</p>
               <p>But now being it hath fallen to my lot in Truths Teſtimony, to be called to ſuffer Impriſonment, and thereby at preſent freed from ſome of the aforeſaid Service and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels; and the ſaid concern hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:57915:3"/>
reſting upon my Spirit, I was made willing to ſet to the Work, being partly helped by others, as to gather and tranſcribe their Books and written Epiſtles, ſo many whereof as we could meet with are inſerted hereafter in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places, ſo near, as we could, being ſeveral of them without dates.</p>
               <p>As for their Labours, unwearied Travels, Exerciſes, Faſtings, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings Buffettings, Scornings and Perils many ways, and upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral occaſions, in full I cannot relate, but ſhall give the Reader a ſhort hint of ſome part of them, as they may be brought to my remembrance in the following Teſtimony, which lives upon my Spirit to bear for the Lord, in the behalf of them, as made Inſtrumental in his hand, through the ſtrength of his holy and eternal Arm of Power to and in them revealed, to the exalting of
<pb facs="tcp:57915:4"/>
his own Glory, and the publiſhing of his everlaſting Goſpel-glad-tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the Poor, and Redemption to the Poor, and Redemption to the Priſoner of Hope, in which bleſſed Work his Strength girded, and his Power ſupported them in all faithfulneſs to preſevere to the finiſhing of their Courſe here; and having fought the good Fight, they are entred into his everlaſting Joy and Reſt, where they are freed from their many Labours, Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and Exerciſes, and their Works follow them, glory to God for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Camm,</hi> as he was my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the Fleſh, ſo was he alſo a ſpiritual Father, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor of me in the way of Truth and Righteouſneſs, the which through the operation of the Word of Life, meaſureably revealed in me in my Childhood, became ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to my Confirmation in that bleſſed Way; for his tender
<pb facs="tcp:57915:4"/>
eare was great for the Education of me, and the reſt of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Family, in the Nurture and Fear of the Lord; and as he was ſharp and ſevere in reproving every appearance of evil, yet with Wiſdom, Gravity and great Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the which appeared alſo in his encouraging and ſtrengthing every appearance of God in his Children, Family, and all People, being an eſpecial example in his life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p>The place of his outward Birth was at <hi>Camſgil,</hi> within the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony of <hi>Kendal</hi> in <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> which place hath been poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Anceſtors long before him.</p>
               <p>As for his Parentage and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I ſhall not ſay, much more then that it was honeſt, and of good report, as any of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in that par of the Country, as many can teſtfie; as alſo that he
<pb facs="tcp:57915:5"/>
from his Childhood, was inclined to be Religious, and ſought after the beſt things; and ever ſince I can remember, he was one that joyned in ſociety with them that were the moſt ſtrict and upright in the performance of religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ordered their lives moſt according to Holineſs and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
               <p>He having ſeen beyond the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Prieſts, and their empty lifeleſs Forms, and ſo ſeparated from them, ſtill preſſing forward, towards a further manifeſtation and revelation of the Way of Salvation, which his Soul hungred and thirſted after; and therefore he with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, who were under the ſame ſence of hunger, often met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether amongſt themſelves; and ſome openings from the Lord ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them had, from which they could have declared excellent things, having ſome ſight or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb facs="tcp:57915:5"/>
thereof, yet wanted the inward poſſeſſion of the Vertue, Life and Power of what they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, and in this ſtate continued many days.</p>
               <p>But the fulneſs of time being come, wherein the Lord in his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting loving-kindneſs did cauſe his day to ſpring from on high, and his Light to break out of obſcurity, and his glorious eternal Goſpel to be preached again upon the Earth, and particularly in this our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having heard the cryes of the Poor, and the ſighings of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in the Pit; even then the Lord called and anointed ſeveral for his Work and Service, to publiſh this bleſſed day; to bring Glad-tidings, and proclaim the Year of Jubile.</p>
               <p>And firſt, and more eſpecially, he called forth and made choice of his dear Servant and faithful Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to the Nations, <hi>George Fox,</hi> and ſent him into the North Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:6"/>
and particularly into <hi>Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> near <hi>Kendal;</hi> where there was a Field white unto the Harveſt,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a People ripe to be gathered, who as aboveſaid, were ſeparated in meaſure from the Worlds Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and empty dry Forms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in many things, and met together as aforeſaid, having ſeveral that were become Teachers amongſt them, but the chiefeſt <hi>John Audland</hi> and <hi>Francis Howgil,</hi> amongſt whom the Lord ſent this his dear Servant and Meſſenger <hi>George Fox,</hi> with the Meſſage of Life; at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing whereof in the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit and Power of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the aforeſaid <hi>John Camm</hi> my dear Father, with <hi>John Audland, Francis Howgil, Edward Borough, Richard Hubberthorn,</hi> and many Hundreds more were convinced, and their hearts opened, as was the Heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> in former days, and by the Revelation of the day of God,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:6"/>
and the inſhining of his Heavenly Light in their Hearts, they came to ſee, that they wanted the lively poſſeſſion of what they had made a great profeſſion of, which profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral of them had eſteemed of, as great riches, of all which they came to be ſpoiled; their Wiſdom that ſtood in words only being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, they became as Fools, and at the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, they conſulted no more there with; but it became as Droſs and Dung in compariſon of the excellent Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Jeſus Chriſt, revealed by his Spirit, to regenerate them, and ſprinkle their Hearts and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from dead words, to which they were Stangers, notwithſtanding their great profeſſion, under the ſence of which great was the Gry and the Lamentation of many, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable; for the day of the Lord was dreadful and terrible upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high and exalted thing, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:57915:7"/>
lofty ones, and tall Cedars (high in profeſſion) were bowed down under the mighty hand of Gods Power, and Judgment begun at the Houſe of God, the Heart his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and by the Spirit of Judgment and Burning the eternal God enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and begun his bleſſed Work, in order to redeem, purge and make clean Veſſels for his own uſe and ſervice, through and by whom he might carry on his bleſſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and work in the Nations to the Glory of his Eternal, Name.</p>
               <p>And <hi>John Camm,</hi> amongſt many others, was bowed down under the mighty Power of the Lord, and the operation of the bleſſed Spirit was effectually known in his Heart and Soul, whereby he was made willing to take up the Croſs, and become a Fool for Chriſt's ſake, forſaking the World, and all the Glory, Delights, Pleaſures, Wiſdoms and
<pb facs="tcp:57915:7"/>
Riches of it, of which he had enjoyed a ſhare equal, if not above many of his degree; for naturally he was a Wiſe Man in Worldly matters, having at that time great concerns and dealings therein; and the World ſeemed to ſmile upon him, and the riches and glory of it had exceedingly encreaſed, and was then likely to encreaſe more; yet notwithſtanding all this, the Lord ſo prevailed by his Power and Spirit in his Heart, that he was made willing to part with all, and counted it a bleſſed exchange, to be made an Heir in Chriſt of that dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Riches laid up in Heaven, that his Soul had Travelled for, ſo that it was no hard thing for him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all for Chriſt's ſake, and become a deſpiſed Follower of him through many Tribulations.</p>
               <p>And after a day of great trouble and inward exerciſe, through the bleſſed operation of that Spirit of

               <p>How gloriouſly the Lord appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that City, and the Countries adjacent, and how he proſpered his Work in the Hands of theſe his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, how great and manifold their Labours, Travels, and Perils in thoſe Parts I am not able to relate, but ſhall leave, in hope that ſome one or other of my Brethren in thoſe Parts, may be engaged to perform
<pb facs="tcp:57915:9"/>
ſome part of that work, who may have a larger knowledge thereof, as being preſent with them in many of their exerciſes, which were not a few to my knowledge; but ſuch was their zeal for the Lord, and the proſperity of his work, that their very lives was not dear unto them, for the Lord, the Goſpel, and his Peoples ſake, but to ſpend and be ſpent they were freely in the will of the Lord given up, their care and watchings being for the proſperity of his work continually.</p>
               <p>And being that my Father was but naturally of a weak conſtitution of Body, inclining to be Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, by the many and daily Travels that he underwent, his outward Body did waſte, and his ſtrength ſpend exceedingly, having a moſt violent Cough, ſo that for ſeveral Years before his death, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to walk on Foot half
<pb facs="tcp:57915:10"/>
a Mile at one time, nay, many times he was not able to go up one pair of Stairs, into a Meeting-place, without help, yet nevertheleſs while the Meeting continued (through the enlivening Power and Spirit of God) would have been over the ſence of his Bodily weakneſs, but after the Meeting was over, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times as one ready to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>In this outward weakneſs he Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through many Countries and places of the Nation, to the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrengthning of the Flock of God, for ſeveral Years; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taking me along with him, to wait upon him, his weakneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown ſo great, that he was not able many times to get on or of his Horſe, without help; through all which the Lord brought him, his faith being fixt in his power; and his life and whole delight was in the proſperity of Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb facs="tcp:57915:10"/>
in the Earth, amongſt the Sons of Men.</p>
               <p>He was a Man that was richly furniſhed with the gifts of the holy Spirit, always patient in his great exerciſes and weakneſs, of a noble Spirit, and exceeding grave in his carriage and deportment, profound in judgment, and of a quick diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, a ſharp reprover of the World, and the Wickedneſs therein, as alſo all deceitful Hypocrites, with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly walkers, who made profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Truth, but walked not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rule thereof. Unity of the Brethren was his joy and Souls delight, and therefore whatever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to break the ſame, his Sword was keen upon to Wound, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry was weighty and deep, and very powerful, not pleaſant to the itching Ears that loves ſmooth words, but reached to the witneſs of God, and tended to the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Seed of the Kingdom,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:11"/>
where it was growing and ſpringing up in the Hearts of Gods People; alſo to the weary, toſſed and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; he had often a word in ſeaſon to their Conſolations, being very tender over the good in all; he had openings and ſights of many things to come; and he would often ſay, there would come a day of Famine, and that in that day, many that had made a great ſhew, would but be like the ſtony Ground, or the broken Bow in the day of Battel; he would alſo often ſay, that his other Son, my Brother; would be an <hi>Eſau,</hi> a rough Man, and not love the Truth, but be a Grief and Exerciſe to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſhe would have Comfort of her other Children, all which is fulfilled; when he grew near his end, his weakneſs encreaſing, he had great joy as he always had in the company of Friends that were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, of which many came to viſit him; and many times he would
<pb facs="tcp:57915:11"/>
have been wonderfully opened with the Power of the Lord, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the ſence of his Love and Peace, and a freſh Teſtimony thereof he would often bear, to the great refreſhment of Friends and his Family, when he lay in great weakneſs upon his Bed.</p>
               <p>His great care in all his Travels was, that the Goſpel of Chriſt which he had to publiſh, might be without charge, for all he had or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed of outward things, was freely given up to the Service of Truth, ſo that he was willing to lay out part of the ſame in his Travels; alſo his Heart and Houſe was open, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all Friends that came in Truths Service, having a great Comfort therein; he was a pattern of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in ſuffering for Truth's Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, though never much in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet his Goods were often ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or taken away, which he ſuffered joyfully in Truth's Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:57915:12"/>
Tythes, in which Teſtimony, and all other relating to Truth, he was ever firm, and never ſhrunk in the leaſt, his frequent Exhortations was to all Friends, and his Family, to be valiant and noble for Truth, and to keep their Faith in God's power, and never to look out, or conſult with the Wiſdom of the World.</p>
               <p>He did often call his Children and Family together, and exhort them with much fervency of Spirit, to fear the Lord, and walk in holineſs of Life, as becomes the Goſpel that they had believed in; and would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pray to the Lord for us, and bleſs us in his Name, ſome Months before he died; he would often call for me to be with him, for he loved me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and it was my joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to ſerve and obey him in all things; and many times he would wonderfully extol the Name of the Lord, and praiſe him for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:12"/>
and great mercy, counting his bodily weakneſs a happineſs, being ſanctified unto him by that Word eternal, which had ſanctified his Soul, and made him an honourable Veſſel, to the praiſe of his God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſence of which he would ſay, <hi>How great a benefit do I enjoy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond many, who have ſuch a large time of preparation for Death, being dying daily, that I may live for ever with my God, in that Kingdom that's unſpeakably full of glory; my outward Man daily waſts and moulders down, and draws towards its place and center, but my inward Man revives &amp; mounts upward towards its Place and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Heavens, in the ſence whereof his Soul would often wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully magnifie the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That very Morning that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this Tranſitory Life, he called my Mother the Children and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto him, gave us many good and ſeaſonable Inſtructions, to fear the
<pb facs="tcp:57915:13"/>
Lord, love his Way and Truth, and walk in it with upright Hearts; charging us to be kind and loving one unto another, telling us that his Glaſs was run, the time of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture was come, he was to enter into everlaſting Eaſe, Joy and Reſt; charging us all to be patient, and content with our parting with him, as to the outward, and ſo preſently fainting paſſed quietly away into a ſweet Sleep; whereupon we were all ſo overcome with Sorrow and Weeping, ſome of us aloud; as one out of Sleep he was again a wakened, and deſired to be a little help'd up in his Bed, ſpeaking to this effect, <hi>My dear Hearts, you have wronged me, and diſturbed me, for I was at ſweet Reſt, you ſhould not ſo Paſſionately ſorrow for my departure, this Houſe of Earth and Clay muſt go to its place; but this Soul and Spirit was to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up to the Lord, to live with him forever, where we ſhould meet with</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>John Audland</hi> was Born in the ſame County, not above a Mile from <hi>Camſgil,</hi> his Parents and Kindred of good Repute; who when he was but

a Child was of a very ripe and quick wit of Underſtanding and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, though ſomewhat incline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to youthful Play, execept which; never addicted to any Vice; about the Age of ſeventeen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years, the Lord inclined his Heart to Sobriety, and reading the holy Scriptures, and to be very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious in what was then manifeſted; ſo that he choſe the Company and Society of the beſt and moſt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in that day, and having a large Underſtanding, and great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, he became able in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures; and could largely diſcourſe of things relating to Religion, and the Duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; in ſo much, that amongſt a Society then gathered, or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the common Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way of Worſhip, he became an eminent Teacher, and highly eſteemed of amongſt them; and not only ſo, but many times he
<pb facs="tcp:57915:14"/>
would have gone to Chappels, or the Pariſh Steeple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>houſe, where there was ſome Idle Sottiſh Prieſts, and there would have Preached, and abundance of People was taken and affected with him; and in great Multitudes would have flocked after him: Now being grown upward of twenty years of Age, he took to Wife a Sober, Vertuous, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maid, of the ſame Separated So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, called <hi>Ann Newby</hi> of <hi>Kendal,</hi> and the Lord made them a great Comfort and Bleſſing each to other, while they both lived together, which was about thirteen years. Since the Death of her Husband, the Lord by his Providence hath Bleſſed me with the enjoyment of her being given me to Wife.</p>
               <p>But in the fulneſs of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, as aforeſaid, the Lord ſent his Meſſenger and Servant <hi>George Fox,</hi> and by the Meſſage of Life by him Preached, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
<pb facs="tcp:57915:15"/>
of the Spirit and Power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: This <hi>John Audland</hi> was reached the firſt time that ever he heard him; and he received <hi>George Fox</hi> into his Houſe, being fully ſatisfied that he was one that poſſeſſed, what he himſelf had but a notion and profeſſion of; and then by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, in the Light of God's eternal day he came to ſee the emptineſs of his great Profeſſion, and high flown Notion, and that all his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs was but as filthy Raggs, Droſs and Dung; ſo that he ſat down in ſilence and aſtoniſhment, like <hi>Job,</hi> for many daies; and great and weighty was the Work of the Lord upon his Spirit, being as a Man ſtript of all his earthly Wiſdom, and his Profeſſion being confounded and brought to nought, under the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Hand of the Lords Power; he did Mourn and Weep bitterly, biding adieu, adieu to all the World,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:15"/>
and all the empty Profeſſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; a great Hunger and Thirſt the Lord having raiſed in his Heart and Soul, for a Saviour, one of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand that could give a Ranſom for his Soul, and redeem him from the Pit of Corruption, for he ſaw all his great Profeſſion, all his Wiſdom and Knowledge could not help him; but it was the Lord alone that his Soul Thirſted for, who heard his Cries and Mourning in a time acceptable, and in a day of great compaſſion; and revealed his ſaving Health, and redeeming Arm of eternal Power, in alarge meaſure, by which he raiſed him, up fitting and filling him with all Wiſdom and Strength, for the performance of that Work and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that the Lord had predeſtinated himfor, and to be concerned in, to the Glory of his eternal Name, in gathering home the out-caſts of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and the diſperſed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who had been held under a ſtrange
<pb facs="tcp:57915:16"/>
King, in great and moſt grievous Bondage; to which Work the Lord in a ſhort time called him, anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to Preach and Publiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to the Poor, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to the Captive exile, the Year of Jubile: And the day of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon the Wicked; in which Work he was found faithful, being filled with power and might from on high, and girded with the ſtrength of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>And leaving all outward concerns and enjoyments, he faithfully Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through many parts of the Nation, and the Dread, Wiſdom and Majeſty of the eternal God was with him; and the mighty and high exalted ones, bowed before the Lord and his Power in all places wherever the Lord called him; and many Hundreds were Convinced and turned to God through him, as a choſen Veſſel, and prepared In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
<pb facs="tcp:57915:16"/>
in the Hand of the Lord of Hoſts; Glory, Glory to God for ever ſaith my Soul,</p>
               <p>The bleſſed remembrance of this mighty and notable day of the Lord, and the ſplendant breaking forth of his Glory in the Morning thereof in this Nation, often, and at this time breaks my Heart, and makes my Spirit rejoyce in the God of my Salvation; and his eternal Power and Preſence, that was with this, and other of his faithful Servants, in the firſt Publiſhing of the Goſpel in this our day, can never be forgotten by many; but the great and bleſſed Work that the Lord hath wrought by the Arm of his holy Power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in and through his Servants, is greatly to be admired for ever, for many thouſands of his <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath the Lord gathered and brought home that were afar of; and hath given them a City with Foundations, whoſe Walls and Bulwarks is Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:17"/>
in which Praiſes waits for him, and is ſounded ſorth unto the Lord, and the Lamb that ſits upon the Throne, &amp; Reigns for ever more.</p>
               <p>As he was diligent and laborious in the Work and Service of the Lord in many parts of the Nation, ſo was he furniſhed for that Service, as the effects and Fruits thereof hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly demonſtrated, in many places where the Lord made him as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the Word of his Power and Spirit, to beget and turn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to God, but moſt eſpecially in and about <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and ſeveral Counties in the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can ſpeak and bear Teſtimony, to the effectual working of that Word of Reconciliation that God had given him to publiſh, by which they were turned from Darkneſs to the bleſſed Light thereof.</p>
               <p>In thoſe Countries and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his Labours and Travels were great, being often accompanied by
<pb facs="tcp:57915:17"/>
my Father, <hi>John Camm;</hi> as long as he had ſtrength outwardly to Travel, their Hearts being firmly knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> by the Bond of unſpeakable Love, their very Lives being endearedly bound up in each other, in which Bond of Love their Unity was kept inviolated unto the end; whereby their Labours and Travels together were-very comfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table and joyous, being perfectly of one heart and ſpirit, and minding the ſame things, the glory of God, and the gathering of his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in which Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they ſpent their daies &amp; ſtrength.</p>
               <p>After my Father, <hi>John Camm,</hi> grew weak of Body, and at laſt was taken away: Oh, how <hi>John Audland</hi> would often bemoan the loſs of ſo dear a Companion and faithful Brother, he being left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, to bear the Burthen of many weighty Travels and Concerns, yet through and over all the Lord aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57915:18"/>
I was from my Child-hood very intimately acquainted with him, and loved him with a Brotherly Love, before we were brought into the bleſſed Way and Life of Truth, as now revealed, after which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more inwardly acquainted, and endearedly bound up together in a more Heavenly and Spiritual relation, the Fellowſhip therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Life and Joy; and therefore can give a certain account of the Gift and Graces of God, by which he was adorned and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied inwardly and outwardly.</p>
               <p>He was a Man beloved of God and all good Men, and eſteemed of by moſt that knew him; of a quick Apprehenſion, and great underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of a noble Spirit, yet in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity condeſcending to ſerve the leaſt in Truth; his Company was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delightful and pleaſant, being always cheerful, his diſcourſe good and tending to Edification, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:57915:18"/>
ripe in the Knowledge of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, and of a ſtrong Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; he was often concerned in Diſputations with Prieſts and other Oppoſers of the Way of Truth, that he bore Teſtimony too, and walked in; and the Lord had richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him for that Service, to the ſtopping the Mouthes of Gain-ſayers to Truths honour; his Declaration and Teſtimony exceeding large, free and affecting, almoſt to all ſorts of People, many with great delight would flock to hear him in many places, which made his Service ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, in opening the way of Truth unto all; he having a Word in ſeaſon to all Conditions, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he regarded not his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Body, but many times went beyond the natural ſtrength there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, notwithſtanding that he was young and ſtrong, yet in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was much ſpent ſeveral Years
<pb facs="tcp:57915:19"/>
before he departed and laid down his Head.</p>
               <p>His Life was bound up in the Unity and Fellowſhip of Friends and Brethren, his Labour was ever to conſerve the ſame, and prevent whatever would appear to divide: As he was honourable in the eſteem of Thouſands that the Lord through him had called, and brought (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them) to the Knowledge of the way of Life and Salvation; ſo alſo had he a right honourable eſteem of ſuch as were in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and eſpecially dear <hi>George Fox,</hi> by whom he was Convinced; He was very tender to the ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Life in Teſtimony in the leaſt Babe, always ready to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and give place to the ſame, for it was his great Joy to ſee the Lord's Work to proſper, and the Teſtimony of Truth to ſpring in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Boſom: In Counſel and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he was endewed with heavenly
<pb facs="tcp:57915:19"/>
Wiſdom beyond many; in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Careleſs and Rebellious he was ſharp and powerful: In fine, I have this to ſay, that he was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly furniſhed with ſpiritual Gifts, a choſen and honourable Veſſel in the Hand of his God, to the Praiſe and Glory of his eternal Name.</p>
               <p>Many comfortable daies and times have I enjoyed with him, whom I loved and honoured in the Lord, and I am not unſenſible of his Love to me, our Hearts being perfectly united and knit together, in that love that's everlaſting, paſſing the love of Women; I never thought Travel hard or tedious at any time, ſo that I might enjoy his Company, in which I was always delighted greatly ſatisfied, whatever diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſoever I under-went to obtain the ſame.</p>
               <p>After he was firſt called forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Work and Service of the
<pb facs="tcp:57915:20"/>
Lord, he was very diligent therein almoſt in continual Travels, and ſeveral times was in Priſon for his Teſtimonies ſake; as at <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> in the North, and <hi>Briſtol;</hi> often in great Perils in the beginning, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many rough places to break through, where many times he Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſore Beatings, and many Strokes together, with cruel Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Revilings and Scornings from the wicked Rabble often; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from angry bitter-ſpirited Profeſſors, through and over all which the Lord preſerved him to his own Glory, to inherit a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that's everlaſting, for he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing dear unto him for the Goſpels ſake, but left his dear Wife and Child (whom he loved entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) and Trade, and all to follow the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Captain of Salvation, having an eye to the eternal recompence of Reward, that
<pb facs="tcp:57915:20"/>
the Lord hath given him fully to enjoy.</p>
               <p>His dear Wife was not long after him, called forth into the ſame Work and Service, and Travelled into ſeveral Parts of the North Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and after into the South, where at <hi>Banbury</hi> in <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> ſhe was a Priſoner for one Year and ſeveral Months, the Lord making her inſtrumental in his Hand, to the turning many from Darkneſs to Light in that place, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places where ſhe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled.</p>
               <p>When <hi>J. A.</hi> did grow weaker, by his lingering Diſtemper of a ſore Cough, his Lungs waſting, he would often complain of an inward ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Breaſt, though he ſeemed to look well, being of a Ruddy and fair Complexion, and would often ſay; Ah! thoſe great Meetings in the Orchard at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> I may not forget; I would ſo gladly have
<pb facs="tcp:57915:21"/>
ſpread my Net over all, and have gathered all, that I forgot my ſelf, never conſidering the imability of my Body; but its well my reward is with me, and I am content to give up, and be with the Lord, for that my Soul values above all things.</p>
               <p>Betwixt two and three weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, he was taken (as was ſuppoſed) with an hective Feaver, and daily it encreaſed upon him; ſo that his ſleep for many days and nights was taken from him, in which time I was often with him, being his deſire and my delight to ſerve him; in which time Friends in abundance flocked to viſit him from ſeveral parts; for, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he was a man greatly beloved of the Lord, and all his People, yea, many of the World had a good eſteem of and loved him, and many times the Lord did wonderfully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his Mouth in Teſtimony to
<pb facs="tcp:57915:21"/>
Friends (as if he had been without ſence of his Sickneſs) to their great refreſhment and exceeding joy; and often he would be raiſed upon his Knecs upon his Bed, and ſupplicate the Lord in the behalf of his whole Heritage; and to proſper his Work in the Nation and Nations round about: he ſaid that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all the World, that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to live to enjoy, except the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable enjoyment of his Friends and Brethren in the fellowſhip of the Life of Truth, and that he might be a comfort to his dearly beloved Wife; whoſe deſolate condition he often bemoaned; being ſo big with Child (as that ſhe was delivered of a Son about ten days after his deceaſe) but in this he ſaid his will was in true ſubjection, ſubmitting to the Will of the Lord, whether life or death; to God he often and again committed and recommended all the whole Flock, Heritage and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb facs="tcp:57915:22"/>
of God, together with his dear Wife and Child, to be kept, cared for, and preſerved; ſaying that he would be a Husband to his deſolate Widow, and a tender Father to his fatherleſs Children, often entreating his dear Wife freely to give him up to the Will and diſpoſing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, whoſe he was, being made acceptable in the beloved Son; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſweetly comforting her in her Sorrow and great Diſtreſs, making as little ſhew of his illneſs (for her ſake) as ever he might: yet we ſaw that he was under a great weight of Sickneſs, and that his ſtrength daily waſted, ſo that in leſs then three weeks time after the Feaver took him, he finiſhed here, and was ſweetly taken to reſt in the joy of the Lord for ever more, it being the day of the firſt Month 1663. and the next day was accompanied to his Grave, by many Friends and others, and his Body enterred in the

               <p>COncerning my dear Husband <hi>John Audland</hi> deceaſed, I am under Obligation to bear this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teſtimony, as one that had the advantage beyond all others to know, as well his Qualifications, endowments and Gifts given him of God, whether Spiritual or Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; as alſo his great Labours and Travels in that bleſſed work and ſervice of the Lord, his Truth and People, that he was in the Morning of the day called unto, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in (in all fidelity and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the ſpending of his natural
<pb facs="tcp:57915:24"/>
ſtrength) to the end of his days and finiſhing of his Courſe here, in order to be ſwallowed up in eternal Joy for evermore.</p>
               <p>The eternal God, who by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence joyned us together in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in our young days, in his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Counſel alſo cauſed his day to ſpring from on high upon us, in the marvelous Light, and bright ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof he revealed his Son Chriſt in us, and gave us Faith to believe in him the eternal Word of Life, by which our Souls came to be quickned and made alive in him, and alſo in and by the quickning Power of his holy Power we were made one, in a Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly relation, our hearts being knit together in the unſpeakable love of Truth, which was our Life, Joy and Delight, and made our days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exceeding comfortable, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that whereby all our temporal
<pb facs="tcp:57915:25"/>
enjoyments were ſanctified, and made a bleſſing unto us.</p>
               <p>How exceeding dear and kindly affectionate Husband he was to me, I am far ſhort in ability to declare; but in a word ſhall ſay, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve few ever enjoyed a greater bleſſing in a Husband, then I in him, and notwithſtanding that I loved his company, and the enjoyment of him with me, above all the World; yet nevertheleſs in ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Will of God (whoſe cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Veſſel he was) and alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the honourable Service of Truth, and the publication thereof which he was called unto; I could freely give him up as to be ſeparated from in the outward a great part of, our time after we were convinced of Gods bleſſed Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and made living Witneſſes of the vertuous Life, and powerful Operation thereof, as in this our day gloriouſly
<pb facs="tcp:57915:25"/>
made known to the everlaſting joy of our immortal Souls.</p>
               <p>But before this bleſſed work came to be effected, great was the warfare and inward exerciſe, that my dear Husband underwent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the chaſtizing Hand of the Lord, and the Spirit of Judgment and of burning that was at work in his inward parts, in order to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him for the Lords own uſe and ſervice; for when the Lords bleſſed and honorable day Broke upon him, he was high in Notion and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, imagining that he had been filled with durable Riches and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but in the Light of this day he ſaw the emptineſs of it all, while he wanted the Subſtance, Life in the eternal Word, and by the ſame to be ſanctified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Therefore under the ſence of this great want, many and great were his Sighs and Groans, and his Tears not a few; Days and
<pb facs="tcp:57915:26"/>
Nights of Sorrow many a one he underwent, the Word and Power of the Lord being as a Fire revealed within him, to burn the great buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he had been erecting and ſetting up of Hay, Wood and Stuub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and in this exerciſe I alſo had a ſhare with him, and in great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation I have heard him often Sorrowfully ſay; Ah! what have we been doing? what have we been labouring for? or what availeth our great Profeſſion? all our building tumbles down; our Profeſſion is high as the Wind; the Day of the Lord is upon it, and his Word as a Fire conſumes it as dry Stubble; and put's an end unto all empty Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and high Notions without Life or Subſtance to all the Wiſdom of fallen man: we muſt forſake the World, and all its glory; its all but Vanity and Vexation of Spirit; 'tis a Saviour that I long for, 'tis him that my Soul pants after; Oh! that
<pb facs="tcp:57915:26"/>
I may be comprehended into his Life and over-ſhadowed with his Glory, ſanctified throughout by his Word, and raiſed up by his eternal Power. To this effect did his Soul often Travel before the Lord; and the Lord who had called him for the purpoſe of his own Glory, was nor unmindful of him; but had regard to his bleſſed work begun, to proſper the ſame, that ſo out of the Furnace of Affliction a pure and clean Veſſel might be brought forth; And then the Lord plentifully poured upon him of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, filling him with all Wiſdom and Power to publiſh and proclaim his everlaſting Goſpel, and to bring Glad-tidings to the poor, the Day of deliverance to the captivated Souls, and to ſay unto <hi>Sion</hi> that her King reigns.</p>
               <p>And thus the Eternal God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fitted and furniſhed his dear Servant, he called him forth into
<pb facs="tcp:57915:27"/>
ſeveral parts of the Nation; and the Lord appeared with him in his glory, and gave him Authority in his Power, even to tread upon Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and to put to flight the Armies of the Alians; God having given him the Tongue of the Learned, to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and heavy Laden, and Wiſdom to divide that word aright which he had put in his Mouth to publiſh in his Name; by which he became eminent in his work and ſervice, a bleſſing to Thouſands, who can bleſs the Lord on his behalf.</p>
               <p>How great was his Travels in Soul, Body and Spirit? how unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in his Labours? and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold his Tryals and Sufferings in full, is beyond my ability to relate, notwithſtanding that I knew more thereof then any other living; but inaſmuch as my now dear Husband hath in his foregoing Teſtimony in part hinted at them, and happily
<pb facs="tcp:57915:27"/>
may be added to by ſome other in or about <hi>Briſtol</hi> (where his Labours, Travels and Sufferings was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great) I ſhall not much endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to under take that work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well ſatisfied, that whether any thing had been related thereof or no; its known to the Lord, and lives in the remembrance of Thouſands, who can teſtifie to his faithful and effectual Labours, in the Word and Goſpel in his day, and that he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not his life dear, that he might be found in the diſcharge of a good Conſcience, (in that concern) in the ſight of God and men; who are his living witneſſes this day, to the praiſe of the eternal God, to whom alone belongs all the Glory for ever.</p>
               <p>He was a man of an exceeding ſweet diſpoſition, unſpeakably lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and tenderly affectionate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to lend a helping hand to the weak and needy, open-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:28"/>
free and near to his Friends, deep in the underſtanding of Heavenly Myſteries, willing and able to give advice and counſel to the afflicted and bowed down, with whom he alwayes did ſympathize in their ſufferings; he was abundantly filled with Love and endeared kindneſs to all his Brethren, and fellow La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the Goſpel, and had an honorable eſteem of the leaſt that was faithful in that work, and his life was bound up in the unity and fellowſhip of the Spirit with them; whatever would in the leaſt appear to break that bond amongſt Friends, he was ſharpe in the Authority of Truth againſt, to judge the ſame.</p>
               <p>He was greatly beloved, and highly eſteemed of in the Lord, for his works ſake; notwithſtanding, not lifted up thereby, but preſerved in great humility and lamb-like low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, never ſeeking to Lord over
<pb facs="tcp:57915:28"/>
Gods Heritage; but to ſerve the leaſt for the Goſpels ſake, always deteſting ſelf exaltation in whom ſoever it appeared.</p>
               <p>His Body and outward Strength was much ſpent, through his great Labours for ſeveral Years before the Feaver took him, of which he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that he under-went many weariſome nights, through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of a moſt violent Cough, though he bore it with unſpeakable patience and contentedneſs.</p>
               <p>In the time of his ſickneſs which was ſharp and ſtrong upon him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Feaver took him, ſo that his Sleep was taken from him for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days and nights; yet he bore it alſo with wonderful Patience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always of an exceeding cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spirit; Friends daily coming to viſit him in abundance, from ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al parts, he was often drawn forth in a living ſweet Teſtimony, the Lords Power and Life living with
<pb facs="tcp:57915:29"/>
him, to the great refreſhment and tendering of the Hearts of many; he was alſo exceedingly filled with the high Praiſes of God, being as one overcome and raviſhed in the ſence of Gods Love, Joy and Peace everlaſting; When he grew weak he would be helped up upon his Knees, and upon his bed ſweetly ſupplicate the Lord, in the behalf of Friends preſent, and all the Lords Flock and Heritage every where, that they might be preſerved in his powerful Truth, and out of the evil of the World, and that his Truth and Goſpel might be more and more ſpread and publiſhed to the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of all that appertain to <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was greatly afficted in the ſence of my Sorrow, (occaſioned by his great weakneſs which I ſaw dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to encreaſe upon him) lamenting my deſolate ondition, to be left ſo Big with Child, as that I was
<pb facs="tcp:57915:29"/>
within a few dayes after his Death delivered; and therefore did very wiſely and tenderly comfort me, withal deſiring me to give him up freely ro the diſpoſing of the Lord whoſe he was, and enjoyed his pure peace; And although it was hard to part with ſo dear, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leved a Husband, yet the Lord ſtrengthened me, and I ſeeing the extremity of his Diſtemper to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding heavy upon him, and to encreaſe, I was made willing to go to him, and freely recommend him into the Hands of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Living God, to diſpoſe of him according to his divine Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and unſearchable Wiſdom and Counſel, whether Life or Death; the which added to his eaſe and my peace, in true ſubmiſſion to the Will of the Lord; ſo his Body dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakning, and his Diſtemper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing; he notwithſtanding being moſtly kept ſenſible to the laſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
<pb facs="tcp:57915:30"/>
in Prayer, and Praiſing the Lord, often and again recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me, and his Daughter then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, (whom he dearly loved) into the keeping of his God, with Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, that he would be an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to his deſolate Widow, &amp; a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Fatherleſs Children, he ſweetly fell on ſleep, and finiſhed his Courſe &amp; the year time by my now Husband before ſet down, being paſſed into the fulneſs of eternal Joy, which his Eye was only to, and his Soul breathed for, more then length of days in the enjoyment of the World, or its Riches: Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Glory and eternal Praiſes to the Lord for ever, and for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <bibl>Amen.</bibl>
               </p>
               <p>How hard it was, and how great a loſs to part with ſo dear and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Husband as he was to me, it being always (I can truely ſay) his joy and delight, to add to my eaſe, good, and content every way (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="tcp:57915:30"/>
my eſtate and condition being conſidered) is far beyond what I can expreſs, the dolour of my Heart my Tongue or Pen is not able to declare, yet in this I contented my ſelf, that it was the Will of the Lord, and that he was taken from the evil, and freed from his manifold exerciſes, and that my loſs though great was not to be compared to his eternal gain, being entered into that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and bleſſed reſt with the Lord, prepared in the Heavens for all the faithful Followers of the Lamb, through the many Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where being freed from all Pain and Sorrow, and Tears being wiped away, ſhall for ever Praiſe the Lord upon mount <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great was his joy in the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Work of the Lord, in the Hands of his Servants called thereto, and who were faithful therein his Soul honoured for their work ſake; on the contrary, where any was ſlack
<pb facs="tcp:57915:31"/>
or negligent, or taught themſelves in an exalted mind, it grieved his Spirit exceedingly, I have known him often to lament and mourn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the exerciſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Some time before he was taken out of the Body he had a clear ſight or Viſion upon his Bed (I being at that time with him) concerning two, (I ſhall not need to name them, the Viſion being fulfilled, hath marked them out to all whoſe Eyes are open) who were with him in the beginning called to the work and ſervice of the Goſpel, and being in meaſure together with himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein, yet grew ſlack in that work, and begun to be exalted and gathered to, and ſought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and being that his Spirit was ſo grieved therewith, and time hath given to ſee the clear fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof; I have had it weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily upon my Spirit for a long time (as my Husband and ſome other
<pb facs="tcp:57915:31"/>
Friends can bear me record) to publiſh the ſame, for the Glory of that eternal God that reveals his Secrets to thoſe that fear him, and by his holy Spirit gives to ſee things to come; and alſo for the ſervice of Truth and Friends, and as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof upon the ſlack and exalted ones who ſeek themſelves, not the Glory of God, nor the good or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his People, upon whom its evidently fulfilled; and in as much as the Lord hath made way for the foregoing Teſtimony relating to my dear Husband <hi>J. A.</hi> deceaſed; in the diſcharge of my Conſcience, and to eaſe my Spirit of its Burthen, I am engaged to inſert the Subſtance thereof as followeth, judging it both a proper place and ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>It was on this wiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> He ſaw a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large Mine, where there was very much precious Ore to be digged out, but with great and hard Labour, and the Lord and Maſter had called him,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:32"/>
with many more, to Labour in this Mine, in order to work and digg out this good and precious Ore, and who was moſt dilligent in Labour was to be moſt liberally rewarded, and the command was that they might work in every part of the Mine, but muſt all gather to oneplace, and to one heap, &amp; the work proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and became exceeding great, to the glory of the Lord, and their Joy &amp; comfort who were found diligent; but in proceſs of time he looked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, upon others that were labouring, and amongſt them beheld two (who had been antient La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers) to begin to ſlack, and would but work where it was moſt eaſie, in their own time, and by their own appointment not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the command of their Lord; and not only ſo, but when they found a piece of Ore more rich and goodly then ſome other, whether it was of their own digging or no,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:32"/>
they did gather it to another private heap of their own, for themſelves, to their own benefit, and not the Lords; whereupon he cryed out in the grief and bitterneſs of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to ſee ſuch diſobey the Lords command, in gathering to their own heap; Ah! Lord, it was thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that we ſhould all work at thy appointment, and gather to one heap, and for a time it was ſo, and thy Heap encreaſed and Work pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered; but now there's two, that's begun to gather to themſelves, to their own heap, and not to thee; And being in a great exerciſe of mind and Spirit, he a woke, and the power of the Lord was upon him, and did make him Tremble very much; and under the ſence of what he had ſeen he did ſigh and mourn greatly; whereupon I asked him, what was the occaſion of ſo great exerciſe, and he told me with much
<pb facs="tcp:57915:33"/>
Sorrow what he had ſeen concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe two Labourers, that had been called to the work and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord, with him and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, and whileſt faithful, were loved with a Brotherly love, for their works ſake; and further told me, that the thing would come to paſs, and be fulfilled in a few years; as certainly it is, as many can teſtifie; yet, notwithſtanding Gods gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goes forward, and his heap dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreaſes; and the idle ſlack un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, and the ſelf-gatherers ſhall be covered with Rags, and ſhall have their Portion with the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in a dry Land.</p>
               <p>Before his departure he would often be ſpeaking of his being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from me, deſiring me to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therewith, for the Lord would care for me, and by his heavenly Providence order for the ſupply of my want of him, as I kept my truſt
<pb facs="tcp:57915:33"/>
in the Lord: And truly even ſo it hath come to paſs, bleſſed be the Lord, who hath bleſſed me with the enjoyment of another faithful Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band according to my Hearts deſire, to my unſpeakable comfort; ſo that I might juſtly reflect upon my ſelf for great ingratitude, if I ſhould not both humbly and thankfully acknowledge the care and bleſſing of my God to be exceeding large and great, for which my Soul is under Obligation for ever, to extol and magnifie his holy, living and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Name.</p>
               <p>And thus having in the fore-going Teſtimony cleared my Spirit, as it lived with me in the ſight of God, I ſhall conclude with an humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to his heavenly Majeſty, in the behalf of all his gathered ones, that they may be kept and preſerved in all faithfulneſs and holy Obedience, by the Arm of his everlaſting power,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:34"/>
that having run their race and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed their courſe, they may with their Brethren that are gone before, be ſwallowed up in immortallity for evermore, and that by the ſame eternal Arm (that hitherto hath not only girded me with ſtrength to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo many Trials, and deep ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, but alſo hath been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſtretched forth to double and redouble bleſſings both ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and temporal upon me) I may be aſſiſted to anſwer the unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mercies of my God, in all Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and holy Obedience; and having fought the good fight of faith, and finiſhed my courſe with joy; in the fulneſs of Gods appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time being made acceptable in the beloved Son, I may enter into that eternal Kingdom of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that's prepared for the faithful, into which my late dear Husband, with a Remnant of faithful Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

               <p>AFter the long, and tedious Night of Apoſtacy ſpread over Nations, and diſmal Darkneſs over People, it pleaſed the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:57915:35"/>
God of Heaven and Earth to viſit this Northern Iſland, and firſt the Northern part thereof; with the Morning of his ever bleſſed day; from whence came the aforeſaid bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Servants of the Lord Jeſus; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the everlaſting Goſpel, from the Angel of Gods preſence, to Preach in the demonſtration of his Mighty Power; with which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were filled. <hi>John Camm</hi> was an Ancient man, full of Zeal and Fervency in the Goſpel; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the precious Gift of diſcerning, and ſound Judgment; terrible to the man of Sin, and full of bowels and tenderneſs to the travelling Souls; Sharp and terrible to the evil, but ſweet and Friendly to the tender; and well inclined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way of Righteouſneſs, not ſparing his weak body, which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up, even unto Death, to ſerve the Lord God in his bleſſed work of gathering, which he ſaw in a
<pb facs="tcp:57915:36"/>
plentiful manner to his great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; a farther Teſtimony of him, as to his Country, Life, Travels and Death, is given by his dear Wife, and <hi>Thomas Camm</hi> his Son, and his Wife, to which I refer. His memory is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and his place is among the living Ancients in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>John Audland</hi> was a younger man, of a ſweet ruddy and amiable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and of a chearful Spirit; one of the Wiſe in heart, filled with the excellent bright ſparking glorious Power of the Lord God everlaſting; in which he appeared many times ſo filled, that immortallity ſhined in his Face, and his Voice was as Thunder, therein dreadful in the Strengh of the Lord of Hoſts againſt the man of Sin, and thoſe in Covenant therewith; terrible in the dread of God againſt the Workers of iniquity; but livingly tender to the ſenſible Travellers, and poor in ſpirit. Ah! my Soul hath a ſenſible remembrance, how the
<pb facs="tcp:57915:36"/>
Doctrine given him of Chriſt Jeſus dropt as dew, and ſweetly deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the refreſhing Rain: He was a Labourer indeed, Night and Day in the Labour of the Goſpel; in which he extreamly ſpent himſelf; and his fervent and unexpreſſible Travells in and about the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> I am well ſatisfied, laid a Foundation for the waſting his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life; which was ſpent, and offered up for the Truth, and in the work of it: and indeed he, with dear honourable <hi>John Camm,</hi> was inſtrumental in the Hand of the Almighty God of our Gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and the ſpending their lives and ſtrength was moſt in their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Travels amongſt us, in the City, and adjacent parts, of which I was an eye and ear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, being with them frequently. Theſe two faithful Miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus came to the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> in the 5th Month 1654.
<pb facs="tcp:57915:37"/>
and firſt they came amongſt a ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people, who kept one day in the week in faſting and praying, waiting for, and breathing in Spirit after the Morning and Viſitation of of God, and Day of Redemption; and amongſt us they ſpoke the powerful Word of Life, in the dread of his Name that lives forever; and we were ſeized on, and ſmitten even to the Heart; and that Day, and the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of it over took us, which we had longed and waited for, and from Darkneſs to the marvellous Light of the Lord we were turned. Some Meetings we had before the more general gathering in and about that City, which began on this wiſe: On a firſt day in the morning I went with theſe two Servants of God, about a mile and half from the City, to a little ſpring of Water, where I often had ſpent many Solitary hours in my tender years, ſeeking the Lord; where we ſat ſome time, and
<pb facs="tcp:57915:37"/>
drank of the ſpring. After ſome hours of the morning were ſpent, I ſaw in them a great travel in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; Trembling, <hi>J. A.</hi> ſaid, let us be going into the City; ſo we came to the Street called <hi>Broadmead,</hi> to a houſe where were ſeveral People met together, enquiring after theſe two men of God. <hi>John Audland</hi> was under a great exerciſe of Spirit, and ſaid, Is here any one that has any intereſt in any Field? An ancient man ſaid, I have in a Field prety near; notice being given to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the houſe, they came forth; and as we went along, people in the Streets went alſo to the Field, called <hi>Earls-mead;</hi> ſo that we came a pretty number, where ſome Seats or Stools were brought; Dear <hi>John Camm</hi> began to ſpeak renderly, and in great Zeal, directing to the heavenly Grace of God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying againſt Sin and Iniquity fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently; to which ſome were atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb facs="tcp:57915:38"/>
in this ſeaſon; I perceived a great exerciſe of Spirit on my dear Friend, and Father in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>J. Audland</hi> who very much trembled. After dear <hi>John Camm</hi> ſtood down, he ſtood up, full of dread and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning brightneſs on his countenance, lifted up his Voice as a Trumpet, and ſaid, I proclaim ſpiritual War with the Inhabitants of the Earth, who are in the Fall and Seperation from God, and Propheſie to the ſour winds of Heaven; and theſe words dropt amongſt the Seed; and ſo went on in the mighty Power of God Almighty, opening the way of Life. But, ah! the ſeizings of Souls, and prickings at heart, which atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that ſeaſon; ſome fell on the Ground, others crying out under the ſence of opening their States, which indeed gave experimental Knowledge of what is recorded, acts 2. 37. Indeed it was a notable day, worthy to be left on Record,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:38"/>
that our Children may read, and tell to their Children, and theirs to another Generation, that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy noble Acts of the Arm of Gods Salvation may be remembred, which have been the way of the Lord, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Servants through Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>At this Meeting many were effectually convinced, and from Darkneſs to Light turned, after which our Meetings grew larger and larger. They viſited the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of them called Independants, and Baptiſts, teſtifying amongſt them in great power the things given them of God, directing the poor and needy in ſpirit, that ſaw their want of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, no longer to ſeek the Living amongſt the Dead, but look from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Hills dead Ways and Worſhips, unto Chriſt Jeſus the Foundation of Life and Salvation; and there was added unto the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
<pb facs="tcp:57915:39"/>
daily, and great dread was round about, and in our Meetings, under the ſeaſonings of the holy Ghoſt, Oh! the Tears, Sighs, and Groans, Tremblings, and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the ſight of the middle will of partition, that we ſaw then in our awakened States, that ſtood between us and the Lord, and in the ſight and ſenſe of our ſpiritual wants and neceſſities: Oh! the hungrings, and thirſtings of Soul that attended daily, and great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels of Spirit, to obtain through the working of the mighty Power of Gods dominion, and Spiritual Victory over the Enemy of our Souls, who had lead us in the Paths of Death and Darkneſs; and indeed as the Viſits of Gods holy and ever bleſſed Day was ſignal and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible, as aforeſaid; ſo I Teſtifie in the fear and dread, and awe of God Almighty, we received the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel with a ready mind, and with
<pb facs="tcp:57915:39"/>
broken Hearts, and affected Spirits and gave up to follow the Lord fully, caſting off the weights and burdens, and the Sin that eaſily beſets, and from the evil ways and vanities of this World departed: Oh! the ſtrippings of all needleſs Apparel, and the forſaking of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities in Meats, Drinks, and in the plain ſelf-denying Path we walked; having the fear and dread of God on our Souls, that we were afraid of offending in word or deed, our Words were few and ſavory, our Apparel and Houſes plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtripped of ſuperfluities; our Countenances Grave, and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Weighty: amongſt thoſe we had to do with. Indeed we were a plain broken-hearted, contrite ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, ſelf-denying people; our Souls being in an unexpreſſible Travel, to do all things well-pleaſing in the Sight of God; for our great concern night and day was to obtain through
<pb facs="tcp:57915:40"/>
Jeſus Chriſt the Great work of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and thereby an aſſurance of the everlaſting Reſt, and Sabboth, of our God; and in thoſe days, Oh! the unexpreſſible Labour, Travels, and ſpending of the Strength of theſe Servants of the moſt high God, in great Aſſemblies in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Countries round about; our Meetings were ſo large that we were forced to meet without doors, and that in Froſt and Snow: In which Meetings, Oh! the extending of Voice of theſe Servants of God, to reach over theſe great multitudes, when ſeveral thouſands have been aſſembled together, and as the Work of the Lord increaſed, ſo the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was at work in Prieſts, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in thoſe dayes, who ſtirred up the Youth of the City, into a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multing, like the men of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> and once we had a very great tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult that the Streets were crowded, and theſe two Servants of the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:57915:40"/>
were ſeized upon by the multitude, and were in great hazard.</p>
               <p>But the Lord ſignally delivered them, as in dayes paſt he had done his Servants on ſuch occaſions, and all came to be quieted, and our Meetings peaceable, and many grew in Grace, and in the Knowledge of God, and Chriſt Jeſus, which is Eternal Life; much more of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars I might write, but affecting brevity, for ſeveral reaſons; I ſay, in ſhort, ſuch was the effectual working of the Almighty Power of God, and makings bare of his Arm of Salvation, that attended thoſe Servants of the moſt High, and the great work of our Goſpel, meeting with the various Trials and exerciſes that attended them, and us that were the fruits of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the Lord, that my Tongue cannot expreſs what I was an eye and ear witneſs of, and a Soul ſharer in. Therefore to the God of this
<pb facs="tcp:57915:41"/>
bright Morning of our day of Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ariſeth, ſprings up, as in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with himſelf through Chriſt Jeſus, holy heavenly high Praiſes, Might, Majeſty and Dominion is aſcribed to the Lord God, and the Lamb. So let it be ſaith my ſpirit in fear and trembling, through Ages and Generation, for ever and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more <hi>Ameu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, dear Friends every where, but more particularly in and about the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who have ſeen the Morning of the day of God break forth in our Age, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, and by the divine Light thereof, have ſeen the darkneſs that has covered the people expelled, in which darkneſs people have been Ignorant of the true and living God, and his precious work of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which ignorance they have performed their worſhip, even in the ſame nature that they are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and rebelling, and grieving
<pb facs="tcp:57915:41"/>
the Good Spirit of God which all ought to be ſubject too; now it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the divine Being, in his infinite love and tender pity and compaſſion to look down upon us, whileſt in the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and Houſe of Bondage ſpiritually, and to ſend forth his Light and Truth, to give us a ſence inwardly of the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtates of our Souls in the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from, and depravation of the enjoyments of the Lord, which ſence and ſight begat in us living Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and a holy Cry after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him we ſaw our ſelves ignorant of; and he in the fulneſs of the Diſpenſation of time viſited us, as afore mentioned, of which, dear Friends, we were right glad, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though when the Lord diſcovered our ſtates, he laid Judgment to the Line, and Righteouſneſs to the Plummet, and gave to us the Cup of Trembling, in which was the Wine of Aſtoniſhment. which was
<pb facs="tcp:57915:42"/>
in mercy to our Poor Souls, that could not be redeemed but by Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment poured on the nature that had ſeparated us from God, and on us as joyned thereunto; and here, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Sin revived, we begun to dye to it. O Good day! and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeaſon, worthy, worthy both to be remembred by us, and our Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring through Generations; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was the ſeaſon of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Condemnation, yet was it glorious; and in this ſeaſon the Almighty God by his ſpiritual Trumpet ſounded to us that the end of this his ſpiritual Appearance, was to root out, lay waite, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the nature of Sin and Iniquity, that had divided and ſeparated us from God, and hindred the good things from us of his Heavenly power and Kingdom, and we were perſwaded the ſet time was come for clenſing and ſanctifying the Temple, and fitting it for the pure
<pb facs="tcp:57915:42"/>
immortal God; and did not we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin inward, as in the day of <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> that the Temple might be clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed throughly in every part? for in the outward Temple they clenſed firſt the inward part of the Houſe of the Lord, and ſo came along to the Porch, until the Temple was throughly clenſed. Indeed in the Morning of our precious Day of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, the Ax was laid to the Root of the corrupt Tree, and the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to the hard Rocky Heart, and the ſpiritual Fire kindled in the Stubble. Now, dear Friends, in the Word of Truth I ſay unto you, ſearch with the holy Light of Chriſt Jeſus, how this work has proſpered in your Souls, ſee whether you that knew a right beginning firſt in the inward part, have come along faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the work of Sanctifying the Heart and the Temple, from the inward part to the outſide; ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Root has not eſcaped the
<pb facs="tcp:57915:43"/>
Ax, the rocky Heart the Hammer, and the Chaff the Fire; for if it has, the cauſe is not in the Lord, nor in his Power; but in your diſobedience and negligence, going from the Ax, Hammer and Fire, and ſo ſparing the beſt, as diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, ſo the Root of bitterneſs ſprang up againſt the work of God, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth of his heavenly wiſdom: To the holy plain ſpeaking Witneſs of God, I ſpeak, earneſtly deſiring and entreating all to have a ſingle regard to that which will duely and rightly apply theſe things; and let all ſee whether that nature be alive that the holy Power of the Lord did work againſt in the beginning, and if ſo, ſee the cauſe, which being ſeen will deeply humble and ſeize on the ſpirits of all concerned. Oh! what a day have we had, how has the good Husbandman been at work in his Vineyard, how did he
<pb facs="tcp:57915:43"/>
plant in a fruitful Hill, with the choiceſt Vine? he digged, pruned, and gathered out the Stones, and Hedged and Walled about, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all he looked for good Fruit, but where the unſpeakable Mercy and loving Kindneſs of the Lord has not been anſwered, behold ſower Grapes, and wilde Fruit was brought forth; and what was the conſequence of it, Was it not the taking away the Hedge, through which it was eaten up; and breaking down the Wall thereof, and it was trodden down? Read, ſee, feel and conſider; and the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty viſit you in your Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſecret Chambers, in his holy dread, with his ſearching Life and piercing Word of Power, who in his tender infinite Love and Mercy, long-Sufferings, great Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to his Seed and Off-ſpring, viſited us in his pure morning, aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to give all the ſence of their
<pb facs="tcp:57915:44"/>
inward ſtates, as they are in his ſight; from whom nothing can be hid. And now dear Friends, the cauſe of the hindrance of the proſperity of the work of the Lord in the Souls of any, hath not been from any cauſe in God, or deficiency in his Light, Power and Wiſdom, but from the Creatures going out of a capacity of receiving and enjoying the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power of God, in which Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is worked out, by all that wait for it, and joyn with it, and cleave to it, and not forſake it, for I have learned of the Lord through many exerciſes unexpreſſible, that after the Viſitation of the Almighty to any Soul, the Lord requires an inward worthy receiving his Love, &amp; ſpiritual Watch to be kept in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Light, in which all the workings and approaches of the deſtroying Adverſary of the Soul is diſcerned, and the enlightned and obedient mind is preſerved, and through the
<pb facs="tcp:57915:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpiritual fence, given in a tender waiting on the Lord in the inward part; ſupplicating breathings ariſeth to the living eternal God of Love and Compaſſion who beholding the want of the Soul, deſcends in his Love, and reaches forth his helping Hand to the broken and contrite Hearted, and lifts up the bowed down Spirit, with the liftings up of his holy ſpiritual Standard, ſo the Temptation and Aſſaults of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy is vanquiſhed and overcomſe and the Power of God is felt in thoe, that deſcend with it in humility; to be working on the Root as an Ax, and on the Rocky as a Hammer, and Chaffy as a Fire; Now Friends when there is an abatement of the inward and ſpiritual care, and a gradual leſſening of the inward watchfulneſs, then the mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes both unworthy and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the enjoyments of the Power of the Lord, that begun and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth on the Work of the Lord;
<pb facs="tcp:57915:45"/>
ſo then the Enemy comes as not ſeen, through the minds being out of the holy Watch in the Light, the nature that was wounded comes to be healed again, and eaſe given to that which ſhould be deſtroyed; ſo the Enemy perceiving where the weakneſs is, and how, and by what means he has gotten a little ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he endeavours in all ſubtilty and vigilency, by preſenting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſubjects, to lead by degrees out of a watchful ſtate, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to every degree of digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he brings over the once enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mind a proportion of darkneſs and deceiveableneſs of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and inſenſibility of Spirit, in the in ward feeling part, of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Enemy of the Soul, who thus works, that with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining there may be a proportion of benuming all the inward ſences, of Seeing, Hearing and Feeling; and then again he has Mankind in a ſtate
<pb facs="tcp:57915:45"/>
fit to work upon, by drawing them out by his Power to act and bring forth, that which he ſees them moſt capable of and which there is the greateſt inclination in their natures to go into; hence Schiſms ariſe in Judgments, which the wrathful part in Man getting into, he works by the way of a fierce management, with a ſort of Zeal, but not according to Knowledge, in which the power of the Enemy works up at laſt into a Schiſm, and the Enemy is never wanting to preſent matters to the mind, as juſt for the Creature to be blown up with, which ends in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring the Lord and his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truth, and hurting and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, until the Enemy has worked his end, by ſuch Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, bringing them into an Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the Life of God, into a worſe ſtate, then the tender day of God's Viſitation found them in; and ſo if not humbled under the
<pb facs="tcp:57915:46"/>
mighty Hand of God, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are expoſed to Shame, and ſo dies away under the Wrath of God.</p>
               <p>Now, dear Friends, the Enemy of <hi>Sions</hi> Proſperity works variouſly, according as he ſees where he may get an entrance, by proportionating his Snares to the inclinations of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, as before is hinted, &amp;c. Where he ſees an inclination in any to be taken with the earthly things, there he works ſubtilly to captivate the mind, and draw it out of the watchful, tender, ſpiritual ſtate, into a falſe Liberty, both to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the things acting and poſſeſſed, and in the converſation amongſt Men; others into ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Meat, Drink and Apparel on themſelves and houſes; and ſuch their comforts ſtand moſt in outward things, and by degrees are ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up of them, and the Pleaſures, Luſt and Delights below, and ſo they
<pb facs="tcp:57915:46"/>
dye to an inward Life of watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and freſhneſs, which is preſerved in fear and dread, in keeping the holy Watch, and in the ſpiritual Croſs, which Crucifies to the World, and the World to it.—Now, dear Friends, here is our ſpiritual Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſame that through Death to Sin made us alive to God, as we abide under the leadings and teachings of it, keeps us alive to him, in a growing, increaſing, freſh flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſtate; for as we delight in his eternal Law of Life, we grow as Willows by the Water-courſes of Immortal refreſhings, and Travel faithfully on in our ſpiritual Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, until we come to <hi>Sion</hi> the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, and then are Enjoyers of the end of all our Tryals and Tribulations, having overcome, we ſee an enterance adminiſtred, and that abundantly into the eternal Reſt and Sabboth of our God.</p>
               <p>The Lord Almighty give all to

enjoy this bleſſed Portion and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inheritance and let all ſee in this Age, and the Ages to come, all that which lets and hinders them taken out of the Way, that the God of all our Mercies, in whom is all our freſh Springs may have his Honour and Glory; his Church and People through Ages the Comfort and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, <bibl>Amen, Amen.</bibl>

               <head>A Teſtimony concerning the Precious Unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Chriſt Jeſus.</head>
               <p>THe Unity of the Spirit is ſo precious a vertue, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Qualification, in all the Churches of Chriſt Jeſus, that whileſt the people of the Lord did abide therein, in every Age they were in a thriving flouriſhing, ſweet and glorious ſtation; for as long as they truely held the Head Chriſt Jeſus, and kept in Unity with him; Unity and Amity was preſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them in their ſeveral ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſervices, as Members of one Body, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Of which Unity, <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh preciouſly, and comprehenſively; ſaying, Behold, how good, and how pleaſant it is for Brethren to
<pb facs="tcp:57915:48"/>
dwell together in unity; its like the precious Ointment on the head, that ran down upon the Beard even <hi>Arons</hi> Beard, and went down to the Skirts of his Garment: as the Dew of <hi>Hermon,</hi> and as the Dew that deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Mountains of <hi>Sion;</hi> for there <hi>(Mark)</hi> the Lord commanded the bleſſing, even Life everlaſting. This was the ſtate the holy Power of the great God gathered a people into. For concerning them, it is left upon record they continued daily in fellowſhip, and that with one accord.</p>
               <p>Now, dear Friends, we clearlyſaw felt and underſtood in the precious Morning of our tender Viſitation, that the ſame ancient Power of the Lord that wrought powerfully, firſt to diſunite us from the nature which ſeparated us from God, and then to bring us up into unity and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with himſelf, in his dear love, and therein one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

For here (ever was and is) the the Foundation of the true Unity, even that of the Spirit, in which love the Body edifies it ſelf, and is increaſing, and building up a holy Habitation for God through the Spirit; ſo then all abiding, and growing up in the love of God, and walking with him in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, Unity encreaſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the Members, and Branches taken out of the wild-Olive, and planted into (and abiding in) the Vine of Life Chriſt Jeſus our Head, and Law-giver; and here the Church of Chriſt grew up, into a ſtate of being clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her Feet: Ah! precious, bleſſed, ſweet and glorious ſtation! But did it always thus continue in the Apoſtles dayes? Ah! no, the old Serpent, the Enemy of mans welfare wrought power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and cunningly, firſt to draw forth from the R oot of Life, and out

of the holy Love, and ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to this glorious Power that had gathered them, to a daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward walking with God, and to draw out of a ſpiritual exerciſe of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Croſs, and holy Watch, as before has been demonſtrated, &amp;c. And then fruit from another Root was brought forth, as the Reader may note in ſeveral Epiſtles; and in <hi>John</hi>'s Teſtimony to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia:</hi> Then the Power of the Lord that had gathered them, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to exhort to put away bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, Wrath, Anger and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; Evil-ſpeakings, and Malice, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>And now, dear Friends, with your Lamps trimmed and burning, look inward, ſearching every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of your Hearts, that clear unto your own underſtandings, every one of your ſtates may appear as it is in the ſight of the pure al-ſeeing God, that ſo all the Enemies dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,

               <p>And tender Friends, thoſe that have ſeen the ſweet, lovely precious ſtateof Unity, and Concord, that the excellent Power of the Lord God Almighty gathered into, and was gathering into, in the bleſſed morning of our day, and the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al advantages, comforts, joy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments and divine Satisfaction, that attended the Church of Chriſt in this true and ſpiritual Unity, with our the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and one with another and on the other hand Head the anxious, exeriſing conſequences of the Enemies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing to break unity, and of the lamentable effects thereof, ſo that all the true hearted &amp; ſincere ſpirited to God, cannot but on the on Hand admire, prize, and unexpreſſibly eſteem the precious Unity. And on the other hand greatly dread the
<pb facs="tcp:57915:50"/>
turnings aſide and going out of it; For thoſe who have kept their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and lived to God as they have taſted, and enjoyed the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and beheld the amiableneſs of this Unity, and Amity ſo they have felt the ſorrows and anguiſh of the effects of the contrary; which have cauſed them to go many days, and months, with bowed down Souls, crying to the Almighty God of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der compaſſion, Night and Day, under the unexpreſſible weight thereof; and the tender God of Love bowed his ear to the cry of the Poor, and ſighing of the Needy, and has ariſen in the might of his Power, and the Majeſty of his Glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence hath relieved, and his holy Arm has been made bare, through which he hath redeemed his Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the Dog, and his dear ones from the Devourer; and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues working to bring into this precious unity, in the holy Light of Life, with God in Chriſt Jeſus,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:50"/>
and one with another. And now dear Friends every where, unto you, and to the Generation coming after, I have this Warning, and tender Advice, to leave behind me, in the Name of my God, that hath been with me in my Travels, in his Power, Work and Labour of the Goſpel of Life, and Salvation. Keep the Unity of the Spirit, in the Bond of Peace; and let none give way to a prejudicing Spirit, which leads into ſecret Whiſperings, Back-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and ſuch like evil, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Fruits, the working of which Spirit is like a Moth in a Garment, dividing, deſtroying, ſpoyling and eating up; for indeed, as <hi>Sion</hi> is a City at Unity with it ſelf, under the ſeamleſs Garment of Chriſt Jeſus, and there all are well, and ſafe, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing increaſing and flouriſhing; ſo when the Spirit aboveſaid prevails, to draw out of <hi>Sions</hi> Gates, and from within her Walls of Salvation: Oh! what deplorable work and havock
<pb facs="tcp:57915:51"/>
will it make in its Growth and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; working, as I ſaid before, of the Moth gradually and ſecretly firſt; but as it prevaileth and increaſeth in its growth and ſtrength, it will appear as a roaring devouring Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeking whom it may devour and ſwallow up.</p>
               <p>Here comes in Pride, and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of Spirit, puffed up, with the abundance of injoyment of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, Emulations, Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſings, evil Jelouſies, Bitter-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Detractings, and abundance of evil Fruit ariſeth from this evil Root of Bitterneſs which Root and Fruit is to be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſunk down, under the eternal Judgment of the holy, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſweet Power of the Lord. And therefore Friends, I ſay unto you in the Name of the Lord God eternal, let none give ſtrength, or any incouragement or nouriſhment, any way to this Spirit in any of its murthering workings, in any Heart,
<pb facs="tcp:57915:51"/>
but let it be looked on as a Vagabond, and Fugitive, in the Earth, and ſo as it is kept out of the Camp of God, and from <hi>Iſraels</hi> dwellings, by the ſweet, living, bright Power of the great God of heaven, and earth, it will periſh under Truths Judgement ſet up in every ſoul, and ſo the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, as well as its evil ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and dividing fruits will be worn out, and deſtroyed for ever: And then all keeping in the firſt love, pure fear, living awe, and holy dread fearing to offend our God and tender Father, perſevering in an inward keeping the holy Watch, and abiding in Subjection, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the ſpiritual Croſs, in ſtaidneſs of Mind, ſoundneſs of Judgment, and clearneſs in Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, you ſee, Comprehend and Fathom all the Enemies Devices, Temptations and Snares; and the Lord God beholding you in a ſtedfaſt Habitation of Obedience, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb facs="tcp:57915:52"/>
tenderneſs before him, his Power will deſcend wonderfully in an increaſing manner, and his Glory will ſhine, his River of Life flow; yea, rhe Spring of the great deep will be broken up, and the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Heaven will be opened, that you may be abundantly filled with Joy and Thankſgivings, holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, and Songs of deliverance, with ſpiritual high Praiſes aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Throne, which will be as ſweet Incenſe, and a Sacrifice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to our God. And here you ſhall ſpend the reſidue of your days in Dominion over both the Snares of the Enemy attending Proſperity and Liberty, Adverſity and Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſeeing over all things that have their riſe in Mortality and Time; feeling Mortality ſwallowed up of Life immortal, and ſo gathered to the general Aſſembly, to the Church of the firſt born, to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, yea to the
<pb facs="tcp:57915:52"/>
firſt and laſt, God the Judge of all, to whom be immortal high Praiſes, and holy Renown, for ever and for evermore But if the wonderful Bleſſings, tender Mercies, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing loving Kindneſſes that the Lord God Almighty every way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends unto us in this Age, be not duely, reverently and obediently taken notice of; but inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, any ſhall forſake and be unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Lords tender Mercies, and thereby imbrace lying Vanities, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the ſpiritual Diligence, into a ſpiritual Idleneſs, through which a ſpiritual Slumber overtakes, and the Lamp thereby be inwardly neglected, the ſpiritual Watch and Croſs ſlighted, and not duely regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but the Earth and earthly things take up the exerciſe of the Mind and Affections: Then I ſay, inſtead of injoying what is above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Tribulation and Anguiſh will ſeize upon all ſuch, and the
<pb facs="tcp:57915:53"/>
dreadful Judgement of the eternal God that lives for ever and ever, will overtake all ſuch unfaithfulneſs. A dreadful Cup ye ſhall drink of from the Hand of God, and diſtreſs from the rebukes of the Lord ſhall diſtreſs you; and you ſhall be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people of his Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in his dreadful approaching day of ſignal pleadings with all Fleſh that have corrupted its way before him; and therefore hear, fear, and dread the holy Name of the Lord; and whileſt its called to day bow before him, and ſpeedily return unto him, leaſt your day paſs over, and ye ſleep the Sleep of eternal Death and Deſtruction, and be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated for ever from his refreſhing Preſence, (in which is Life) and from the glory of his divine Power.</p>
               <p>Therefore all dear Friends eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, retire inwardly, ſee, feel and underſtand the Counſel of the Lord which unto you ſprings; all
<pb facs="tcp:57915:53"/>
retire inward (that are not there) in great humility before the Lord, that you may feel the bleſſed Work of God bleſſedly begun, perfecting your inward man, growing in the Root of Life; and as you have profeſſed the Knowledge of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Oracle before the Nations, you may approve your ſelves in the ſight of God, following its Inſtructions in all things, and go not without it; lean upon the Lord, and cry to him to gu de you with his Eye, and lead you by his Arm, and ſo guide you in the way everlaſting; and this is his promiſe whileſt you keep with him, he will be with you, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaving nor forſaking you, if you do not leave and forſake him, his Preſence and glorious Arm of Salvation ſhall ſurround you, to the renown of his Name, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his People, <bibl>Amen, Amen.</bibl>

of our coming hither to <hi>London.</hi> Friend, we came not to thee, to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition any thing from thee in the outward, but in the tender Bowels of Love to exhort thee, to mind thy own condition, how thou ſtandeſt in relation to the Lord God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, who is Powerful, and Pure, and Holy, who will not acquit the Wicked, but will wound the hairy ſcalp of him who goes on in iniquity, before whoſe Preſence all ſtands naked and bare, who knows and ſees all the ſecrets of thy Heart, thy out-goings and in-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to whom thou muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all things done in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whether they be good or evil: Therefore in love to thy Soul were we moved to come to exhort thee to ſtand in the fear of the Lord, and in his Counſel; and to mind the Light in thy Conſcience, which is pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A word more to clear thy miſtake, when we ſpoke unto thee, that the Lord would make thee an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Hand to eſtabliſh the Goſpel; wherein thou apprehendeſt us, that ſhould be eſtabliſhed by an outward Law, that was not our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, nor we ſpoke no ſuch thing; but we witneſs the coming of Chriſt in his Kingdom is not by Might nor Power, nor Pomp, nor Glory from without; nor by any Law which is in the will of Man, but our deſires were, that there ſhould be no Law upon Religion, for it needs no Law to defend it, for pure Religion, and

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57915:61"/>
Seal of our Miniſtry, begotten into a lively hope in Chriſt Jeſus, by the immortal Seed of the Word of God; and ye are our Witneſſes, that we ſeek not our ſelves, but you, nor our own good, but the Glory of our God, and the recovery of his own Image, and the freedom of the Righteous, that the Name of our God may be exalted, and that he may reign over all, and have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in every one of you, that you may witneſs your Head exalted; dwell in the pure eternal Light of Chriſt Jeſus which doth diſcover and make manifeſt all the deeds of darkneſs, and lays open all deceit, and brings it to the righteous Law of God, and ſo condemns Sin in the Fleſh, and ſets up judgment in the Earth, and the Inhabitants thereof learn righteouſneſs; and when this is witneſſed, the Oppreſſor is caſt out, and the Vail is rent, and the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57915:62"/>
bonds of Iniquity is broken, and the Serpents Head is bruiſed, and the Seed of the Woman raiſed, (which all the Promiſes of God are yea and Amen, unto) yea and he fetches up out of time, into the beginning, before Sin was, and leads up into eternity, where time ſhall be no more; and therefore, dear Hearts, all wait in that which you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the Light which comes from Chriſt, that by it you may come to injoy the pure Life, and have Power over all your Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as many as receive him, to them he gives power to become the Sons of God, and gives them victory over the World, to tread and to trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and therefore all of you dwell low; and in the pure fear of the Lord abide, and in his Counſel ſtand, and be faithful in what you know; and imp ove it to the glory of the immortal God, that you may be the

               <p>DEarly beloved Friends in our Head the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, doth my Soul Salute you all, who are faithful in your Meaſures, and obedient to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, which is made manifeſt in you, which being faithful in, will lead you up to Chriſt your Head to exalt him over all in you all, that he may reign whoſe right it is, in you, and that his Scepter of Righteouſneſs maybe ſwayed in you, and the ſtrong man armed may be bound and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of all his goods, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Condemnation, which is Glorious in its time, may be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by you all, that through it you

our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, according to your own meaſures, which you have received from him, that he may be gloryfied by his own. And now dear Brethren and Siſters, I Exhort you, and Warn you, or rather I Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech or Intreat you, that every one of you walk worthy of your Calling whereunto you are called, for Holy is he that hath called you; and he hath called you unto Holineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none ſhall ever ſee God, and take heed that none turn his Grace into wontonneſs, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the Blood of his Covenant, and ſo diſpiſe the day of their Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but prize the time, for it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and while you have the Light walk in it, and ſtrive to make your Calling and Election ſure, for many ſhall ſtrive and ſhall not be able, becauſe they ſtrive amiſs; and take heed that none of you come ſhort of your Crown, in ſitting down by the way, and getting into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion

prehenſion before the Life, and there you build in the Air without a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and is gone away from the corner Stone, and you and your building ſhall periſh together, and therefore all to take heed to the Meaſure of Life, received, that in it you may be found in the day of the Lord, which will be a ſure hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place for you, in the Day of his fierce Wrath, when he comes with ten Thouſands of his Saints, to take Vengeance upon the wicked, and upon all you that hold the Truth of God in unrighteouſneſs; but all you who fear the Name of the Lord, and walk up unto him in a pure Godly Converſation, the Son of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to you is riſen with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under his Wings, and the day of glad Tidings is come unto you, and the Winter is paſt, and the Storms and the Showers is over and gone, and the ſpring time is come, and the Flowers appear upon the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

abide in your Meaſures, for you are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, but if any Man defile his Temple him will God deſtroy, for no unclean thing can dwell with him: And therefore I exhort you all, that you be faithful to the Meaſure of Light, which is pure, it being the guide of your minds, will lead you out of all impurity, and uncleanneſs; for he that is the Light is the Meſſenger of the Covenant, and by his Light ſhining in you, he is come into his Temple, to ſit as a Refiner, and as a Fuller, to purifie the Sons of <hi>Levi.</hi> Now the Light which comes from Chriſt Jeſus being the guide of all your minds, leads you up into Unity with him, from whence the Light comes, and there we are one for evermore, and cannot be ſeparated: Now the Light ſhining in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it maks manifeſt all the dark ways, and rips up Man, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers all deceit and judges it, ſo that

peace and love is kept, and where all Sorrows and Troubles is done away: and for this cauſe was I moved to write unto you theſe few Lines, as an Epiſtle to be read and witneſſed in the Hearts, where you may read me continually in the Meaſure of God, which is but one, in which we own, know, and read one another, where the World knows us not.</p>

ſees God, which no Man can, but the Son declares him, for he ſees him.

Oh, my dear Hearts, my care is, that you grow in the Truth, and that you may keep ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle every one in your Meaſure; take heed of coldneſs and dulneſs in any, but dwell in Authority, and ſpeak in Authory, that deceit may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and baniſhed from among you, that ſo the Pure may be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Truth; none be Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but be Watchful, and Watch one over another in Love, that you may be eſtabliſhed in Righteouſneſs, that the Land may rejoyce, and the Peaceable flouriſh, and all the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous be cut down by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>

And all Friends, take heed of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, for if any draweth back my Soul hath no pleaſure in him: But all dear Friends, preſs forward in the ſtrait way; my Hearts deſire and prayer to the Lord is, that you may grow and increaſe in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of God, and that you may all be Faithful, for there is your Crown. Oh, be Faithful to the end, that you may inherit all things, and be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that which never ſhall have end; and keep in the Croſs daily, which will Crucifie daily, and Mortifie daily your Affections which be upon Earth; for the day of the Lord is approaching, the good and happy day, glad-Tydings to the Priſoner, but a day of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to the Wicked, and to all that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57915:87"/>
live in filthineſs, who profeſs much Love to God with their Mouthes, but the Heart going after Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And a word to all you who are in that condition, who draw near God with your Mouthes, but your Hearts far from him; to you who are convinced of the Truth of God, and denies the Prieſts in words, and come to Meet amongſt the Saints, and ſits like them, but do not forſake your Sins, nor own the Croſs of Chriſt, ſo as to live in it, and ſo you give occaſion to the World, to ſpeak evil of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt; now to ſuch I ſay, from the Lord, Depart ye Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, terrible and dreadful is the day that ſhall come upon you; wo unto them that cover with a Covering, but not of the Spirit of the Lord; Fear the Lord and tremble before him, and prize your time while it is called to day, for the Lord is near, and if he find you eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>I am moved to write unto thee, to ſtand ſtill in the Light which ſhows thee thy wretched ſtate; by that Light, thou comeſt to ſee thy ſelf where thou art, and how thou haſt ſpent thy time: thy knowledge of God and profeſſion of God, now comes to wither, that which thou haſt gathered without, periſheth and ſtands thee in no ſtead; (Now) in that, that ſhows thee thy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wait, that the judgment of the Lord may be made manifeſt in thee upon the head of the wicked, and through judgment <hi>Sion</hi> may be ſet free. Abide in that which is the condemnation of all that's wicked, both within thee and without thee
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57915:98"/>
ſtart not aſide from the judgments of the Lord, for his judgments are righteous, and all his ways are equal; if thou art brought as low as Hell, yea, if thou come to ſay there is no hope, let Patience have her perfect work in thee, and ſtand ſtill and ſee the Salvation of God, and a way will be made beyond thy underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the deliverance of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for the freedom of his choſen, for the bringing of the Priſoner out of the Priſon-Houſe: Now, Friend from the Lord do I ſpeak unto thee, to wait in the Light that ſhews thee thy condition, that thou mayſt know one of the Days of the Son of Man, which came not to ſend peace on the Earth, but a Sword, and to kindle a Fire, and thou wilt love to know his judgments: he comes to ſhut and to open, thy right Eye muſt be pluckt out, and that Eye opened which the Prince of the Air hath blinded in the Chrildren of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.

               <p>DEarly beloved in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Grace, Mercy and Peace be multiplied in you, and among you, that in it you may all be eſtabliſhed, and grow as living Plants, and be fruitful in him that hath called you to Grace and Vertue, that you may live in it, and abound in every good work to the praiſe of the Lord, whoſe love hath been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted amongſt you, and you have heard his Voice, and been Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his Power, and his eternal Love hath been abundant towards you: Therefore all Friends, of your high calling walk worthy, and preſs hard after the Mark, ſo runing that ye
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57915:105"/>
may obtain, every one of you in particular, abiding in the ſtrait way, and in the Croſs daily, which is the delight of the Juſt, and peace and refreſhment to the Juſt in you all, that in the Juſt you may all dwell, and then the earthly comes to dye, and judgment is executed upon the wicked, and the Famine comes on all the Gods of the Earth, and the day of ſeparation and ſorrow upon all the Lovers, and the Mortification of the old Man, and as that dies the Spirit is quickned, and waiting on the Lord every one, your ſtrength comes to be renewed, and your Life refreſhed. So, to you all Friends, Lambs and Babes of God, whoſe minds are ſtaid upon God, their Food you will receive from the living God, and grow every one in your Meaſure, walking as you have received, and priſing the love of God unto you, which hath been and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57915:105"/>
is large and bountiful, who hath ſearched you out, who was ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the cloudy dark day, and found no reſt to your Souls, but wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Mountain to Hill, and laid diſſolate and barren in a waſte how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Wilderneſs, and no eye pitied, but he alone who is mighty to ſave, hath viſited you, and your time was the time of love, and he hath loved you with an everlaſting love, and drawn you in much tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and given his Son for a Light, that you might all walk in it, and have fellowſhip in it: And now my dearly beloved ones, ſtand faſt in that which brings eternal Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and makes free; and be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful every one in your meaſure; to you all I ſpeak as to one, that you may grow in love, and walk in love, and in it be eſtabliſhed, for it will endure for ever; oh! let it be your joy to do the will of God in

all ſingleneſs, and to dwell in his fear, and abide in the daily Croſs, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not, nor conſult not, for the myſtery is hid from that eye; but dwell low, and learn there, that ſubject to the Yoke every one of you may be, and wait upon the Lord, meeting in his fear, watching one over another, and abiding in the Light, that your fellowſhip may ſtand in that which is the Worlds condemnation; my Soul is poured out to the Lord for you, and my Bowels runeth freely to you, in pure love and ſingleneſs, that you may all be preſerved in the pure fear of the Lord, out of the ſnares of the Enemy, that in the eternal Counſel of God you may abide, and be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the hour of Temptation: Dear Hearts, keep every one to your own meaſure, which from the Lord is given unto you, that you may witneſs the preſence of the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57915:106"/>

there was Elders ordained in the Church, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply;</hi> Theſe things proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thy mediate call, or mans Miniſtry; Chriſt is not born by the will of man, and holy men ſpoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt, and no Propheſie came by the will of man; <hi>Paul</hi> a Miniſter and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, not by the, will of man; and that which is highly eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men is abomination in the ſight of God: and there is thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate call, and mans Miniſtery, which the Scriptures ſpeaks not of; what Chriſt did, and the Saints did, was by the Power of God, and the Holy Ghoſt ſpoke to them, no Voice of that is heard in thy mediate call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or mans Miniſtry, therefore denied by them who are guided by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord, who receives not the Miniſtry of man, but by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that's not mans Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:57915:115"/>The Third is, <hi>that we are to ſalute no man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply;</hi> this is thy own, and in thy confutatiou thou anſwerſt thy ſelf; for the Saints Salutation we own, and honour all men in the Lord, which is more than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then do; but we have learned not to faſhion our ſelves according to the World, and to deny the cuſtoms of the Heathen and their flattering Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and vain faſhions, which is without the <hi>fear of God, who have mens perſons in admiration becauſe of advantage, and reſpects mens perſons, and commits ſin;</hi> and a difference do we put betwixt the Saints Salutation, and the vain faſhions and cuſtoms of the Heathen, which <hi>Iſrael was not to obſerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fourth is, <hi>that the Scripture oughe not to be expounded, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of Scripture is an adding to Scripture, and if we add, then God will add to as all the Plagues that are
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57915:116"/>
written therein, and in thy confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaith, Chriſt expounded Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply;</hi> He that adds the Plagues is to be added to him, as it is written; but thy other words is falſe, and thy own, it is your own Imagination of the Scripture which we deny, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as thou haſt done, and adding with thy Envious Spirit againſt the Truth; but that Chriſt expounded the Scriptures was never denied by us, and that he opened <hi>their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to underſtand the Scriptures,</hi> we own and witneſs, and <hi>the Spirit of Chriſt is one in all his Saints;</hi> and for the lye, let it return upon thy own Head.</p>
               <p>Thy Fift is, <hi>That it is not lawful to uſe the title of Maſter to any, and in thy confutation thou ſaith, Chriſt was called Maſter; and where it is ſaid, Be ye not called Maſters, for one is your Maſter even Chriſt, thou ſayeſt, the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57915:116"/>
meaning is not, that it is unlawful to be called Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply;</hi> thou ſhews thy ſelf to be none of Chriſts Servant, who pleads againſt his command, and ſaith, he bad them avoid a thing which was not unlawful, if it be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, its lawful; thou haſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten now to make Scripture thy rule, as for Chriſt being called Maſter, he was and is ſo, and whom he made Miniſters, he made them not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for they had one Maſter, and him we own to be Maſter; and in this thou art a Lyar, and of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who ſaith, we ſay it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to uſe the title of Maſter to any; and we likewiſe ſay, and exhort thereto, that Servants ſhould be Obedient to their own Maſters, not as Men-pleaſers with Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice, but ſerving the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thy ſixt is, That Infant-Baptiſm is no Ordinacne of Chriſt, and therefore of no uſe in the Church
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57915:117"/>
of God; and thou ſaiys, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command thou grants is not to be found; but thou ſaith In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were Circumciſed, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſin is ordained in the room of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply;</hi> We deny it to be an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Chriſt, or that it came in the room of Circumciſion; the Scripture ſpeaks of no ſuch thing as Infant-Baptiſm, and till thou prove it came in the room of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thy ſaying proves nothing: the Male-Children were Circumciſed, In room of what came in your Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Children to be Sprinkled? thou ſpeaks thou knows not what, he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and Baptiſm is by the Spirit, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is that of the Heart, <hi>he that is in Chriſt is an new Creature, born again of Water, and of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſuch are Partakers of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and are Members of the Church, and that which is no Ordinance of</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:57915:117"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt is of no uſe in the</hi> Church of God, <hi>but is by the</hi> Children of Light <hi>denied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thy Seventh head is, <hi>That we ſay, that the Lords Supper is of no uſe in the Church of God, ſince the Reſurrection of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply;</hi> This is an abſolute Lye, never ſpoken or owned by us; I charge thee to prove it either by our words, or writings, or let ſhame cover thy Lips, Lyar for the Lake, and own thy Condemnation for thy Slandring, Lying, and falſe accuſing.</p>
               <p>Thou ſayſt, <hi>It was not thy purpoſe to have writ a Treatiſe of this ſubject till of late, finding that none anſwered the Book before mentioned.</hi>

of <hi>Briſtol</hi> aforeſaid, Iron-monger, taken the two and twentieth day of <hi>January,</hi> 1654. who informeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Oath, that in the Month of <hi>September</hi> laſt, this Informant had ſome diſcourſe in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> with one he calls Mr <hi>Coppinger</hi> an Iriſh man, formerly a School-fellow of his, that came thither purpoſely for his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into <hi>Ireland,</hi> who told this Informant, that he had lived in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> eight or nine years, and had taken upon him the order of a Fryer of the <hi>Franciſcan Company;</hi> and he told this Informant that he had been at <hi>London</hi> lately, for ſome Months, and whileſt he was there he had been at all the Churches and meetings publike and private that he could here of, and that none came ſo neer him as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and being at a meeting of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he there met with two of his acquaintance in <hi>Rome,</hi> the which two perſons were of the ſame <hi>Franciſcan</hi> order and

company that were now become chief <hi>Speakers</hi> amongſt the Quakers; and he himſelf had ſpoken amongſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> about thirty times, and was well approved of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; and this Informant further ſaith, that rhe ſaid <hi>Coppin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> asked him, what kinds of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Religion there was in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and this Informant told him, that there were ſeveral opinions and judgements, and not naming any Opinions of the Quakers; the ſaid <hi>Coppinger</hi> asked him whether there had been any Quakers in <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and the ſaid Informant anſwered him no; whereupon the ſaid <hi>Coppinger</hi> told him (the ſaid Informant) two or three times, that if he did love his Religion and his Soul, he ſhould not hear them, whereupon this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant told him, that he thought none of them would come to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who expreſly replyed, that if this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant would give him five pound,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57915:120"/>
he would make it five Hundred Pounds if ſome Quakers did not come to <hi>Briſtol</hi> within three weeks or a month then following; and on the morrow following, the ſaid <hi>Coppinger</hi> departed from this City for <hi>Ireland,</hi> his Native place, and about eighteen dayes after, there came to this City two Perſons, that bare the name of Quakers: This is a true Coppy of the Information ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon Oath at <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Being the ground of that ſcandalous Paper, put forth by thee <hi>William Prynne,</hi> to it I ſhall anſwer, and clearly make appear, that theſe ſcandals are falſe and full of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Firſt, that they are falſe, it will appear two of us (whom the World reproachfully calls Quakers, came from the North (being moved of the Lord to come to the City of <hi>Briſtol)</hi> our birth and being according to the Fleſh, was in <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> not far from <hi>Kendal,</hi> and there at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57915:120"/>
is our outward Habitations and Families: We came from thence in the Month called <hi>June,</hi> and we came into the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> the 12th day of the Month, called <hi>July,</hi> and on the morrow (being the 13th day) we were at two Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, the one was with the People called <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> the other with the People called <hi>Independants,</hi> and were moved by the Lord to ſpeak at both their Meetings, which we did, and this was the thirteenth day of the Month, called <hi>July,</hi> which was a little before the Fair at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> called <hi>Jame's-Fair,</hi> as ſeveral of thoſe People can bear witneſs. Then further thou ſaith, it being in <hi>September, George Cowliſhaw,</hi> being asked by the ſaid <hi>Coppinger,</hi> if there had been none of thoſe People called Quakers at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> he anſwered no: now this is falſe, ſome of us (who is ſo called) was then at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and here I ſhall take many People to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57915:121"/>
witneſs againſt thee, for we had Meetings then in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the tenth day of the Mouth called <hi>September,</hi> we had a Meeting at the Fort, the thireenth day of the ſame Month, a Meeting at the Red-Lodge in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and at both Meetings there were ſeveral Hundreds of People: and likewiſe a Meeting at <hi>Fieltin,</hi> the fifteenth day of the ſame Month, and the ſeventeenth day we had a Meeting at <hi>Biſhford,</hi> and Hundreds went out of the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> to that Meeting: the nineteenth day we had another Meeting at the <hi>Red-Lodge;</hi> and ſeveral other Meetings we had in about <hi>Briſtol</hi> in the ſame Month, called <hi>September,</hi> which will all bear witneſs againſt thee, that thy ſlander is falſe, and thy Oath falſe, who ſaith we were at <hi>Briſtol</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> which he hath ſaid on his Oath we were not; and here I have proved thy informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion falſe; again, it is full of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57915:121"/>
who ſaith that <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſaid that none came ſo near him as the Quakers, and that he met with two in <hi>London</hi> of his own order, and yet he ſaith to the Informant, if that he loved his Religion and his Soul, he ſhould not hear them, and yet ſaith they came near him, and was of his own order, which is falſe, we deny ſuch Lyers, and their Order, and here he is proved to be in confuſion, let all that can diſcern judge.</p>
               <p>Again, the man that took the Oath (as thou ſayeſt) ſaid that <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi> was one of the Franciſcan company, and had taken upon him the Order at <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Italy;</hi> here the Informant hath made himſelf guilty of, and liable to the Law in ſuch caſes provided, who was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to him, who ſaid he had taken up that Order, and did not diſcover him (but let him go) and then accuſeth thoſe that are Innocent, which bear
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57915:122"/>
the Name of Quakers. Now here thou art made manifeſt, to be a falſe Accuſer, and a Slanderer, I have proved that we came to the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> in the Month called <hi>July,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fair, and likewiſe that we were at thoſe Meetings before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and ſeveral other Meetings we were at, in and about <hi>Briſtol,</hi> in the Month, called <hi>September,</hi> and this Oath before-mentioned, being the ground of a Warrant given forth by the Magiſtrates of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and ſeveral of our Names therein expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, we who had been at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> whoſe names were there mentioned, came all forth of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> near unto <hi>Kendal,</hi> none of us having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been out of the Nation, but we lived and walked in and at our own Habitations, as that Country can bear witneſs to our Places, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and here your Lyes and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are made to appear and utterly denyed; and <hi>William Prynne,</hi> here

thou art clearly detected, who ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt the Innocent, living in the Spawn thou ſpeaks of, the Poiſon of Aſps being under thy Tongue, and ſpuing out thy Venom againſt the harmleſs, and thy Informant is proved to be guilty, in not diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the man he ſpeaks of, which he hath on his Oath ſaid that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to him he had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> and taken upon him the order of a Fryer of the <hi>Franciſcan company.</hi> Now here let all people take notice of the dealings of the Magiſtrates, who gave out a Warrant againſt the Innocent, whom they cannot juſtly prove any thing againſt whereof they do accuſe them, and yet lets him go free, who concealed the ſaid <hi>Coppinger,</hi> which on his Oath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; that the ſaid <hi>Coppinger</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf to be one of that Order; and we deny all of his Order, who lives in lyng and confuſion, or any ſuch to ſpeak amongſt us, for we

for know this, that the Lord God will plead with thee for all thy hard ſpeeches, and juſtly by him ſhalt thou be rewarded; and we utterly deny, and do bear witneſs againſt all ſuch filthy wayes and practiſes of all ſuch Frogs as thou mentions, and againſt thee who prints Lyes, as I have already proved, and Lyars muſt be caſt into the Lake; and here I have found thee, and proved thee in the intoxicated, giddy-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition thou ſpeaks of, who art already deceived, and need be deceived no farther, and thou art fallen into the Pit thou digged, and they for whom thy Net was ſpread (being Innocent) are eſcaped, and thy folly is unmasked, and thou art clearly detected, and proved to be in error in thy very Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo all thy building is made void, and if thou cannot begin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better evidence, let thy Mouth for ever be ſtoped, and let ſhame

               <p>Friend, thy Spirit is ſavoured and tryed, and now this is the end of thy zeal, who art become a Perſecutor of the Life which thou haſt profeſſed in words, and now thy zeal appears without the knowledge of God, and ſo there is many unſavoury ſpeeches in thy Paper, put forth by thee <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Prynne,</hi> which (worth the mentioning) are not; but thou haſt manifeſted the end of thy Profeſſion, who appears now to be one of thoſe giddy, headed <hi>Engliſh</hi> men thou ſpeaks of: and as touching leading, ſilly Women Captive, laden with ſin, and led away with divers luſts, ever learning, and never able to come to

               <p>Thou ſaith, <hi>I except againſt thee for averring that the Quakers are but the ſpawn of Romiſh Frogs, Jeſuits, and Franciſcan Fryers, and to deny this, is alledged that they came out of the North<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thou ſaith to come out of the North is a ſhrew'd ſign <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

perfect Freedom, in the pure and precious Truth of the living God, which as you ſtand in it, and walk in the undefiled way, in the pure Fear and Counſel of God, you will be kept in the pure Unity, in the Love unfeigned, to grow together in the Life of Truth in the Power of God, in which is your beauty, your comlineſs, your ſtrength, your order, and your peace, every one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and one with another, all glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lord in your uprightneſs and obedience in your holy calling, in the meaſure of the Grace of Life, in which every one abiding, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power from the Life, which gives Dominion over the World, and the powers of Darkneſs and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in the high places; you dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Life and Power of God, are kept in ſubjection to the higher Power, which is the Ordinance of God, which throws down the man of Sin, the deceitful works, and

raiſeth up the dead to Life, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſlain, and opening the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Doors, which brings Joy and Peace, and the Oyl of Gladneſs and the Garments of Praiſe, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Year, where the meek come to be beautified with Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; there the Treaſures of Life is ſeen, of Wiſdom, and of Love, which reached to the Poor to raiſe him up, and there the weary finds reſt, and the hungry Soul comes to be ſatisfied, with the unſearchable Riches of the Lords Love, of which there is no End, unto them who wait upon him in faithfulneſs: Dear Hearts, other Foundation can no man lay, then that which is laid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, which is Chriſt Jeſus, the Light of the World, the Way to Life and everlaſting Reſt, and thoſe that believe enter into the pure and peaceable Kingdom, which is prepared for the little Flock, who follow the Voice of the true Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,

who hath ſearched you out, who was ſcattered in the cloudy dark day, and found no Reſt to your Souls, but wandered from Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Hill, and laid deſolate and barren in a waſte howling Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and no Eye pittied; but he alone who is mighty to ſave hath you viſited, and your time was the time of Love, and he hath loved you with an Everlaſting Love, and drawn you in much tender Mercy, and given his Son for a Light, that you might all walk in it, and have fellowſhip in it. And now my Dearly beloved Ones, ſtand faſt in that which brings Eternal Freedom, and makes free, and be faithful eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in your Meaſure; to you all I ſpeak, as to one that you my grow in Love, and walk in Love, and in it be Eſtabliſhed, for it will indure for ever; Oh, let it be your Joy, to do the Will of God in all Singleneſs,

and to dwell in his Fear, and abide in the daily Croſs: Reaſon not, nor conſult not, for the myſtery is hid from that Eye, but dwell low, and learn thee that Subject to the Yoke, every one of you may be, and wait upon the Lord, Meeting in his Fear, watching one over another, and abiding in the Light, that your Fellowſhip may ſtand in it, which is the Worlds Condemnation; my Soul is pouned out to the Lord for you, and my Bowels run freely to you in pure Love and Singleneſs, that you all may be proſerved in the pure Fear of the Lord, out of the Snares of the Enemy, that in the Eternal Counſel of God you may abide, and be ſtedfaſt in the time of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>INſtance if thou canſt, of one out of the Scriptures, that ever came in at the door, that did ever ſue Men at the Law for Tythes, Wages or Eaſter-Recknings; if thou canſt not prove it by the Scriptures, thou art Antichriſt that doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the Doctrine of Chriſt, and no Miniſter of Chriſt, but one of <hi>Baal's</hi> Prieſts; if thou be a Miniſter of Chriſt, and come to my Houſe, what I have I will ſet before thee, and thou ſhalt freely Eat; but to give my Corn and Hay, Calves and Foles, Wooll and Lambs, Geeſe, Hens, Piggs, Eggs, and other things, to be carried to thy Houſe, Chriſt gave no ſuch Command, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould bring ſuch things to his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57915:142"/>
Diſciples, but ſaid, <hi>Freely you have received, freely give, Eat and Drink ſuch as they ſet before you:</hi> And ſo, if you be ſent out by Chriſt to Preach the Goſpel, which Goſpel thou canſt not receive of Man, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, and if thou come to my Houſe, and freely miniſter unto me Spiritual things, I will freely miniſter unto thee Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things; But the Apoſtles, who were ſent into the World to Preach the Goſpel, (which Goſpel they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not at <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> nor by Studying Authors, but ſpoke forth that which they were partakers of, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Will of Man) they did not enquire out a great Benefice, or a Perſonage, and there ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but went up and down, Preaching the Goſpel freely, and did not make it Chargable to any, but ſaid, <hi>We have coveted no Mans Silver nor Gold, God is our Witneſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:57915:143"/>
                  <hi>and you your ſelves know it:</hi> But I know thee to act contrary to them, who would take from me, who have received nothing from thee: And here let the practice of the Miniſters of Chriſt bear Witneſs againſt thee, that thou art no Miniſter of Chriſt, from the Lord God do I charge thee, that thou art no Miniſter of Chriſt, who art out of the Doctrine of Chriſt, and doth not live the Life as they did who was ſent of Chriſt, for they never Sued any at the Law for Earthly things whatſoever; ſhew me one Example out of the Scriptures of any of the Prophets, or Apoſtles, or any of the Miniſters that ever did any ſuch thing, then take it, and follow their Example, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thou ſheweſt thy ſelf openly to walk contrary to all that ever Chriſt ſent, and to Chriſt himſelf and his Commands, and art found in the ſteps of the falſe Prophets &amp; falſe Shepherds, who ſought for their Gain,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57915:143"/>
from their Quarters, as they do that taught for the Fleece, as thou makeſt it appear thou do'ſt, and held up the filthy horrible thing which thou hold'ſt up, the Prieſts bearing Rule by their Means, which is a filthy thing; and the falſe Prophets pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared War againſt them that did not put into their Mouths, as thou do'ſt againſt me, becauſe I do not put into thy Mouth; and here be witneſs againſt thy ſelf, that thou art in the ſteps of the falſe Porphets, and the falſe Teachers, which loved the Wages of Unrighteouſneſs, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Error of <hi>Balaam,</hi> which thou followeſt; and to take Wages from me, for whom thou haſt done no Work, neither did I ever hire thee or ſet thee to work: This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be Unrighteous Wages, to the Light in thy Conſcience I ſpeak; &amp; here let the Life that they lived in, that gave forth the Scriptures, judge thee, and condemn thy practice,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57915:144"/>
for the Holy Men of God did not ſo; therefore give over calling thy ſelf a Miniſter, and either make proof of thy Miniſtry, and walk according to the Example of them that were ſent of God, otherwiſe I do deny thee; and I may not put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Mouth, although thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare War againſt me, for I muſt walk according to the Commands of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, though thou wilt not. Now blame not me, that I walk according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and turn away from proud and Covetous Men, ſuch as thee; for if I ſhould uphold thee in thy ways, which is contrary to the Way of God, I ſhould be guilty of thy Sins, and might pertake of thy Plagues: Now thou art warned, if thou goeſt on in thy Deceit, I am clear of thee, thy Blood be upon thy own head.—And now Friend, ſeeing thou profeſſeſt thy ſelf to be a Miniſter of Chriſt, thou ought'ſt to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57915:144"/>
convince me by ſound Doctrine; and in plain Words, I deſire thee to ſhew and prove, how I became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to thee: For no Man would I hinder of his Right, neither would I owe any thing to any Man, but love: This I do acknowledge, that the Labourer is worthy of his Hire, and the Work-man is worthy of his Meat: Now ſhew when I hired thee, or what Work thou haſt done for me; no Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Nation can force their Wares upon me, contrary to my mind, much leſs take my Goods from me, when I have none of their Ware: When did'ſt thou Plow for me? When did'ſt thou Threſh for me? When did'ſt thou tread out Corn for me? Art thou the Ox that treads out the Corn, whoſe mouth muſt not be muzled; Or art thou one of the evil Beaſts, and ſlow Bellies, who for fi thy Lucre ſubverts whole Hearts, whoſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57915:145"/>
Mouth muſt be ſtoped.—Shew me by what Scripture-ground thou claim'ſt Tythes to be thine; and whether ever the Miniſters of Chriſt took Tythes of the People? And where ever they took by force from them for whom they did not work, and whether the Prieſt-hood be not changed which received Tythes? and whether the Commandment be not diſanulled by which the Prieſts recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tythes? and whether Chriſt be not the end of the Law, which Law made many Prieſts? and whether is not the Law changed as well as the Prieſt-hood? and where did ever Man provide maintenance by a Law for the Miniſters of God? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not the Lord provide for them, and opened the Hearts of People to receive them? and where did any Miniſter of God take by force from them whoſe Hearts were not opened to receive them?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:57915:145"/>
Give me a reaſonable Anſwer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe things; for I would owe nothing but love to any Man, and that which is right according to Goſpel Order, and maintenance allowed by Chriſt, thou ſhalt have povirded if thou prove thy ſelf a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt, and abide in his Doctrine; now ſhew thy ſelf whoſe Servant thou art; for he that abides not in Chriſt's Doctrine hath not God; and ſuch I may not follow nor receive into my Houſe.</p>
               <p>Read this to the People, which thou profeſteſt to be a Teacher unto; and either clear thy ſelf from theſe things, or elſe ſtop thy Mouth and confeſs thy ſelf to be a Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>

               <p>THe good and bleſſed Day of the Lord is come, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Viſitation of Life, wherein
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57915:146"/>
the Light of Righteouſneſs is ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up unto many People, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have received the Bleſſed Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, and are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Heavenly Power, by which they are quickened and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up unto newneſs of Life, to ſerve him, and to follow him in Truth and Righteouſneſs; and the bleſſed Day wherein the Lord Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us, and the notable Works which the Lord hath wrought, and his noble Acts which he hath done, are not by us to be forgotten, but are recorded in our Hearts, as things remarkable and conſiderable, to be remembered by us while we have a being upon the Earth, and that with fear and reverence in our Hearts unto the Lord our God, who is great and mighty, whom we have known to execute Judgment in Righteouſneſs, to the judging and bringing down of that which was once exalted; for when the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57915:147"/>
Year of the Lord came unto us, Judgement was laid to the Line, and the Lord did ariſe to ſhake terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Earth, the loftineſs of man was bowed down, and the haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man was laid low, that the Lord alone might be exalted; and the Earth reeled to and fro, and was removed like a Shepherd's Tent, and the Light of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was as a Fire, and the Holy One as a Flame, to burn up the Thorns and the Thickets in a Day; many Faces ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered paleneſs, and Hearts grew weak, and Knees feeble, and many had their Hands upon their Loins, becauſe of the great Travel that was upon them, becauſe of the mighty Power of the Lord which was made manifeſt in them, for the bringing down of that which had been exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt him, and for the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the oppreſſed Captive, that deliverance might be known from the power of Satan, and from
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57915:147"/>
the bondage of Corruption, that we being ſet free, wherein we were held, might ſerve the Lord in Truth and Singleneſs of Heart, and wait upon him, and follow the leadings of his Spirit, in the exerciſe of our Hearts and minds in Serving and Worſhiping the Lord our God; And ſo the God of Heaven hath revealed and made manifeſt the Way of Life and Peace, the Way wherein Comfort and Satisfaction to the Soul is found, the Gate of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, even the entrance to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom of Reſt and Joy for evermore; which although it be ſtrait and narrow, and a croſs to the fleſhly part, and earthly ground and wiſdom, yet it is eaſie, pleaſent and delightful, living in the Spirit, and becoming little, even as a Child, for ſo muſt he become that enters in at the ſtrait Gate, to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God: So we
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57915:148"/>
have found the way of everlaſting Peace, (through the rich Mercy, and tender Viſitation of the Lord) walking in the Spirit, and living in that which mortifies the deeds of the Fleſh, being ſubject to the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Here is reſt to the Soul; here is the ſweet Viſitations of the Lord known, which are as the former and latter Rain, to refreſh the lowly in Heart, and Poor in Spirit: Here waiting upon the Lord, the ſtrength is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and here the Lord ſpeaks Peace to People, even as they are in Chriſt the Power of God, growing up in him, who is the Truth and the Life, they are poſſeſſors of laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace (which God ſpeaks not to the wicked) which is the Portion of the upright in Heart; and as the Lord hath made manifeſt the way of Peace, Life and everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, he hath alſo diſcovered the contrary, even the way of miſery,
<pb n="981" facs="tcp:57915:148"/>
darkneſs and deſtruction, the way which is broad, and many in the luſts of the Fleſh take pleaſure in it, following the motions of the Fleſh, and the deſires of the carnal mind, reſiſting the motions of Gods good Spirit, and hating the bleſſed Light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo ſpend away their precious time; and in this ſtate, that is to ſay in the Fleſh, reſiſting the Spirit of the Lord, they cannot ſerve God, nor pleaſe him, nor worſhip him in Truth, though they may profeſs him in words, and draw near him with their Mouth; yet being in the Fleſh contrary to the Spirit of Truth, the Ear turned away from hearing of God's Law, their Prayers are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination, their plowing is Sin, their ſacrifice is as <hi>Cain's,</hi> not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the Lord, no Peace from God, no ture Reſt, no Satisfaction, no beholding the Countenance of the Lord, nor no aſſurance of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57915:149"/>
Eternal Inheritance which never fades away, but an earneſt of wrath, pain, miſery, anguiſh and trouble, which will come upon all who live and dye in Diſobedience of the Glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo we ſee the Way of Life to all that believe in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and the way of death to all who live in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and are not changed by the power of God, and tranſlated from Death to Life, and from the Kingdom of darkneſs, into the Kingdom of the dear Son of God.</p>
               <p>And theſe things are of great concernment unto us; and we ſee it is very needful to wait upon the Lord, and to follow the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Spirit, that we may feel his Power to preſerve us in his Will, out of the evil of the World, that ſo in the Power of the Lord
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57915:149"/>
our God we may war a good Warfare, and finiſh our Courſe with joy.</p>
               <p>And verily this a matter of great weight unto us, even to have our hearts exerciſed towards the Lord in obedience to his Will, in what he requireth of us, that we may have a Conſcience void of offence towards him: And ſo the Day of the Lord God being come, and his Eternal Power made known in many hearts, by which many are raiſed to ſerve him, and obey him, yea, to worſhip him according to his own Will, and the leadings of his good Spirit; We are even conſtrained by the Power of the Lord to meet together in his Name and Fear, to wait upon him, and to worſhip him, and alſo to exhort one another in his holy Power, as the Spirit of the Lord directs; yea, and ſo much the more as the day appeareth: And this we find alſo
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57915:150"/>
to be according to the Scriptures of Truth, and practice of the Servants of the Lord in former dayes, who did not forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together, but met often, and ſometime in one place, and ſometime in another, as they were directed in the fear of the Lord: <hi>And they that feared the Lord ſpake often one unto another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a Book of Remembrance was written for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his Name: And they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord, in the day that I make up my Jewels, and I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own Son that ſerveth him:</hi> And this was in a time when the proud were called happy, and they that wrought wickedneſs were ſet up, and they that tempted God were delivered; yet even in ſuch a time did they that feared the Lord ſpeak often together, and alſo in the time
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57915:150"/>
when the Goſpel of Chriſt was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Jeſus, many were brought into the obedience of the Truth, and were gathered from the <hi>Jews</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and way of ſervice, [and they, to wit, the <hi>Jews,</hi> could plead more juſtly for the Antiquity of their way of Worſhip, and their order in their Worſhip, then many who this day profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, and a reformed Church] and in that time did they meet together, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in a Chamber, ſometime in an Houſe, and ſometime in an upper Room, as the Lord directed them, and as they had opportunities; and gathered Churches which met at Houſes, and waited upon the Lord, and exhorted one another, and might all ſpeak one by one, as the Spirit of the Lord led them, that all might hear, and all be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fored.</p>
               <p>And we do not read that the <hi>Jews</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:57915:151"/>
made a Law, (or the <hi>Romans</hi> either, who at that time had the Principality) that they ſhould not meet above four together, or if they meet five, or above, they ſhould be fined.</p>
               <p>Indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> who believed not, were bad enough, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Saints from City, and haled out of Houſes they that profeſſed the Name of Jeſus, and ſometimes ſcourged them; but they are evil examples to be followed, and its pitty that any who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, ſhould do the like to any that meet together in the Fear of the Lord, to ſerve him, and walk peaceably in Godlineſs &amp; Fear.</p>
               <p>And why may not more than four meet together lawfully to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, in the account of God and all juſt men? why may not Ten? Yea, and Why may not a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and more? Provided ſtill it be to Worſhip God, and ſerve him. And why may not alſo ſome come
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57915:151"/>
in amongſt them who are Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that are ignorant of the way of Truth, that they may come to hear, and learn, and be convinced of all; and go away, and confeſs that God is there of a Truth; and if there be more that come upon the ſame account, it is alſo appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Sure that was a great Concourſe of People, when the Diſciples were met in one place, where three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were pricked to the Heart at one time. Had it been juſtifiable in the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time to hinder ſuch gatherings of People together, or ſuch Speakers as were, who ſpake as the Spirit of the Lord gave them utterance? The <hi>Jews</hi> were very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them, and commanded them to ſpeak no more in the Name of Jeſus; but they obeyed God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than man, and ſpoke boldly the Word of the Lord, and the Lord was with them, yea, and filled
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57915:152"/>
their Hearts with joy and comfort, though ſometime they were put in the Stocks, and ſometime in Priſon.</p>
               <p>So we do verily find both by the the Teſtimony of the Spirit of God in our Hearts, and alſo by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Scriptures, That our meeting together to Worſhip the Lord, and to wait upon him, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of God, and alſo to the practice of the Saints in former days; and although we be of the ſuffering-ſide, as the Saints were in times paſt, yet we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the Will of the Lord to give up unto him in all theſe things: And ſurely if they that cauſe us to ſuffer, did but diligently mind and conſider their way and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons which they go on in, and war with, they may find themſelves to be on the perſecuting-ſide, and ſee the Saints did not ſo, neither War with ſuch Weapons; for the Saints Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57915:152"/>
were not Carnal, but Spiritual, and mighty through God, to the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of ſtrong holds; for 'tis the ſpiritual Weapons that can and doth conquer the man of ſin within, and can ſubdue every high thought and imagination, and bring under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is contrary to the Will of God: 'Tis the Eternal Word of the everlaſting God that is quick and powerful, ſharper than any two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged Sword, which divides within, where no carnal Weapon can divide: And if any think we be not in the Way of the Lord, let them come forth with ſpiritual Weapons, or with the beſt they have, laying aſide all carnal Weapons, Club and Staff, Force and Compulſion, for that will never overcome a ſpiritual Enemy; it may kill outwardly, but cannot kill ſpiritual wickedneſs; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth with theſe Weapons, this is like men that profeſs Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and would be far more comely
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57915:153"/>
amongſt the ſober and honeſt-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed People, and far more like to the Saints, then haling out of Houſes by force with earnal Weapons, and caſting into Priſon for no other thing but owning the Doctrine of Chriſt, and meeting together to Worſhip God.</p>
               <p>And then this is offered as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Argument; There is a Law made lately, that will not allow you, and if you do, we muſt fine you, or we muſt take your Goods, or commit you to Priſon, or cauſe you to forfeit your Eſtates: Therefore we charge you give over, if not, we muſt proceed againſt you, and break your Meetings with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weapons.</p>
               <p>Oh! where is the Spiritual Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, the Power to convince gain-Sayers, Goſpel-Miniſters that went forth without Club or Staff; for ſay we, convince our Conſciences, or elſe we dare not do it; for we may not
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57915:153"/>
diſobey the Lord becauſe of theſe things.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Well, then</hi> (ſay they) <hi>you will be ruinated; have you no Wiſdom? will you ſpoile your ſelves with theſe things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> More is the pity, (ſay we) that we may not ſerve the Lord, and Worſhip him; but ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings will he exerciſed upon us by a people that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, and reformed ones too: Well, we ſay we muſt commit our cauſe to the Lord, and even give up all to him, who knows how to deliver the righteous out of all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Obj. Ay, <hi>but</hi> (ſay they) <hi>cannot you meet four, and no more?</hi>

               <p>And for being of a Hundred Years ſtanding, this adds no ſtrength to it at all, for the <hi>Jews</hi> Religion was far more ancient, and yet being in the Perſecuting nature, and reſiſting the Holy One and the Juſt, though they profeſſed God with their Mouth, yet that would not cover them, nor will it cover people now, to profeſs God with their Mouth, while they are found in the Nature, Steps and Practice of them who Perſecuted the Saints and Servants of God in Ages paſt.</p>
               <p>And for that which is ſaid, That we are but of late Years; We ſay, Men are not true Chriſtians by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, neither by an outward Profeſſion, but by an inward Change in the Heart, wrought by the Power of God in the Regeneration. And ſo if it be but a few Years in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, ſince we, or any of us were
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57915:167"/>
changed and turned to the Lord, yet it was in the time when the Lord was pleaſed, and ſaw good to viſit us, and we can truly ſay it was an acceptable day and time when we were turned from Darkneſs to the true Light, and from the power of Satan to God: And we are glad of it, and can ſay, Bleſſed be the Lord for it, if it had been but yeſterday, that any of us were renewed in the Spirit of our minds to God; for it is matter of Joy to us, that the Lord hath gathered us in our day and time, from off the barren Mountains, into his Fold, to wait upon him, and to receive teaching and ſatisfaction from him: This is far more to us to know the Lord changing us in our day, and bringing us to know the things that pertain to our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Peace, than to have a large Profeſſion of the Saints Words, and yet to be out of the Saints Life, and out of the way where true Peace and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57915:167"/>
Reſt is found to the Soul; and ſo the Lord having manifeſted his Truth to us, and brought us into the Religion, in which he manifeſts his Preſence to us, we are content to wait in the Will of the Lord, and may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our Religion, nor the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of our ſelves together, becauſe Man ſaith to the contrary, but walk according to the Gift of God, by which only it is that true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Service is performed unto him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, we meet together to wait upon the Lord; that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences may be kept clear towards him, that we may have the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which if we ſhould walk contrary to that which the Lord hath made manifeſt, here would be ſhipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience; for ſo it was formerly, if any forſook the Lord and his Truth after they had taſted of his good Word, if they fell away from that which they had once
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57915:168"/>
known and profeſſed of the Truth and Goſpel of Jeſus, they made ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of Faith and a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and then they could not have the anſwer of a good Conſcience, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they Peace with God, and what remained if they continued ſo, but a certain fearful looking for of Judgement and fiery Indignation, which will devour? And therefore we knowing the preciouſneſs of the anſwer of a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, do prize it, and eſteem it as a Jewel of great worth; and we may not forſake the Way of the Lord, wherein we have the anſwer of a good Conſcience (becauſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Force) and go into that in which we ſhould ſuffer Anguiſh, and have a certain fearful looking for of Judgment, and a ſting in our own Conſciences; therefore we can put it to all who fear the Lord to judge of, if it be not ſafe for us to abide in the Way of the Lord, and to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57915:168"/>
to him, though we may meet with Sufferings in this World.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, we meet together in the Fear of the Lord, and own the doctrine of Chriſt to live in it, becauſe we are perſwaded in the Fear and Power of the Lord God of Life; who is our ſtrength, that nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the Love of God which we have in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> our Lord: the Love of God is ſo Comfortable, and his Favours is ſo refreſhing to us, and the Teſtimony of his Spirit is ſo ſatisfactory in our Hearts, that we are perſwaded, nothing will be able to ſeparate us; our Strength is in the Lord, and he is all-ſufficient to keep us through all, by his mighty Power, unto the end; waiting upon him, and abiding in his Power, he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt; and this were the Saints formerly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded off, that nothing ſhould be able to ſeparate them from the Love
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57915:169"/>
of God, and they met with many hardſhips, and were oftentimse cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated, and ſhamefully handled, as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> declare; yet through all the Lord was with his people, and comforted their hearts in their following of him, and the Love of God abounded to them and in them, and they were Conquerors through him that loved them. Now if any at that time denyed the Truth for fear of man, or any other thing, they came to ſuffer in their hearts, and to feel ſorrow in their inward man; for when iniquity enters into the heart, it darkens the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and alſo the creature loſeth the ſence of the Love of God; and if there be not Repentance, and a returning unto the Lord, Iniquity grows more ſtrong, and love grows cold in ſuch, and the heart grows worſe and worſe, and is hardned by degrees againſt the Lord and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and then there is a ſeparation
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57915:169"/>
from the Love of God, and the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and earneſt of ſorrow and tribulation upon every one that doth evil; therefore we are perſwaded that it is ſafe for us to wait upon the Lord in the way which he hath made manifeſt unto us, that ſo we may receive the Power to renew our ſtrength, that we may walk on in the Path of Life, and nothing ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from the Love of God which we have in Chriſt Jeſus. Shall tribulation, or affliction, or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, or Powers ſeparate us from the Love of God?

the Power of God, that his Love and Life, bleſſing, and heavenly Preſence may be with us: Better to ſuffer out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in Priſons, and Holes, and have the Love and preſence of the Lord with us, then to diſobey the Lord, and walk contrary to his gift, and ſo ſuffer inward anguiſh and ſorrow of heart, and ſome thing ſeparate us from the Love of God, and then who can ſpeak peace to us, if the Lord ſpeak trouble? but if the Lord ſpeak peace, it's no matter though man may ſpeak trouble; though the wrath of man may riſe high, yet he that doth whatſoever he will in Heaven and in Earth, he can make it to turn to his Praiſe, and the reſt of it he will reſtrain; and bleſſed are they that have the Lord with them, on their ſide; he ſpeaks peace to them in the midſt of all, his love refreſheth our Hearts, and ſo to put all out of doubt, we are perſwaded in the Power of the

Lord, that nothing will be able to ſeparate us from the Love which we have in our Saviour; and here it is good to abide, and not to give one Foot back, to give any ground unto the Enemy, but to continue where the Love of God is with us, and his bleſſed Preſence with us comforting our Hearts, which people do not find with them in diſobedience, walking and acting contrary to what the Lord hath made manifeſt to them; and ſo we can put it to the Conſciences of all People who have any ſence of the Love of God in their Hearts, Whether it can be ſafe for us to forſake the Way of peace and reſt which God hath made manifeſt unto us, and in which we have the Love of God with us, and to go into a Way by force, into which the Spirit of the Lord doth not lead us, where we ſhall find an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and ſorrow, and ſomething ſeparating us from the Love of God,

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57915:172"/>
that God knows the Heart of every one, yet lie looks for Fruit alſo to be brought forth, that we may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. It is recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that there were many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſought againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> but they could find none againſt him, except it were concerning the Law of his God, and they that hated him, conſulted to get a Decree, that none ſhould ask any Petition of God or man for thirty dayes, ſave of the King; if he did, he was to be caſt into the Den of Lyons: and the Decree was ſealed according to the Law of the <hi>Meades</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> Now it cannot be denied but <hi>Daniel</hi> might have prayed to God in his heart, and his evil-wiſhers have known little of it; but he was taught by the Lord to pray openly, and to confeſs unto him, that he was great, mighty and powerful. And ſo though the Decree was ſealed, he (as if he regarded it to not) went
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57915:172"/>
and prayed to his God three times a day upon his knees, with his Window open, and his face towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo held forth his Teſtimony, and bore witneſs to the Lord, that he was worthy to be ſought unto, and that he was not to be limited (by an outward Decree, though a ſtrong one) from praying and calling upon the Name of the Lord, and the Lord vvas vvith him; and though he ſuffered the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of being caſt into the Lyons Den, yet the God of Heaven was his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, and he held forth a precious Teſtimony, and God was much glorified; for it was ſaid, yea, and proclaimed through many Nations, that all ſhould fear and worſhip the God of <hi>Daniel,</hi> for there was no other God that could ſave in ſuch ſort.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But now if any ſhould ſay,</hi> Theſe were Heathen Kings, and ſo not to be obeyed.</p>

And ſurely, for theſe things will the Lord Viſit, and in the mean time we find that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57915:174"/>
the Lord requireth it of us, to be faithful to him in what he hath made manifeſt unto us, that we may bear a true Teſtimony, and faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Truth, and for the Lord, that he may glorifie himſelf by us; for we are not our own, but his, who hath formed us, and called us to follow him.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe we are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that their Practice in their Miniſtry, is not according to the Practice of the Miniſters of Chriſt, but according to the practice of the falſe Prophets, and falſe Apoſtles which the Scripture teſtifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>

for they deny the Light of Chriſt, which lighteth every Man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the World, to be ſpiritual and ſufficient to guide in the ways of Peace; and this is contrary to Chriſts Doctrine and his Apoſtles; again they ſay, all that ever people do, is Sin, while they are here, (though Saints) and people muſt never have freedom nor victory, over Sin while they live upon the Earth; and this is contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles: They ſay all they do is Sin, their beſt Actions are Sin, their Prayers are Sin, (to this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) therefore they are not the Prayers of the Upright, which God delights in, nor were they ever ſent of God, whoſe Prayers and beſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Sin, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

together, do that which they ought not to have done, and leave undone that which they ought to have done, ſo are breakers of their Covenants and Vowes made in their Baptiſm, which promiſed that they would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh, &amp;c.

               <p>IN the Eternal Fountain of Love we Salute you all, even with the ſame Love, wherewith our Father hath loved us, the ſame flows out to you all, to that which is of God in you, to that we ſpake, and to that we are made manifeſt, even to that of God in all your Conſcinces, read in that, and it will witneſs our love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you all: Dear Hearts, dear and pretious you are unto us, as you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the pure Light of Jeſus Chriſt which he hath enlightned you withal, in that we have Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with you, and in that you will ſee our dear love to you all, even ſuch love as the World knows not, for it far exceeds the Love of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: Oh, we cannot forget you, for you are our Epiſtles, written in our Hearts: for we ſee you daily,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57915:193"/>
and our Deſires to the Lord are for you, that you may ſtand in his Counſel, and in his Will, and in the daily Croſs, which will crucifie you to the world, and the world to you, and will make a ſeparation in you, and ſeparate you from the world, and draw yon out of it: For your Hearts being in the world, you are Enemies to God, and Strangers to the Covenant of Grace; for the Promiſe is not to that which flees the Croſs, but to that which ſtands in the daily Croſs; for all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God are Yea and Amen, to the Seed; but there is no Promiſe to that which turns away from the pure into the carnal (from the Light by which you may come to witneſs your Redemption from the world) into the Earth, where the Curſs is, and where the Woe is; for the Woe is to them that do inhabit the Earth, and ſo all whoſe hearts are in the Earth, and in the Fall, and turned
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57915:193"/>
away from the pure Light are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the woes, and under the curſe, and in the invention, and in the witch craft, and ſorcery; and here are all they who have received the Light which is pure, and have turned from it into the carnal; here is the Dog, and the Swine which was waſhed which is turned to the Vomit, and to wallowing in the mire, and they who turn from the pure may which leads to Life turned into <hi>Cain</hi>'s way, and <hi>Balaam</hi>'s way, and <hi>Judas</hi>'s way, but we hope bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things of you, and ſuch as accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Salvation, for we are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that you will not put your hands to the Plow, and look back, for then you are not fit for the Kingdom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife, and hold faſt that which you have received, and walk in that which is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and dwell in that which judges and condemns for ſin, for that leads out of Sin into the pure Paths
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57915:194"/>
of Righteouſneſs, and ſo the man of Sin is deſtroyed, and the powers of Darkneſs removed, the Captive redeemed, and the Priſoner ſet free and the Cords of iniquity cut, and the Bonds broken, and that which is impriſoned and lead captive, is brought into Captivity, and judged and condemned by the Light: ſo dwelling in the Light the righteous come to flouriſh, and the pure come to grow, and the Dead come to live, for the Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and he that hears ſhall Live, and ſo Life comes to death, and ſo the one lives in the death of the other, for there is no reconciling of them, for the one lives in the death of the other, there is no communion between Light and Darkneſs, betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Belial,</hi> and therefore read within, and ſee who is Head, and who rules, and hath Dominion, and let the Light of God ſearch and try you;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57915:194"/>
that ſo no Thief nor Enemy to your Souls may lodge within you, but by the Light you may be judged, and condemned: Dear Hearts we are with you in the pure Life, and our Bowels are turned within us for you. Yeſterday, we were with you, and broken, and melted in remembrance of you, it was the firſt Day of the week when we were at the Meeting in <hi>Cheſter,</hi> our loves run out to you, and the remembrance of you melted us, and we think we ſaw it melting and breaking you; Oh! the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God of Life throw down all his Enemies in you, that he himſelf may rule and reign in you, that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs may run down as a ſtream, and Eqnity as a mighty River, that that we might ſee the fruit of our Labours, and the diſires of our Souls anſwered, which is the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Righteous Seed in every one of you, that ſo the Eternal God of Power my be honoured, and he
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57915:195"/>
alone glorified, and your Souls edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and nouriſhed, which is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire of us who truly love you in the Eternal Love of God. Dear Friends, we hope we need not exhort you to meet together, we think you do meet often in the Fear of the Lord, and there to wait upon him in the Light, and there you will find the Power of the Lord manifeſted to you, and in you, to the throwing down of ſtrong holds of Sin and Iniquity, and to Kill and Crucifie the old nature, and to raiſe up the pure Eternal Life in you, for by the Power of the Lord the dead are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Life; and ſo waiting every one in your Meaſure, in Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Patience, and in the Godly Fear, you will come to ſeeth e freſh Springs opened, and the pure Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life made manifeſt in you, and ſo you will ſee the Rocks rent, and the Earth removed out of its place, and the Mountains melted, and the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57915:195"/>
tall Cedars bowed down, and all that is exalted laid low, and the Lord alone exalted in you in that Day: (Dear Hearts) let us hear from you with what ſpeed you can, and the Eternal and everlaſting rich Love of our Father overſhadow you, and keep you in the hour of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you may ſtand ſtedfaſt and unmoveable in the Eternal Strength, and Power of the Lord, and in his Light to keep, that you may ſee the Tempter and his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and ſo you may eſcape them: So that the mighty Power of the Eternal only Wiſe God, keep and preſerve you all, and give you Dominion of, and over all the Beaſts of the Field, and Fowls of the Air, that you may reign above the World, and tread upon it, to his own everlaſting Praiſe and Glory, <bibl>Amen.</bibl>
               </p>
               <p>Farewel, (Dear Hearts) our Life is with you, and as you grow into
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57915:196"/>
the Life you are near and dear unto us, for the Life is but one; ſo we ceaſe to writ, but ſtill we are with you, (our Dear Ones) our Love is great unto you, you may read it in the Light, and feel it in the Life: Farewel, yours in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Love.

will of man, which were made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters not by the will of man, and they witneſſed that no Propheſie of the Scripture in old time came by the will of man, neither was it of any private Interpretation, but holy men of God did ſpeak as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt; the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved, which is but one; and all who be in their own will, and have the Scriptures, and make a Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, which came not by the will of man, are in the Blaſphemy and Perſumption, the Unpardonable Sin, and with the Light of Chriſt, which hath enlightened every one that cometh into the World, with that Light ſhall they be condemned, that hate it, and live in your own wills; and ſo the Unity is in that which condemns the World, and all that live in their own wills, which come not by the will of man; for they who live in their own wills, and make a Profeſſion of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57915:198"/>
there are the Sects and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and there is no Unity, and they have not Unity among the Sects, but only in nature a Oneneſs, but in their meaning they have not Unity, in their meaning in the Letter, yet one in Nature that which comes not by the will of man, but is contrary to his will, and contrary to all the World, and overturns them, which is according to that of God in all Conſciences, in that we have Unity, which ſhall Teſtifie againſt every mans Face, when he acts contrary to it, and with it he ſhall be judged and condemned in his own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Underſtanding; And you all walking in the Light it will bring you all to Plainneſs, and Pureneſs, and Singleneſs of Speech, which will make the deceit to tumble, and the myſtery of iniquity to ſhake, which lodgeth in the Temple of God, and ſits there where it ought not, and is exalted above that which

Women ſee all their actings done in time, and hating this Light is their condemnation, and all loving this Light, and walking in it, you come to walk in that which is the World's Condemnation, and ſhall condemn the World from God, from Chriſt, and all who are of God; To you all this is the Word of God, which is againſt all mens wills, that in that which is contrary to the wills, you may all wait and walk, for that will lead you from all your thoughts and deſires, and with it you ſhall have them all judged, there wait and you will witneſs the Birth born, not by the will of man, and this is Heir of another World, and Heir of the certain Riches, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to that of God in all Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; ſo to you all to uſe plain words, and plainneſs of Speech; ſo to you all this is a Warning from the Lord, who are in the Light, and love the Light which Chriſt hath

enlightned you withall, which is contrary to your wills, and to all mens wills, that with it you may uſe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Speech to all, to be made manifeſt to that which they hate, which is their condemnation, and ſhall condemn the World from God, from Chriſt, and all who are of God: To you all this the Word of God, which is againſt all mens wills, that in that which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to your wills, you may all wait and walk, for that will lead you from all your thoughts and deſires.</p>
               <p>And you all in the Light which Chriſt hath enlightned you withal abide, ſo in him you will abide in Chriſt, who is the Vine, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one will come to witneſs the Branch abiding in the Vine, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under the Vine. So to you all this is the Word of the Lord, which is not no go among the World, which hate the Light, but to Friends, that you may come to uſe plainneſs
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57915:200"/>
of Speech; this was I moved of the Lord to ſend out amongſt you, as a Meſſage, to all Plants of the Lord; if you ſpake any thing contrary to the Light which Chriſt hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned you withal, with the Light you are to be condemned; and if you do not ſpeak when you are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and live in the Light, and walk in the Light, with the Light you are to be condemned, and if you do ſpeak Experiences, and not dwell in the Light, but in Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and Preſumption, and Envy, without the Fear of God, thou art to be thrown down, and with the Light condemned from God, and woe upon thy Head from God and Chriſt proceedeth, thou Hypocrite, art to be thruſt out with the Light, and judged with the Light, and all who are in the Life, and with the Life. Therefore in the Light dwell, and walk every one in particular, then you will all have Unity one
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57915:201"/>
with another, and grow up to be Trees of Righteouſneſs the Planting of the Lord.</p>
               <p>We are not of many Religions which is no true Religion; but of one Religion, which is the true Religion, which hath not been by us taken on by Imitation, but gathered into it by the Eternal Spirit, and it planted in us by the ſame Spirit; And we are not known, nor can be by any thing, but by that which we live in, which was in the beginning, which is not ſubject unto time, but which comprehends all time, and that which hath its rize in Time. So if any would us know, and our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they muſt come to live in the ſame, for none knows us but who are with us in the Unity, in that which was before Time, which neither had Beginning, nor ſhall have End, in that we comprehend all Sects and Opinions, and ſee their Rice and Foundation; And from
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57915:201"/>
the Life which was before they were, we declare againſt them all, for by it, out of them all, we are come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which was before their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and by it we judge their Foundation, and their Actions, acted by the Principles which with God hath not unity, which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of God hath victory &amp; domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over. So he that would us know, and our Religion, muſt come out of many things into one, to abide in it, and walk in it only; and as he knows God, he will know us, who are of him; and as the man of Sin is caſt out in him, which makes a ſeparation, ſo will he have Unity and Fellowſhip with God, and with us, in that unto which the will of man is contrary, and doth oppoſe (which Will) muſt be caſt out, for it cannot inherit or enter, but keeps in the Enmity againſt the Seed of God, which is oppoſed, where the Head of the Serpent is
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57915:202"/>
not bruiſed, but where the Serpents Head is bruiſed by the Seed of the Woman, the Enmity is ſlain, and the Seed raiſed, and the Seed is the Head, and the Head is exalted; and he that witneſſeth this hath U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with us, and in it we rejoyce together, and our Joy no man can take from us, for he reigns which hath overcome the world, and gives the Victory over the World, by which Spirit we bear witneſs againſt the World, that the Deeds thereof are Evil; Therefore are we hated and reproached by the World, but this is our Riches.</p>

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57915:206"/>
within the Prieſts Gates which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Tythes: but by this Law, by which your Prieſts receive Tythes, you help the Prieſts to make many Beggars, which is contrary to the Scriptures, and that of God in the Conſcience both, and by that Law many Righteous ones ſuffer; all who own Chriſt in Life, ſuffer by your Law, and are oppreſt; and all your Laws acted contrary to that of God in the Conſcience; that of God in the Conſcience will teſtifie, and witneſs againſt you, and your Laws, and witneſs the Law of God, which is according to that in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is perfect, and endures for ever.</p>
                  <p>You that Swear, deny the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that bought you, and his Doctrine; and you that compel men to give Tythes, and you that take them, are men that deny the Lord Jeſus Chriſt come in the Fleſh, the ſubſtance; you that ſue men at
