            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat at firſt I made choiſe of this argument, I haue not as yet repented me for if the Muſe haue not much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſed me, it was moſt worthy to haue found a more worthie Pen then mine owne; for the <hi>Barrons warres,</hi> (omitting the qualitie of thoſe Armes, whereof I haue not heere to ſpeake) were ſurely as well for their length in continuance, as for their manifold bloodſhed, and multitude of horrid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, meet matter for trumpet or tragedy. Therefore, as at firſt the dignitie of the thing was the motiue of the doing, ſo the cauſe of this my ſecond greater labour was the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient handkung of the firſt, which though it were more then boldneſſe to venter on ſo noble an argument without leiſure, and ſtudie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent, either of which trauell hardly affoords; yet the importunitie of friends made me, contrarie to mine own iudgement, take, vndertakem &amp; publiſh it, ſo as the world hath ſeene; but herein I intend not to be too exact, as if ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it needed too much excuſe (knowing, that euen as it was it ought to haue paſſed for better then ſome would ſuffer, who can hardly thinke any thing hath ſauour but their own, though neuer ſo vnſauoury) or as if I ſhould ſeeme now to haue excelled my ſelfe, and failing in my hopes, be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe. <hi>Grammaticaſters</hi> haue quarreled at the title of <hi>Mortimeriados,</hi> as if it had beene a ſinne againſt <hi>Syntaxis</hi> to haue ſubſcribed it in the ſecond caſe, but not their idle reproofe hath made mee now abſtaine from fronting it by the name of <hi>Mortimer</hi> at all, but the ſame better aduiſe which hath cauſed me to alter the whole; and where before
<pb facs="tcp:10437:3"/>
the ſtanza was of ſeauen lines, wherein there are two cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plets, as in this figure appeareth.
<figure/>
the often harmonie thereof ſoftned the verſe more then the maieſty of the ſubiect would permit, vnleſſe they had all bin Geminels, or couplets. Therefore, (but not without faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the whole frame) I choſe <hi>Arioſtos</hi> ſtanza, of all other the moſt complete and beſt proportioned, conſiſting of eight, ſix interwouen, and a couplet in baſe.</p>
            <figure/>

The Soſtin hath Twinnes in the baſe, but they detaine not the Muſicke nor the Cloze (as Muſitians terme it) long enough for an Epicke Poeme; The ſtanza of ſeauen is touched before; This of eight both holds the tune cleane through to the baſe of the columne, (which is the couplet, the foote or bottome) and cloſeth not but with a full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the care, for ſo long detention.</p>
            <p>Briefely, this ſort of ſtanza hath in it, maieſtie, perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſoliditie, reſembling the pillar which in Architecture is called the Tuſcan, whoſe ſhaft is of ſix diameters, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of two. The other reaſons this place will not beare, but generally all ſtanzas are in my opinion but tyrants and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, when they make inuention they their number, which ſometime would otherwiſe ſcantle it ſelfe. A fault that

And though (heroicall) bee properly vnderſtood of demi-gods, as of</hi> Hercules <hi>and</hi> Aeneas, <hi>whoſe parents were ſaid to be, the one celestall, the other mortall, yet is it alſo transferred to them, who for the greatneſſe of minde come neere to Gods. For to bee borne of a celeſtiall</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubus, <hi>is nothing elſe but to haue a great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſpirit, farre aboue the earthly weakneſſe of men; in which ſence,</hi> Ouid <hi>(whoſe imitator I partly profeſſe to bee) doth alſo vſe Heroicall. For the ſecond, ſeeing none to whom I haue dedicated any two Epiſtles, but haue their ſtates ouer-matched by them, who are made to ſpeake in the Epiſtles, howeuer the order is in dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet in reſpect of their degrees in my deuotion, and
<pb facs="tcp:10437:83"/>
the cauſe before recited, I hope they ſuffer no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing euery one is the first in their particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, hauing in ſome ſort, ſorted the complexion of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to the character of their iudgements to whom I dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them, excepting onely the blamefulnes of the perſons paſſion, in thoſe poynts wherin the paſſion is blamefull. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch manifeſt diffrence being betwixt euery one of them, where, or howſoeuer they be marſhalled, how can I be iuſtly appeached of vnaduiſement. For the third, becauſe the worke might in trueth be iudged brainiſh, if nothing but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous humor were handled therein, I haue enter-wouen matters historicall, which vnexplaned, might defraude the minde of much content, as for example, in Queene</hi> Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites <hi>Epiſtle to</hi> William de la Poole,

If they be as harmeleſly taken, as I meant them, it ſhall ſuffice to haue only touched the cauſe of the title of the Dedications, and of the Notes, whereby emboldned to publiſh the reſidue, (theſe not being accounted in mens opinions reliſhleſſe) I ſhall not laſtly be afraide to beleeue and acknowledge thee a gentle Reader.</hi>

Some ſay this vſe began by the</hi> Heroes <hi>&amp; braue ſpirits of the old world, which were deſirous to be thought to patronize learning; and men in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall honour the names of thoſe braue Princes. But I think ſome after, put the names of great men in their bookes, for that men ſhould ſay there was ſome thing good, only becauſe indeed their names ſtood there; But for mine owne part (not to diſſemble) I find no ſuch vertue in any of their great titles to do ſo much for any thing of mine, and ſo let them paſſe.

Though the ſmalnes of his eies full of a ſhining moiſture, as it tooke away ſome comelineſſe; ſo it argued much ſharpnes of vnderſtanding, and cruelty mingled togither. And indeed <hi>George Buccanan</hi> (that imperious Scot) chargeth him and other Princes

That picture which I haue ſeen of hers, was ſuch as ſhe roſe out of her bed in the morning, hauing nothing on but a rich mantle caſt vnder one arme ouer her ſhoulder, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a chaire on which her naked arme did lie.
