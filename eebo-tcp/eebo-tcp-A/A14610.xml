            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>This yeare doubtlesse shall haue foure Quarters.</l>
            <l>Prime time, Sommer, Haruest, and Winter,</l>
            <l>And thereto hath granted Master <hi>Iohn Spinter.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>We finde by the calculation of the Sphaere:</l>
            <l>That you shall haue foure Termes this yeare.</l>
            <l>Two in Winter, and two in Sommer,</l>
            <l>Wherein many honest men haue great comber.</l>
            <l>If our diuination seeme not worth a straw:</l>
            <l>Then aske our Masters, the men at the Law.</l>
            <l>Which had rather heare of <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall:</l>

These Quarters in deed, shall make such variety:</l>
            <l>Some Drunken men, wot not where they be.</l>
            <l>As for the Weather, it shall be mutable,</l>
            <l>And Womens mindes much variable.</l>
            <l>Winter colde, and Sommer hot:</l>
            <l>Sometimes it shall raine, and sometimes not.</l>
            <l>Sometimes Snowe, except great maruaile:</l>
            <l>Sometimes Mist, and sometimes Haile.</l>
            <l>Yea, and the Planets shall cause such weather,</l>
            <l>That it shall shine, and raine altogether:</l>
            <l>But where, and when, and how it shall be,</l>
            <l>In what part and Coast of each Countrey:</l>
            <l>By <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Pisces,</hi> I finde it perfectly,</l>

               <l>Shall be much giuen, to Thunder and winde.</l>
               <l>One reason is, which Doctors doe marke well,</l>
               <l>Milke shall not be so deare as Muskadell.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> shall haue so strong a regiment,</l>

               <l>How if that Aprill had hapt in May,</l>
               <l>Ostlers should make but small bottles of Hay.</l>
               <l>Also it had beene a hot yeare for Bees,</l>

This yeare they say it will begin in Iune,</l>

               <l>Be it moyst or dry, it proceeds of the ayre,</l>
               <l>But if it be not soule it shall be faire.</l>
               <l>In Sommer the Sunne such heate shall giue,</l>
               <l>That none may take vp water with a Siue.</l>
               <l>Yet if the Moone keepe her course aright:</l>
               <l>The Sunne with vs shall not shine at midnight.</l>
               <l>For <hi>Mars</hi> is rough, and <hi>Venus</hi> is milde,</l>
               <l>And therefore an olde Knaue is no Childe.</l>
               <l>When the Sunne and Moone are in Coniunction,</l>
               <l>Hard hearted folkes shall want compunction.</l>
               <l>But when the Sunne is in opposition,</l>
               <l>Many shall be full of bad condition,</l>
               <l>Diuers of the Planets are inclined to heate,</l>
               <l>Men shall not be colde as long as they sweate.</l>

               <l>And though <hi>Cancer</hi> be crooked, yet as I weene,</l>
               <l>In most parts Sommer shall be greene.</l>
               <l>But considering the heate, some will not shrinke,</l>

               <l>Then were a blacke Sheepe a perilous beast.</l>

            <l>Some Doctors thinke, great fires shall not be,</l>

            <l>My reason is, that fewell and Cole,</l>

Harbourlesse, Idlenesse, Pride and Nicenesse,</l>

            <l>Little worke, losse of time, scoffing and mocking:</l>
            <l>Plenty of quarrelling, and of Gamesters flocking;</l>

            <l>Also by the enticement, and working of Sathan,</l>

            <l>The want of good liuing, grace and mercy,</l>
            <l>Of loue and true faith, of peace and of pitty.</l>
            <l>Of friendship, of ioy, of truth and of concords:</l>

            <l>I doubt all vertues, and these are all odd.</l>
            <l>Money with many, this yeare shall be dainty,</l>
            <l>But they shall lack nothing, that haue great plenty.</l>
            <l>Therefore who so hath spent their thrift in waste,</l>
            <l>By the course of stars, they shall haue leaue to fast.</l>

            <l>That many loue well to goe to good feasts:</l>

            <l>Such as haue enough, shall haue more still,</l>

            <l>As for Corne and victuall, I put no doubt,</l>

            <l>Ye shall haue plenty of Brawne and of Sowce,</l>

            <l>Though Monkes and Friers be not in Cloysters,</l>

            <l>In Lent shall be larges of red Herrings and Sprats,</l>

            <l>Which is by reason, the Doctors strongly admit,</l>

            <l>Yet fooles haue good fortune, I cannot denie,</l>
            <l>Though they haue no more wit then they occupie,</l>
            <l>And though Quailes this yeare be very dainty,</l>

            <l>And rifer then either Capon or Goose,</l>
            <l>For some shall haue Woodcocks at home in their house.</l>
            <l>Wherefore I say some shall want, and some haue,</l>
            <l>And all because some will spend, and some will saue.</l>
            <l>But he that hath all thing, nothing shall lacke,</l>
            <l>And he that hath nothing, shall goe to wracke:</l>
            <l>In the heat of Sommer, many shall thinke,</l>
            <l>That Claret wine with Borage, is a cup of good drinke.</l>
            <l>Reapers and Rakers, of Corne and of Hay,</l>
