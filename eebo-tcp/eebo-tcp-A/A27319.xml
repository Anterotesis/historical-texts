            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </byline>
            <l>HOw we shall please ye now I cannot say;</l>
            <l>But Sirs, 'Faith here is <hi>News from Rome</hi> to day;</l>
            <l>Yet know withal, we've no such PACKETS here,</l>
            <l>As you read once a Week from Monkey <hi>CARE.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But 'stead of that Lewd Stuff (that clogs the Nation)</l>
            <l>Plain Love and Honour; (tho quite out of Fashion;)</l>
            <l>Ours is a Virgin ROME, long, long, before</l>
            <l>Pious GENEVA Rhetorick call'd her Whore;</l>
            <l>For be it known to their Eternal Shames,</l>
            <l>Those Saints were always good at calling Names:</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Scarlet Whores</hi> let'em their Wills devise,</l>
            <l>But lete'm raise no other <hi>Scarlet Lies;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>LIES that advance the <hi>Good Old Cause,</hi> and bring</l>
            <l>Into Contempt the PRELATES with the KING.</l>
            <l>Why shou'd the <hi>Rebel Party</hi> be affraid?</l>
            <l>They're <hi>Ratts</hi> and <hi>Weazles</hi> gnaw the <hi>Lyon's</hi> Beard,</l>
            <l>And then in IGNORAMUS Holes they think,</l>
            <l>Like other Vermin, to lie close, and stink.</l>
            <l>What have ye got ye <hi>Conscientious Knaves,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With all your <hi>Fancy'd Power,</hi> and <hi>Bully Braves?</hi>

            <l>Were <hi>Knaves</hi> before; to which you've added <hi>Fools.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Now I dare swear, some of you <hi>Whigsters</hi> say,</l>
            <l>Come on, now for a swinging <hi>TORY PLAY.</hi>

            <head>EPILOGUE to the Same,
Spoken by the Lady SLINGSBY.</head>
            <l>FAir Ladies, pity an unhappy Maid,</l>
            <l>By Fortune, and by faithless Love betray'd.</l>
            <l>Innocent once.—I scarce knew how to sin,</l>
            <l>Till that unlucky Devil entring in,</l>
            <l>Did all my Honour, all my Faith undo:</l>
            <l>LOVE! like <hi>Ambition,</hi> makes us Rebels too:</l>
            <l>And of all Treasons, mine was most accurst;</l>
            <l>Rebelling 'gainst a KING and FATHER first.</l>
            <l>A Sin, which Heav'n nor Man can e' e forgive;</l>
            <l>Nor could I <hi>Act</hi> it with the face to live.</l>
            <l>My Dagger did my Honours cause redress;</l>
            <l>But Oh! my blushing Ghost must needs confess,</l>
            <l>Had my young Charming Lover faithful been,</l>
            <l>I fear I'd dy'd with unrepented Sin.</l>
            <l>There's nothing can my Reputation save</l>
            <l>With all the <hi>True,</hi> the <hi>Loyal</hi> and the <hi>Brave;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Not my Remorse, or Death, can expiate</l>
            <l>With them a Treason 'gainst the <hi>KING</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Some Love-sick Maid perhaps, now I am gone,</l>
            <l>(Raging with Love, and by that Love undone,)</l>
            <l>May form some little <hi>Argument</hi> for me,</l>
            <l>T' excuse m' <hi>Ingratitude</hi> and <hi>Treachery.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Some of the Sparks too, that infect the <hi>Pit,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>(Whose Honesty is equal to their Wit,</l>
            <l>And think <hi>Rebellion</hi> but a petty Crime,</l>
            <l>Can turn to all sides Int'rest does incline,)</l>
            <l>
               <hi>May cry</hi> 'I gad I think the Wench is wise;</l>
            <l>'Had it prov'd Lucky, 'twas the way to rise.</l>
            <l>'She had a <hi>Roman</hi> Spirit, that disdains</l>
