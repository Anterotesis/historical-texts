         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with any of you, yet ſome <hi>Conferences</hi> have left
me not without hope that you might ſee your Errour
about the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> and
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the chief Point on which

<hi>Infallibility</hi> in their Determinations. Certainly, theſe
two Points which are the Pillars of the Religion of the

from which <hi>Errours,</hi> which are pernicious to your Souls,
<pb facs="tcp:119447:3"/>
if I could contribute any thing, I ſhould count it a part
of my happineſs, of which I ſhould have ſome hopes
were it that I perceived you free from the Impoſition of
your Leaders on you, not to reade ſuch <hi>Writings</hi> as are
againſt them; which muſt of neceſſity <hi>enſlave</hi> you to
their <hi>Opinions,</hi> and hinder you from an impartial Search
after Truth: wherein what deceit is uſed by your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<hi>Paſtour</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> may appear, as by many other
things, ſo eſpecially by the late carriage of Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
the tenth in the Controverſies between the <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi>
and <hi>Moliniſts</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who being importuned to
give Sentence concerning the five Propoſitions of
<hi>Janſenius</hi> (if we may believe <hi>Thomas White</hi> one of
your chief Diſputants, and one whoſe approbation is to
this Manual of Controverſies of <hi>H. T.)</hi> did in ſhew
condemn <hi>Janſenius</hi> his words, but did allow his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And that I may not be thought to miſreport him,
I will ſet down his words in his <hi>Appendicula</hi> to his <hi>Sonus
Buccinae,</hi> about the Cenſure of the five Propoſitions of
<hi>Janſenius, Sect.</hi> 9. where after he had ſhewed that the
Propoſitions of <hi>Janſenius</hi> might be true in their ſenſe,
though the words were liable to Exceptions, he adds,
<hi>But whereto are all theſe things ſaid? Is it that I might
enervate or reprehend the Popes Decree? Nothing leſs: I
profeſs, that was publiſhed by the beſt Counſel and ſpecial
guidance of the Holy Spirit which governs the Church.
The Church was afflicted with Diſſentions: one part ſtood
propped by the Truth and Authority of holy Scripture; the
other being guarded with the multitude of Princes, and of
the common People circumvented with the ſound of words
flattering humane weakneſs, took great courage. What
ſhould the Father of the Church do? He allayed the more
unquiet part by granting them their words: the more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb facs="tcp:119447:4"/>
part he flatteringly comforted, by commending to them
their Senſes. The former part of the Saying was confirmed
by a publick Inſtrument. The later (if there be any credit to
be given to men of tender conſcience) was done before the
Oratour of the moſt</hi> Chriſtian <hi>King. It is manifeſt by what
hath been ſaid, with what rectitude of Faith and Divinity
this part ſhines; that that exhibites prudence worthy the
Pope, thus take it.</hi> Wherein it may be perceived, that
however <hi>White</hi> ſpeak favourably of the Pope, yet he
ſets out his dealing in that buſineſs as unworthy an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Judge of Controverſies, which ſhould have <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided</hi>
openly for <hi>Janſenius, whoſe Propoſitions ſtood prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by the Truth and Authority of holy Scripture according
to their meaning, which</hi> Innocentius <hi>the tenth commended
to them,</hi> that they might hold them ſtill in that meaning
in a Conference; and yet he condemned their Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in their words by his Bull publiſhed to quiet the
wrangling and potent party of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> that had drawn
the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>common People</hi> to their ſide by words
that flattered humane weakneſs in ſtead of Truth glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
God, than which in ſo weighty a matter what
could be done more like a <hi>Juggler</hi> or <hi>man-pleaſer</hi> than a
Servant of God conſtant in aſſerting Truth? Which
ſhews, that the <hi>Popes</hi> reſolve not by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> or
the <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> but by humane <hi>policy,</hi> as it may be for
their <hi>advantage,</hi> to keep their party in <hi>obedience</hi> to them.
And that it is not indeed any <hi>ſincerity</hi> in ſeeking Truth,
or <hi>ſerious intention</hi> to feed the Souls of People with <hi>true
Doctrine,</hi> but to accommodate all their Determinations
and Negotiations, as to uphold their credit &amp; authority,
might be made abundantly appear by the Hiſtory of the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and many other ways, which I ſhall
not mention, being ſhewed by many, and particularly by

of God, and the Damnation of Souls
ſuch deplorable things, as tolerate not a laughter in the
ſtanders by, it would ſeem one of the moſt ridiculous things
in the World, that a man of ſeeming wiſdom ſhould be a
<hi>Papiſt,</hi> and that ſo many Princes, and learned men, with the
vulgar multitude, ſhould be able ſo far to <hi>renounce</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate</hi>
their <hi>Reaſon</hi> while they are awake: And a <hi>Papiſt</hi>
would be deſcribed, to be one that ſets up his underſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:119447:6"/>
to be the laughing-ſtock of the ſober rational World. There
are abundance of Controverſies among Phyſicians that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
mens lives; and yet I have heard of none ſo vain, as
to ſtep forth and challenge the Authority of being the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Decider of them, or to charge God with folly or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
if he have not appointed ſome ſuch univerſal Judge in
the World, to end all Controverſies in matters of ſuch
weight. But if in <hi>Phyſick's,</hi> Law, or any of the Sciences,
the Controverſies ſhould be never ſo many or ſo great, if yet
you could reſolve them into ſenſe it ſelf, and bring all to the
judgement of mens eys, and ears, and taſte, and feeling,
who would not laugh or hiſs at him that would ſtill make
them the matter of ſerious doubts?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> finding that man is yet imperfect, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
but in part, and that in the Scripture there are <hi>ſome
things are hard to be underſtood,</hi> and that Earth hath not
ſo much Light as Heaven, imagine that hereby they have a
fair advantage to plead for an univerſal terreſtrial Judge,
and to reproach God, if he have appointed none ſuch, and
next to plead that their <hi>Pope</hi> or his approved <hi>Councils</hi> muſt
needs have this Authority. And when they come to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
they are not aſhamed to ſee after ſo many hundred
years pretenſions, that the World is but <hi>baffled</hi> with the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
name of <hi>a Judge of Controverſies,</hi> and that Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are no leſs Difficulties ſtill, and Controverſies are no
where ſo voluminous as with them. But this is a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with them. Their Judge ſeems much wiſer when he is
ſilent than when he ſpeaks. When he comes to a Deciſion,
and formeth up thereby the <hi>Hodge-podge</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> they
ſeem not to ſmile at, nor be aſhamed of the Picture which
they have drawn; which is, of an Harlot ſhewing her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs,
and committing her lewdneſs in the open Aſſemblies,
in the ſight of the Sun. They openly proclaim their ſhame
<pb facs="tcp:119447:6"/>
againſt the light of all the acknowledged Principles in the
World, their own or others, and in oppoſition to all, or almoſt
all that is commendable among men. The charge ſeems
high, but (in a few words) take the proof.</p>
            <p>1. They confeſs the Scripture to be the Word of God:
and yet when we would appeal to that as the Rule of
Faith and Life, or as a divine Revelation, in our Diſputes,
they fly off, and tell us of its obſcurity and the neceſsity of a
Judge. If they meet with a <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> they
ſeem for a while to be zealous for the Scripture: But tell
them that <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26, 27, 28. doth call it <hi>Bread</hi>
after the Conſecration, no leſs than three times in the three
next Verſes, and then Scripture is non-ſenſe to them till the
Pope make ſenſe of it. It is one of their principal labours
againſt us, to argue againſt the Scriptures ſufficiency to this
uſe. By no means can we prevail with them to ſtand to the
Deciſion of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>2. They exceſsively cry up the <hi>Church,</hi> and appeal to its
Deciſion: and therefore we might hope, that here if any
where, we might have ſome hold of them. But when it comes
to the Point, they not onely diſown the judgement of the
Church, but impudently call <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Spouſe a Strumpet,
and cut off (in their uncharitable imagination) two or three
parts of the univerſal <hi>Church</hi> as <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
The judgements of the Churches in <hi>Armenia, Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia,
Egypt, Syria,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and many more beſides
the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> is againſt their
<hi>Popes</hi> univerſal <hi>Vicarſhip</hi> or <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> and many of
their Errours that depend thereon. And yet their judgement
is not regarded by this Faction. And if a third or fourth
part (ſuch as it is) of the <hi>Univerſal Church,</hi> may cry up
themſelves as the Church to be appealed to, and condemn the
far greater part, why may not a tenth or a twentieth part do
<pb facs="tcp:119447:7"/>
the like? Why may not the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> the <hi>Novatians,</hi> or
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> (much more) do ſo as well as <hi>Papiſts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. They cry up <hi>Tradition.</hi> And when we ask them, How
we ſhall know it, and where it is to be found, they tell us,
principally in the profeſsion and practice of the preſent
Church. And yet when two or three parts of the univerſal
Church profeſs that Tradition is againſt the <hi>Papal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
and other Points depending on it; they caſt Tradition
behinde their backs.</p>
            <p>4. They cry up the <hi>Fathers:</hi> and when we bring their
judgements againſt the ſubſtance of Popery, they ſometime
vilifie or accuſe them as erroneous, and ſometime tell us,
that Fathers as well as Scripture muſt be no otherwiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
than their <hi>Church</hi> expoundeth them.</p>
            <p>5. They plead for and appeal to <hi>Councils;</hi> and (though
we eaſily prove that none of them were univerſal, yet ſuch as
they were) they call them all <hi>Reprobate,</hi> which were not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by their Pope, let the number of Biſhops there be never
ſo great. And thoſe that were approved, if they ſpeak
againſt them, they reject alſo, either with lying ſhifts denying
the approbation, or ſaying, the acts are not <hi>de fide,</hi> or not
<hi>conciliariter facta,</hi> or the ſenſe muſt be given by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Church, or one ſuch contemptible ſhift or other.</p>
            <p>6. At leaſt one would think they ſhould ſtand to the
judgement of the Pope, which yet they will not: for ſhame
forbids them to own the Doctrine of thoſe Popes that were
<hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Infidels</hi> (and by Councils ſo judged): And
others they are forced to diſown, becauſe they contradict their
Predeceſſours. And at <hi>Rome</hi> the Cardinals are the Pope,
while he that hath the name is oft made light of. And how
infallible he is judged by the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Venetians;</hi>
how <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth was valued by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and by
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is commonly known.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:119447:7"/>
7. But all this is nothing to their renunciation of <hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
even of the <hi>common ſenſes and reaſon of the
world.</hi> When the matter is brought to the Deciſion of their
eys, and taſte, and feeling, whether <hi>Bread</hi> be <hi>Bread,</hi> and
<hi>Wine</hi> be <hi>Wine,</hi> and yet all <hi>Italy, Spain, Auſtria, Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
&amp;c.</hi> cannot reſolve it; yea, generally, (unleſs ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<hi>Proteſtant)</hi> do paſs their judgement againſt their ſenſes,
and the ſenſes of all ſound men in the World; and that not
in a matter beyond the reach of ſenſe (as whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> be
there ſpiritually) but in a matter belonging to ſenſe, if any
thing belong to it; as whether <hi>Bread be Bread, &amp;c.</hi> Kings
and Nobles, Prelates and Prieſts, do all give their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that all their ſenſes are deceived. And is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for theſe men than <hi>to know any thing?</hi> or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
between us and them to be decided? If we ſay that
the Sun is light, or that the Pope is a man, and Scripture le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
or that there are the Writings of Councils and Fathers
extant in the World, they may as well concur in a denial of
all this, or any thing elſe that ſenſe ſhould judge of. If they
tell us that Scripture requireth them to contradict all their
ſenſes in this point; I anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. Not that Scripture before mentioned, that calleth it
<hi>[Bread]</hi> after the Conſecration, thrice in the three next
Verſes.</p>
            <p>2. And how know they that there is ſuch a Scripture, if
all their ſenſes be ſo fallible. If the certainty of ſenſe be not
ſuppoſed, a little Learning or Wit might ſatiſfie them, that
Faith can have no certainty. But is it not a moſt dreadfull
judgement of God, that Princes and Nations, Learned men,
and ſome that in their way are conſciencious, ſhould be given
over to ſo much inhumanity, and to make a Religion of this
brutiſhneſs, (and worſe) and to perſecute thoſe with Fire
and Sword, that are not ſo far forſaken by God, and by their
<pb facs="tcp:119447:8"/>
reaſon? and that they ſhould ſo ſollicitouſly labour the perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of States and Kingdoms for the promoting of ſtupidity
or ſtark madneſs.</p>
            <p>8. And (if we go from their Principles to their Ends, or
Ways, we ſhall ſoon ſee that) they are alſo againſt the <hi>Unity
of the Church,</hi> while they pretend this as their chiefeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
to draw men to their way. They ſet up a corrupted
Faction, and condemn the far greater part of the <hi>Church;</hi>
and will have no unity with any but thoſe of their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Subjection: and fix this as an eſſential part of
their Religion, creating thereby an impoſsibility of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
concord.</p>
            <p>9. They alſo contradict the Experience of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Saints; aſſerting that they are all void of the Love of
God and ſaving Grace, till they become ſubject to the Pope
of <hi>Rome;</hi> when as the Souls of theſe Believers have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the Love of God within them, and feel that
Grace that proveth their Juſtification. I wonder what kinde
of thing it is that is called Love or Holineſs in a Papiſt,
which Proteſtants and other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have not, and what
is the difference.</p>
            <p>10. They are moſt notorious Enemies to Charity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
moſt of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World to Hell, for being out
of their ſubjection.</p>
            <p>11. They are notorious Enemies to Knowledge under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> and avoiding <hi>Hereſie.</hi>
They celebrate their Worſhip in a Language not underſtood
by the vulgar Worſhippers. They hinder the People from
<hi>Reading</hi> the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> (which the ancient Fathers
exhorted men and women to, as an ordinary thing.) The qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of their Prieſts and People, teſtifie this.</p>
            <p>12. They oppoſe the <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>divine Worſhip,</hi> ſetting
up a multitude of humane Inventions in ſtead thereof, and
<pb facs="tcp:119447:8"/>
idolatrouſly (for no leſs can be ſaid of it) adoring a piece of
<hi>conſecrated Bread</hi> as their God.</p>
            <p>13. They are Oppoſers of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> both by the foreſaid
enmity to Knowledge, Charity, and purity of Worſhip, and
by many unholy Doctrines, and by deluding Souls with an
outſide hiſtorical way of Religion, never required by the
Lord, conſiſting in a multitude of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping
of Angels, and the Souls of Saints, and Images,
and Croſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let Experience ſpeak how much the Life
of Holineſs is promoted by them.</p>
            <p>14. They are Enemies to common <hi>Honeſty,</hi> teaching the
Doctrines of Equivocations and Mental Reſervations, and
making many hainous ſins venial, and many of the moſt
odious ſins to be Duties, as killing Kings that are excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
by the Pope, taking Oaths with the foreſaid Reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and breaking them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Doctrine,
<hi>Montaltus</hi> the <hi>Janſeniſt,</hi> and many of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy
have pretty well opened it: and the Pope himſelf hath lately
been fain to publiſh a condemnation of their <hi>Apology.</hi>
And yet the power and intereſt of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
among them, is not altogether unknown to the
World.</p>
            <p>15. They are Enemies to <hi>Civil Peace</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
(if there be any ſuch in the World) as their Doctrine
and Practiſe of killing and depoſing excommunicate
Princes, breaking Oaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhews. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that will
go a middle way, gives the Pope power <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alia,</hi>
and indirectly to diſpoſe of Kingdoms, and tells us,
that it is unlawfull to tolerate heretical Kings that propagate
their <hi>Hereſie,</hi> (that is, the ancient Faith.) How well Doctor
<hi>Heylin</hi> hath vindicated their <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Laterane</hi> in this,
(whoſe <hi>Decrees</hi> ſtand as a Monument of the horrid treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Doctrine of the Papiſts) I ſhall, if God will, hereafter
<pb facs="tcp:119447:9"/>
manifeſt: In the mean time, let any man reade the words
of the Council, and judge.</p>
            <p>And now whether a Religion that is at ſuch open enmity
with 1. Scripture, 2. The Church, 3. Tradition,
4. Fathers, 5. Councils, 6. Some Popes, 7. The
common ſenſes and Reaſon of all the World, even their own,
8. Unity of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> 9. Knowledge, 10. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Believers, 11. Charity, 12. Purity of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
13. Holineſs, 14. Common Honeſty, 15. And
to Civil Government and Peace (which might all eaſily be
fully proved, though here but touched) I ſay, whether ſuch a
Religion ſhould be embraced and advanced with ſuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and violence, and mens ſouls laid upon it, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
before us. And whether it ſhould be tolerated
(even the propagation of it, to the damnation of the peoples
ſouls) is now the Queſtion which the juggling <hi>Papiſts</hi> have
ſet a foot among thoſe that have made themſelves our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers:
and there are found men among us, that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> and godly, that plead for the ſaid Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
(and conſequently for the delivering up of theſe
Nations to Popery, if not to <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or other foreign Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers)
which if they effect, and after their contrary Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
prove ſuch Traitors to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his Goſpel and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
as they leave the Land of their Nativity in miſery,
they ſhall leave their ſtinking names for a reproach and
curſe to future Generations; and on ſuch Pillars ſhall be
written, <hi>[This pride, ſelf-ſeeking, uncharitableneſs, and
ſchiſm hath done.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thou marvel, Reader, that the learned Authour of this
Book and I, do joyn thus againſt the common Adverſary,
after our own Differences in the <hi>one</hi> point of <hi>Infant-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi>
thou doſt but marvel that we are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and
have not made ſhipwrack of our Faith and Charity; and on
<pb facs="tcp:119447:9"/>
the account of our Imperfections and little Differences, caſt
away our ſalvation and the Churches peace. Be it known to
you that we are ſome years elder than when our Differences
begun: and therefore if we have made no progreſs in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
we are unexcuſable. And we know that he that is
ſtrongeſt in holy Love, is ſtrongeſt in Grace. Marvel not
then if we get ſome little increaſe by the opportunities and
mercies we poſſeſs; and if we forget not, that we are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the ſame <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Heirs of the ſame Kingdome,
(where we hope to live in perfect Love) when we draw
nearer to it, and ſee that long we cannot be thence; and
when we ſee what havock the Devil hath made in the
Churches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Souls of multitudes ſeemingly
religious, by uncharitableneſs and Schiſm. I am ſure the
Soul that is moſt for <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> is likeſt to thoſe that
are in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This alſo is my Anſwer to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that I know will
make it my Reproach, that <hi>I hold ſo much Communion
with</hi> Anabaptiſts; that is, that I am not as uncharitable
and ſchiſmatical as they, that confine the Church to their
deluded Faction. We own nothing in each other that we
diſcern to be evil; but we unanimouſly practiſe ſo far as we
are agreed. If ſin have left <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> any
hopes, the Lord have mercy upon a divided ſelf-deſtroying
Generation, and ſuffer not the ſins of men profeſsing godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to drive away the Goſpel, and ſend it to <hi>America,</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi>'s ſad conjecture in his <hi>Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.)</hi>
And, O that Profeſſours of Godlineſs would conſider,
both, what they have done, and how much of Holineſs doth
conſiſt in <hi>Charity, Unity,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and leave not to the
Papiſts the temptation or honour, of ſeeming more <hi>unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi>
and <hi>peaceable</hi> than we, leſt they ſeem to themſelves
and others more <hi>holy</hi> than we. <hi>Experience</hi> and <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119447:10"/>
will leave us the moſt unexcuſable people under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
if we prevent not our own and the Churches ruine, by
a ſpeedy, diligent return, to <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> As theſe
are the thoughts which I judged moſt neceſſary on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to communicate, ſo are they the matter of my daily
Prayers.</p>
            <p>Reader, the times require thee to be well verſed in the
Controverſies with the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> If thou love thy Faith and
Soul, be not lazy; but as there are multitudes of excellent
Treatiſes at hand againſt Popery, be not through negligence
a ſtranger to them. And among others, in this <hi>Treatiſe</hi>
thou wilt finde the Adverſary ſolidly confuted, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his Reaſonings detected, (which briefly I did in his
moſt material parts, in my <hi>Key for Catholicks.)</hi> And
among the many excellent Treatiſes, againſt them, with
which Shops and Libraries abound, I commend to the
Countrey Reader, that would ſee much in a little room, and
know the true grounds of confuting <hi>Popery,</hi> two little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes,
<hi>viz. Dr.</hi> Challoner's <hi>Credo Sanctam Eccleſiam Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicam,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Peter Moulin</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>Cotton</hi>'s
Queſtions, with the Queſtions and Challenges annexed.
And for Arguments againſt Toleration of Popery, Dr. <hi>Sutliffe</hi>'s
Anſwer to the Lay Papiſts Petition for Toleration, and <hi>Gabriel
Powel</hi>'s Anſwer to the ſame. Whoſe ſide the Scriptures are
on, reade a little Book called, <hi>The abatement of Popiſh Brags</hi>
by <hi>Alexander Cook.</hi> Reade alſo their own <hi>[Catholick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratour,
proving Proteſtants no Hereticks]</hi> and <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Judge or Moderatour of the Moderatour, by</hi>
John <hi>of the Croſs,</hi> &amp;c. Shortly I hope you may have
Dr. <hi>Peter Moulin</hi>'s excellent <hi>Treatiſe of the Novelty
of Popery,</hi> tranſlated by his Reverend Son, and now going
to the Preſs. The Lord grant, that mens refuſing to receive
the Truth in the Love of it to their Salvation, and their
<pb facs="tcp:119447:10"/>
baſe ſubjecting it to their pride and worldly intereſts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
not God to give them over to believe ſuch Lyes as are
here detected, and to withdraw the Goſpel from an unworthy
Nation. <hi>Amen.</hi>

to <hi>have clearly demonſtrated the truth of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Religion,</hi> by which he means the Roman opinions, branched by him
into 28 Articles; the truth of which he hath no otherwiſe demonſtrated, than
by ſhewing that there is no truth in them: Which will appear by conſidering
that the two chief Points of the Roman Religion, diſtinct from the Proteſtant,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119447:12"/>
are, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Supremacy, and Tranſubſtantiation of the Bread
and Wine in the Euchariſt, into the very fleſh and blood of Chriſt which he
had of the bleſſed Virgin. Now if he believe himſelf, that he hath clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
the truth of theſe by Texts of holy Scripture, Councils of all
Ages, Fathers of the firſt 500 years, common Senſe and Experience: yet
there is ſo little ſaid by him that carries a ſhew of proof of either; or rather
there is ſo much in his own Writing as gainſays it, that were there not a ſpirit
of error which doth poſſeſs men, they would not believe him. For, that he
hath not clearly demonſtrated the truth of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Supremacy
over the whole Church, is apparent, in that he hath not demonſtrated clearly
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy, there being no Texts brought by him, <hi>Art.</hi> 7. to prove it,
but <hi>Epheſ. 2. 20. Matth. 16. 18. John 21. 16, 17, 18. Luke 22. 31. Matth.</hi> 10. 2.
<hi>Mark 3. Luke 2. Acts</hi> 1. of which the very firſt proves, that other Apoſtles
were Foundations as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore the term <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>rock, Matth.</hi>
16. 18. proves not the whole church ſo built on <hi>Peter,</hi> as that thereby he is
declared Supreme viſible Head over them, or over the whole church, any
more than other Apoſtles were. Nor doth <hi>feeding the ſheep</hi> of Chriſt, prove any
other Supremacy than was in the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> commanded to do the ſame,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and by <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, as a fellow-Elder with them, required of

Nevertheleſs for the undeceiving of thoſe who are willing to be undeceived, I
ſhall examine his Writing, and ſhew that he hath not at all demonſtrated the
Roman Doctrine to be true, nor anſwered the Proteſtants objections; and
that the true Fathers, Prophets, and Apoſtles, and Teachers in the next Ages
to them, have not taught the now Roman opinions, but the contrary.</p>

                  <p>LEtting paſs other things in the Epiſtles, with the approbation and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of thoſe of his own way, as being no better than a kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement

party, I ſhall onely take notice of that paſſage in his Epiſtle to the Reader,
in which he ſaith, but not truly, <hi>It is agreed by all parties, that the Church
founded in Chriſts blood, was the onely miſtris of Divine Faith, and ſole repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of all revealed truths, at leaſt for an age or two.</hi> For this is not true of
the church, but of Chriſt his Apoſtles, and their <hi>preaching and writings.</hi>
And therefore it is not true, which he thence infers, that <hi>the controverſies of
the Church are the moſt important doubtleſs of all others,</hi> or that <hi>on the notion
and eviction of her authority, all other points eſſentially depend for their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and deciſion;</hi> which in effect is as if he had ſaid, Were there not a Pope
and his council, the Scriptures would be ineffectual to know the revealed truths
of God, and to decide any controverſies in Religion, which I count little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than blaſphemy; nor doth he well to begin with that point; were it that he
intended to have cleared truth, he ſhould firſt (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and ſome others
have done) have examined the points of the Scriptures ſufficiency, and the
needleſneſs of unwritten Traditions, and thereupon have examined the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
points in difference, that thereby the Reader might have diſcerned whether
the Roman church were the true church of God, ſith the truth of the church

                        </gap>e of Rome,</hi> he means the Roman Biſhop, or Pope, and
the Communion he means, is in the ſame Tenets which they hold according
to the <hi>Trent</hi> Canons, and <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth his Bull with ſubjection to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi>'s juriſdiction over the whole Church of Chriſt. In which ſenſe
the Tenet is ſo palpably falſe, and ſo extremely uncharitable, that it is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
that any that hath the underſtanding of a man ſhould imbrace it, or the
charity of a Chriſtian ſhould brook it. For,</p>
                  <p>1. If the Church now in communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> be the onely
true Church of God, then that Church onely hath eternal life, for onely the
true Church of God hath eternal life. <hi>Extra Eccleſiam non eſt ſalus,</hi> is their
own determination, <hi>Concil. Lateran. 4. Can.</hi> 2. and elſewhere. But that Church
which is not in communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath eternal life; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it
is the true Church of God. The Minor is proved thus, That Church which
believes in Jeſus Chriſt hath eternal life: But other Churches beſides thoſe
now in communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> believe in Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Ergo.</hi> The
Major is plain from <hi>John</hi> 3. 16, 18, 36. &amp; 17. 3. &amp; 20. 31. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 11, 12.
<hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. in which it is expreſly ſaid, that <hi>he that believeth on Chriſt</hi>
(without any mention of <hi>Peter</hi> or the Pope) <hi>hath eternal life.</hi> The Minor is
proved by their profeſſion, and other evidences of their reality in believing;
which if any deny to prove true faith in them, he may as well deny there are
any believers in Chriſt in the world.</p>
                  <p>2. If there be no true Churches but ſuch as are in communion with the See
of <hi>Rome,</hi> then there is ſome other name beſides the Name of Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119447:13"/>
given among men, by which we muſt be ſaved, and there is ſalvation in ſome
other beſides him, for men have ſalvation in that name by which they are the
true church of God; and if we be the true church of God by communion
with the Pope, we have ſalvation by the Pope. But this is moſt falſe and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian,
to aſcribe ſalvation to any other name beſides the Name of Jeſus
Chriſt, as being expreſly contradictory to <hi>Peter's</hi> own words, <hi>Act. 4. 12. There
is no ſalvation in any other, neither is there any name under heaven given to men
by which we muſt be ſaved, but the Name of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> not <hi>Peter,</hi> or the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. If no churches be true churches of God, but ſuch as are in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> then Chriſt died for no other churches but them.
For Chriſt died for his church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25. it is not ſaid, he gave himſelf for
them who are not his church. But ſure it is very uncharitable to ſay, that
Chriſt died for no other than thoſe that own the Pope, and contrary to the
Scripture, that <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that
whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 16.
therefore it is falſe and uncharitable, to exclude all but Romaniſts out of the
church of God.</p>
                  <p>4. If none be the true church of God, but ſuch as are in communion with
the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> then none are members of Chriſt, in Chriſt, the ſons of
God, but ſuch as are in communion with the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> for the true church
of God onely are members of Chriſt, in Chriſt, the children of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 23.
But it is falſe, that none are members of Chriſt, in Chriſt, or children of God,
but ſuch as are in communion with the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> for the Apoſtle tels the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> Gal. 3. 26, 27. <hi>that they were all the ſons of God by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aith in Chriſt
Jeſus, that as many as were baptized into Chriſt, had put on Chriſt,</hi> v. 28 that
<hi>they were all one in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> without any requiring of communion with
the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. If none are the true church of God but ſuch as are in communion with
the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> then Chriſt is preſent with none by his Spirit and protection;
but ſuch as are in that communion. For ſuch as are not the true Church of
God, Chriſt is not preſent with them by his Spirit and protection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9.
<hi>Ye are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, if the ſpirit of God dwell in you. If any
man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his,</hi> ver. 14 <hi>As many as
are led by the ſpirit of God, they are the ſons of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19. <hi>Know ye not
that your body is the temple of the holy Ghoſt, which ye have of God, and ye are
not your own,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 16. <hi>For ye are the temple of the living God, as God hath
ſaid, that I will dwell in them, and walk amidſt them, and I will be their God,
and they ſhall be my people.</hi> Revel. 2. 1. <hi>Chriſt walketh in the midſt of the ſeven
golden candleſticks.</hi> But Chriſt is preſent by his Spirit and protection with
other Churches and perſons, than ſuch as are in communion with the See of
<hi>Rome,</hi> even all that believe in Chriſt, and are the ſons of God, as is apparent
in that they call Jeſus the Lord, <hi>which none can do, but by the holy Ghoſt, 1 Cor.</hi>
12. 3. <hi>they cry Abba Father,</hi> and thereby ſhew they have the ſpirit of adoption,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4 6. Can any have the face to ſay, that the millions of chriſtian Greeks,
and others in perſecution, who ſervently invocated God in the Name of Chriſt,
have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, nor are his, becauſe they are not in communion
with the Roman See? yea, is there not more evidence of Chriſts Spirit among
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119447:14"/>
them, than is in the Roman church, in which there is ſo much uncleanneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ſo little of holineſs, that even <hi>H. T.</hi> to prove its holineſs, is fain to have
recourſe to ſome ſuppoſed Saints many hundreds of years ſince, by reaſon of the
late ſcarcity.</p>
                  <p>6. If none are the true church of God, but ſuch as are in communion with
the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> then none are the houſe of God but they, ſith the houſe of
God is the church of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. But that is falſe; for perſons not in
communion with the See of <hi>Rome</hi> may be built on Chriſt <hi>a ſpiritual houſe,</hi>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. Otherwiſe, beſides the foundation which is laid, to wit, Jeſus
Chriſt, it were neceſſary there ſhould be another foundation, on which they
ſhould be built, to wit, <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors. But <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 11.
<hi>No man can lay any other foundation to build upon a ſpiritual houſe to God, but
that which is laid, Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. tels us, <hi>Chriſt
is the living ſtone, on which they are built;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 6. alledgeth the Scripture,
ſaying, <hi>Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner ſtone, elect, precious, and he that
believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed;</hi> therefore all that believe in Chriſt, though
they be not in communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> are a ſpiritual houſe, and
a true church of God; which is confirmed by the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.
19, 20, 21. where he ſaith of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that <hi>they were of the houſhold of
God, and were built on the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt
himſelf being the chief corner ſtone, in whom all the building fitly framed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord. In whom ye alſo are builded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for an habitation of God through the ſpirit.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ. 4. 4. There is
one body, and one ſpirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling. 5 One
Lord, one faith, one Baptiſm. 6 One God and Father of all, who is above all,
and through all, and in you all.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 12. <hi>For as the body is one, and hath
many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body:
ſo alſo is Chriſt. 13 For by one ſpirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
we be Jews or Greeks, whether we be bond or free: and have been all made to
drink into one ſpirit. V. 27. Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</hi>
From whence may be gathered, that communion with Chriſt by his
Spirit, Faith, and Baptiſm, without any communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>
is ſufficient to prove perſons to be the houſe of God, and the body of Chriſt,
and conſequently the true church of God. For that which was ſufficient to
make the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and <hi>Corinthians</hi> the houſe of God, and body of Chriſt, is

Chriſt by his Spirit, Faith, and Baptiſm, without communion with the See

the true church of God now, that perſons be in communion with the See of
<hi>Rome;</hi> for there is no more required to the being of the true church of God
now, than was then, and it could not then be required to be in communion
with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> when there was no Biſhop nor church there. But there
were Apoſtolical true churches of God at <hi>Jeruſalem, Samaria,</hi> and elſewhere,
afore either <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> or any church there gathered (as the Hiſtory
of the new Teſtament ſhews;) therefore it is not neceſſary to the being of the
true church of God, to be in communion with the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>8. If there be none true churches but ſuch as are in communion with the
See of <hi>Rome,</hi> then the churches in <hi>India</hi> and elſewhere ſo remote from <hi>Rome,</hi>
that they never heard of the Biſhop or See of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor were required commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with it, ſhould be excluded from the church of Chriſt, though they hold
the true faith, becauſe they do not that which being of meer poſitive inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they are unavoidably ignorant of, and conſequently ſhould be damned.
But this is too abſurd, ſith it imputes to God tyranny, in requiring that which
cannot be done, and cruelty in damning for not doing it; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. If to be in communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> be neceſſary to the being
of the true church, then were the Apoſtles and Fathers, who in their Writings
and Creeds never required this of the believers to conſtitute them a true church
of God, very unfaithfull or defective in their Tradition, ſith they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
or teach this as neceſſary to the being of a true church of God; as may
be ſeen in their Writings and creeds. But this is falſe, as being contrary to
their proteſtations of their integrity, in not ſhunning to declare the whole
counſel of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 26, 27. and elſewhere; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. If there were many Saints and Martyrs, acknowledged even by the
Romaniſts to be ſuch, who did not hold communion with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
ſo as to own him to be ſupreme viſible head of the whole church, but did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him, and lived and died in that oppoſition, and yet were in the church of
God, then they who hold not communion with the See of <hi>Rome</hi> may be the
true church of God. But the antecedent is true in <hi>Cyprian, Auguſtine,</hi> and

keeping <hi>Eaſter,</hi> therefore either they muſt be unſainted, or elſe it muſt
be yielded, that perſons who are not now in communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>
may be true churches of God. I need not inſiſt any longer in proving the

as to be known onely to themſelves, and ſome near neighbors. The proof of
this ſucceſſion may be conceived to be out of Hiſtory, or other clear Writings,
Records, or Monuments extant, expreſſing perſons and their faith, or elſe it
may be conjectured from ſome more obſcure intimations. This Author I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from many paſſages following, underſtands his major here thus: <hi>That is
the onely true Church of God, which has had in the ſame place a continued ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
from Chriſt and his Apoſtles to this time, without interruption any nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time in any age, of a number of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Laicks, ſucceeding
one another in the profeſſion of the ſame faith, not onely in fundamentals, but
in other points alſo, ſo conſpicuouſly, that all Chriſtians did or might know it as
the Roman Empire, French Kingdom, or Venetian Republique may be known,
and this to be proved out of Hiſtory, or other clear Writings, Records, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents,
expreſſing the perſons and their faith.</hi> For ſuch a ſucceſſion this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
would have neceſſary to a true church, which he imagines may be proved
to be in the Roman church, and no other. But in this ſenſe his Propoſition is
moſt falſe, and no whit proved out of the Texts he produceth, and nullifies
the Roman church it ſelf, which he indeavours ſo much to magnifie, as to make
it to be the onely true church of God. In oppoſition thereto I ſay, 1. There
may be a true church of God, where there are no Biſhops or Prieſts at all.
Which I prove, 1. From <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>
after they had gathered the churches, they returned to them and <hi>ordained El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in every Church,</hi> which ſuppoſeth they were churches ſometime afore they
had Elders ordained for them; therefore it follows, there may be a true church
without Biſhops, Prieſts, or Elders, ſith thoſe churches were ſuch afore they
had them. 2. From the definition of a true church. That is a true church
which hath the definition of a true church. <hi>H. T.</hi> confeſſeth often this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to be true. But a number of believers in Chriſt who have no Elders, or
Prieſts, or Biſhops, hath the definition of a true church; <hi>Ergo,</hi> The minor
is proved from the received definitions. <hi>Bellarm. Tom. 2. Controv. l. de Eccleſ.
milit. c. 1. Eccleſia eſt evocatio ſive caetus vocatorum, the church is the company of

or Prieſts, therefore they may be a ture church of God. 3. That company
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119447:15"/>
which hath the eſſential parts of a true church, is a true church of God; But
a number of believers profeſſing the faith of Chriſt, hath the eſſential parts
of a true church. They are the matter of a church, in that they are men, the
form is faith, or the profeſſion of it, no other thing can be rightly aſſigned to
be eſſential as conſtitutive of a true church; their governours, order, ſpecial
gifts, and other things tending to their well-being, are common accidents,
which may be, or not be, and yet the church remain a true church. Therefore
a number of believers profeſſing the true faith of Chriſt, without Biſhops, is a
true church of God. 2. It is not neceſſary to the being of a true church, that
there be a ſucceſſion of Biſhops diſtinct from Presbyters, whom <hi>H. T.</hi> terms
Prieſts. For 1. There are many Fathers and popiſh Writers, who make them
but one Order at firſt, <hi>Lumbard. ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Epiſcopi &amp; Presbyteri fuerunt. The Antients took Biſhops and Prieſts for the
ſame;</hi> therefore with them there were churches, in which were no Biſhops di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from Presbyters. 2. Where there were two Orders, yet they were not
ſo neceſſary, but that the church may be without them; otherwiſe in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy
of the Epiſcopal See (which hath in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf been ſometimes ſome
years together, often many moneths and days) the church ſhould ceaſe to be a
true church of God; for then it would follow, that in ſuch vacancies the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
church did ceaſe to be. 3. It is not neceſſary to the being of a true church,
that there be a profeſſion of the ſame faith in every point; for then the Roman
church ſhould not be a true church in <hi>Paul</hi>'s days, in which it is clear from
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 2. that <hi>one believed he might eat all things, another who was weak did
eat herbs.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>One man eſteemeth one day above another, another eſteemeth
every day alike.</hi> In after Ages the differences in the Roman church it ſelf, if
reckoned, would make a large catalogue. 4. It is not neceſſary to the being of
a true church, that the company and their profeſſion be ſo viſible, as that they
may be diſcerned as the Roman Senate was, or the Venetian Republique, and
French Kingdom are. For then <hi>the diſciples which were aſſembled, the doors
being ſhut for fear of the Jews,</hi> John 20. 19. had not been a true church of
God, nor the <hi>woman in the wilderneſs,</hi> Revel. 12. 14. nor <hi>thoſe that wand red
in dens and caves of the earth, in deſarts and mountains,</hi> Heb. 11. 38. then the
Saints in perſecution ſhould not be bleſſed, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 10. but
curſed, as ceaſing to be the true church of God. 5. It is not neceſſary to the
bring of a true church, that there ſhould be in it a ſucceſſion of Biſhops, Prieſts,
and Laicks, profeſſing the ſame faith; for then the firſt company of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
though called out of the world, ſhould not be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a true church of God,
for want of ſucceſſion. 6. Much leſs is it neceſſary, that there ſhould be a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
in the ſame place. For then when Chriſt removed the candleſtick, that
is, the church out of it's place, as he threatens, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 5. though believers
ſhould come to dwell there a thouſand years after, they ſhould not be a true
church, becauſe of the interruption of ſucceſſion in that place: the church at
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after the perſecution had not been a true church, if the Apoſtles had
been ſcattered as well as the reſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 1, 2. Doth a church perſecuted and

are removed out of their dwellings? Suppoſe the place waſted and deſtroyed,
ſhall that deſtroy the being of the church which was there before? 7. Much
leſs is it neceſſary that there ſhould be a continuance without any notable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119447:16"/>
in each age. For there may be many hinderances of elections of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and ordinations of Prieſts, there may be ſcatterings of the Laicks, as
was at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 8. 1. and yet the being and verity of the church conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.
8. If a church muſt be judged no true church, becauſe no Writings or
Monuments have kept the catalogue of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Laicks, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the ſame faith, from Chriſt till this time, a church ſhall be condemned as
no true church, for want of Writings and Monuments, or becauſe they are

he would not have mentioned them, or at leaſt he would have ſhewed
how he proves his Propoſition from them, it being neceſſary to do ſo, if he
had a mind to inſtruct, and not impoſe on his Readers. The firſt Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
59. 21. is no promiſe of ſuch a ſucceſſion in any viſible church, as <hi>H. T.</hi> ſpeaks
of, but of a continuance of Gods Word and Spirit with the perſons there
meant, which ſeem to be peculiarly the <hi>Jews,</hi> by the Apoſtles alledging <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 26. However they are onely the Elect who can be there meant, ſith the
promiſe is made good to none other, none other have the Spirit of God not
departing from them, not any whole viſible church among the Gentiles, from
whom the Spirit of God may depart. In the three next Texts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 1, 3, 11.
<hi>Iſa. 62. 6. Ezek.</hi> 37. 26. the very words apply the promiſes to <hi>Hieru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo that if they ſpeak of any continued ſucceſſion in any
viſible church in all Ages, it muſt be the Jewiſh, which it is certain hath had
no ſuch ſucceſſion, but is broken off from the true Olive to this day; and
therefore cannot be meant of them in <hi>H. T.</hi> his ſenſe, till they be reingraſſed.
The next, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 13, 14. ſpeaks not of the continued ſucceſſion which <hi>H. T.</hi>
imagines of every true viſible church, but of the duration of Chriſts domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>which ſhall not paſs away</hi> to another; that is, there is no kingdom
which ſhall ſucceed to it, as there did to the former Monarchies, nor <hi>ſhall it be
deſtroyed,</hi> as they were, but ſhall be continued to Chriſt without any ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
So that this Text mentions not <hi>H. T.</hi> his ſucceſſion, but excludes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of any other to Chriſts dominion. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. intimates a ſucceſſion

Laicks, profeſſing the ſame faith, from Chriſts time till now. Much leſs
doth <hi>John</hi> 14. 16. prove ſuch a ſucceſſion, it being onely a promiſe of the
Spirits abiding with the Apoſtles for ever; which is no promiſe to the Biſhop

as that there may be a catalogue of ſuch produced out of good records, and no

church to have this ſucceſſion continued. 2. That no other hath. Which he
takes on him to do, by a catalogue of the Roman churches chief Paſtors,
Councils, Nations converted, and publique Profeſſors of her Faith. But his
catalogue proves not that which it is brought for. For 1. many hundreds of
years there hath been no one of the Roman Popes, or very few, who have been
Paſtors at all in the church of God; they have been Stateſmen, have meddled
with the civil affairs of many kingdoms, diſturbed the Empire and many
Kingdoms, advanced their baſe ſons, who are tearmed their nephews, and their

ſome years as Pope. 4. Their ſucceſſion is a very uncertain thing. For 1. It
is certain that Jeſus Chriſt was never Paſtor of the Roman church, as Biſhop
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119447:17"/>
there ſeated; and it is very audaciouſly, if not blaſphemouſly done by <hi>H. T.</hi>
to reckon him as chief Paſtor of the Roman church, and to make <hi>Peter</hi> and
others as Succeſſors to him in his paſtoral Office, as if it were ceaſed in his
own Perſon, and transferred to another as his Succeſſor. Nor is it likely that
<hi>Peter</hi> was ever at <hi>Rome,</hi> or Biſhop there, notwithſtanding ſome of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
by uncertain tradition have conceived he was. For neither were the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
ſettled any where as Biſhops of one place, nor were they to be, it being
againſt their commiſſion, and peculiar work of planting churches in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And <hi>Peter</hi> being <hi>the Apoſtle of the circumciſion, Gal.</hi> 2. 7. and his being
many years in the parts about <hi>Judea</hi> (of which the Scripture makes expreſs
mention) it is very improbable that he was at <hi>Rome</hi> at all, certainly not ſo as
to ſit there as Biſhop ſo many years, as ſome Writers do write of him. And it
is more likely, if any where, he was Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where it is certain he
was, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11. and as good authority there is of his being Biſhop there, as of
his being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore the ſucceſſion to <hi>Peter</hi> was rather to
be there than at <hi>Rome;</hi> nor is there any proof of tranſlation of <hi>Peter</hi>'s See
from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. Concerning the ſucceſſion after <hi>Peter,</hi> there is ſo
much uncertainty, as may ſhew how miſerable a people they muſt needs be,
who have no better proof for their church than ſuch uncertain ſucceſſion. For
1. There is no certainty, but difference among their own Writers, who was
next after, whether <hi>Linus</hi> or <hi>Clemens,</hi> or whether both together, and the like
concerning the order of <hi>Cletus, Anacletus, Clemens,</hi> as may be ſeen in <hi>Platina</hi>
and <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> and others. 2. It is manifeſt, that the ſucceſſion hath been
through diſſention about the election ſometimes a great while interrupted, as
<hi>Baronius</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>Ann. 853. num. 63. It hath fallen out, that the See of</hi> Rome
<hi>hath been void above two years and five moneths, the election being delayed
through contention.</hi> 3. There have been many Schiſms, very near thirty, in
which there have been two or three Popes at once, one oppoſing, curſing and
condemning the other, and no clear certainty who was the right Pope, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Princes being divided, ſome adhering to one, ſome to another. 4. A
great part of their ſucceſſion, even by the confeſſion of their own Writers, is of
<hi>Monſters,</hi> as they term them, more truly to be termed devils incarnate rather
than men, ſo abominably wicked, that hell hath not worſe in it, not worthy
of the name of Chriſtians, much leſs of Paſtors of the church of God, not
worſe ſurely in any church, I think not the like for wickedneſs any where; ſo
that the ſucceſſion of ſuch Paſtors is fitter to prove the Roman party a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of Satan, the very ſeat of Antichriſt, than the onely true church of
God. Methinks no man that thinks well of Chriſt, ſhould imagine he would
truſt the Government of the Univerſal church with ſuch men, but rather if he
intended to commit that care to any one, have choſen a better race than the
Popes have been to manage it. 5. Their ſucceſſion is alſo by their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſaid to be with ſuch wicked practices of poyſoning predeceſſors, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Cardinals, power of notorious whores, dealing with the devil, Simony
and bribes, fightings and bloodſhed, as proves them Succeſſors to <hi>Nero,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to <hi>Peter.</hi> So that if a man would draw an Argument to prove the
Roman church to be the <hi>Mother of barlots and abominations of the earth</hi> (as
<hi>Rome</hi> is ſtiled, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 5. by the confeſſion of their own Writers) the ſtory of
the ſucceſſion of the Popes and their lives, might convince one that is not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119447:17"/>
bewitched with their ſorceries, that ſuch hath been for many hundred years
together the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 6. It is alſo falſe, that thoſe he calls cheif
Paſtors, have had a continued ſucceſſion in the profeſſion of the ſame Faith
with the now <hi>Roman,</hi> ſith it is not denied, that Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> joyning with the
<hi>Arians,</hi> and ſubſcribing to the condemnation of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> (as <hi>Hierom</hi> in
his <hi>Chronicle</hi> and <hi>Catalogue of writers,</hi> in that of <hi>Fortunatianus</hi> teſtifies) did,
as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>l. 4. de Rom. Pont. c. 9. by interpretation, if
not expreſly, conſent to the Arian hereſie:</hi> and Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the firſt in the
ſixth Synod at <hi>Conſtantinople, Act.</hi> 12. &amp; 13. Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> being Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
was condemned as a <hi>Monothelite</hi> by hundreds of Biſhops, and after by
other Synods; beſides what is charged on ſundry other Popes even by Popiſh
writers, as <hi>Anaſtaſius, John</hi> the 22. &amp;c. As for <hi>H. T.</hi> his Catalogue of
Councils, Nations converted, and publick Profeſſors of the Romiſh Faith;
it proves much leſs, that <hi>the Church now in communion with the See of Rome,
has had a continued ſucceſſion of Biſhops, Prieſts and Laicks, ſucceeding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the profeſſion of the ſame Faith, with the now Roman Church from Chriſt
and his Apoſtles to this time.</hi> For, 1. According to his own allegation, the
agreement of profeſſion is never in any age entirely the ſame in points of
Faith, afore the ſixteenth Century and the <hi>Trent Council.</hi> In all the ages
before, the moſt he can produce is, that after the five or ſixth firſt Centuries,
ſome in each age held ſome of the points now held by the Papiſts, but denied
by Proteſtants; the moſt we can find in the firſt ages, is ſome agreement in
rites, and ſome priviledges of the Roman Biſhop, taken either from forged
writings impoſed on the firſt Popes, or ſome ſayings of Fathers miſinterpreted.
2. He confeſſeth <hi>ſundry ages, to wit, the ſecond and third produced no Councils;</hi>
and that <hi>he finds no general council nor yet provincial in the tenth age, in which
any controverſie of moment was decided.</hi> 3. Of thoſe Councils he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
there is no one general Council alleged in the four firſt Centuries, which
was held at <hi>Rome,</hi> or did acknowledge ſubjection to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
now they require, and they being all or moſt of them of the <hi>Greek<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Church,
which did and doth yet deny ſuch communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>H. T.</hi>
means, it is falſly ſaid, that they prove his continued ſucceſſion in the Church
now in communion with the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> 4. For the Nations converted
and Chriſtian profeſſors in his Catalogue, there were few of them <hi>Romans</hi>
or converted by any from <hi>Rome,</hi> or had any acquaintance with the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church or Biſhops; and therefore to make them witneſſes of a ſucceſſion of
Biſhops, Prieſts and Laicks in the profeſſion of the ſame Faith continued from
Chriſt and his Apoſtles to this time in the Church now in communion with
the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> is extreme impudence and vanity: nevertheleſs let's view his
Catalogue.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the firſt age he alledgeth Chriſt, and St. Peter the Apoſtle, Linus, Cletus,
Clemens, and the Council of the Apoſtles at Hieruſalem, St. Peter preſiding

of his chair from Antioch to Rome; he names ſome Catholick profeſſors to
the year 100. and the ſpreading of the Church over all thoſe Countries; to which
St. Paul wrote his Epiſtles and ſome others, as <hi>France, Spain, England,</hi> and
ſome Catholick profeſſors to the year 200. with a falſly, ſo called Canon of the
Apoſtles approved in the ſix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That all this is little to his purpoſe, appears by conſidering. 1 That
it is manifeſtly falſe, which he ſuppoſeth. 1. That becauſe Chriſt is the chief
Paſtor of the Catholick Church rightly ſo termed, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
hath arrogantly uſurped the title of the Catholick Church, and the Pope is
Biſhop of that See; therefore the Pope muſt be ſucceſſour to Chriſt in ſuch a
peculiar manner, as no other Biſhop or Paſtor is; and that the title of Vicar
of Chriſt belongs to him peculiarly, which is the title blaſphemouſly aſcribed
to him by flattering Romaniſts. 2. That Chriſt hath a ſucceſſor in his
Paſtoral office, though the Scripture aſcribe to Chriſt, becauſe of his living
for ever, an office which paſſeth not to any other, as <hi>Aarons</hi> did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24.
3. That <hi>Peter</hi> is ſucceſſor to Chriſt in the Paſtoral office he had, and no
other Apoſtle, or Biſhop beſides the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> though if there were any
that could challenge ſucceſſion to Chriſt or <hi>Peter,</hi> it ſhould be rather the
Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the mother Church, if any, where Chriſt Preached, and
<hi>as the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our Profeſſion</hi> offered himſelf, being <hi>Miniſter
of the circumciſion,</hi> Rom. 15. 8. and <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>Apoſtle of the circumciſion,</hi>
Gal. 2. 7. and <hi>Paul</hi> when he <hi>went to ſee him</hi> (which Romaniſts make an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of ſuperiority) went to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Gal. 1. 17. not to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and if he were Preſident in the Council, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. as <hi>H. T.</hi> imagins, it was at
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> not at <hi>Rome.</hi> 4. It is falſe, that either Chriſt, or <hi>Peter,</hi> or the
Catholick Profeſſors he names in the firſt and ſecond ages, held the ſame
profeſſion of Faith with the now Roman Church in the points, wherein the
Proteſtants, who hold the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do diſſent from
them. 2. That if all were granted, <hi>H. T.</hi> which he ſaith about the ſucceſſion
in the two firſt ages, yet it doth not amount to the proof of ſo much as one of
the twenty eight Articles he holds in his <hi>Manual,</hi> or the Articles in Pope <hi>Pius</hi>
the fourth his Creed, to have been held by any of them, not the Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
tranſubſtantiation, invocation of Saints deceaſed, half communion,
worſhipping of Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For <hi>Peter might be Preſident at the Council at
Jeruſalem, he might tranſlate his chair from Antioch to Rome, it might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
lawful to appeal from other Biſhops to the Biſhop of Rome, chief honour
might be given to the Biſhop of Rome;</hi> yet neither <hi>Peter</hi> nor the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> the head, viſible Monarch or Ruler over the Apoſtles and the whole
Church: <hi>mention might be made of oblation and ſacrifice,</hi> yet the maſſe no
properly ſo called ſacrifice propitiatory for quick and dead. There's not a
word in any of Chriſts, or <hi>John Baptiſts,</hi> or <hi>Peters,</hi> or <hi>Pauls,</hi> or <hi>James,</hi> or
<hi>Johns,</hi> or <hi>Judes</hi> Sermons or writings, to prove any of the points of Popery, but
enough to the contrary. Nor is there any of the reſt of the Martyrs or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
alledged of the two firſt ages, of whom he is able to produce any one
ſentence of theirs, which may demonſtrate their acknowledging of any one of
the points now held by the Romaniſts, which are by the Proteſtants fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
contradicted: which will appear by conſidering the frivolouſneſs of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119447:18"/>
what <hi>H. T.</hi> here produceth. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>defined,</hi> Act. 15. 7, 8, 9, 10.
<hi>That the Jewiſh ceremonies were not to be impoſed on the Gentiles, therefore
he had the premacy over the Apoſtles and the whole Church,</hi> as if the defining
in a Council or Colledge did prove ſuperiority. By the ſame reaſon it might
be proved that <hi>James</hi> had the premacy, ſith he ſpake leaſt, and according to
his ſentence was the decree. <hi>Paphnutius</hi> in the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> as <hi>Sozome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>hiſt. c.</hi> 22. relates, when the Council was about to forbid Prieſts the uſe of
wives, defined the contrary, and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council approved it; was he
therefore the primate over the other Biſhops in the Council? as in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it is which <hi>H. T.</hi> adds: <hi>Hicrom</hi> ſaith, <hi>Peter was Prince and Author
of the decree, therefore he had the primacy,</hi> that is the ſupreme headſhip over the
Apoſtles and whole Church, though being <hi>[Prince and Author of the decree]</hi>
imports no more, but to give ſentence firſt, according to which the decree was
framed. But <hi>James</hi> who ſpake after, was he according to whoſe ſentence the
decree was framed entirely, however <hi>Peter</hi> began before; ſo that by this reaſon
<hi>James</hi> had the primacy, and not <hi>Peter.</hi> A like in conſequent is this, <hi>Peter
remained not always at Antioch, as all that Church acknowledgeth, nor did ſhe
ever challenge the firſt chair in any general Council, as appears in the Councils,</hi>
ergo <hi>Peter tranſlated his chair from Antioch to Rome: riſum teneat is araici?</hi>
As if <hi>Peter</hi> did always remain at <hi>Rome;</hi> or that becauſe we read not of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch's</hi>
challenge, therefore it was not made, or as if the not challenging the firſt
chair, were becauſe of <hi>Peters</hi> tranſlation of his chair from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the very decree of the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> Council, <hi>Can.</hi> 28. gives <hi>Rome</hi> the firſt chair
becauſe of the dignity of the City, not by reaſon of <hi>Peters</hi> ſupremacy, or
tranſlation of his chair from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> of the ſame ſort of inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence

honour of St. Peters memory, it ſhould be lawful to appeal from whatſoever Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
to the Biſhop of Rome,</hi> Can. 3. <hi>therefore the primacy was in Peter, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him in the Biſhop of Rome.</hi> For, 1. This Council (whatever it were)
was not in the firſt or ſecond ages. 2. Nor was it reckoned, no not by the

were removed for not yielding, whereto the Biſhops of the Eaſt met by

yea however in the late edition of the Councils at <hi>Paris,</hi> corrupt devices are uſed
to gain the credit of a general Council to it, and for ſome advantage to the
Papacy to make its Canons of authority: yet <hi>H. T.</hi> makes it to have had but
ſeventy ſix Eaſtern Fathers, when there were three hundred Weſtern; and
the ignorance of any general Councils eſtabliſhing appeals from <hi>Africa</hi> to
<hi>Rome</hi> in the ſixth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſhews that it was not taken for an

                     </gap>cumenical Council. 3. Nor doth the Canon it ſelf decree as <hi>H. T.</hi> ſets
down, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have power to receive appeals, and to
judge the cauſe, but in caſe of the depoſition of a Biſhop, they permit the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> to deliberate whether the judgement ſhould be renewed, and then
conſider whether he ſhould ſend ſome from his ſide who might be preſent at the
renewed cognizance of it, and if it ſhould ſeem meet, alſo appoint judges out
of a neighbouring Province: none of which give the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> a judiciary

power, but onely a Directory. Nor was this to be extended to any other than
thoſe of the weſtern countreys, the <hi>Africans</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> ever rejecting it.
4. The very canon it ſelf expreſſeth the reaſon of it, not any divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or ancient uſe, the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> having to the contrary, <hi>Can.</hi> 5.
determined that ſuch controverſies ſhould be ended in a provincial Council,
but it was then propoſed firſt by <hi>Hoſius, for honour of St.</hi> Peter's <hi>memory, and
the laſt determination of the cauſe to be by a Council, Can. 13. &amp;</hi> 14. No bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
that which <hi>H. T.</hi> adds, <hi>The Council of</hi> Chalcedon, Anno 451. <hi>ſaid, All
primary and chief honour according to the Canons was to be kept for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of old</hi> Rome, <hi>therefore this is good evidence that in the firſt Age the
primacy was in</hi> Peter <hi>and the Pope.</hi> For neither doth that Council held in the
fifth Age mention what honour or primacy the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had in the two
firſt Ages, nor doth it aſcribe to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> any ſuperiority, but doth
expreſly in that very Canon aſcribe to the other Patriarchs equality with the
<hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop in power, however he were firſt in order, and this was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
notwithſtanding the reluctancy of the Popes Legates. The reſt is as
vain. <hi>Pope</hi> Antherus Anno 238. <hi>ſaid,</hi> Peter <hi>was changed from</hi> Antioch <hi>to</hi>
Rome, Gregory <hi>in the ſixth Age ſaid, he knew no Biſhop, but is ſubject to the
See of</hi> Rome, Epiſt. 62. Ergo, Peter <hi>and the Pope had the ſupreme Headſhip
over the whole Church in the firſt Age.</hi> As if the counterfeit writing of a Pope
in the third Age, or the ſaying of a Pope in the ſixth Age of what was then in
uſe (though not true, ſith the <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhops to his knowledge were not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
without telling them by what means it was ſo, were a ſufficient proof ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

neither were thoſe canons made by the Apoſtles, as many things in them ſhew,
and if they were, private Maſſes uſed by Papiſts ſhould be condemned, nor doth
it follow there is mention of a Sacrifice and Offering, therefore in the Maſs was

ſhould buſie themſelves in making Decrees about ſacred places, ſacred veſſels,
hearing of greater cauſes, faſting in <hi>Lent,</hi> when they were in danger to be ſhut
up in Priſons, neceſſitated to hide themſelves, wanted perhaps food of any ſort
by reaſon of perſecution? 2. Or who that reades Authours of thoſe and
other Ages does not perceive in thoſe Epiſtles the ſtyle and terms of far later
Ages? 3. But were it ſuppoſed they were the genuine Epiſtles of thoſe Popes,
yet there is no proof from thence of the now <hi>Roman</hi> faith held by them in the
points gainſaid by Proteſtants, as <hi>v. g.</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, or the Popes viſible
Headſhip over the whole Church. They might call the Euchariſt <hi>a Sacrifice,</hi>
yet not properly ſo called propitiatory for quick and dead. <hi>Pius</hi> might call <hi>the
ſpilling of Wine, ſpilling of Chriſts Blood,</hi> ſignified by it, as <hi>the Cup</hi> is termed
<hi>the Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> becauſe it is ſignified by it, <hi>Lent</hi> faſt, faſting
afore Maſs, mingling Water and Wine might be appointed, yet no real
ſubſtantial preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body and Blood taught, the greater cauſes of
the Church, and more difficult queſtions referred to the Apoſtolick See, and
yet no ſupreme Headſhip over the whole Church deduced thence. As for the
Tale of <hi>James</hi> his being made Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by St. <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and
<hi>John,</hi> it rather makes againſt <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy, than for it, fith in that no
more is aſcribed to <hi>Peter</hi> than to <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John:</hi> ſo that we may grant him,
that they <hi>were Popes of</hi> Rome, and yet aver they were true Proteſtants in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their Doctrine, though differing in frivolous ceremonies, if the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
alleged had been their own, (which is altogether improbable) and ſlight
the folly of <hi>H. T.</hi> in triumphing afore the victory.</p>

                     <p>The Catalogue of H. T. is defective in proof of his pretended Succeſſion in the
Roman Church in the fourth and fifth Centuries.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the fourth Age he begins with a catalogue of catholick Profeſſors to the
year 400. of whom ſome were of the <hi>African</hi> Churches, ſome of the <hi>Greek,</hi>
ſome of the <hi>Aſiatick,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Latin</hi> Churches: but he ſhews not that any
one either owned the Popes Supremacy, or the Doctrine of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi>
which he maintains againſt the Proteſtants. Sure <hi>Hierom</hi> was no Aſſertor of
the Papacy, who in his Epiſtle to <hi>Euagrius</hi> makes <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> the
ſame, and <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Rome of no higher, <hi>but of the ſame merit and Prieſthood
with the Biſhop of</hi> Eugubium. And for the Nations converted which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
there were ſome of them, as <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> who it is not likely
ever heard of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, nor had any converſion from them. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is
it likely that any of them either owned the Popes or Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
or any point of Doctrine, they now hold in oppoſition to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</p>
                  <p>As for the fourteen Popes of this century, what ever their ſucceſſion were,
(which is not without queſtion) yet that they did aſſert as due to them ſuch a
Supremacy as the Popes now claim, or that faith, which now the Papiſts hold
in oppoſition to the Proteſtants, cannot be proved. The ſame may be ſaid of
the two general Councils he mentions in the fourth century, to wit, the firſt
<hi>Nicene,</hi> and the firſt <hi>Conſtantinopolitan:</hi> which never aſcribed to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> any more power than to the Biſhops of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
nor after them the <hi>Epheſin</hi> and <hi>Chalcedonian</hi> in the fifth century. <hi>H. T.</hi> himſelf

though it be ſaid, <hi>that Cyril held the place of Pope</hi> Caeleſtinus, yet that was in
giving ſuffrage to ſhew the agreement of the Patriarchs, not in preſidency, or if
in preſidency, yet ſo as to be preſident, <hi>ſuo jure,</hi> by his own right, as one of the
Patriarchs without deputation from <hi>Rome. H. T.</hi> adds, <hi>The</hi> Chalcedon <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

And when the Popes Legates oppoſed the aſcribing to the Patriarch
of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> equal authority and privileges with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
yet the ſix hundred Fathers determined for the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what do the Councils in theſe two Ages ſay for <hi>H. T.</hi> his <hi>Minor?</hi> He
brings ſome paſſages out of the <hi>Arabick</hi> Canons and the Decrees, as if the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Council aſſerted the Popes ſupremacy and the real preſence. But thoſe
<hi>Arabick</hi> canons are of no credit, being but lately (as they ſay) brought by a
certain Jeſuit from the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and thoſe variouſly publiſhed
by <hi>Piſanus</hi> and <hi>Turrian,</hi> in which are eighty canons: whereas of old in the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Synod there were but twenty, and the Letter of the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops (of
whom <hi>Auguſtin</hi> was one) in the ſixth Synod at <hi>Carthage</hi> written to the Pope
of <hi>Rome,</hi> aſſuring that the copies of the <hi>Nicene</hi> canons which <hi>Cecilian</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Carthage</hi> brought from <hi>Nice,</hi> and the copies they had from <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria</hi>
and <hi>Atticus</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> had not the canon about Appeals to
<hi>Rome</hi> from all parts, which three Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> alleged; but the true ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the <hi>Nicene</hi> council, to wit, the fifth and the ſixth being againſt the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
power about appeals to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in vain doth <hi>H. T.</hi> obtrude
his nine and thirtieth and the threeſcore and fifth <hi>Can. Arab.</hi> for the Popes
ſupremacy and prayer for the dead. And for the canon, <hi>that forbids Deacons to
give the Euchariſt Presbyters being preſent,</hi> (which he bring for the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing
of the Sacrifice of the Maſs) the genuine words of the canon men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not a power in prieſts (as he terms them) to offer ſacrifice, which Deacons
have not, but a reſtraint of Deacons from that giving the Euchariſt, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being preſent, which they might do in their abſence. And for <hi>the other
teſtimonies which he fetcheth out of the Decretals, for Baptiſms, purging
away ſin, and the unbloody Sacrifice,</hi> they are of no validity, being not taken
out of the acts of the Council, but the compiler of the canon-law, who thruſt
into the canon-law all ſorts of Determinations, whether they were chaff or
wheat, genuine or ſuppoſititious. And yet if they were genuine they may have a
ſenſe agreeing with proteſtant doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Decree of the firſt</hi> Conſtantinopolitan <hi>Council againſt</hi> Macedonius,
<hi>which decreed the Biſhop of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>to be chief next to the Biſhop of
Rome,</hi> proves not that the Fathers then aſcribed to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuch a
ſupremacy of power as now the Popes arrogate over all Biſhops, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
For it doth make the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> a chief, not under the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119447:21"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> but next him, and aſcribes to him honour and dignity alike with
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> though in order of mentioning, ſitting and ſome ſuch like
acts it prefers the biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt <hi>Epheſin</hi> council, if <hi>Peter</hi> were <hi>defined Head and Prince of the
Apoſtles,</hi> yet they never meant thereby ſuperiority and power over them, but
priority in order, and excellency in virtue. The power of binding and looſing
ſins was not given to <hi>Peter</hi> any otherwiſe than to other Apoſtles, <hi>John</hi> 20. 23.</p>

                     <hi>In the third action</hi> (ſaith <hi>H. T.) Pope</hi> Leo <hi>is called univerſal Arch-biſhop.</hi>
And it is granted that the Council extolled <hi>Leo,</hi> yet they made him not <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Biſhop</hi> over all biſhops in the world, but he was ſtyled <hi>Occumenical Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of old</hi> Rome, not by the council, but by particular men of the council,
which yet did give it to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> but by none was that title
then given to either in that ſenſe in which now the Pope claims it; for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Popes Legates; which determination was again confirmed in the ſixth Synod at
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Trullo</hi> in the ſixth Age. The ſenſe in which the title of <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical,</hi>
or <hi>Univerſal Biſhop</hi> was given to any of the Patriarchs was not given
to them as aſcribing to them ſupremacy &amp; power over all biſhops, and churches,
as afterwards <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> affected the title, and <hi>Boniface</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
uſurped it by the means of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour, but it was given to each of
the Patriarchs for their eminency by reaſon of their great care of the churches,
in like manner as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 28. Upon me cometh daily the
care of all the Churches:</hi> which was therefore put on them becauſe of the dignity
of their cities, and amplitude of the rule and dominion which was exerciſed
there by the Emperours Lieutenants, by means whereof the biſhops of thoſe
cities had the advantage of intelligence and aſſiſtance in the ordering of things
belonging to many churches in a large compaſs, even as at this day a Patriarch
at <hi>London</hi> hath an advantage for the ordering of things concerning the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
and <hi>Iriſh</hi> churches: the regiment of the churches in thoſe days much follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the government of the Empire, as is manifeſt by the acts of councils and
hiſtories of thoſe times. It is granted that in the fifth age Pope <hi>Leo</hi> affected
the extolling of <hi>Peter,</hi> and did it too immoderately, and that the phraſe of
<hi>Peter</hi>'s doing what the Pope did was in uſe: and this proves that then ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had crept in among the biſhops, and the affecting of vain titles increaſed, and
that in reſpect of theſe things there was great corruption in the Patriarchs and
other biſhops, which grew to an extreme height afterwards; yet neither in that age
nor any other was that power over the whole church, which now the Popes and
their flatterers challenge aſcribed unto them without controul of the ſounder
part, and is yet to this day oppoſed by the <hi>French</hi> popiſh churches, and ſome
other.</p>
                  <p>That which is added by <hi>H. T.</hi> of <hi>the Council of</hi> Eleberis <hi>in</hi> Spain, <hi>and the
ſecond of</hi> Atles <hi>in</hi> France, <hi>about Prieſts abſtaining from their Wives, or elſe to
be degraded, and that no man who was married could be made a Prieſt unleſs a
converſion were promiſed,</hi> is but of provincial Synods, not general councils,
about a matter onely of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, not a point of Faith, about
which alone is the Queſtion, whether he can prove ſuch a Succeſſion as he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
in all ages: beſides the <hi>Eleberin</hi> canon ſuppoſeth they had then Wives;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119447:21"/>
and it appears that till then they did uſe them, and that there were married
prieſts: but many being corrupted in their opinions of Marriage by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing
of it as carnal, and extolling Virginity as meritorious, began to put
that yoke on men, which occaſioned in after ages the intolerable tyranny of
denying Marriage to prieſts, againſt Gods allowance, and the practice of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ages.</p>
                  <p>The catholick profeſſours he mentions to the year 500. were many of the
<hi>Greek</hi> and other churches, who, though they held communion with the biſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> in oppoſing the Hereſies then riſen, yet did neither acknowledge the
Popes ſupremacy now challenged, nor held the Doctrine the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> now
teach in oppoſition to Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>As for the Nations converted, <hi>Scots, French,</hi> the Martyrs of <hi>Africa,</hi> which
he mentions, it is not ſhewed, that either they were converted by any from
<hi>Rome,</hi> or acknowledged ſubjection to him as the ſupreme oecumenical biſhop,
or held what the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> now hold againſt Proteſtants. And thus have I
ſhewed the inſufficiency for the proof of his <hi>Minor</hi> of the catalogue of <hi>H. T.</hi>

                  <p>That which he allegeth out of the <hi>Caeſar Auguſtan</hi> Council, which decreed

and it is true alſo that he did in many things pervert them, and it is ſaid he was
an inſtigator of the murder of many <hi>Britiſh Chriſtians</hi> better than himſelf:
but that either he, or Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> that ſent him, held the ſame ſupremacy of
the pope, which now popes claim, or the now-<hi>Roman</hi> faith oppoſite to the
proteſtants cannot be ſhewed. On the contrary, it is manifeſt enough, that
<hi>Gregory</hi> the great refuſed the Title of <hi>Univerſal Biſhop,</hi> as <hi>profane,</hi> and <hi>ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi>
and accounted the aſſumer of it to be <hi>a fore-runner of Antichriſt, lib</hi> 4.
<hi>epiſt. 32, 34, 36, 38, 39. &amp; lib. 6. epiſt.</hi> 30. he allowed not Worſhip of Images
in his Epiſtle to <hi>Serenus</hi> biſhop of <hi>Marſeiles,</hi> he allowed prieſts wives, nor did
tie men to follow the order of the <hi>Roman</hi> church, which ſhews the popes then
not to have been altogether ſo bad as in the next age. In which and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the reſt of his Catalogue he can hardly ſhew a Pope that lived either the
life of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or did the Office of a paſtour of the church of God, if
any, ſure not many: but in ſtead of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> paſtours a generation of men
of an ambitious and luxurious ſpirit, contending with Emperours and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
for worldly greatneſs, perſecuting godly <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> living in pomp, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot,
and all kinde of wickedneſs, are ſet down as chief paſtours of the univerſal

In the ſeventh age he reckons up nineteen Popes, whom he terms <hi>chief
Paſtors:</hi> of them the ſecond is <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, who obtained of <hi>Phocas</hi>
the Emperor (who by treaſon had gotten the Empire, ſlaying his Lord <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius</hi>
and his children) the title of <hi>univerſal Biſhop,</hi> deteſted before by <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
the great, as <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>ſacrilegious;</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> the firſt, is the fifth
condemned in the third <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Council, in which <hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith,
<hi>there were Fathers two hundred eighty nine, Pope Agatho preſiding, Anno
Domini 680. against the Monothelites, and that in it were condemned Sergius,
Paulus, Petrus, Cyrus, and Theodore, who moſt impiouſly taught, but one will
and operation to be in Chriſt.</hi> But this Author deceitfully conceals it, that
the ſame Council in the thirteenth <hi>action,</hi> did ſolemnly condemn <hi>Honorius</hi> the
Pope of old <hi>Rome</hi> as a <hi>Monothelite</hi> together with the reſt; and again in the
Greek edition the firſt Chapter, and that Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> in his Epiſtle to the
ſixth Council, doth anathematize his predeceſſor <hi>Honorius</hi> as a Monothelite,
and Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the ſecond, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperor, inſerted
in the eighth action of the ſixth Synod, which was alſo done in the ſecond
<hi>Nicene</hi> Council, termed the ſeventh ſynod in the laſt action.</p>
                  <p>As for that which <hi>H. T.</hi> adds of <hi>the definitions of the ſixth Council againſt
Prieſts marriage, not giving grapes, mingling water and wine, adoration of the
Croſſe, conſideration in him that binds and looſeth, invocating Saints;</hi> it is not
worth while to inſiſt on the examination thereof, partly becauſe ſome of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions
ſerve not the purpoſe; for though it be granted, that there ought to
be a particular knowledge of the ſin of him that is to be abſolved by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of it, yet is not thereby the neceſſity of Popiſh auricular confeſſion
proved, or the Prieſts power judicially and authoritatively to abſolve, and
remit ſins eſtabliſhed, partly becauſe they are not all points of faith, but either
of diſciplin, as about the marriage of men in orders, or of Ceremonies, as about
the mingling of water and wine in the Euchariſt; and partly becauſe it is
doubtful whether thoſe Canons are truely aſcribed to that Council, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome reaſons tending to the contrary, and partly becauſe if they were
their determinations, there is little reaſon to aſcribe any authority to them,
after the firſt ſix hundred years barbariſm, and many corruptions being gotten
into the Chriſtian Churches, and the ſimplicity of the Chriſtian profeſſion
very much changed into contentions about Biſhops Sees, Eccleſiaſtical privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
humane ceremonies, and ſuch like abuſes: yet, were all granted which
he allegeth of the councils definitions, neither the now <hi>Roman</hi> ſupremacy nor
faith is proved, nor from the Catholick profeſſors, as he terms them, or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
converted are either of them avouched in that age.</p>
                  <p>In the eighth Century things grew worſe. In it <hi>H. T.</hi> reckons thirteen
<hi>Popes,</hi> among whom there's not a man, of whom their own writers relate any
thing that belongs to the Paſtors of the Church of Chriſt, to wit, the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Goſpel; but their intermedling with the buſineſs of the Empire and
Kingdoms, making Kings monks, contentions about images in Churches,
enlarging their dominions, building walls, making decrees about ſhaven
crowns and ſuch like toyes... Two Popes, <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> the ſecond,
can hardly be acquitted from being ſinfully inſtrumental in the depoſing of
<hi>Childerick</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and the traiterous uſurpation of <hi>Pepin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, <hi>in which H. T.</hi> ſaith, <hi>were three hundred
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119447:23"/>
and fifty Fathers, Pope Adrian preſiding,</hi> Anno Domini 787. <hi>againſt image
breakers, in which were decreed for images in Temples, and the veneration and
worſhip of the Saints, Reliques, Images,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Sens about tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>
though theſe things are but a few of the Popiſh doctrins, yet we grant,
that then the Popes had gotten to ſuch heighth as to juſtle Emperors, and
that the Churches in Communion with the Papacy were in that age and the
following ſo corrupt, as that traditions of men and decrees of Biſhops were
more regarded than the written Word; and that thereby placing of images
in Temples, and their worſhip got into the Chriſtian Churches to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of that Idolatry in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which hath made her <hi>the mother
of harlots, and of abominations of the earth:</hi> yet this was not done without
oppoſition, not only in the Greek Empire, but alſo in the Weſtern: <hi>Charles</hi> the
great calling a Council at <hi>Frankford,</hi> which condemned the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi>
Council.</p>
                  <p>And for <hi>the Catholick Profeſſors,</hi> ſuch as venerable <hi>Bede</hi> and others, though
they were tainted with the ſuperſtitions of thoſe times about monkery, and
ceremonies, and eccleſiaſtical dignities and orders, yet that they held the now
<hi>Roman</hi> faith cannot be demonſtrated, nor that the Nations mentioned to be
converted were converted to it. And for the miracles mentioned there is no
credit to be given to them, many ſuch tales having been made, or ſuch mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
counterfieted in thoſe dayes for deceiving the ignorant people: nor were
they done in ſuch manner and to ſuch purpoſes, as the miracles of Chriſt and
his Apoſtles were by which the Goſpel was confirmed.</p>
                  <p>In the nineteenth age <hi>H. T.</hi> reckons up eighteen Popes, omitting the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one of them as a woman; though a great number of Popiſh writers ſet
her down as Pope, and relate the ſtory of her ſitting in the chair ſome years, till
ſhe travailed with child in proceſſion. But if that were not true, yet the things
related by themſelves of <hi>Formoſus, Stephanus, Romanus</hi> ſhew cruelty and
wickedneſs in the Popes of that age, one hating and undoing what another
had done, and thereby ſhewing that they were rather of <hi>Cadmus,</hi> than St.
<hi>Peters</hi> race.</p>
                  <p>And for the fourth <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Council (Fathers one hundred and
one) Pope Adrian preſiding,</hi> Anno Domini 869. <hi>againſt Photius, and for the
Pope and images, and againſt temporal Princes medling in the election of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops;</hi>
it is an argument, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops were gotten then by many
wicked practices to a great heighth of unjuſt power. And the depoſition of
<hi>Photius</hi> for reproving the Emperor, together with his oppoſition of the Pope
(whoſe works extant do ſhew him to have been of more worth for learning
than any Pope in that age) and the Epiſtle of <hi>Ulderick</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auſpurg</hi> to
Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the firſt, in which he rebukes the wickedneſs of Popes in denying
marriage to the Clergy, do prove that the doctrin and tyranny of the Popes of
<hi>Rome,</hi> did not freely paſs without controul even in that age, which by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of <hi>Genebrard</hi> himſelf, <hi>Chron. l.</hi> 4. was an unhappy age for want of any
writer of worth in the Latin Church.</p>
                  <p>As for the Catholick profeſſors mentioned by <hi>H. T.</hi> in this age, that they
were all of the <hi>Roman</hi> church, or profeſſed her faith is not ſhewed: not that the
Nations converted, were either converted by the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, or owned
their now claimed ſupremacy or profeſſed faith; <hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith <hi>the Ruſſians were
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119447:23"/>
converted by a Prieſt ſent by the Emperor Baſilius,</hi> and therefore had their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
from the <hi>Greek</hi> church whom they followed, and with whom they
now hold communion, not acknowledging the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> ſupremacy
to this day, and therefore that inſtance is manifeſtly againſt <hi>H. T.</hi> his
purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>In the tenth age are reckoned twenty ſix Popes, whereof there's ſcarce any
that may be termed a Chriſtian, much leſs a chief Paſtor of the Chriſtian
churches. Their own ſtories tell us of ſome of them that got the Popedome
by means of <hi>Mororia</hi> a notorious whore, others by cruel practiſes: one, to
wit <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the ſecond, by the help of the Devil, whoſe agents they were in
bringing a deluge of ignorance and wickedneſs into the world, which made
that age to be termed <hi>a miſerable age, in which were neither famous writers, nor
Councils, nor Popes that cared for the publick, by Bellarmin in his book of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
writers,</hi> and of it <hi>H. T.</hi> here ſaith, <hi>in this tenth age or century I find no
general council, nor yet provincial in which any controverſie of moment was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.</hi>
So that by his own confeſſion, his catalogue of councils fails him.
And for his ſucceſſion of chief Paſtors, it is of ſuch perſons and ſo uncertain
a ſucceſſion, and by ſuch irregular ways, as yeilds proof that <hi>Rome</hi> was the
Synagogue of Satan, not the church of Chriſt. Of the catholick profeſſors
added, ſome of them, as <hi>Dunſtan, &amp;c.</hi> were ſuch, as it may be well doubted
whether they are in heaven or in hell. And for the Nations converted, it is not
proved they were of the now <hi>Roman</hi> faith.</p>

as any in hell; moſt of them magicians, if their own writers ſpeak truth:
<hi>from Sylveſter the ſecond, to Gregory the ſeventh, all Necromancers,</hi> ſaith <hi>Benno</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Of councils <hi>H. T.</hi> names but one, telling us, that <hi>in this eleventh age
about the year 1049. Berengarius an Archdeacon of Ghent</hi> (of <hi>Aniou</hi> he ſhould
have ſaid, miſtaking <hi>Gaudavenſis</hi> for <hi>Adegavenſis) began to broach his hereſie</hi>

Gregory the ſeventh,</hi> Anno 1073. <hi>where he abjured his hereſie in open council,
and died a Catholick after divers penances done for his ſin.</hi> But methinks
<hi>H. T.</hi> ſhould be aſhamed to mention <hi>Berengarius</hi> his forced abjuration, in

underſtand theſe words of Berengarius, you will fall into a greater hereſie than
ever he held any.</hi> And for his Catholick profeſſors and Nations converted,
wherein or how far they avowed the Popes ſupremacy, and the now <hi>Roman</hi>
faith is not ſhewed by him; nor do I believe he is able to prove, that they did
avouch the Popes ſupremacy which is now challenged, or in all things the now
<hi>Roman</hi> doctrin, though Romiſh ſuperſtitions, and the exceſſive eſteem of the
Popiſh Biſhops did very much corrupt men in thoſe days. If the ignorant
devotion of one <hi>Henricus</hi> the Emperor with his wife, make any thing for the
credit of the <hi>Roman</hi> papacy; the ſtory of another <hi>Henricus,</hi> to wit, the fourth,
his wife and childs uſage by <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh and other Popes is ſuch, as
that it demonſtrates the Popes of thoſe times to have been no ſucceſſors of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
either in doctrine or practice, but devils incarnate rather than men. And
however <hi>Anſelms</hi> learning ſeem to credit the papacy, yet in many points of
doctrin he is not for the now <hi>Roman</hi> tenents, as where he ſaith on <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.
<hi>ſalvation conſiſteth not in mans merits, but in Gods grace,</hi> and his contention
with the King of <hi>England,</hi> being animated by the Pope is an evidence, that the
faith of Chriſt was not ſo much profeſſed then as the greatneſs of Biſhops, and
the unrighteous ways of Clergymen.</p>
                  <p>In the twelfth age are reckoned up eighteen Popes and three Lateran coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
of which Popes it will be hard for <hi>H. T.</hi> to ſhew what their faith was, or
to prove they did orderly ſucceed, eſpecially conſidering how many Antipopes
were ſet up, and what abominable practices were uſed to get up into the chair,
and how wickedly they lived, as men that cared not what rebellions they raiſed,
what wars and bloodſheds they cauſed, not againſt infidels, but of ſubjects
againſt their ſoveraign Chriſtian Emperors; not for the Goſpel of Chriſt, or
their lawful liberties, but for the Popes moſt impudent claim of freedom from
ſubjection to Emperors, and inveſtiture of Biſhops and Abbats, things which
Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles never granted, but commanded the contrary.
Their own writers tell us ſo much of them, ſpecially of <hi>Calixtus</hi> the ſecond,
<hi>Innocent</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth, <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, and their mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
pride in oppreſſing and inſulting on the Emperors, beyond what is to
be found in any Prieſts of <hi>Pagan</hi> Gods towards the Princes of the earth, as
ſhews them to be inſpired by the devil, not guided by the Spirit of God. <hi>H. T.</hi>
adds three <hi>Lateran councils for inſtauration of diſcipline, for the right of the
Clergy, for reformation, with preſidency of Calixtus</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Anno</hi> 1122 of
<hi>Innocent</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Anno</hi> 1139. which he tells us <hi>defined little in matters
of controverſie,</hi> and ſo by his own confeſſion prove not his ſucceſſion in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119447:24"/>
profeſſion of the ſame faith. As for the ends in thoſe two councils, which he
mentions, all the inſtauration of diſciplin therein was concerning monks in
the former, and in the later, the right of the clergy was about the Biſhop of
<hi>Romes</hi> power in civil things at <hi>Rome,</hi> and exempting of clergy men from the
Senate and Conſuls of <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> deſired to be reſtored to
their ancient power in civil things, but the Pope and his council withſtood it,
anathematizing them that laid hands on a clergy man, yet limiting the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſome ſort. Theſe are the great buſineſſes of three hundred at one
time, and one thouſand Biſhops and Abbats at another time. Which may
ſhew how little the Popes and councils then regarded Chriſts doctrin or
precepts, but minded the upholding their own inventions and their uſurpations
of power.</p>
                  <p>The third Lateran Council, <hi>ſaith</hi> H. T. (Fathers three hundred) for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
Pope Alexander the third preſiding, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1179. condemned
Waldenſis the Merchant of Lyons, who taught the Apoſtles were lay men, that
lay men and women might conſecrate and preach, that clergy men ought to have
no poſſeſſions or properties, that oaths were unlawful in all caſes, that Prieſts
and Magiſtrates by mortal ſin fell from their dignity, and were not to be
obeyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His tenents were here defined againſt, and he himſelf ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe all this were true that he ſo taught, and that the Pope with his
council condemned him, what is this to prove <hi>H. T. his minor, that a council
in that age profeſſed the ſame faith with the now Roman againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants?</hi>
Are the contrary tenents any of the Articles, which in his <hi>Manual</hi>
of <hi>Controverſies H. T.</hi> defends againſt the Proteſtants? do the Proteſtant
churches in their confeſſions avow the ſame, which he here ſaith the council
aſcribed to <hi>Waldenſis</hi> the Merchant of Lyons? but to ſhew the ignorance of
this ſcribler, the perſon who was Merchant of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France</hi> was <hi>Petrus
Waldus,</hi> from whom his followers were termed <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> whom I find to have
been condemned in ſome council at <hi>Rome</hi> about that time, but in the <hi>Lateran
council</hi> 1179. I find other decrees about Prieſts continency, the number of
horſes clergy men might have in their viſitations, and the exemption of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks
from the judgement of Laicks, which it ſeems were the great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of reformation. As for the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> there is no cauſe to believe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
in their accuſations of them, eſpecially ſuch ignorant and malicious
men as the Friers and Monks of former and later times have been. Beſides
the experience which after ages yeilded about their belying <hi>Wicklef, Hus</hi> and
others; our own times yeild many examples of Papiſts falſly reporting the
tenents of Proteſtants. Though <hi>Bellarmin</hi> be more ingenuous in ſetting down
the Proteſtants doctrin than many other writers, yet there's ſcarce a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
wherein he doth not deal deceitfully in repreſenting the Proteſtants
doctrin or their arguments and anſwers. But the writings, profeſſions, apologies
put forth by <hi>Balthaſar Lydius</hi> in Latin, ſhew that the opinions of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi>
were not ſuch as the Papiſts repreſent them, and the words of <hi>Reinerius</hi> an
inquiſitor and enemy to them in his book of <hi>inquiſition</hi> concerning them,
doth more truely acquaint us what they were, which are thus, <hi>that whereas all
other ſects by the immanity of their blaſphemies againſt God do make men abhor
them, this of the Lyoniſts</hi> (the ſame with the <hi>Waldenſes) hath a great ſhew of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119447:25"/>
godlineſs, becauſe they live juſtly before men, and do believe all things well of
God, and all the articles which are contained in the Creed; only the Church of
Rome they do blaſpheme and hate.</hi> And now we have more full knowledge
of them, by Mr. <hi>Morlands</hi> hiſtory of the Evangelical Churches of
<hi>Piedmont.</hi> As for the Catholick profeſſors <hi>H. T.</hi> adds in this age,
though <hi>Bernardus Abbas,</hi> commonly called St. <hi>Bernard</hi> be reckoned
as a profeſſor of the new <hi>Roman</hi> faith, and it is not denied that
he was ſuperſtitious in ſome points; yet he freely noted divers corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

and others named, whether they were of good or bad note it is of little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

errors and ſuperſtitions. Nor is it of much advantage, that <hi>Nicolas</hi> the

bad enough, and the converſion, if to Romiſh ſuperſtition, rather than

The like were <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, in whoſe time the bloody factions of <hi>Guelphs</hi>
and <hi>Gibellius</hi> happened, and <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth whom <hi>Robert Groſthead</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Lincoln</hi> withſtood, contemning his excommunication, and being dead
was ſuch a terror to this wicked Pope as to haſten his death. <hi>Nicolas</hi> the
third, whom <hi>H. T.</hi> makes <hi>the converter of the Pomeranians and Norwegians,</hi>
raiſed the quarrel between <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France</hi> for <hi>Sicily,</hi>
whence grew the maſſacre of the <hi>French</hi> called <hi>the Sicilian Veſpers,</hi> and the
laſt and worſt of them, <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth is ſaid <hi>to have entred like a Fox,
reigned like a Lyon, died like a dog. H. T.</hi> adds <hi>two general Councils: the
fourth Lateran council (Fathers</hi> 1285.) <hi>Pope Innocent the third preſiding,</hi>
Anno 1215. And tells us, <hi>that this Council deſined that the univerſal Church
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119447:25"/>
of the faithful, is one out of which no man is ſaved.</hi> Which definition we
approve, and thereby the doctrin of the Proteſtants is confirmed; who teach,
that the Catholick Church we believe, is the inviſible Church of true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
and that the Catholick Church is not only the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and
thoſe who ſubject themſelves to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and profeſs the ſame
faith with the now <hi>Roman</hi> Church: but all the believers who believe the
doctrin of the Goſpel taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, though they neither
know nor own the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in the things therein held againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
nor acknowledge any ſuperiority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Catholick Church; and that it is not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (which
is falſly called Catholick) out of which none can be ſaved, but the univerſal
Church of the faithful; in which who ever is by true faith in Chriſt he may
be ſaved, though he diſclaims the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as Antichriſt, and the
faction or party joyning with him as the Synagogue of Satan; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that it is not as <hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader, the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
controverſie to know the notion and authority of the Church;</hi> but to
know the true faith, by which alone the true Church is known; and it is a
moſt impudent aſſertion, which <hi>H. T.</hi> takes on him in his firſt <hi>Article</hi> to
maintain, <hi>that the Church now in communion with the See of Rome is the only
true Church of God,</hi> unleſs he can prove none are believers but they. So that
this very definition of the <hi>Lateran</hi> council is ſufficient to overthrow the main
drift of <hi>H. T.</hi> in this book, and to ſhew how heedleſs or impudent a writer
he is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>H. T.</hi> tells us alſo that <hi>the fourth Lateran council defin'd in the profeſſion of
faith,</hi> can. 1. <hi>that the true body and blood of Chriſt is in the Sacrament of the
Altar under the forms of bread and wine, the bread being tranſubſtantiated by
the divine power into the body, and the wine into the blood.</hi> Which is granted,
if it be true, that the Council it ſelf did define any thing, and not Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
himſelf three years after the Council. <hi>Platina</hi> ſaith in his life, <hi>that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things then came into conſultation indeed, and yet not any thing could be
openly decreed.</hi> But were it the Council or the Pope alone that thus decreed,
it was a moſt bold and preſumptuous act in either or both to make that a point
of faith, of which, as <hi>Bellarm. tom. 3. cont. l. 3, c.</hi> 23. confeſſeth. <hi>Scotus</hi> in
<hi>quartum ſent. diſt. 11. q.</hi> 3. ſaid, <hi>that the tenent of tranſubſtantiation was no
tenet of faith before the Lateran Council,</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Cameracenſis</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſay, that <hi>neither by words of Scripture, nor by the Creeds, nor ſayings of
the ancients are we compelled to the tenet of tranſubſtantiation.</hi> And <hi>Cardinal
Cairt. in 3. Aq. q. 75. art.</hi> 1. ſaith, <hi>that nothing out of the Goſpel doth appear
to compel us to underſtand theſe words [this is my body] properly.</hi> To the ſame
purpoſe <hi>John Fiſher Biſhop of Rocheſter, contra. capt. Babylon c.</hi> 1. For which
reaſon <hi>Cuthbert Tonſtal l. 1. of the Euchariſt, p.</hi> 46. ſaid, <hi>perhaps it had been
better to have left every curious man to his conjecture, concerning the manner of
Chriſts body being in the Euchariſt, as before the Lateran Council it was left
at liberty,</hi> and therefore he was oſt heard to ſay, <hi>if he had been preſent at the
Lateran Council, he would have endeavoured to perſwade Pope Innocent to have
forborn the decreeing of tranſubſtantiation as an article of faith.</hi> And indeed
the reaſon of the Council is ſo groſly abſurd, that had there been any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
men at the making of the decree, it's likely it had not paſſed.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119447:26"/>
For this reaſon they give of their decree, <hi>that to perfect the myſtery of unity we
our ſelves may take of his what he received of ours, the bread being tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiate
into the body, the wine into blood by the divine power,</hi> intimates,
1. That the bread is tranſubſtantiate into the body and wine into the blood,
not either into body and blood, and then he that drinks not the wine drinks
not the blood, nor is it ſaid to be tranſubſtantiate into it as an animate body,
ſo that that determination makes it a tranſubſtantiation without life. 2. It
faith that <hi>we may receive of his what he receives of ours;</hi> which in plain
ſenſe intimates, that Chriſt receives our body and blood by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as we do his. 3. It makes this the myſtery of our unity, as if the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of our unity by faith were not perfect without this groſs <hi>Capernaitiſh</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibalitiſh
eating Chriſts very fleſh made from bread by a Prieſt, and drinking
his very blood with our mouth, in drinking tranſubſtantiate wine. All which
are ſuch groſs, irrational, unchriſtian abſurdities, as had not the age been block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,
and Popes and popiſh writers and people dementate, they would with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency
have rejected that determination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>H. T.</hi> adds, that <hi>the fourth Lateran Council, can. 1. defined in the profeſſion
of faith, that no man can make this Sacrament, but a Prieſt rightly ordained by
the keys of the Church given to the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors:</hi> which although
it be otherwiſe in the text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. expreſſeth, wherein <hi>the keys,</hi> not of
the Church but <hi>of the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> are mentioned as given to <hi>Peter,</hi>
not to the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors; yet were it true that the keys were
given to the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors, this would overthrow the Popes
ſupremacy if it be deduced from that gift of the keys. For if Chriſt himſelf
gave the keys of the Church to the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors, then not to
<hi>Peter</hi> only and his ſucceſſors, but to other Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors as well
as <hi>Peter,</hi> and conſequently according to their own principles to other Biſhops
as well as the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> As for the definition of the Council, that
<hi>none can make this Sacrament but a Prieſt,</hi> then it is to Prieſts only that it
is ſaid <hi>[do this]</hi> (for from thoſe words he deduceth, <hi>p.</hi> 215. the power to make
Chriſts body) but that is moſt abſurd, for then they only ſhould eat, <hi>the
doing this</hi> being meant plainly of eating the bread, being ſpoken not to the
Prieſt conficient only, but to all the Apoſtles at table alſo, and if ſo, not only
the cup ſhould be kept from the people, but the bread alſo, contrary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
16, 17. &amp; 11. 28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>H. T.</hi> tells us that <hi>they defined that baptiſm profits little ones as well as thoſe
who are of riper years unto ſalvation, and condemned the hereſie of Abbas Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achim,</hi>
which is nothing againſt the common tenet of the Proteſtants, though
it be ſuſpected, that if <hi>Abbat Joachim</hi> had not been a man, whoſe reputed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
and free ſpeeches againſt the Popes and the clergy troubled them, he
might have eſcaped that cenſure The <hi>definition concerning confeſſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
at Eaſter are points of diſciplin,</hi> not part of the profeſſion of faith, and
ſo impertinent to the preſent buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>H. T.</hi> mentions alſo <hi>the Council of Lyons (Fathers one hundred) Pope
Gregory the tenth preſiding,</hi> Anno 1274. againſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
againſt the common tenet of the Proteſtants, and that which is added,
<hi>this hitherto (ſaith the Council) the holy Roman Church (the mother and miſtris
of all Churches) hath preach'd and taught,</hi> (beſides the non-ſenſe how frequently
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119447:26"/>
ſoever it be uſed of the Churches preaching and teaching, who preach not
nor teach, but they are preached to and taught) it is but a piece of palpably
falſe flattery, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being not the mother of all Churches, it
being certain, that the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was before that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
<hi>Jeruſalem from above is ſtiled the mother of us all,</hi> Gal. 4. 26.</p>
                  <p>Among his <hi>Catholick profeſſors</hi> of this age <hi>H. T.</hi> nominates St. <hi>Dominick</hi>
and St. <hi>Francis, Inſtitutors of their holy orders of Friers,</hi> but how they
ſhould be Saints, whereof one was a bloody inſtigator of war againſt the
innocent ſheep of Chriſt the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and the other an obſerver of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
inventions, with neglect of Gods command to <hi>work with his hands the
thing that was good, that he might have to give to him that needs,</hi> and
how they ſhould be called a holy order, who were like to the inſtitutors,
but never appointed by God, I underſtand not. Many learned men in thoſe
daies demonſtrated them to be no holy orders, but a company of men that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
the Popes uſurpations and injuries, to the great miſchief of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
and Churches of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the Nations converted,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Caſſanes,</hi> with innumerable
<hi>Tartarians</hi> were not converted by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor owned the Popes
ſupremacy or faith, and therefore are no witneſſes for the Papacy.</p>
                  <p>In the fourteenth age ten Popes are ſet down, of whom moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Clement</hi> the fifth, who chained <hi>Francis Dandalus</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador

the twenty one, by others <hi>John</hi> the twenty ſecond, whom <hi>Bellarmin. de
Pontifice Rom. l. 4. c.</hi> 14. confeſſeth <hi>to have thought that the ſouls ſhould not
ſee God till after the reſurrection,</hi> though he adds a cold excuſe, as <hi>if he might
ſo think then without danger of hereſie, becauſe no definition of the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded:</hi>
which is not true if he ſay rightly himſelf, <hi>l. 1. de eccl. triumph. c.</hi> 2.
<hi>that the ſame,</hi> that is, <hi>that the ſouls ſee God afore the reſurrection, teacheth

However, if there were no definition, it proves a Pope may teach hereſie, ſith
<hi>John</hi> the twenty ſecond did earneſtly preſs this on the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> that they
ſhould believe as he did. Of the reſt their unpeaceableneſs in their contention
with the Emperor and among themſelves in their Schiſms, in which one Pope
was ſet up againſt another; divers Popes at the ſame time, one owned by one,
another by another, makes the ſucceſſion ſo uncertain, that even the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts
diſagree in the ſucceſſion, ſome putting in <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh in this

                  <p>H. T. <hi>adds</hi> one general Council of Vienna (Fathers three hundred) Pope
Clement the fifth preſiding, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1311. in which he tells us, the
Council defined baptiſm to be neceſſary for infants, condemned the Begards and
Beguines, who held carnal luſt done out of temptation to be no ſin, and that we
ought not to ſhew reverence at the elevation of the body of Chriſt, <hi>which laſt
alone is againſt Proteſtants in common. But the Council whether provincial
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119447:27"/>
or general, being ſwayed by a proud prelate,</hi> Clement <hi>the fifth, its no marvel it
ſhould make ſuch decrees as then were made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Catholick Profeſſors,</hi> there is ſcarce a man of any note, but <hi>Iro</hi> a
Canoniſt, whoſe profeſſion will be of little weight with conſiderate men.
That an Emperour of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> if made a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> did embrace the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Religion, and ſubmit to the Pope, is not likely. The reſt of the Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<hi>H. T.</hi> proves not to have been converted from <hi>Rome,</hi> or to have held
communion with the Pope, if they did, it avails little to prove <hi>H. T.</hi> his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>

                     <hi>H. T.</hi> tells us of <hi>two general Councils,, that of</hi> Conſtance, Anno 1415.
<hi>againſt</hi> John Wickliff, John Hus, <hi>and</hi> Hierom <hi>of</hi> Prague, <hi>Pope</hi> John <hi>the two
and twentieth, and</hi> Martin <hi>the fifth preſiding:</hi> but the main end of its calling
by <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperour, was the compoſing of the Troubles by three Popes
together, whom it depoſed, and decreed <hi>the Council to be above the Pope,</hi> which
is againſt the now <hi>Roman</hi> faith. It is true alſo, that they condemned ſundry
Articles of <hi>John Wickliff, John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> whereof ſome
were moſt falſely aſcribed to them, as the Works of <hi>John Wickliff</hi> and other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
do ſhew. And notwithſtanding the ſafe conduct given by <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>
the Emperour, to the perpetual infamy of the popiſh party, they <hi>judged he was
to deliver</hi> John Hus <hi>to be burned, Seſſ.</hi> 19. whereupon the Emperours ſolemn
faith was broken, and thereupon they were burned, and <hi>Wickliffs</hi> bones, as
they imagined, forty years after his death were digged up and burned in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

by the faithfull in both kindes, yet the cuſtom was confirmed of receiving
in one, and the requiring it in both judged an errour, and it was forbidden to be
given the people in both kindes, Seſſ.</hi> 13. The other Council <hi>H. T.</hi> mentions
<hi>is the Council of</hi> Florence, <hi>(Fathers</hi> 145.) <hi>Pope</hi> Eugenius <hi>preſiding,</hi> Anno
1439. <hi>againſt many Hereſies; which defined Pugatory, the Popes headſhip,

                     </gap> in oppoſition to the Council of
<hi>Baſil,</hi> which was decreed by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, to be ten years after the
Council of <hi>Conſtance:</hi> and the end of it was to divert the Fathers of the
Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> from depoſing <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth from his Popedom, which
nevertheleſs they did for his ill Government, and choſe <hi>Amadeus</hi> Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi>

and the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which together with the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> had
determined that <hi>a general Council was above the Pope, and were not bound to
obey him, but might depoſe him,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> churches yet to this day do hold,
ſo that they who are termed <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and owned as children of the church,
yet do not profeſs the now-<hi>Roman</hi> faith of the Popes ſupremacy, which <hi>H T.</hi>
and the Jeſuited party among Papiſts the Popes flatterers aſcribe to him. As
for the preſence of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> it was of a few
needy ones driven out or brought low by the <hi>Turks,</hi> who yielded to that in the
Council for ſome relief to them in their low eſtate, which the <hi>Greek</hi> churches
after would not own, nor do yet to this day. And therefore that which <hi>H. T.</hi>
hath done in ſetting down the Popes and Councils of this Age is done deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
concealing the true ſtate of things, and ſo he hath done of <hi>Catholick
Profeſſors,</hi> mentioning ſome of ſmall worth, but leaving out <hi>Gerſon, Picus
Mirandulanus,</hi> and ſome others, though in communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> church,
and men of more abilities and repute than many of thoſe he ſets down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Gerſon</hi> held <hi>that the Church might be without a Pope,</hi> in his book <hi>de au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feribilitate

                  <p>As for the Nations converted, which he mentions, they are names of people
ſaid to be in <hi>Africa;</hi> but whether there be ſuch people, or are converted, or
what numbers of them have been converted is known onely by the vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
Writings of ſome popiſh Writers of that ſort, who for the extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Papacy, either feign that which is not, or it is likely make a

                     <hi>H. T.</hi> mentions two general Councils <hi>the laſt</hi> Lateran <hi>Council Pope</hi> Julius
<hi>the ſecond and</hi> Leo <hi>the tenth preſiding, 1512. I finde not the certain number of
Fathers, it was a general Council.</hi> But <hi>Bellarmine lib. 2. de concil. auth. cap.</hi> 13.
ſaith, <hi>Some doubt whether it were truly general:</hi> and there was reaſon, ſith it
was called by a Faction adhering to <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond to eſtabliſh his tyranny
in oppoſition to another party gathered in <hi>France</hi> to eſtabliſh the <hi>pragmatick
Sanction.</hi> But what did this Council define? <hi>The ſoul of man immortal, and
that there be as many humane ſouls as bodies, anathematizing all ſuch as obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
defend or hold the contrary in the communion of the Church of</hi> Rome,
<hi>Seſſ</hi> 8. A point which a Council of Philoſophers might have decided.
However it intimates there were that did then hold or teach the contrary in the
communion of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that Pope <hi>John</hi> the two and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Doctrine was not quite extinguiſhed: but this Council is of little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
among a great party of the Papiſts themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is the other Council
the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third and <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth preſiding againſt
<hi>Martin Luther</hi> and his fellow Proteſtants, <hi>Anno</hi> 1546. of which he ſaith, <hi>The
definitions are conformable to thoſe of all precedent general Councils for us,
and againſt Sectaries, as our Adverſaries know, and cannot deny.</hi> But this is
moſt falſe, it being by Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> and many other learned Proteſtants aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and proved, that the Decrees of that Council in many points about the
Popes power, half communion, tranſubſtantiation, worſhiping Images, and
other points are contrary to the Councils and Fathers for the firſt five hundred
years at leaſt. And for this Council not onely <hi>Sleidan,</hi> but alſo Frier <hi>Paul,</hi> a
man greatly honoured by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate for his learning, prudence, and
integrity in his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Trent Council</hi> hath ſhewed, that it was nothing
but a meer packed and fraudulent conventicle of a crue of prelates, moſt of
them <hi>Italians,</hi> ſome meerly titular, and the Popes penſioners and paraſites, few
of them who had any knowledge in the Scripture or Divinity, but canoniſts,
courtiers, and ſchool-men, who underſtood not the Proteſtants Doctrine in
the great point of juſtification by faith, carried on by <hi>Paul</hi> the third, <hi>Julius</hi>
the third, <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, and their Legates to cheat the World by innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
artifices, not onely hindring the freedom of ſpeech of the Proteſtants in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119447:28"/>
the Council, but alſo of ſome of the popiſh Biſhops, when they endeavoured to
recover the right of Biſhops taken away from them by the Popes, in ſo much
that not onely the Proteſtants have proteſted againſt it, but alſo the <hi>French</hi>
Kings, by their Embaſſadours and Parliaments, and it is not owned by the
<hi>French</hi> popiſh churches unto this day, and the vanity and impiety of its
Decrees hath been detected by <hi>Kemnitius, Calvin,</hi> and innumerable learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
proteſtants, beſides what may be gathered from the contrary Writings
of perſons, who were there, as <hi>Catharinus, Soto, Vega,</hi> and others; in ſo
much that if men were not blinded with prejudice and faction they would
eaſily diſcern that Council to have been a corrupt Synod juſtly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted.</p>
                  <p>As for the catholick profeſſours he mentions, their profeſſion adds but little
credit to their cauſe. For what advantage is it to prove the truth of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Tridentin</hi> Doctrine that it was profeſſed by <hi>Catharina</hi> a woman, or <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Loyola</hi> a lame Souldier, the hypocritical Deviſer of the Order of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
the Incendiaries of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> States, and corrupters of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nobility
and people by their abominable Devices in reſolving caſes of conſcience ſutably
to the luſts of men rather than the will of God, (as is ſhewed in the late book of
the <hi>Myſtery of Jeſuitiſm)</hi> or by <hi>Edmund Campian</hi> a bold talkative calumniator,
and a traiterous zelot for the Popes tyranny, or by <hi>William Allen</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Fugitive, who wrote ſeditious books to apologize for <hi>Stanley</hi>'s Treachery, and
to provoke Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Subjects to Rebellion againſt ſo good a Prince?
And for <hi>the great multitudes converted in</hi> Italy, Spain, Germany, India, Japo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
China, <hi>by Prieſts and Religious of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and likewiſe ſome
conſiderable perſons of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation, even in the heat of Perſecution,</hi>
they are ſhort of that which was undertaken of the converſion of Nations.
The converſions in the Weſt <hi>Indies</hi> have been by horrid cruelties of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
depopulating many countreys, in which were millions of people, to get
their Treaſure, not to the faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but to the <hi>Roman</hi> yoak and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt their will, which hath made <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion-odious, and the
Name of God to be blaſphemed. Thoſe of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japonia</hi> are fictions,
or ſo obſcure, as that they are not conſiderable. The converſions in <hi>Spain,
France, Germany, Polonia,</hi> have been by fire and faggot, the bloody Inquiſition,
perſecutions, Maſſacres, and ſuch like arguments fetcht from Hell. The hot
perſecution of Papiſts here in <hi>England</hi> is, as all know that know <hi>England,</hi> a
meer fiction: ſome mulcts and reſtraints have been put on popiſh perſons, but
none put to death meerly for being Papiſts, but for that which the Law made
Treaſon, being forced to it by their inceſſant traiterous practices, and yet theſe
alſo are executed ſparingly. The converſions to Popery in <hi>England</hi> have been
by various artifices upon various inducements, whereof none of them is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from the canonical Scripture of the truth of popiſh Doctrine (they dare
not ſtick to it without help of unwritten tradition, and the Popes or his
Councils explication, which they muſt receive, though contrary to the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their own moſt learned and judicious Writers in their Commentaries) but
the devices which they uſe are calumniating Proteſtant Writers, miſ-repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Doctrine, forging Writings of the Ancients, purging out of them
ſuch paſſages as make againſt them, which do take effect by the levity of ſome,
prejudice, diſcontent, or ſome ſuch like ill affection of others. And though

                     <hi>Campian</hi> after his vain-glorious manner boaſted of <hi>turning ten thouſand in one

at this day the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have not brought all the Papiſts under the Popes girdle:
which makes the Pope cautelous how he determins controverſies among his

oppreſſed Kingdom ſet up a Patriarch of its own. So that I may ſay it is an
impoſſible task for this Scribler <hi>H. T.</hi> or any of his party to make a true ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of chief Paſtors or Councils, or approved Doctors in all ages for the
Popes ſupremacy, tranſubſtantiation, communion under one kind, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of images, invocation and worſhiping of deceaſed Saints and their reliques;
but a better catalogue may be made of more godly perſons (with whom their
Popes for this one thouſand years are not to be compared, their own writers
being Judges) who have oppoſed theſe doctrins of the now <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> as hath
been ſhewed by many learned men to the eternal confuſion of Popiſh novelties,
then this Author hath here, or any Popiſh writer elſewhere hath made, to
prove a ſucceſſion of Paſtors, Councils, Profeſſors and Nations avouching
the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> opinions, which were never ſo avouched or enjoyned as now
they are in Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth his new Creed, till about one hundred years
ago. And to this inſolent demand, <hi>where was your Church before Luther?</hi>
Proteſtants may reply to Papiſts, where was your church which believed, as
you now do, before <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh, <hi>Innocent</hi> the third,
and <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth? The ſpeeches of the Fathers for the churches continued
ſucceſſion, do none of them prove the major of <hi>H. T.</hi> his Syllogiſm, <hi>that is
the only true Church of God, which has had a continued ſucceſſion from Chriſt
and his Apoſtles to this time,</hi> meaning it of local perſonal ſucceſſion, of which
<hi>H. T.</hi> means it, but only of ſucceſſion in holding the ſame doctrin. Nor do
any of them prove <hi>H. T.</hi> his <hi>minor, that the church now in communion with the
See of Rome and no other, has had a continued ſucceſſion from Chriſt and his
Apoſtles to this time,</hi> for they were all dead above a thouſand years afore this
time. All that can be proved, is that in caſe of hereſies or Schiſms they made
uſe of the ſucceſſion in the <hi>Roman</hi> church, (which was then leſs tainted then
ſome others) to repreſs them, yet ſo as that they alleged a ſucceſſion in other
churches as well as it, but none ever, as this Author, held it neceſſary, that
all churches ſhould own the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> ſupremacy, or the <hi>Roman</hi>
churches communion how corrupt ſoever they ſhould prove: only while they
continued uncorrupt in the faith they held communion with them, and ſo
ſhould we, if they would embrace the primitive purity of doctrine and worſhip,
which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and other Apoſtles firſt taught in the churches of Chriſt,
of which that at <hi>Rome,</hi> though not the firſt, yet was one of the moſt famous, and

                     <hi>H. T. takes upon him to</hi> ſolve objections againſt the Churches continued

at that time in <hi>Iſrael</hi> (where he was) who had not howed their knees to
<hi>Baal:</hi> and in the Kingdom of <hi>Juda</hi> there was then publick profeſſion of
the true religion in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> paralip. 22. 14, 15. ſo that conſequence is
falſe.</p>
                  <p>To which I reply, this author ſhews himſelf deceitful in ſetting down our
tenet and argument, and ſlighty in his anſwer. For the tenet of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
is not, that the Church hath failed, and that there is no continued
ſucceſſion of men in the viſible Church, who have held forth the truth againſt
Popiſh innovations. But that ſometimes they have been by perſecution ſo
obſcured, as that however they have been diſcernable among themſelves, yet
not ſo to adverſaries, and to others of their brethren at a farther diſtance; nor
perhaps have they been ſo conſpicuous, as that a catalogue might be made of
the ſucceſſion of Paſtors and people in the ſame place in every age, but oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they have been ſo diſperſed, as to be in one age or time in one Country,
and another time in another; and that the monuments of their being and
doctrine, have been in part loſt and in part obſcured by inundations of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
nations, perſecutions of Popes and Popiſh Princes, and their knowledge
and profeſſion hath been ſometimes larger, ſometimes leſs, and ſtill miſreported
by adverſaries. Nevertheleſs, that is, though they have been in ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity,
they have been true Churches of Chriſt; and notwithſtanding we
cannot prove ſuch a ſucceſſion in any one City or Country of Paſtors and
people in every thing agreeing with us, yet we may be a true Church as long
as we hold the true faith once delivered to the Saints, and now upon record in
the holy Scriptures, though we ſubmit not to the Pope as chief Paſtor, nor
own the now <hi>Roman</hi> doctrin in the articles required in the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius</hi>
the fourth to be profeſſed over and above the ancient Creeds. In a word this
we aſſert, that the defect of a catalogue ſuch as <hi>H. T.</hi> requires, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity
of profeſſors nullifies not the verity of the Proteſtant Churches.
And this is proved by the objection thus. If there were a true Church in
<hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Elias</hi> his days, which was ſo hidden as that <hi>Elias</hi> knew them not,
and ſo could make no catalogue of them; then there may be a true Church,
whoſe profeſſors may be ſo obſcure, as that neither in the ſame, nor in after
ages a catalogue of them can be aſſigned. But ſo it was; as appears by <hi>Elias</hi>
his complaint, and Gods anſwer, 1 <hi>King. 19. 10, 14, 18. Ergo,</hi> there may
be a true Church whoſe profeſſors may be ſo obſcure, as that neither in the ſame
nor in after ages a catalogue of them can be aſſigned. Now what doth he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer?

what ſenſe the ſpeech bears according to that figure, nor how it ſerves for his

an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> or <hi>Synecdoche</hi> would make the ſpeech non-ſenſe <hi>[I,</hi> that is a few or

to the intent of the ſpeech, <hi>[I]</hi> being in the firſt perſon and that doubled,
[few or many] in the third: to ſay [few or many are left alone] when <hi>[alone]</hi>
excludes few, many, any more then one: to ſay <hi>[they ſeek my life,</hi> that is of

                     </gap> the occaſion,
end of the ſpeech, and anſwer of God ſhew ſuch an expoſition would be the
conceit of a man extreme ſhallow or impudent. And his reaſon is as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
<hi>God himſelf told Elias in the ſame chapter,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>that he had ſeven
thouſand at that time in Iſrael (where he was) therefore Elias ſpake figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
when he complained he was left alone,</hi> 3 Kings 19. Nay the contrary
follows, that he did not ſpeak figuratively, becauſe God corrects him, and ſhews
his miſtake in ſaying <hi>he was left alone,</hi> that is, there were no more beſides
himſelf left. 2. But yet if it were granted that the ſpeech is figurative, and
the meaning as <hi>H. T.</hi> would have it, it no whit avoids our objection, that
the Church of God, though conſiſting of ſeven thouſand, yet were ſo obſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ure
that they appeared ſo few to <hi>Elias,</hi> as that he took himſelf to be left alone.
As for the other exception <hi>of the Kingdom of Juda,</hi> it takes not away the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
as the Proteſtants frame it, but as <hi>H. T.</hi> frames it, it is not our obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and ſo though the conſequence be falſe, yet it hurts not us, who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not hence the failing of the Church, but the obſcurity of it, and that
there may be a true Church, which is ſo hidden, that it is not diſcerned at
ſome times, no not by ſuch an eminent Prophet as <hi>Elias;</hi> and ſo though we
cannot ſhew our Church in every age before <hi>Luther,</hi> yet there might be then,

                  <p>To which I reply, If the <hi>Arian</hi> fury laſted but four years, and in the Eaſtern

ſucceſſion had ceaſed, and the Eaſtern Churches then were ſo obſcure, that

ſo far, as to bring <hi>Liberius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſubſcribe to the council
of <hi>Ariminum.</hi> Nor do I know how the words of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> yeild any thing in
anſwer to the objection, that in the time of the <hi>Arian</hi> prevalency the Church
was ſo obſcured, that the whole world ſeemed to be <hi>Arians;</hi> therefore the
Churches ſucceſſion may be ſo interrupted or obſcured at leaſt, as that a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of it's paſtors and profeſſors at all times cannot be framed. For ſuppoſe
the meaning of the ſpeech ſhould be, that the words concerning the number of
<hi>Arians ſeem to be addreſſed to all, when they reach home only to ſome few:</hi> yet,
if the words ſhew the number ſo great, as that the other part of the Church
were obſcured ſo as not to be diſcerned, they ſerve to prove there may be
Churches, which are ſo hidden as that a catalogue cannot be framed.</p>
                  <p>But the objection is further preſſed thus. Object, <hi>St.</hi> Hierom <hi>ſays, the
whole world groan'd and admired to ſee it ſelf become Arian (in his book againſt</hi>
Luciferius.) <hi>To which</hi> H. T. <hi>ſaith.</hi> Anſw. <hi>If ſhe wondred, ſhe knew not
when it was done, if ſhe groaned, ſhe approved it not being done, therefore the
major part were ſtill Catholick.</hi> To which I reply, if <hi>H. T.</hi> did not preſume
he ſhould meet with ſilly readers, he would not have thus frivolouſly inferred
from thoſe words which were delivered to ſhew the <hi>Arians</hi> to be the greater
part, that the <hi>major</hi> part was ſtill Catholick. For who knows not that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is Rhetorical and the meaning this, that <hi>Arians</hi> prevailed ſo much,
that the whole world, that is all the churches of the Eaſt and Weſt were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
that they were burdened with <hi>Arians</hi> as a man that groans under a
burden, and that on ſuch a ſudden, as that the accident was as it were a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
now from ſuch Catachreſtical metaphors to infer as if they were proper,
<hi>that while the world was Arian, it knew not it was done, or approved it not,</hi> is all
one as to ſay, when they were <hi>Arians</hi> they knew not, nor liked <hi>Arian</hi> doctrine;
that is while they were <hi>Arians</hi> they were not <hi>Arians,</hi> which is to make <hi>Hieroms</hi>
ſpeech ſelf-contradicting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> H. T. <hi>adds,</hi> Let St. <hi>Hierom</hi> anſwer for himſelf. The Biſhops (ſaith
he againſt <hi>Luciferius)</hi> that did the fact of <hi>Ariminum</hi> were deluded <hi>(viz.</hi> by the
new Creed there made, which might have born a good ſenſe) few defending
the fact, and ſome lamenting it. And St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> tells us, that the church
then appeared in her moſt conſtant members, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and others, <hi>ep.</hi> 48.</p>
                  <p>To which I reply, It is true, that when they came to ſee their error they did
lament it, yet were for the time <hi>Arians,</hi> and though <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did not yeild
to ſubſcribe to it, yet <hi>Liberlus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> did. And I believe <hi>H. T.</hi> his
fellow Papiſts will not allow his ſpeech, <hi>that the decree made at</hi> Ariminum
<hi>might have born a good ſenſe.</hi> It is added by <hi>H. T.</hi> thus. Obj. <hi>The church
will fail in the time of Antichriſt according to that, unleſs there come a revolt
firſt,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3. Anſw. <hi>No, ſhe will not; ſhe ſhall then ſuffer great
perſecution,</hi> Apoc. 20. 8. <hi>and therefore ſhall be to ſuffer: many will revolt, all
ſhall not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I reply, that if the revolt be of ſo many and the perſecution ſo great, as that
they ſhall be diſperſed and obſcured ſo as not to appear; it is ſufficient
to prove the ſucceſſion to be then either ſo interrupted as not to be, or
ſo obſcured as not to be diſcerned by enemies or brethren further off,
and ſo as that the making a catalogue of Paſtors and profeſſors in that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119447:31"/>
age, cannot be expected juſtly from the churches in after ages, which is
enough for our purpoſe to ſhew, that the defect of ſuch a catalogue ſhews
not the nullity of the Proteſtant churches, nor is with any juſtice or
reaſon ſuch a catalogue of Paſtors and profeſſors in all ages required of
them by Papiſts: Yet, however this Author conceives, his fellows the
<hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> Annot. on 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3. think the Apoſtaſie ſhall be ſo great, as
that Antichriſt ſhall pull down generally all kind of religious worſhip, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that which muſt be done to himſelf alone: nor is that, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.
8. to the contrary. For neither is it certain that time is the time of
Antichriſts reign, nor, if it were, doth it appear, that the thing done is
afore the end of that reign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> H. T. <hi>adds.</hi> Obj. What if men would not perſevere? how then?
you hold freewill, I hope. <hi>Anſw.</hi> With St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> as
if the holy Ghoſt were ignorant what would be the freewill of men, which
yet foreſeeing, he foretold that the church of Chriſt ſhould endure for ever.
<hi>de unit.</hi> Eccleſ. cap. 12.</p>
                  <p>I reply, what Proteſtant hath thus objected I know not. The poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the militant churches ceaſing, is ſufficiently proved by the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the acts of freewill to be undetermined, or undeterminable by God.
Nor doth the anſwer avoid it. For though, if the anſwer be good, the
futurition of the churches failing follows not from the holding of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will;
yet it ſhews not but that it may be, and perhaps it will be hard
for him to avoid the objection, that if mans will be not determined by
Gods decree, which is meant by freewill among that ſort of writers: then
the Holy Ghoſt cannot foreſee that the church militant will endure for
ever, it being in reaſon impoſſible, that there ſhould be certain foreſight
of that which is not certain to be afore that act of freewill in man
which God himſelf cannot determine: A certain preſcience of that which
is purely contingent, may be or not be before it, notwithſtanding any
purpoſe in God, is according to all principles of reaſon impoſſible. If
this Author hold with many of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> mans freewill, not to be
determined by Gods decree and influx on the will of man, or the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its
middle knowledge, he hath enough of Papiſts to oppoſe him. I have

Succeſſion from Chriſt to this time, and ſhall have from hence to the end of the
world, as hath been proved. But the Proteſtant Church (and ſo of all other
Sectaries) hath not a continued Succeſſion from Chriſt to this time. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Proteſtant Church is not the true Church of God. The Minor
(which onely remains unproved) is cleared by the conceſſion of our moſt learned
Adverſaries, who freely and unanimouſly confeſs, that before Luther made his
ſeparation from the Church of Rome for nine hundred or a thouſand years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the whole world was Catholick, and in obedience to the Pope of Rome,
there being no Proteſtants any where to be found, or heard of. Let therefore
our Enemies be our Judges, Calvin, Hoſpinian, White, Norton, Bancroft,
Jewel, Chamier, Brochard, Whitaker, Bucer, Perkins, Bale, Voyon, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliander.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> IT hath not been proved, that every true Church of God hath had
a continued Succeſſion from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to this time: many true
Churches have had no Predeceſſors, and ſo no Succeſſion, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Churches certainly had not Succeſſion, there being none
before them, they had not been primitive if there had been prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and ſundry Churches have been true Churches, who have had none after
them in the ſame place, when their Candleſtick hath been removed. And
therefore it is moſt falſe, which he here vainly ſaith he hath proved, <hi>that the
true Church of God</hi> (meaning every true Church of God, without which his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi>
is not univerſal, and ſo his Syllogiſm naught) <hi>hath had a continued ſucceſſion;</hi>
(meaning without interruption of perſons, which may be named in the ſame
place, profeſſing the ſame Faith with the now <hi>Roman</hi> Church in every point,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119447:32"/>
which is his meaning and is onely for his purpoſe) <hi>from Chriſt to this time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> he
hath not proved it, no not in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, nor in thoſe that are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with it under the Pope. Nor hath he proved at all <hi>that every true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Church on earth ſhall have ſuch a continued Succeſſion from hence to the end
of the world.</hi> The prophecies he alleged are ſhewed not to ſpeak what he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verres.
And for his <hi>Minor,</hi> though it is granted, that the Proteſtant Church
under that name, as ſo termed, hath not been ancient, yet the Proteſtant
Church in reſpect of that Faith they hold hath been from the beginning, and
hath continued as the Church of God in perſecution ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
leſs pure, ſometimes larger, ſometimes ſmaller, ſometimes more obſcure,
ſometimes more conſpicuous, ſometimes in one place, ſometimes in another,
and in reſpect of their Proteſtation againſt popiſh Doctrines, the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
Tranſubſtantiation, half-communion, propitiatory Sacrifice of the
Maſs, prayer in an unknown Tongue, Worſhip and Invocation of Saints, and
other popiſh Errours, it hath had Churches and perſons who have, as they
have been urged on them, oppoſed them, ſometime more, ſometime fewer,
ſometimes in a more open, ſometimes in a more ſecret way, as perſecution per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and God ſtirred up their ſpirits. It is moſt falſe, <hi>that the moſt learned
Adverſaries of the</hi> Romaniſts <hi>do freely and unanimouſly confeſs, that before</hi>
Luther <hi>made his Separation from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>for nine hundred or a
thouſand years together, the whole World was Catholick, and in obedience to the
Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>there being no Proteſtants any where to be found or heard of.</hi>
Sure the <hi>Grecians</hi> were part of the World, and <hi>H. T.</hi> himſelf confeſſeth here
<hi>pag. 48. there was a Revolt of them from the</hi> Roman <hi>Church after ſeven or eight
hundred years, and they were united again to the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of</hi> Florence, <hi>Seſſ. laſt,</hi> which himſelf ſaith, <hi>p. 34 was in the year</hi> 1439. ſo that
by his own account their Revolt was ſix hundred years at leaſt, beſides what is
manifeſt of the <hi>Arminians</hi> and others. And ſure the <hi>Huſſites, Wickleviſts,
Waldenſes,</hi> and thoſe who went before them (whom <hi>Rainerius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Some
counted to have been from Pope</hi> Sylveſter<hi>'s time, ſome from the Apoſtles)</hi> were a
part of the whole World, and many Proteſtants: <hi>Illyricus, Fox, White,</hi> with
others, deny to have obeyed the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> afore <hi>Luther,</hi> and averre that
they were, though not in name, yet in truth Proteſtants in ſome at leaſt of the
chief points againſt the now popiſh Doctrine. And therefore that which <hi>H. T.</hi>
hath recited in this Speech is manifeſt untruth. Yea Dr. <hi>Richard Field</hi> a
learned man, in his <hi>Appendix</hi> to his <hi>third Book of the Church,</hi> hath proved it
notwithſtanding <hi>Brerely</hi> his wonderment, <hi>that the Weſtern Churches afore</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>were Proteſtant, and the maintainers of the now</hi> Roman <hi>Faith onely a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in it.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath demonſtrated in his <hi>Demonstration of the
Probleme this Poſition, No Apoſtle, no holy Father, no ſound Catholik for twelve
hundred years after</hi> Chriſt <hi>did ever hold or profeſs that Doctrine of all the
Principles and Grounds of Religion, that is now taught by the Church of</hi> Rome,
<hi>and authorized by the Council of</hi> Trent. Nor do the Speeches of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Writers amount to that which he produceth them for. He himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeth
<hi>p.</hi> 41. out of <hi>Auguſtin Epiſt. 48. that even the Canonical Scriptures have
this cuſtome, that the word ſeems to be addreſſed to all, when it reaches home one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſome few,</hi> and thereby he would interpret the complaints that were made
of the whole world becoming <hi>Arian,</hi> when <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and others were not.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119447:33"/>
And he might have ſo interpreted the Speeches he allegeth of <hi>Hospinian</hi> and
the reſt. I have not all the Books he citeth; but ſome of their words I finde
not as this Author would have them. Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> having ſaid, <hi>pag.</hi> 208.
<hi>And to be ſhort, all the World this day crieth and groaneth after the Gospel,</hi>
adds, <hi>And all theſe things are come to paſs at ſuch time as to any mans reaſon it
might ſeem impoſſible: when all the World, the People, Prieſts, and Princes
were overwhelmed with ignorance: when all Schools, Prieſts, Biſhops, and
Kings of the World were ſworn to him, that whatſoever he took in hand they
would uphold it.</hi> Which Speeches are to be underſtood onely of the Weſtern
Empire, as when it is ſaid <hi>Luke 2. 1. A Decree went out that all the World
ſhould be taxed,</hi> it is meant onely of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and when <hi>John</hi> 12.
19. <hi>The World is gone after him,</hi> it is meant by an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> of a great part,
ſo the words of Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> are to be underſtood as is uſual in ſuch rhetorical
expreſſions, though the words are not as this Authour ſets them down, <hi>that the
whole World, Princes, Prieſts, and People were bound by Oath to the Pope,
Jewel Serm. on Luke</hi> 11. In like manner when <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib. 4. inſtit. c.</hi> 18.
<hi>ſect. 18. that the abominations of the Maſs preſented to drink in a golden Cup
hath ſo made drunk all the Kings and People of the Earth, from the firſt to the
laſt,</hi> he alluding to the words <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 3. is to be conceived, as in that Scripture
and many more, to be underſtood by an exceſs of Speech a great part, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of whom the reſt are as if they were not. To the ſame purpoſe were
the words of <hi>Perkins Expoſition of the Creed, vol. 1. pag. 260. col. 2. c.</hi> as the
whole period recited ſhews, which is this, <hi>And during the ſpace of nine hundred
years from the time of</hi> Boniface, <hi>the Popiſh Hereſie,</hi> to wit, of the Popes
Supremacy, <hi>ſpread it ſelf over the whole Earth, and the faithfull Servants of
God were but as an Handfull of Wheat in a Mountain of Chaff, which can
ſcarce be diſcerned.</hi> The next words of Dr. <hi>White</hi> himſelf in the ſame period
ſhews his meaning to be of freedom wholly, and of appearing conſpicuouſly,
and to the World viſibly to be ſeen by all, and ſeparated from the reſt. For thus
it follows, <hi>And whether any company at all, known or unknown, were free from it
wholly or not, I neither determine nor greatly care.</hi> Nor do I queſtion but that
the ſame is the meaning of the reſt, if their words were rightly cited, and the
Reader might perceive how they are wreſted by <hi>H. T.</hi> againſt their meaning:
and they wrote thoſe expreſſions in like meaning with thoſe paſſages of holy
Scripture which complain of corruption as univerſal, when the greateſt or moſt
conſpicuous part are ſo, as <hi>Pſalm 12. 1. Micah 7. 2. Phil.</hi> 2. 21.</p>

                     <p>The Argument of H. T. to prove the nullity of the Proteſtant Churches for

                  <p>H. T. further argues thus, Without a continued number of Biſhops, Prieſts,

Chriſt and his Apoſtles to this time, a continued Succeſſion cannot be had. But
Proteſtants have no continued number of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Laicks, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

Proteſtants have no continued Succeſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles to
this time. The Major is manifeſt, becauſe it proceeds from the Definition to the

able, nor ever will, to aſſign any ſuch number of men whom they have ſucceeded
in their nine and thirty Articles, or Luther in his Auguſtan Confeſſion, when

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. THis Argument is thus juſtly retorted; Without a continued num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Laicks, ſucceeding one another in
the profeſſion of the ſame Faith from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles to this time a
continued Succeſſion cannot be had. But Papiſts have no continued number

of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, the Articles in the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth,
or any other ſet number of Tenets expreſly holding and denying all the ſame

they have ſucceeded in their <hi>Trent</hi> Canons, and the Articles of the Creed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to be profeſſed and ſworn to in the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth. If
any man pretend to ſuch a Catalogue, let him name none but ſuch as held ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely

and denying the ſame points, that the late Faction of <hi>Romaniſts</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi>
popiſh Sectaries granted and denied, or that our new Reformers the Jeſuites

cannot be eſteemed Catholiks. Let him not name <hi>Chriſt, John Baptist, Peter,

Saints reigning with <hi>Chriſt</hi> are to be worſhipped and prayed unto, nor their

them honour and veneration is to be given, nor that the power of Indulgences
(ſuch as the Pope grants) was left by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Church, nor that the uſe
thereof is moſt wholeſome to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s people, nor that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is

Apoſtles, and Vicar of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Neither let them name the Popes
Councils or Fathers for the firſt five hundred years, for they held not theſe
points. Papiſts pretence to the Fathers of the firſt five hundred years is very
idle, becauſe were it true, as it is moſt falſe, that thoſe Fathers were Papiſts, yet
could not that ſuffice to prove them a continued Succeſſion of ſixteen hundred
years. Secondly, becauſe thoſe of the ſixth Age muſt needs know better what
was the Religions and Tenets of them who lived in the fifth Age by whom
they were inſtructed, and with whom they daily converſed, then our modern
Papiſts can now do, and they have not proteſted on their ſalvation that it was
the very ſame with the now popiſh Doctrine, nor that they received it from
them by word of mouth, and ſo from age to age: and finally, becauſe if our
Tenets in which we differ from Papiſts, and are oppoſed by them, be taught
and approved by the Fathers of the firſt five hundred years, then it is wholly
impoſſible they ſhould be for Papiſts and againſt us. But our Doctrines (in
which we differ from Papiſts, and are oppoſed by them) are taught and approved
by the Fathers of the firſt five hundred years. Therefore it is impoſſible that
the Fathers of the firſt five hundred years ſhould be for Papiſts and againſt us.

Whereupon I gather as a certain concluſion, that the opinion of them who hold
the Pope to be a temporal Lord over Kings and Princes, is unreaſonable and
improbable altogether. For he hath not to meddle with them or theirs civilly,
much leſs to depoſe them, or give away their Kingdoms: that is no part of his
commiſſion. He hath in my judgement the Fatherhood of the Church, not a
Princehood of the world: Chriſt himſelf taking no ſuch title on him, nor giving it

which makes a ſyllogiſm naught. 2. By denying his <hi>Major,</hi> and as a reaſon
of that denial I ſay, agreement of doctrin with Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the
main points of faith and worſhip, though there be no Biſhops nor Prieſts is
ſufficient to a true Church; and ſuch ſucceſſion as <hi>H. T.</hi> requires is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.

3. To the <hi>Minor,</hi> though Proteſtants have not a continued number of
Biſhops, Prieſts and Laicks ſucceeding one another from Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
to this time in the profeſſion of the ſame faith or tenets, the thirty
nine Articles or any other ſet number of tenets expreſly holding and denying
all the ſame points; yet they do agree with Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the
doctrin of the Chriſtian faith, and the Chriſtian worſhip; and there hath
been a ſucceſſion in all ages hitherto of Chriſtian profeſſors holding the ſame
points of faith in the fundamentals, although ſometimes more purely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly

neceſſary to the being of the true Church of God; as hath been proved before
in the anſwer to the former Article, <hi>Sect,</hi> 4. 5. And to the proof of the <hi>Minor:</hi>
I anſwer, that Proteſtants may have true ſucceſſion from Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and may be eſteemed Chriſtians and Catholicks, though they differ in
many material points, as long as they hold the ſame fundamental points, and
Proteſtants, oppoſing all or ſome of the chief points of Popery as they aroſe and
were diſcovered to them, though they did not diſcern all their errors, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh
all their practiſes, or the communion of the Churches ſubject to the
Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> rule; but they were truely Proteſtants, however otherwiſe
named, while they did hold the ſame fundamental truths we hold, and oppoſed,
as they appeared to them, all or ſome of the Popiſh corrupt worſhip and errors,
which the Proteſtants now do. And for proof of this we rightly name the
<hi>Waldenſes, Huſſites, Wickleviſts, Albigenſes, Puritan Waldenſes, Beringarians,
Grecians,</hi> of whom writers teſtifie they excepted againſt the Popes ſupremacy,
purgatory, half communion, tranſubſtantiation, ſetting up and worſhip
of Images, propitiatory ſacrifice of the Maſſe for quick and dead, invocation
and worſhip of Angels and Saints deceaſed, ſeven Sacraments, with other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the now Romaniſts; and yet in the chief points of Chriſtian faith
and worſhip did agree with the now Proteſtants, as may be gathered from the
confeſſions, and writings of their own, either extant or acknowledged in the
hiſtories and writings of their adverſaries, ſuch as were <hi>Rainerius, Aeneas
Sylvius, Cochlaeus,</hi> and others. See <hi>Samuel Morlands</hi> hiſtory of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Churches in <hi>Piedmont</hi> the firſt book, by which their confeſſions and

he was both able to declare and to tranſlate the books of Scripture, alſo did
collect the Doctors minas upon the ſame.</hi> Yet were he unlearned, ſure he had
ſtore of companions among the Romaniſts, Friers, Biſhops and Popes of thoſe
times, by one of whom a Biſhop was condemned as an heretick, for holding
that there are <hi>Antipodes;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the ſecond ſaith, <hi>Platina pronounced them
hereticks, who ſhould from thence forth mention the name of the Academy, either
in earneſt or in jeſt.</hi> The very decrees and Epiſtles of the Popes in their
Canon law ſhew, that few of them had any skill in the Scriptures or the
original languages competent to divines, and who ſo readeth their writings
obſervingly, ſhall find that the ableſt of their ſchoolmen in thoſe dayes were
very ignorant of the Scripture ſenſe and language. Nor do I think the Popes
and generality of Biſhops and Prieſts, and Preachers among the Romaniſts at
this day are men of much learning in the holy Scriptures. So that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<hi>Waldus,</hi> as unlearned as he was, was comparable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy
at that time in learning, and for holineſs of life, by the relation even of Popiſh
writers, exceeding them as much as gold exceeds lead, and therefore as likely
to know the mind of God as any Pope, or Biſhop, or Frier at that time. Now
clear it is by an ancient manuſcript alledged by the <hi>Magdeburg. cent. 12. c.</hi> 8.
that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> held, that <hi>the Scripture is the only rale in the Articles of
faith, fathers and councils no otherwiſe to be received then as they agree with
the Scriptures, that the Scriptures are to be read by all ſorts of men, that there
are two Sacraments of the Church, that the Lords ſupper is appointed by Chriſt,
and to be received by all ſorts in both kinds, that Maſſes were impious, and that
it was a madneſs to ſay Maſſes for the dead, purgatory to be a figment, the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and worſhip of dead Saints to be idolatry, the Roman Church to be the
whore of Babylon, that the Pope hath not the ſupremacy of all the Churches of
Chriſt, marriage of Prieſts to be lawful:</hi> with ſundry more, which are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Proteſtant tenets againſt Papiſts: which is confirmed, becauſe much
to the ſame purpoſe <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> in his <hi>Bohemian</hi> hiſtory writes of their
opinions. Nor is it likely they held what they are ſaid by <hi>H. T.</hi> to have held.
For it appears by the diſpute between them and one Dr. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſet down by
Mr. <hi>Fox Acts and Monuments</hi> at the year 1179. out of <hi>Orthuinus de gratiis,</hi>
that their opinion was, that <hi>Chriſt is one and the ſame with his natural body in
the Sacrament, which he is at the right hand of his Father: but not after the
ſame exiſtence of his body. For the exiſtence of his body in heaven is perſonal
and local: there to be apprehended by the faith and ſpirit of men. In the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
the exiſtence of his body is not perſonal or local to be apprehended or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of our bodies, after a perſonal or corporal manner, but after a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
manner: that is, where our bodies receive the ſign, and our spirit the
thing ſignified.</hi> And <hi>Illyric. cat. teſt. verit.</hi> tells us, <hi>that it is ſaid to be their
opinion, that the tranſubſtantiation is not made in the hand of the conficient, but

they might ſay <hi>the Apoſtles were lay men</hi> not ordained, or tradeſmen, as

arrogance of the Biſhops and Prieſts, who appropriated to themſelves the title
of the clergy (which <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 3. gave to all the flock of Chriſt) and the
power only to tranſlate, read, expound and preach the Scriptures, which the
<hi>Waldenſes</hi> held to be free to all men. <hi>By Magiſtrates falling from their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

did ſuſpend from the exerciſe of their function, when they lived wickedly, they
being not to receive, and ſo not to conſecrate,</hi> as I find it in, <hi>Illyric. catal.</hi> or
perhaps they meant it, that Magiſtrates were not to be obeyed in their wicked
commands, or (as it is moſt probable they meant it) it was juſt with God
they ſhould fall from their dignity; and that he by his providence did ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, not that men might depoſe them, as Papiſts have taught, nor that <hi>ipſo

aroſe from their doctrine, that they could not fall from the faith, as if thereby
they muſt hold, that then they could not ſin. That <hi>the Waldenſes held it not

general council is a black Swan, there having never been any council ſo general,
but that there have wanted meſſengers from many Chriſtian Churches in the
world. The four firſt councils of the Biſhops of the Empire have gotten a
great repute in the Chriſtian Churches, and have been accounted as the four
Evangeliſts, though the canons extant even of the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> council have no
ſuch excellency in them, as to deſerve ſo great an opinion. Of the four later,
ſurely the two laſt leſſe deſerve the name; the later <hi>Nicene</hi> council being

the having the Popes approbation at all prove any authority over them in him,
it being a thing uſual to ſeek approbation of men, who have no authority over
the ſeekers, by reaſon of their eſteem for prudence, learning and other qualities,
and for the more ready receipt of what they ſeek to have approved. But the
councils determinations, and that with <hi>Anathema</hi> to the gainſayers, ſhewed that

what they were not, and the tranſubſtantiation they hold is a change of the
communicants into the being of Chriſt, that is partakers of the divine nature,
as the Apoſtle means when he ſaith <hi>they are the body of Chriſt,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Field</hi>
proves out of <hi>Dam. ſcen, Cyril</hi> and others in his third <hi>book of the Church,</hi> ch. 1.

other than lofty hyperbolical ſpeeches, ſuch as the Apoſtle uſeth when he ſaith,
<hi>Chriſt was crucified among the Galatians,</hi> Gal. 3. 1. which abound in <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,
Pſeudo, Dionyſius Areopagita</hi> &amp;c. inſomuch, that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
expreſſeth the preſence of Chriſt in the euchariſt, as if it were ſenſible, the
communicants <hi>touching Chriſts body, ſeeing his blood, having their mouths
made red by it, ſucking his blood, receiving him into our houſe,</hi> with more of the
like, as may be ſeen in <hi>Chamier. Panſtr. cath. tom. 4. lib. 11. c.</hi> 9. As for ſeven
<hi>Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not teach them to be ſo many, and no more, nor
<hi>the unbloody ſacrifice</hi> any otherwiſe, then by it to mean <hi>a commemoration of the
ſacrifice of Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Chryſostom</hi> in his <hi>hom.</hi> on the tenth to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
it. It cannot be proved that the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſe ſuch prayer to Saints
as the Papiſts do, directing their prayers to them as hearers, and by vertue of
their merits helpers to them that call on them. Neither do they pray for the
dead ſhut up in purgatory (which as I alleged out of <hi>Roffenſis, the Greeks do
this day deny)</hi> and there enduring puniſhment of ſenſe, for deliverance thence,
but commemorate the dead, even the moſt holy martyrs and confeſſors, and
pray for their happy reſurrection and acquittal in the laſt judgement. As for

the <hi>Egyptian Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> what they hold is not ſo eaſie to know
by reaſon of their remoteneſs from <hi>Europe,</hi> nor what Succeſſion they have

ſome obſcure perſons, whoſe acts the Churches never owned, and yet there doth
not appear ſufficient reaſon to exclude them out of the Catholick Church,
notwithſtanding ſuch Errours as are imputed to them, nor to queſtion their
Succeſſion. Nor is the <hi>Proteſtants pretence to the Fathers of the firſt five
hundred years idle,</hi> (it being not falſe, but moſt true, and ſo proved by <hi>Jewel</hi>
and others, and the Anſwers of <hi>Harding</hi> and other <hi>Romaniſts</hi> proved inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent)
that they were in the moſt material points Proteſtants, that is held other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> now do. And though it prove not a Succeſſion of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred years continued, yet it proves a Succeſſion of ſo long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
as will make void the popiſh claim of Succeſſion as peculiar to them, and
with any conſiderate perſon ſo far take place as to juſtifie the Proteſtants oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
againſt the modern Papiſt's Errours and Innovations. 'Tis true, <hi>thoſe of
the ſixth Age muſt needs know better what was the Religions and Tenets of
them who lived in the fifth Age by whom they were inſtructed, and with whom
they daily converſed, than Proteſtants can now do,</hi> in thoſe things which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by word of mouth to them, if they were heedfull, intelligent, and
mindefull of what they heard. But what they left in writing we may know
as well as they. And experience ſhews that oft times upon miſtakes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
voluntarily the ſayings of men ſpoken, yea ſometimes their very Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
either by unskilfulneſs, or negligence, or fraud, are miſ-reported, and
therefore notwithſtanding this reaſon of the acquaintance of thoſe of the ſixth
Age with thoſe of the fifth, yet it may be that Proteſtants may know the
minde of the Fathers in the fifth Age as well as thoſe that lived in the ſixth.
But that thoſe <hi>of the ſixth Age have proteſted on their ſalvation that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
taught by the Fathers in the fifth Age was the very ſame with their, in
every point,</hi> or the Doctrine now taught by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> was received from
them by word of mouth, and ſo from Age to Age is not true; yet if they
ſhould, we have no more cauſe to credit them, than the Church had to believe
the <hi>Millenaries</hi> and <hi>Quartodesimans,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Papias</hi> and others their report
of <hi>John,</hi> with whom they converſed.</p>

                     <p>The Romaniſts Doctrine as it is now was not the Doctrine of the Fathers of

Proteſtants.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>H. T adds a third Argument to prove, that his with other Romaniſts Doctrines,
(in which they differ from Proteſtants and are oppoſed by them) are taught
and approved by the Fathers of the firſt five hundred years, which he thinks to
prove by that he hath cited, and ſhall cite out of the Fathers, and the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Adverſaries, and to that end cites ſome Speeches of Fulk, Kemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Whitgrft, Calvin, Whitaker, Peter Martyr, Duditius, Rainolds, Jewel:
and then infers triumphantly, therefore the Father of the firſt five hundred
years are not for Proteſtants, but for us; therefore Proteſtants are utterly at a
loſs in the point of continued Succeſſion.</p>

ſo will what is after, if God vouchſafe me time and ſtrength
to that end. 2. Of the paſſages cited, the two laſt are not to the purpoſe, and
they are maimedly, and corruptly cited. The Speeches, as they are cited, ſay
not any thing of the popiſh Doctrin taught and approved by the Fathers of the
firſt five hundred years, but the uncertainty of finding out the truth by their
ſayings without the Scriptures. And that the dealing of this Author may
appear, I ſhall ſet down the words as I finde them in <hi>Jewel's Apology, part.</hi> 4.
<hi>cap. 22. diviſ. 3. For where theſe men bid the holy Scriptures away as dumb and
fruitleſs, and procure us to come to God himſelf, who ſpeaks in the Church and in
their Councils, that is to ſay, to believe their fancies and opinions this way, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the truth is very uncertain, and exceeding dangerous, and in a manner a
fantaſtical and mad way, and by no means allowed of the holy Fathers.</hi> Which
Speech is a moſt true and ſavoury Speech, yet not in the leaſt intimating a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of the Fathers of the firſt five hundred years being for the Papiſts (the
contrary to which Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> ſhewed in his famous Challenge at <hi>Paul</hi>'s
<hi>Croſs,</hi> and his making it good againſt <hi>Harding)</hi> but onely vindicating the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures from the foul Speeches of <hi>Hoſius, Pighius,</hi> and other <hi>Romaniſts,</hi>
and aſſerting the authority of the holy Scriptures. The other paſſage which is
cited out of Dr. <hi>Rainold's Conference</hi> (in <hi>H. T.</hi> it is printed <hi>Confeſſ.) cap.</hi> 5.
<hi>diviſ.</hi> 1. is as corruptly and maimedly cited, the words being thus at large,
<hi>Indeed</hi> Vincentius Lirinenſis <hi>preferreth this mark</hi> (of truth the conſent of the
Fathers) <hi>before the reſt, as having held when they failed. Nevertheleſs he
ſpeaketh not of it neither, as that it may ſerve for trial and deciſion of queſtions
between us. For what doth he acknowlege to be a point approved, and ſuch as we
are bound to believe by this mark? even that which the Fathers all with one
conſent have held, written, taught, plainly, commonly, continually. And
who can avouch of any point in queſtion, that not one or two but all the Fathers
held it, nor onely held it, but alſo wrote it; nor onely wrote it, but alotaught it;
not darkly, but plainly; not ſeldom, but commonly; not for a ſhort ſeaſon, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually:
which ſo great conſent is partly ſo rare, and ſo hard to be found, partly ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
though it might be found, that himſelf (to faſhion it to ſome uſe and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
is fain to limit and reſtrain it.</hi> Which words were ſound, and are neceſſary,
but not ſpoken out of any diſtruſt of his cauſe or imagination, as if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the firſt five hundred years were for the Papiſts. For in that very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
he largely proves, that not onely the Fathers of the firſt five hundred
years, but alſo the ſucceeding Councils and Fathers till the ſixteenth Century,
did onely yield the Pope a Primacy among other Patriarchs, but not a Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
over the whole Church, and that Primacy that was given him was by
cuſtome of the Church for the honour of the Imperial City (which was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerible)
not becauſe of any grant of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which was irrevocable. <hi>Duditius</hi>

is not a point of ſaith. <hi>Whitaker</hi>'s Speech is not of the Fathers of the firſt 500.
years, but of the <hi>ancient Church,</hi> which might be after, or onely in ſome part of
that time. The words of <hi>Calvin, lib 3. inſtit. cap. 5. parag</hi> 10. are not rightly
alleged, being not together as <hi>H. T.</hi> cites them, but injuriouſly pieced out of
Speeches, that are diſtant one from another He doth not deny, nor yet expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

but whereas it was objected by the Adverſaries, he urgeth, <hi>that if it were ſo, it
was without Scripture, that it came out of carnal affection, that what we reade

of the vulgar,</hi> he confeſſeth <hi>they were carried away into errour,</hi> but faith
not, <hi>they were all of that time carried away into errour, that ſame teſtimonies of
the Ancients might be brought which overthrow all thoſe prayers for the dead,
that their prayers for the dead were not without heſitancy, that they were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the popiſh in divers things.</hi> The words of <hi>Whitgifts Defenſe,
pag.</hi> 473. are miſ-cited, being not as <hi>H. T.</hi> cites them, <hi>All the Biſhops and
learned Writers of the</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Latin <hi>Church too, for the moſt part, were

<hi>Church, yea and the</hi> Latins <hi>alſo for the moſt part ſpotted with the Doctrines of

be all this while inviſible, neither to be ſeen or heard of in the World.</p>
                  <p>I reply, who frames the Objection as this Authour ſets it down I know not,
ſure I am that many of the Proteſtants do frame it otherwiſe, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
had Churches afore <hi>Luther,</hi> who did oppoſe popiſh innovations, and
that theſe were viſible, though not to their Enemies, nor in ſo conſpicuous a
manner <hi>as the</hi> Roman <hi>Senate or Common-wealth of</hi> Venice, and this is no
Mid-ſummer nights Dream any more than that Papiſts have a Church in
<hi>England</hi> in communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they have Maſſes, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> although it be not known to Proteſtants, nor ſo conſpicuous as

As for <hi>H. T.</hi> his Definition of a Church, it is to me more like a Mid-Summer
nights Dream. For is <hi>the Church a congregation of viſible men
preaching, baptizing, and converting Nations?</hi> Are all the viſible men in the
congregation, which is the Church, men preaching, baptizing, and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nations? May not a Church be a congregation of men that convert not
any Nation if themſelves be converted, that baptize not others if themſelves
be baptized, that preach not if they have heard, received and profeſs the Word
preached? Are not Women part of the congregation, which is the Church?
Do they preach and baptize? However it is well this Authour ſets down
Preaching and Baptizing as acts whereby the men who are of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the Church, are viſible; which is all one with the marks of
the viſible Church given by the Proteſtants, to wit, preaching the Word and
adminiſtring the Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>H. T. <hi>adds, Object.</hi> The Church in communion with the See of <hi>Rome</hi>
was the true Church till ſhe apoſtatized and fell from the faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ſhe were once the true Church, ſhe is and ſhall be ſo for ever; ſhe
cannot fail, as hath been proved, nor erre in faith, as ſhall be proved hereafter.</p>
                  <p>I reply. It is, true Proteſtants yield that the Churches in communion with
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were true Churches while they held the faith of Chriſt
entire, and did not by their innovations ſubvert it, which was in proceſs of
time done by altering of the rule of faith, the Apoſtolical tradition of the
holy Scripture into unwritten tradition, the Popes determinations and canons
of councils as the ſenſe of the Scripture, or the revelations of the Spirit of God,
and by bringing in the invocation and worſhip of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and other
Saints, altering the Sacrament of the Lords Supper inſtituted for a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119447:39"/>
of his death into a propitiatory ſacrifice for quick and dead, aſſerting
tranſubſtantiation, and adoring of the bread, worſhipping images and reliques,
perverting the Goſpel by bringing in the doctrines of humane ſatisfactions for
ſin, power to fulfill the law, juſtification by works, and meriting eternal life,
inſtead of free remiſſion of ſins to the penitent believer only through the blood
of Chriſt, and juſtification by faith in Chriſt without the works of the law.
In which points that the Churches now in communion with the See of <hi>Rome</hi>
have apoſtatized, is apparent by this argument. Thoſe Churches have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatized,
who have left the faith once delivered to the Saints by the Apoſtles
of Chriſt. But the Churches now in communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> have
left the faith once delivered to the Saints by the Apoſtles of Chriſt: therefore
the Churches now in communion with the See of <hi>Rome</hi> have apoſtatized. The
Major is evident from the terms, apoſtaſie being no other thing than leaving
the faith once delivered to the Saints by the Apoſtles of Chriſt. The minor
is manifeſt by comparing the doctrine of the council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and Pope <hi>Pius</hi>
the fourth his Creed with the Apoſtles writings, eſpecially the Epiſtle to the
<hi>Romans</hi> by <hi>Paul,</hi> which ſhews what once the church of <hi>Rome</hi> believed. For
inſtance it is ſaid, <hi>Rom. 15. 4. For whatſoever things were written aforetime
were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
might have hope.</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17. <hi>And that from a child thou
haſt known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation,
through faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus. All Scripture is given by inſpiration of
God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in
righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect throughly furniſhed unto all
good works.</hi> Eph. 2. 20. <hi>And are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles
and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner-stone,</hi> which plainly
prove the Scriptures uſe for all ſorts, ſufficiency, and divinity, and the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
of unwritten traditions to guide us to ſalvation. <hi>Rom. 12. 5. We being
many are one body in Chriſt, and every one members one of another.</hi> 1 Cor.
12. 12. <hi>For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of
that one body being many are one body: ſo alſo is Chriſt.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>For by one
ſpirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
we be bond or free,</hi> ver. 27. <hi>Now ye are the body of Chriſt and members in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi>
ver. 28. <hi>And God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Epheſ. 1. 22. and gave him to be head over all things to the Church which is his
body,</hi> which prove the Catholick Church to have extended to all believers of
Jews and Gentiles, and that they (and not the <hi>Roman</hi> only, or thoſe that are
in communion with it) are that one body or Catholick Church, and that
there is no other head of the whole Church but Chriſt, nor any Apoſtle above
another; and conſequently the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and Pope have no ſupremacy
over the reſt of the Churches. <hi>Rom. 10 14. How ſhall they call on him in whom
they have not believed.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. <hi>There is one God and one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> which prove they then received not
the invocation of Saints, nor made the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> or any other deceaſed
Saint, Mediators between God and men. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.
after his blaming them for diſorder about the Lords ſupper, he ſaith thus,
<hi>For I have received of the Lord that which alſo I delivered unto you, that the
Lord Jeſus, the ſame night in which he was betrayed took bread: and when he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119447:40"/>
had given thanks he brake it and ſaid, take, eat, this is my body, which is broken
for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the ſame manner alſo he took
the cup when he had ſupped ſaying, this cup is the New Teſtament in my blood:
this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me. For as oft as ye eat this
bread and drink this cup ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come. Wherefore
whoſoever ſhall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall
be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himſelf, and
ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17. <hi>The cup
of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? The
bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? for we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many are one bread and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi>
Which texts plainly ſhew, that what is eaten in the Euchariſt is bread, and
therefore not fleſh, and conſequently no tranſubſtantiation, that the actions
are commemorate ſigns of Chriſts death; therefore no propitiatory ſacrifice:
that bread was to be broken and eaten, therefore not to be whole and ſwallowed
down. <hi>Heb. 9. 26. But now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to
put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</hi> Heb. 10. 10. <hi>By the which will we are
ſanctified through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all,</hi> which ſhew
there is no more ſacrifice or offering of Chriſt in the church of Chriſt to be
continued by a Prieſt. <hi>Rom. 1. 25. who changed the truth of God into a lye,
and worſhipped the creature beſides, or more than the Creator.</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 9. <hi>ye
turned to God from Idols to ſerve the living and the true God,</hi> therefore they
worſhipped not bread, nor croſſes, nor reliques as Papiſts do. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28.
<hi>Therefore we conclude that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the
law.</hi> Rom. 4. 5. <hi>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the ungodly, his faith is counted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> Rom. 5. 1.
<hi>Therefore being juſtified by faith we have peace with God.</hi> Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There
is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> ver. 3, 4. <hi>For what the
law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own
Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the

righteouſneſs by works and ſuch other tenets as whereby Papiſts extol man,

of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in the diſcuſſing of the following articles.</p>
                  <p>As for what <hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith here, <hi>if the Church in communion with the See of</hi>
Rome <hi>were once the true Church, ſhe is and ſhall be ſo for ever,</hi> if meant of the
viſible Church militant (of which alone is the queſtion) it muſt reſt either on
this propoſition, every true viſible Church militant is and ſhall be a true
Church for ever, which is proved falſe by the inſtances of the <hi>Hieroſolymitan,
Antiochian, Alexandrian, Epheſian, Corinthian</hi> and other Churches. Where
there are not now churches of Chriſt, but <hi>Mahometans,</hi> at leaſt by this authors
own doctrine, they were not true churches while the <hi>Greek</hi> churches revolted
from the communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> which he mentions, <hi>p.</hi> 47. and it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
by Chriſts threatning, that <hi>he would remove the candleſtick from them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they did repent,</hi> Revel. 2. 5. Or elſe it reſts on this, that every church in
communion with the See of <hi>Rome</hi> is, and ever ſhall be a true church: but
there is no priviledge in Scripture to the church of <hi>Rome</hi> more than to other
churches, much leſs to every church that is in communion with the See of
<hi>Rome;</hi> yea it is ſaid to the <hi>Roman</hi> church as well as other churches, <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 20, 21, 22. <hi>well, becauſe of unbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt
by faith. Be not high minded but fear. For if God spared not the natural
branches, take heed leſt he alſo spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodneſs and
ſeverity of God: on them which fell ſeverity; but towards thee goodneſs, if
thou continue in his goodneſs, otherwiſe thou</hi> (even the <hi>Roman</hi> church to whom
he then wrote) <hi>alſo ſhalt be cut off.</hi> However if it be proved that the church
catholick inviſible of the elect and true believers cannot fail, and that a church
viſible indefinite ſhall not fail, but be in ſome place or other more or leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous,
in greater or ſmaller numbers; yet it is not proved that the church
militant definite of this or that place ſhall not fail, nor is there a word in
Scripture to prove this the priviledge of the <hi>Roman</hi> church, or thoſe that are in
communion with the See of <hi>Rome</hi> that they cannot fail nor erre in faith: nor
do the words of Fathers rightly underſtood prove it. But Scripture and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
do plainly refute it. What hath been alleged is examined, the reſt will
be in its place. I proceed to that which remains in this Article.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> The Catholick ſucceſſion was one ſucceſſion for the firſt five centuries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> You may as well tell me of a white blackmore: a Catholick is not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
nor a Catholick ſucceſſion a Protestant ſucceſſion. Who ever heard of a
Proteſtant Pope? The Catholick church was always governed by a Pope in the
firſt five centuries, as now it is, and hath defined our tenets and condemned
yours, as you have ſeen. It is the very eſſence of a Proteſtant (as a Proteſtant)
to proteſt againſt the Catholick church, as <hi>Lutherans</hi> and you have done.</p>
                  <p>To this I reply, To an objection of ſuch moment as this is the anſwer, is but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119447:41"/>
meer trifling. For he knows, that we mean by catholick ſucceſſion, not that
which he calls catholick ſucceſſion, to wit of Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that the
teachers, who are reputed catholick, whether of the Greek or Latin churches,
who have ſucceeded one after another in the five firſt centuries of years from
Chriſts incarnation according to the account now uſed, taught not the doctrine
now profeſſed in the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, or in the <hi>Tridentin</hi> canons,
but that in all or moſt of the points in difference between Proteſtants and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
they taught the doctrine, which Proteſtants now hold, which hath been
proved by <hi>Jewel</hi> and many other Proteſtant writers. And in this ſenſe it is
no more abſurdity to call a Proteſtant a catholick, then to call a ſpade a ſapde,
a ſtraw a ſtraw. Proteſtants are truely Catholicks, Papiſts are but falſly called
Catholicks affecting the name, as ſome that were of <hi>the Synagogue of Satan
ſaid they were Jews, and were not, but did lye,</hi> Revel. 3. 9. and impudently
claiming that which they have no right to, that they may be it as a ſtalking
horſe catch ignorant people, who are taken with ſhews and confident talk, being
unable to ſift out truth and diſcern it from pretences. A Catholick ſucceſſion is
in true conſtruction a Proteſtant ſucceſſion, and the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Popes, teaching in ſuch writings as remain not the now Papal doctrine,
but in the main the Proteſtant, though by ſome of them exceſſively magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their See, and promoting rites of mens invention way was made for the
after corruptions of the Papacy. The term <hi>Pope</hi> was in former times given
to other Biſhops, Presbyters, yea and Deacons too beſides the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
though now the title is appropriated to him, who deſerves not the name of <hi>Papa</hi>
or <hi>Father,</hi> as it was heretofore uſed as an honourable title of the reverend and
godly teachers and officers in the church of God, nor any other way I know,
except it be in the ſenſe in which an <hi>Italian</hi> ſaid of <hi>Innocent</hi> the eighth,
<q>
                        <l>Octo nocens pueros genuit totidemque puellas:</l>
                        <l>Hunc merito poteris dicere Roma patrem:</l>
                     </q>
Many of whoſe predeceſſors and ſucceſſors have made it their work to advance
their baſtards, rather then beget children to God by preaching the Goſpel. It
is a notorious falſhood, that <hi>the catholick church was alwayes governed by a
Pope in the firſt five centuries,</hi> if he mean by Pope a Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Its
manifeſt by many inſtances, that the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Aſian</hi> churches were not
governed by him in the ſecond, third, fourth and fifth centuries, ſith they did
oppoſe him, as appears by the contentions between <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Polycrates</hi> and
others. That which we have ſeen in <hi>H. T.</hi> or <hi>Bellarmin</hi> or any other writer
of the Popiſh party, hath not yet made it ſo much as probable, that <hi>the Catholick
church hath now defined the now</hi> Roman <hi>tenets, or condemned the Proteſtants,</hi>
nor is it <hi>of the eſſence of a Proteſtant, as ſuch, to Proteſt againſt the Catholick
church,</hi> but againſt the errors and abominations of the now <hi>Roman</hi> party. Nor
hath <hi>H. T.</hi> or any other proved, that the <hi>Proteſtant teachers proteſt againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
revealed verities, and the very fundamentals of the Chriſtian faith,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they do proteſt againſt the fundamentals of the new Popiſh faith, the Popes
monarchy, tranſubſtantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>H. T. <hi>adds,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> and many others are divided in their
opinions, whether <hi>Linus</hi> or <hi>Clement</hi> immediately ſucceeded <hi>Peter. Anſw.</hi> Be
it ſo, yet they all agreed in this, that the ſucceſſion was morally continued, to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119447:41"/>
which it is a thing indifferent whether <hi>Clement</hi> immediately ſucceeded him, as
he well might being his ſcholar, or firſt <hi>Linus,</hi> then <hi>Cletus,</hi> and then <hi>Clement,</hi>
which is now the more common opinion of the church.</p>
                  <p>I reply, what he means by <hi>[morally continued]</hi> I underſtand not, nor
know I any ſenſe of that ſpeech, which ſerves to take away the force of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
which is, that if it be uncertain who ſucceeded <hi>Peter</hi> immediately,
then the tradition of the church unwritten, or not written in the Bible is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
and that too in a main point which is fundamental with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi>
the ſucceſſion of their chief Paſtors, upon which the truth of their
church and the rule of their faith depends, and conſequently the rule of the
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> whereby to know what we are to believe hath a meer ſandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not being ſufficient to build a divine and firm faith upon; and the
Proteſtants are no more to be blamed than the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> if they do not ſo
exactly ſet down and prove their ſucceſſion of Biſhops as the Papiſts require,
ſith the Papiſts themſelves are deficient in their own catalogue, and if the
Proteſtants can prove their faith out of Scripture, though they prove not ſuch
a ſucceſſion as is demanded, they may as well be concluded a true church as the
<hi>Roman,</hi> which anſwers the two firſt Articles of <hi>H. T.</hi> his <hi>Manual of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.</hi>
Beſides the moſt ancient tradition they have, to wit <hi>Irenaeus l. 3. adver.
haereſ. c.</hi> 3. ſaith that Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>founded the church in</hi> Rome, <hi>and then
delivered the Epiſcopacy of the church to be adminiſtred to</hi> Linus, which was
done in their life time, and ſo <hi>Linus</hi> did not ſucceed <hi>Peter</hi> as Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
for he was Biſhop while <hi>Peter</hi> lived, and ſo if <hi>Peter</hi> died Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> there
were more Biſhops together, and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> makes them ſucceſſors of <hi>Paul</hi> as well
as <hi>Peter;</hi> nor were they ſucceſſors to them as having the ſame office with
them. For they could not be Biſhops of particular places fixed there as now
the term is uſed, it ſtood not with their commiſſion, which enjoyned them
<hi>to go into all the world, and to preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> nor were
they ſucceſſors to them in their Apoſtleſhip, for that particular office ceaſed
with the firſt Apoſtles. So that the truth is, this conceit of ſucceſſion is but a
vain conceit, though it be much magnified by <hi>H. T.</hi> and other <hi>Romaniſts</hi> for
want of ſolid proof of their ſeveral doctrins out of Scripture or primitive anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.

require, is not proved to be neceſſary to
the being of a true Church.</p>

                  <head>SECT. 1.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Exteriour Conſecration and Ordination of Miniſters is not neceſſary to the being
of a viſible Church: what H. T. requires of Miniſters preaching and
adminiſtring Sacraments is moſt defective in the Roman Church.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>Our Tenet, ſaith H. T. is, that the Catholick and Apoſtolick Church of God
hath had not onely a continued, but alſo a viſible Succeſſion from Chriſt to this
time, &amp;c. which we prove thus, 1. A Society of men which hath always
in it exteriour Conſecration and Ordination of Miniſters, preaching, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
and adminiſtring Sacraments muſt of neceſſity be always viſible. But
the Church of Chriſt is a ſociety of men which hath always in it exteriour
Conſecration and Ordination of Miniſtere. Therefore the Church of Chriſt
muſt of neceſſity be always viſible. The Major is proved by evident reaſon,
becauſe thoſe are all outward and ſenſible actions, which are inconſiſtent with
an inviſible ſociety of actors. The Minor is proved by Scripture, Go ye,
teaching all Nations, baptizing them, &amp;c. And, Behold, I am with you all
days, &amp;c. St. Matth. 28. v. 20. He gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome
Evangeliſts, and other ſome Paſtors and Doctors, to the conſummation of the
Saints, Epheſ. 4. 11, 12.</p>

aſſerting what hath been, the Concluſion what of neceſſity
muſt be; the Tenet having for its Subject the holy Catholick
and Apoſtolick Church of God, the Concluſion the Church
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> indefinite, and both Tenet and Concluſion is granted, but not in
this Author's and other <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſenſe. It is granted, there hath been a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
but not a continued number of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Laicks, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119447:42"/>
one another in the profeſſion of the ſame Faith, (meaning the now <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)</hi>
from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles to this time, which <hi>H. T.</hi> in the former
Article makes the Definition of Succeſſion. And viſibility of each particular
Church is granted, but not of the Catholick as Catholick, which as ſuch is to be
believed, not ſeen. And this viſibility it is granted to be of ſome at ſome times,
not in the ſame ſplendor or conſpicuity at all times, nor to all perſons. But
Proteſtants deny it viſible always to all in ſo glorious and conſpicuous an
eſtate, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aſſerts, when he ſaith in his Book <hi>de Eccleſ. Milit. cap.</hi> 2.
<hi>That the Church is an Aſſembly of men ſo viſible and palpable as is the Aſſembly
of the People of</hi> Rome, <hi>or the Kingdom of</hi> France, <hi>or the Common-wealth of
the</hi> Venetians: ſo that we might grant his Tenet and Concluſion, were it not
that fraudulently there is more intended than is expreſſed, which is needfull to
be diſcovered. For anſwer to it as it is the <hi>Major</hi> is granted, if it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of viſibility ſimply, but if meant of ſuch a conſpicuous viſibility as the
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> aſſert, it is to be denied. In the <hi>Minor</hi> it is to be obſerved, 1. That
a diſtinction is made between <hi>exterior Conſecration and Ordination,</hi> which I
judge to be done, that thereby may be implied the diſtinction of Biſhops (who
are conſecrated, not ordained) from Presbyters, (whom they ordain, not conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate)
to have been always in the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is not right.
2. That it is aſſerted that <hi>the Church of</hi> Chriſt <hi>is a ſociety of men, which hath
always in it exteriour Conſecration and Ordination of Miniſters,</hi> which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he holds a true Church hath always ſuch Miniſters. But as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that is not true, no not in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the vacancy of the See,
which hath been ſometimes long, and therefore it is not neceſſary to the being
of a true Church, that always the exterior Conſecration and Ordination be
continued, and if it may be intermitted, one, two, or ten years, and yet the
Church a true Church, it may be an hundred; and therefore the <hi>Minor</hi> is not to
be granted, if meant of exterior Conſecration and Ordination of Biſhops di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from Presbyters, and ſuch a perpetuity as is without the leaſt intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor do any of the Texts prove it. For the Precept <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. proves
onely it ought to be, not that it ſhall be; and the Promiſe, if it do prove that
a Succeſſion ſhall be, yet it doth not prove ſuch a Succeſſion as ſhall have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
Conſecration and Ordination, but ſuch aſſiſtance in Preaching and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing
as ſhall uphold and proſper them in that Work: nor is this aſſured to
any one place, but indefinitely to any perſons in any place where this Work
ſhall be continued. And the other place <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4. 11, 12. proves not a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

but an act to be immediately from <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf, or by his Spirit, and ſo doth
not prove a futurity of ſuch Succeſſion by outward Conſecration and Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as <hi>H. T.</hi> brings it for.</p>

For, 1. by this arguing he plainly makes the marks of the Church by which
it is viſible, Preaching, Baptizing, and adminiſtring Sacraments, which doth
by good conſequence infer that the Proteſtants do rightly make the Preaching
of the Word, and the adminiſtring of the Sacraments the notes of the viſible
Church; which will make well for the Proteſtants, by whom theſe are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119447:43"/>
but ill for the Miniſters of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, chiefly the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who neither preach, nor baptize, nor adminiſter Sacraments, but do
other acts of other kindes. Nor, to ſpeak truth, is almoſt any of their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the Rites of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other Saints excellency, little of the Goſpel, or if
any part of it, it is likely the Hiſtory of the Goſpel in an hiſtorical faſhion,
little of the myſtery; but in ſtead thereof ſuch Doctrines of humane ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions,
for ſin, merit, of good works, are preached, as do overthrow the Goſpel.
And for Baptizing, though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us, <hi>lib. 2. de bonis oper. in partic. cap.</hi>
17. <hi>that at</hi> Rome <hi>the old Cuſtome is not aboliſhed of Baptizing the</hi> Catechume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
<hi>at</hi> Eaſter, <hi>but among the Papiſts chiefly in the City of</hi> Rome <hi>there is no year
in which many catechized perſons are not baptized at</hi> Eaſter: yet the truth is,
there is no right Baptiſm almoſt throughout the Churches under the Papacy,
there being nothing but watering of Infants with ſome frivolous Ceremonies,
no immerſion or plunging into the Water after Profeſſion of Faith, as was in
the primitive times, and is the onely Baptiſm <hi>Chriſt</hi> appointed, Infant-ſprinkling,
perfuſion, or dipping, being meer Innovations begun after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
ages, and being onely by unwritten tradition (as their own learned men
confeſs) conveyed to the Church, not inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. And for
adminiſtring the Lords Supper, he that reades their Miſſals or Sees, their Maſs,
may eaſily diſcern, there is not that done by them which <hi>Chriſt</hi> appointed, but
ſuch a change there is in it from <hi>Christs</hi> inſtitution, as that it cannot be termed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a Sacrament of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but a meer ridiculous or abominable device of men,
more like a Play than a religious ſervice. 2. When they ſay that the Church
hath always exterior Conſecration and Ordination of Miniſters, they neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
put themſelves upon it, to prove that it hath been ſo in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
which they can never prove to have been always in the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, much
leſs in their Prieſts, the Records of their Conſecrations and Ordinations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in many reſpects either none or very doubtfull, at beſt but humane teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which is fallible, and if theſe were certain, yet their own Canons make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things neceſſary to their Sacraments, ſpecially that ſottiſh conceit of the
<hi>Trent</hi> Council, <hi>that the Miniſter of Sacraments muſt intend to do what the
Church doth,</hi> without which there is a nullity in what is done; and yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to be proved; and ſo many things according to their Canons nullifie
their Ordinations, as Simony, and other irregularities, of which nevertheleſs
their own Writers accuſe a great number of their Biſhops and Prieſts, and
ſometimes one Pope hath made void the Acts of another, and in deſpite hath
cut off his fingers which did ordain Prieſts, as <hi>Platina</hi> relates in the life of
<hi>Stephan</hi> the ſixth concerning the uſage of Pope <hi>Formoſus;</hi> beſides this the
Ordination of their Prieſts is to ſacrifice for quick and dead, which is no part
of the Miniſterial Office which <hi>Chriſt</hi> required, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſidered, if this be the note whereby the true Church muſt be proved, no
Church in the World hath leſs proof for its truth than the <hi>Roman;</hi> but the
Exceptions will be ſo many againſt their exterior Ordination and Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as will by their own Canons and arguings prove the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be
no true viſible Church at all; and ſo this Argument will be retorted on <hi>H. T.</hi>
Let us go on to his ſecond Argument, onely taking notice that he uſeth the
term <hi>[Miniſters]</hi> which other Papiſts do deride in the Proteſtants.</p>

                     <p>Iſai 2. 2. Matth. 5, 14. Pſal. 18. (with us 19.) 4. prove not ſuch a Church-vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility

                  <p>A Light, ſaith H. T. always ſhining to the World, and a City ſo ſeated on a
Hill that it cannot be hid, muſt needs be always viſible. But the Church of
Chriſt is a Light always ſhining to the World, and a City ſo ſeated on a Hill,
that it cannot be hid, therefore the Church muſt needs be always viſible. The
Major is manifeſt by the very terms. The Minor is proved by Scripture;
The Mountain of the Houſe of our Lord ſhall be prepared on the top of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
Iſai 2. 2. You are the Light of the World, a City ſeated on a Hill can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> THough the Concluſion might be granted in ſome ſenſe, yet in the
ſenſe meant by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> it is denied, and in the Argument the
<hi>Minor</hi> is to be denied, and to the proof of it, it is denied that the Texts produced
prove it. Not the firſt. For though the Prophecies, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 2. 2, 3. be meant of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
and the times of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> yet, whether by <hi>the Mountain</hi> be meant Mount
<hi>Sion</hi> properly, or the Church, or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Apoſtles; it is certain, that it is
meant of that time, wherein the Goſpel was at firſt preached, to which ſenſe
<hi>Hierome</hi> expounds it, and <hi>the exaltation of the mountain of the Lords houſe</hi> is
in reſpect of the firſt promulging of the Goſpel, (in reſpect of which, neither
at firſt, nor now is Rome <hi>exalted above the Hills)</hi> and therefore it is not meant
of every particular Church viſible, nor of ſuch conſpicuity in government and
outward appearance as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> maintain. The ſecond Text <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.
14. is particularly meant of the Apoſtles, and ſuch Preachers of the Goſpel
as continued that Work with them, or after them, and doth not foretell what
ſhall be, but declares what they were in exiſtence or duty rather, and their
conſpiracy is in reſpect of the Preaching of the Goſpel. But this is not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of every particular, or the whole Church militant at all times, as if it were
ſo viſible, as that every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> might know where to addreſs themſelves to
them, and have reſolution from them in their doubts. The other Text is leſs to
the purpoſe, ſpeaking of <hi>a Tabernacle for the Sun,</hi> not <hi>a Tabernacle in the Sun,</hi>
the Suns Tabernacle, not Gods, <hi>put in the Heavens,</hi> (not on earth) as <hi>Hierom</hi>
reades according to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> although the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and Vulgar reade, as
<hi>H. T.</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in his allegorical way expound it of the Church. But it
is frivolous upon <hi>Auguſtin's</hi> conceit in his <hi>Enarration on the Pſalms</hi> to infer
a Tenet from a place that hath quite another grammatical ſenſe, which is onely
argumentative.</p>

I Reply, Though Proteſtants deny not the Church militant to be viſible in
the outward Government and Preaching of the Paſtors, yet they deny that it
is always ſo conſpicuous as that it may be known to every <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as <hi>an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of the People of</hi> Rome, <hi>or Common-wealth of</hi> Venice, to which all may
reſort for direction. Nor by this Argument do they prove that the Church
militant is not viſible, but that the Church in the Creeds Apoſtolical and
<hi>Nicene,</hi> which is one Catholick and Apoſtolick, as ſuch, is not viſible, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
being the Object of Faith, not of Sight: nevertheleſs the Anſwer
takes not away the force of the Objection, if it had been alleged againſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of the Church militant. For the Church is believed, not as teaching,
but as being, it is the exiſtence of the Church, not the Doctrine of it that is
believed, as even the <hi>Trent Catechiſm</hi> expounds it: now that being Catholick,
that is according to the <hi>Catechiſm, conſiſting of all believers from</hi> Adam <hi>till
now in all Nations,</hi> cannot be the object of ſenſe, but of faith; and therefore
the Catholick Church in the Creeds is the inviſible of true Believers, not the
meer viſible now militant.</p>
                  <p>H. T. <hi>adds, Object.</hi> The Woman (the Church) fled into the Wilderneſs,

                  <p>I reply, this Anſwer is ridiculous. For whereas Proteſtants hence prove,
that at ſome times the Church is hid from men, this Authour ſaith, <hi>It was not
hid from the Dragon,</hi> that is, the Devil, which is not in queſtion. So that it
appears he had nothing to anſwer this Inference, from the Womans flying into
the Wilderneſs, and being hid, that ſometimes the Church is ſo hidden as it were
in a Wilderneſs, that though it be, yet it is not ſo viſible or conſpicuous as that
men can diſcern it ſo as to repair to it, howbeit the Devil knows where they
lurk.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet once more</hi> H. T. <hi>Object.</hi> The Church of the Predeſtinate is inviſible.
<hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no ſuch thing as a Church of the Predeſtinate. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Church
is the congregation of all true believers, as well Reprobate as predeſtinate.
There is in his Floor both Wheat and Chaff, St. Matth. c. 3. and in his Field both
Corn and Tares, which ſhall grow together till the Harveſt (the Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)

true indeed, their Predeſtination is inviſible, and ſo is alſo theſe mens Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
                  <p>I reply, To ſalve their main Tenet of the Popes being Head of the Church
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is often ſo wicked as that, if the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be of elect perſons onely, many Popes cannot be termed Members, much

who cannot be ſaid <hi>to be</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s body, his fulneſs, to be loved, ſanctified, whom
he nouriſheth, intends to preſent without ſpot,</hi> as he ſaith there of <hi>Chriſt's</hi>
Church. He that deſires more proof may reade Dr. <hi>John Rainold</hi> his fourth
<hi>Concluſion,</hi> where he proves it fully, both from Scripture and Fathers, that <hi>the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119447:45"/>
holy Catholick Church which we believe is the whole company of Gods elect and
choſen,</hi> which hath not been yet anſwered that I know. Nor do I ſee how the
fourth <hi>Lateran Council</hi> could mean otherwiſe, which determined, as <hi>H. T.</hi>
ſaith here, <hi>art. 1. pag. 30. that the univerſal Church of the faithfull is one out of
which no man can be ſaved,</hi> which can be true onely of the Church of the
Predeſtinate. As for what <hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith here, <hi>The Church of</hi> Chriſt <hi>is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of all true believers as well Reprobate as Predeſtinate,</hi> it ſuppoſeth
true believers may be reprobate: but this is falſe, meaning it of the truth of
being oppoſite to feigned, counterfeit, or in ſhew onely. For our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi>
hath ſaid, <hi>John 5. 24. &amp; John</hi> 3. 15, 16, 18, 36. that ſuch <hi>as believe on him
ſhall not periſh, come not to condemnation, are paſſed from death to life, have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life.</hi> Nor do the Texts <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 12. where <hi>the Floor</hi> is not <hi>Chriſt's</hi>
Church, but the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> people, or <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 30. where <hi>the Field</hi> is expreſly
interpreted <hi>verſ</hi> 38. to be <hi>the World,</hi> not the Church, ſpeak to the contrary.
It is true, <hi>The Predeſtinate are as viſible as the Reprobate,</hi> but they are not
meerly viſible believers as ſome Reprobates are, who profeſs faith, which they
have not. But the <hi>true Church of</hi> Chriſt <hi>againſt which the Gates of Hell ſhall
not prevail, Matth.</hi> 16. 18. contains onely ſuch believers as have that faith
which is true, and that Election of God, which with their faith are inviſible,
and ſo are rightly denominated the inviſible Church from that which is more
excellent, and the Reprobate have not.</p>

Unity in general is ſo far from being eſſentially preſuppoſed to

                     </gap> were ſaid, One is many or all; yet I deny not ſome unity in
ſpecial may be eſſentially preſuppoſed to ſome univerſality in ſpecial. There are
many ſorts of unity which Logicians and Writers of Metaphyſicks reckon up,
in reſpect of which it is certain, that the true Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be ſaid
to be one, as it cannot be ſaid to be one with generical or ſpecifical unity; for
that is not eſſentially preſuppoſed to univerſality of time and place, but is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
from it. But he ſeems to mean unity in Doctrine, Diſcipline, and
Faith, by the words following. Univerſality likewiſe is manifold, as Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and Writers of Metaphyſicks ſhew, as there is an univerſality of predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of eſſence, and exiſtence. Now this Authour ſeems to mean univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of exiſtence for time and place, and his meaning is this, that unity of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Diſcipline, and Faith, is eſſentially preſuppoſed to univerſality of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119447:46"/>
for time and place: that is, that Church which hath not the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Faith, and Diſcipline, which all Churches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all times and
places have had, is not the true Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that which hath is the
true Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now theſe Propoſitions I grant, if meant of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and Faith in the Fundamentals, but not if meant of meer outward
Church-diſcipline, or Doctrine, and Faith in points not fundamental, having
learned from the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11, 12, 13, 14. that <hi>ſome may build Hay and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
that is, ſome errors upon the foundation <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who <hi>yet may be ſaved:</hi> which
they could not be, if they were not of the true Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or, that is no
true Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which conſiſts of ſuch. In like manner, the Apoſtle
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 2. expreſly tells us in the Church of <hi>Rome, one did believe he might eat
all things, and another did eat herbs, one eſteemed one day above another, others
eſteemed every day alike,</hi> and yet <hi>God received them both,</hi> and they <hi>were Gods
ſervants,</hi> v. 3, 4, 5. And that in Diſcipline there may be diſagreement, yea,

they hold the ſame Faith and Doctrine in the main, or points fundamental. <hi>To

church,</hi> after he changeth it into this, that <hi>the church of</hi> Rome <hi>is both
perfectly one, and alſo univerſal for time and place is thus demonſtrated,</hi> here the
concluſion is <hi>the</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick church and no other is the church of Chriſt.</hi> By
comparing of which it is apparent, that this Author ſuppoſeth <hi>the true church,
the church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick church</hi> to be ſynonymous or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
names of the ſame thing, which is ſuppoſed but not proved, nor yeilded,
nor can be true, as ſhall be ſhewed after. 2. This Author pretends to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
by this argument, the church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be perfectly one,</hi> which
ſhould have been his concluſion, whereas not heeding his words he makes it the
<hi>Minor.</hi> 3. He puts in by a <hi>parentheſis</hi> in the <hi>Major</hi> many words which are
not in the <hi>Minor,</hi> though they belong to the middle term, which ſhould be the
ſame in both premiſes: nor is any proof brought for them here; to wit, <hi>that
the Pope is Chriſts deputy on earth, the viſible or miniſterial head of that church,
which is one body, one fold or flock.</hi> 4. That the <hi>Major</hi> might be for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it ſhould have been thus; that church which is one body, one fold or
flock (of which he himſelf is the ſupreme inviſible head, and the Pope his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
on earth the viſible or miniſterial) and no other is the church of Chriſt,
but ſuch is the church of <hi>Rome, ergo.</hi> But as it is now framed it is in the
ſecond figure of all affirmatives, which is againſt Logick rules, and makes the
ſyllogiſm naught, as the very freſhmen know. But to it as it is now framed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119447:47"/>
I anſwer. If the words <hi>[and the Pope his deputy on earth the viſible or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial]</hi>
be left out, the <hi>Major</hi> is granted in this ſenſe, that the univerſal church
of Chriſt are one body by unity of one ſpirit and faith of the fundamentals,
and one flock by unity of one head, and ſupreme Paſtor. But in <hi>H. T.</hi> his
ſenſe it is moſt falſe, that it is one by the ſame faith in every point without any
difference in leſſer points, or without any diviſions in rites and diſciplin, and
in ſubjection to one univerſal Biſhop on earth, as Chriſts deputy and the
churches viſible head. Nor do any of the texts prove it in this ſenſe. For the
firſt doth not expreſs what all Chriſtians were in reſpect of their ſtate; but
profeſſion, and the unity is not derived from either ſubjection to one univerſal
Biſhop on earth, or agreement in all points, but from participating of one
bread in the Lords Supper. For it is not to be read as this Author after the
vulgar tranſlation reads it <hi>[as many as participate of one bread]</hi> but <hi>[for we all
partake of one bread]</hi> it being in <hi>Greek</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

of the vulgar <hi>[nam omnes]</hi> as in the <hi>Plantin</hi> edition by the <hi>Lovain</hi> Divines
1574. I finde it in the margin: ſo that the meaning is this, we do ſhew our
ſelves one body, one bread, foraſmuch as we all partake of one bread in the
Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>The next text, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22, 23. proves only that the church is one body by
unity of one head, to wit <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>H. T.</hi> rightly interprets it. And the third
text, <hi>John</hi> 10. 16. alſo makes the whole church <hi>one flock</hi> (as it ſhould be
read) not <hi>one fold,</hi> in reſpect of one Paſtor, which the very words, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. 14,
15, 16. do ſhew plainly to be Chriſt himſelf, who gave his life for them, and
no other; and therefore none of theſe texts derive the unity of the church from
ſubjection to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as viſible head or chief Paſtor. The next
text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. doth only prove that the church ought to be of one mind
and one judgement without Schiſms, not that they are, or muſt be, if they be
the true church, but the text proves the contrary, that they may be a true
church though there be Schiſms, and difference of judgement among them.
The fifth, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 32. only proves that the church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> once were ſo
(at which time they <hi>had alſo all things common,</hi> which doubtleſs <hi>H. T.</hi> will not
ſay muſt or doth agree to the whole church at all times) but not that the
whole church ſhall be ſo ſtill. The laſt, <hi>John</hi> 17. 11. is a prayer of Chriſt that
it may be ſo, and ſo will be accompliſhed, but by the words, <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22, 23.
it ſeems moſt likely not to be till they be conſummate in glory; or if afore, yet
certainly the unity cannot be meant of unity in every thing; for ſo <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Paul</hi> did not agree, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13, 14. it appears, but of ſuch unity in
communion with God, and aiming at his glory, as is only in the elect by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Chriſts indwelling by his Spirit: which is nothing to the unity which
<hi>H. T.</hi> here requires as peculiar to the <hi>Roman</hi> church. The paſſage of the
<hi>Nicene</hi> creed proves only an unity of the church, but not an unity by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in all points and ſubjection to one Catholick Biſhop on earth. So that
<hi>H. T.</hi> after his faſhion cites many texts, but not one for his purpoſe.</p>

by the preſent manifold Schiſms and diviſions, which are now among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants

Catholicks are perfectly one both in diſciplin and doctrine, all the world over,
even to the leaſt Article or point of faith, being all united to one ſupreme inviſible
head, Chriſt Jeſus, and all ſubordinate to one viſible and miniſterial head, the
Pope his Vicar on earth; we all reſolve our ſelves in points of faith into one ſafe
and moſt unchangeable principle, I believe the holy Catholick church, we look on
her as the immediate and authorized proponent of all revealed verities, and the
infallible Judge of controverſies; God himſelf being the prime Author, and his
authority the formal motive and object of our faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Proteſtants are not Sectaries nor divided from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
church, but from the now <hi>Roman</hi> party, who are really a faction divided
from the Catholick church holding a new faith never eſtabliſhed till the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentin</hi>
council, though with an impudent face <hi>H. T.</hi> avouch a moſt palbable
falſhood of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> univerſality, and arrogates to the <hi>Roman</hi> the title of
Catholick church. Nor are the now diviſions of Proteſtants in doctrine or
government ſuch as cut them off from the unity of the Catholick church, they
own Chriſt their head, and faith in him, which is ſufficient to ſave them, and
even by this Authors next argument, enough to make them members of the
Catholick church. 2. The Schiſms and diviſions of the Papiſts have been
and are as great as the diviſions of the Proteſtants. In former ages there were
many Schiſms even in the church of <hi>Rome</hi> between the ſeveral Popes at one
time, and the factions among the people about Popes and Emperours and
other quarrels. <hi>Onuphrius</hi> reckons up thirty. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf twenty ſix
Schiſms one after another, ſometimes one Pope condemning what another had
done, and excommunicating and perſecuting Emperours, Antipapes, and all
that have adhered to them. Beſides the contentions about the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi>
immaculate conception, about the ſuperiority of a council above the Pope,
about Prieſts marriages, election of Popes, inveſtiture of Biſhops have been
ſo great, and frequent, and of long continuance, as their own hiſtories ſhew,
that they far exceed the Proteſtants diviſions. The diviſions in this laſt age,
and ſome at this day, to wit, in and ſince the council of <hi>Trent</hi> between <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,
Soto, Vega, Andradius</hi> about certainty of ſalvation; <hi>Pighius</hi> and others
about inherent righteouſneſs, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and other Biſhops and the <hi>Papalins</hi>
about the divine right of Biſhops and their reſidence, not deriving their Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
from the Pope; the <hi>French</hi> churches not acknowledging the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> above a council, nor yet receiving the <hi>Trent</hi> council: the two Popes
<hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth and <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth, about the vulgar tranſlation both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning

Dr. <hi>James</hi> in his <hi>Bellum Papale</hi> ſhews, from which no Papiſts have or can

grace, and mans freewill have been and are at this day as great or greater in
reſpect of the things in which they differ, the continuance of them, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
differing and their bitterneſs one to another, then the Proteſtants diviſions,
and therefore the brag of <hi>H. T.</hi> concerning the Popiſh unity, that <hi>Catholicks
are perfectly one both in diſcipline and doctrine all the world over, even to the
leaſt article or point of faith,</hi> is a falſhood apparent to all well read ſcholars,
though the ſimple <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts, from whom the truth of theſe things is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
are made to believe by their Prieſts diſguiſes and pretences as if it were
ſo. Nor doth that which <hi>H. T.</hi> here ſaith, ſalve the matter, and if it did, the
Proteſtants have as good a plea for themſelves, notwithſtanding their diviſions,
in reſpect of means for unity. For, 1. The Papiſts all the world over are
not ſo ſubordinate to the Pope as to acknowledge his ſuperiority to a council,
but that they have and think they may appeal from the Pope to a general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
which may judge the Pope an heretick and depoſe him, yea and take away
the Pope altogether if they ſee it neceſſary, nor do the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> acquieſce in
the late Pope <hi>Innocents</hi> determination at this day, nor do the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> in
<hi>France</hi> acknowledge the Popes power in temporals, or the <hi>Venetians</hi> the Popes
power to interdict their ſtate and meddle with their government in exempting
Eccleſiaſticks from their juriſdiction. 2. That which he ſaith of <hi>the Catholick
church as the immediate and authorized proponent of all revealed verities, and
the infallible Judge of controverſies</hi> is either nonſenſe or falſe, or that which
Papiſts reject in Proteſtants. If they mean by the Catholick church the Pope,
or the Pope with his Cardinals, or a council, it is ridiculous nonſenſe to call
any or all of them the Catholick church, which, according to their own <hi>Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Catechiſm, contains all believers from</hi> Adam <hi>to this day, or that ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,</hi>
and according to this Author, <hi>p. 59. is coexiſtent with all times, and
ſpread or diffuſed over all places:</hi> or if it be underſtood according to good ſenſe,
it is moſt falſe. For the Catholick church properly ſo called as it is in the
Creed, is neither mediate nor immediate proponent of all revealed verities,
much leſs authorized thereto, nor do Papiſts ſo look on them. For many of
the Papiſts go no further than the preſent Pope or council, or their Prieſts,
(who only are to moſt the immediate proponents) but reſt in their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and adhere to what they determine with an implicite faith and blind
obedience, never enquiring what all believers have held or done before them.
Nor is it poſſible they ſhould have reſolution from the Catholick church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
underſtood as in the Creed it is believed: for it is inviſible, they never
did together expreſs their determination in all points of faith, have varied in
many, nor could it be known to others of their own time if they had, much leſs
to the believers of this age. Nor is the Catholick church fit to be the mediate
or immediate proponent of all revealed verities, nor fit for ſuch an authority
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119447:48"/>
as to be infallible Judge of controverſies: for to ſay the Catholick church is
ſuch, is to ſay the univerſity of believers is ſuch, of whom a great part are wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
a great part ignorant perſons altogether uncapable of ſuch an office: yea
it is contrary to the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> reſolution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28, 29. who tells us,
<hi>that God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, then Prophets, thirdly
Teachers,</hi> not the church to be teachers, which is all one with proponents of
revealed verities, but teachers in the church: and theſe are denied to be all the
church, when he ſaith, <hi>ver. 29. Are all teachers?</hi> And to make them infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is contrary to the Apoſtle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4. where he ſaith, <hi>let God he true, and
every man a lyar,</hi> ſurely then not an infallible Judge of controverſies: yea
ſhould this be granted, it would bring all confuſion into the churches of God.
Nor can the ſpeech have any good ſenſe, that <hi>the Catholick church is Judge in
controverſies,</hi> but this which Proteſtants indeed rightly teach, that every man
is to judge for himſelf, not for others with a judgement of diſcerning what
doctrine or points of faith he hears, and receives, yet requiring upon pain of
damnation that they be careful in examining what they embrace, which the
Papiſts do ſo much inveigh againſt falſly, as if it were a leaving every man to
his private ſpirit, though they do in this no otherwiſe than Papiſts muſt of
neceſſity, yeild to each man when the determinations of Popes and councils
are ambiguous, as they were in the council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and are often in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
Breves and other edicts of Popes, as is manifeſt by the writers on the
Canon law, and diſputes about the councils and Popes meaning, in which are
ſo many ambiguities that there is ſcarce a point in which there are not many
oppoſite opinions. If <hi>Pappus</hi> have overcounted, who reckons out of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
alone two hundred thirty ſeven contradictions in Popiſh writers; yet he that
reads <hi>Bellarmins</hi> controverſies, ſhall finde very few queſtions, in which the
Schoolmen and other Papiſts do not gainſay each other. And as for their
<hi>reſolution into the principle, I believe the Catholick church.</hi> They are not agreed
what the church is from whom they may have reſolution, whether the Pope,
who is with them the church virtual, or a general council, which is either never,
or very rare, which they call the church repreſentative, or the uniform conſent
of the Fathers, according to which only the profeſſion of faith of Pope <hi>Pius</hi>
the fourth requires all Papiſts to receive and expound the holy Scriptures: and
yet this uniform conſent of Fathers is either a nullity, it being ſcarce found in
any point, or it is impoſſible to be known. <hi>H. T.</hi> by his words <hi>pag.</hi> 108. reſolves
his faith into the next precedent age and ſo upwards, and here <hi>pag.</hi> 30. into the
church, and this church is, <hi>pag. 70. not the whole church</hi> (which yet is all one
with the Catholick) <hi>but a council approved by the Pope,</hi> into whoſe authority
they finally reſolve their faith; for though they pretend to reſolve it into the
Scripture, yet as it is expounded by the church, <hi>pag.</hi> 109, 113. which is the
Pope. So that whatever pretence they make of reſolving their faith into the
church as the proponent, or God as the Author; in concluſion they acquieſce
in what the Pope dictates by himſelf or with a council approved by him. As
for the Scriptures the Papiſts are not all agreed which be the Canonical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
which not: nor can they ſet down certain rules to know what are the
unwritten traditions of the church, which they are <hi>to admit and embrace with
a like affection of piety as the written Word,</hi> as the <hi>Trent</hi> council decreed, <hi>ſeſſ.</hi> 4.
nor can they have any bottom to reſt on by their principles; ſometimes one
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119447:49"/>
Pope and one council croſſing another, ſome having been condemned in gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
councils as hereticks: nor can they tell, but by information of others, as
Prieſts or Carriers, of their Bulls or Breves (which are many of them not only
fallible, but alſo falſe, as ſome of their own have complained) what the Popes
determin, and what fraud is uſed in procuring Popes Bulls or Breves ſometimes
is many ways teſtified, as that the Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, wherein Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
was excommunicated and deprived, was gotten in a
fraudulent way by <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Webb;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Watſon</hi> quodlib. p. 252, 260, 343.</note> there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
from the reports of others what the Pope determins,
except a man hear him preach, or pronounce ſentence, or
ſee him write and ſeal, he muſt rely on the teſtimony of thoſe that may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are
like enough to deceive. Nor if a man ſee or hear the Pope decree, can he be
certain whether he <hi>ſpake from</hi> Peters <hi>chair,</hi> or determine what is to be believed
by the whole church (out of which caſe they ſay he is fallible) or give his
opinion as a private Doctor. So that it is moſt falſe, that either Papiſts agree
as <hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith, or reſolve themſelves into one ſafe and moſt unchangeable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
or have any infallible judge of controverſies, or have God himſelf for
the prime Author, and his authority the formal object and motive of their
faith: but their faith in what they differ from us reſts only on mens ſayings,
for the moſt part ignorant and wicked (for ſuch have been moſt of the Popes
for a thouſand years) whom they follow againſt the plain and confeſſed words
of the Scripture, as in their communion under one kinde, worſhipping of
Images, and aſcribe to them power by their authority to declare new Scriptures
and Articles of faith, and make the Scripture only to be believed becauſe of the
churches determination, that is the Popes, which in reſpect of us they make
of more authority than the Scripture, and ſo make the churches, not Gods
authority, the formal motive and object of their faith. So that if unity be a
note of the church, of all others the Popiſh church can lay leaſt claim to it, and
<hi>H. T.</hi> his argument may be retorted. The Catholick church is one, the
<hi>Roman</hi> church is not one, therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> church is not the Catholick
church. On the other ſide the Proteſtants have better unity and means of
unity than Papiſts. For however they differ in ceremonies and diſciplin, yet
in points of faith they differ little, as may appear by the <hi>harmony of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,</hi>
which ſhews agreement in their churches; however in explication
of points private Doctors differ, and they have a more ſure principle and ſafe in
owning one Maſter even <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and one certain rule to know the minde of
God, to wit the holy Scripture, which the Papiſts themſelves make the object of
faith, and the tranſlation into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue makes plain in the chief
points to be believed, ſo that every ordinary man may be certain what it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
concerning them, and this tranſlation appears to be certain in thoſe things,

                  <argument>
                     <p>The argument of H. T. from the unity of a natural body, is againſt him and for
Proteſtants.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>But H. T. adds a ſecond argument for the unity of the Catholick church thus.
As a natural unity and connexion of the parts among themſelves, and to the
head is neceſſary for the being and conſervation of a natural body: ſo the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
unity and connexion of the members amongſt themſelves and to the
head, is neceſſary for the being and conſervation of a myſtical body. But
the church of Chriſt (as I have proved) is a myſtical body. Therefore a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
unity and connexion of the members amongſt themſelves and to the
head, is neceſſary for the being and conſervation of the church of Chriſt.
The Major is proved by the parity of reaſon, which is between a natural and
myſtical body; for as a natural body muſt needs dye, if all it's parts by which
it ſhould ſubſiſt be torn and divided one from another; ſo alſo a myſtical body
periſhes, if all it's members be divided from one another, and from the head
(whence it hath it's ſpiritual life) by Schiſm and hereſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> THough it be that this argument is only from a ſimilitude, which
doth only illuſtrate not prove, as Logicians ſay truely, and
there be ſuch diſparities between a natural body and a myſtical, as are ſufficient
to ſhew the weakneſs of this arguing; as namely, that there are no parts vital
in the myſtical body beſides the head, as the heart, liver and lungs are in the
natural, that ſome parts of the head it ſelf may be cut off, as the ears, and noſe,
and yet the being, though not the integrity of the body continue, that there
are ſome parts that have not life, as hair, and nayles, (as ſome conceive) that
the parts receive not life from the head, but the head and the reſt from the ſoul:

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ith the concluſion is true, and the argument with its proof many wayes
againſt the Popiſh tenets, I grant it, and obſerve, 1. That the unity which is
proved hence, is not of the univerſal viſible church; the truth of which Papiſts
and this Author go about to demonſtrate by it's unity, but of the myſtical.
For in this myſtical body the unity is ſpiritual by faith, and the members have
ſpiritual life from the head. But in the Catholick church (of which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes
are) according to <hi>Bellarm. l. 3. de eccl. milit. c.</hi> 10 &amp;c. are many dead
members, ſecret infidels: ſo that this argument proves not the Catholick vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
by it's unity, but the Catholick inviſible of true believers. 2. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is not to prove the unity of the church by ſubjection to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Biſhop, by which <hi>H. T.</hi> would demonſtrate the unity of the church, but by
the unity to that head whence the body hath it's ſpiritual life and motion,
which ſure is Chriſt only and not the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> 3. This ſimilitude, if
by [head] were meant the Pope, cannot evince the purpoſe of this Author. For
there have been Schiſms in the <hi>Roman</hi> church of one Pope and his party againſt
another, and yet the unity of the Catholick church in the profeſſion of the

the unity of the church Catholick without hereſie, but only diſorder, diſtemper
and diſquiet it. And therefore though it were granted (as it is not) that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119447:50"/>
were Schiſmaticks in dividing from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they might
be united to the Catholick church, and it's being and conſervation continued
as long as the unity of faith is continued, and until it be proved that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
have departed from the unity of faith once delivered to the Saints
(which he can never do) in vain doth <hi>H. T.</hi> go about to prove they are not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BUt</hi> H. T. <hi>proceeds thus.</hi> To be univerſal for time and place is nothing
elſe but to be coexiſtent with all time, and to be ſpread or diffuſed over all
places. But the church of Chriſt from the time he hath founded it hath been
coexiſtent with all time, and ſhall be to the worlds end, and hath and ſhall be
ſpread over all nations, therefore the church of Chriſt is univerſal (or Catholick)
for time and place. The Major is proved becauſe the definition and the thing
defined are convertible. The Minor is proved by Scripture for time, St. <hi>Matth.</hi>
28. 20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12, 13. St. <hi>John</hi> 14. 15, 16. St. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 33. For place,
<hi>Pſal. 85. 9. Iſa.</hi> 2. 2. St <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The concluſion ſhould have been, the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick church
and no other is the church of Chriſt, and the argument thus. That church
which is univerſal for time and place, and no other is the church of Chriſt.
But the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick church and no other is univerſal for time and place,
therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick church and no other is the church of Chriſt.
But ſo the <hi>Major</hi> had not been true of any church exiſtent in one age, nor the
<hi>Minor</hi> true of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is contrary to all ſenſe and
hiſtories which relate the occurrences of the world, ſpecially in the churches of
Chriſt. 2. As the argument is framed here by <hi>H. T.</hi> the concluſion is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
being thus underſtood, that the church of Chriſt is not confined to <hi>Iſrael</hi>
only, but extended to all Nations indefinitely and aptitudinally, though not
definitely and actually extended to every Nation. For ſome nations never
were actually the church of Chriſt, nor any church of Chriſt among them,
though there was no reſtraint by Chriſts command of preaching to them. But
if it be underſtood of actual coexiſtence with all times and all places ſo the
<hi>Minor</hi> is not true: nor the <hi>Major,</hi> as I conceive the meaning of the term <hi>[Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick]</hi>
in the Article of the Creed, <hi>I believe the holy Catholick church:</hi> nor
is that the definition of the church Catholick, that it is actually coexiſtent
with all time, and to be ſpread or diffuſed over all places: but it is termed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
becauſe it is not confined to one Nation, and comprehends all the
believers of any Nation, Jew or Gentile: nor do the texts he brings prove any
other univerſality. For <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. proves not ſuch an univerſality, as
that there ſhall be no interval of time or particular place, wherein the church
ſhall not be exiſtent. But that Chriſt would be with them that preach the
Goſpel all dayes till the end of the world, ſo as that they had liberty to preach
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119447:50"/>
the Goſpel in every place, and ſhould finde his aſſiſtance while they did preach,
not that alwayes in each day there ſhall be a Church of Chriſt on earth, much
leſſe that there ſhall be a church viſible conſpicuouſly to all in every Nation of
the earth. The like is the ſenſe of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12, 13. which is, that Chriſt
hath given various gifts till all come to the unity of faith: but this proves not
there ſhall be a continuance of the Church on earth in every age, much leſſe ſo
conſpicuouſly viſible as that it may be known to all, much more leſſe in every
place. <hi>John</hi> 14. 15, 16. is yet farther from the purpoſe as containing a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
promiſe to the Apoſtles: if it be meant of any Church it is the inviſible of
true believers, not of every or any meer viſible Church, wherein many have
not the ſpirit of Chriſt at all, much leſſe abiding with them for ever. The text
<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 33. doth not prove that there ſhall be in every age or time a Church
on earth, but that Chriſts dominion ſhall never end. The texts <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 9.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 2. are thus meant, that not only the Jews, but alſo all Nations, that
is, all other people by faith ſhall be admitted to the Church of God by faith as
well as Jews; now this proves not, that there ſhall be in every place on earth
a Church of Chriſt. But <hi>H. T.</hi> adds.</p>
                  <p>I reſume the Argument and make it thus. 1. That church which is not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
(or Catholick) for time and place is not the church of Chriſt. 2. But the
Proteſtant church (and the like may be ſaid of all other Sectaries) is not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
(or Catholick) for time and place. 3. Therefore the Proteſtant church
is not the church of Chriſt. The Major hath been proved before. The Minor is
proved, becauſe before <hi>Luther</hi> (who lived little above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ixſcore years ago) there
were no Proteſtants to be found in the whole world, as hath been proved by us,
and confeſſed by our adverſaries. To which you may adde, they have never yet
been able to convert any one Nation from infidelity to the faith of Chriſt, nor
ever had communion with all nations, nor indeed any perfect communion among
themſelves: therefore they cannot be the Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Major, <hi>That church which is not univerſal for time and place is
not the Church of Chriſt,</hi> If meant of actual or aptitudinal univerſality is not
true. For the church of the Jews afore <hi>Cornelius</hi> was converted by <hi>Peter</hi> had
been no church of Chriſt, which was actually, yea and aptitudinally, that is
according to <hi>Peters</hi> and other Chriſtians circumciſed their opinions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
to be confined to the Jews: and therefore no other church than on
earth were or was believed by <hi>Peter</hi> and thoſe who <hi>contended with him,</hi> Act.
11. 2. and yet there was a Church of Chriſt before, as is manifeſt from <hi>Acts</hi>
2. 47. But if the <hi>Major</hi> be underſtood of univerſality of faith thus, <hi>That church
which is not univerſal for time and place by holding the faith once delivered by
the Apoſtles to the Saints is not the church of Chriſt,</hi> it is granted: but in that
ſenſe the <hi>Minor</hi> is falſe, <hi>the Proteſtants church is univerſal for time and place:</hi>
that is, holds the ſame faith, which was in all places preached by the Apoſtles
and Apoſtolical teachers to believers. And in this ſenſe Proteſtants have been
in every age before <hi>Luther,</hi> and have as really converted Nations from infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to the faith of Chriſt as the Popiſh church or Teachers, and have had more
perfect communion with all Nations and among themſelves then Papiſts, as
ſuch, have had, and the Papiſts have not been ſo, but have held a new faith, not
embraced by a great part of Chriſtians, nor in all places received or known,
nor for many hundreds of years taught in the churches, but lately by the <hi>Italian</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:119447:51"/>
faction deviſed to uphold the Popes tyranny and their own gain. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I retort the argument thus. That church which is not univerſal (or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick)
for the time and place, is not the church of Chriſt. But the Popiſh
<hi>Roman</hi> church is not univerſal (or Catholick) for time and place, but is of late
ſtanding, therefore it is not the true church of Chriſt.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>AS for the words of the Fathers, which <hi>H. T.</hi> allegeth on this Article,
they are not for <hi>H. T.</hi> his purpoſe to prove, that that is the only true
church which is ſubject to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that the <hi>Roman</hi> church is
the Catholick church, but they prove the contrary. For the words of <hi>Irenaem
l. 4. adv. haereſes c.</hi> 43. are theſe. <hi>Wherefore we ought to obey thoſe Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which are in the church, thoſe which have ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles as we
have ſhewed, who with the ſucceſſion of Biſhoprick have received the certain
gift of truth according to the pleaſure of the Father: but to have the reſt ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either as hereticks and of evil opinion, or as renters and lifted up and pleaſing
themſelves, or again as hypocrites working for gain and vain glories ſake, who
depart from the original ſucceſſion and are gathered in every place. For all theſe
fall from the truth.</hi> By which it may be perceived. 1. That <hi>H. T.</hi> omitted
ſundry words which would have ſhewed that Presbyters and Biſhops were all
one. 2. That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> requires that thoſe to whom he would have obedience
given, be ſuch as have not only ſucceſſion of place, but alſo <hi>the certain gift of
truth.</hi> Whence it follows. 1. That this ſpeech doth not prove that we are
to obey only the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but any Presbyters.
2. That the ſucceſſion required is not confined to <hi>Rome,</hi> but extended to any
place. 3. That ſucceſſion to any of the Apoſtles as well as <hi>Peter</hi> is termed
original ſucceſſion. 4. That Presbyters who in any place depart not from the
truth are in the church. And therefore this place is ſo far from proving the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of unity with the <hi>Roman</hi> church, or that it is the Catholick church, that
it proves the contrary.</p>
                  <p>The words of <hi>Origen</hi> are not for <hi>H. T.</hi> which <hi>require no other doctrine to
be kept, but that which is by order of ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, and remains in

the Catholick church, nor ſay in it only is Gods true worſhip and ſervice
and hope of life, but <hi>in the Catholick</hi> church, that is <hi>the Church of true believers</hi>
all over the world, as the words of <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> next alleged do ſhew, in

impudently appropriated to the <hi>Roman</hi> church. For a few lines before <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
declares whom he calls <hi>the catholick church, that which is ſpread over the earth,

                  <p>H. T. <hi>ſaith,</hi> As the <hi>Roman</hi> church is the collection of all churches holding

the church of <hi>Naples</hi> is the <hi>Roman,</hi> and ſo of other churches. If any were
asked who is in his wits, What is the church of <hi>Naples?</hi> Would he ſay, It is

they apoſtarize the church of <hi>Rome</hi> ceaſeth to be. Nor will it be ſaid, other

I think <hi>H. T.</hi> diſtinctly knows himſelf; but that he is uſed to this unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
Jeſuitical non-ſenſe of <hi>Roman catholick church.</hi> Sure before he made this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119447:52"/>
the definition of catholick, that <hi>it is nothing elſe but to be coexiſtent with all
time, and to be ſpread or diffuſed over all places:</hi> according to which, by terming
the church of <hi>Rome</hi> catholick, he ſhould mean that the <hi>Roman</hi> church hath
been in all places ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> built this church, and in every place of the
world: but both theſe are palpable Lies, contrary to all Hiſtories and ſenſe:
nor in this ſenſe ſhould it be as a whole that hath parts, but be the onely and an

                  <p>But he gives two Reaſons of this Title, <hi>that it is the Mother Church, and
hath power of headſhip and juriſdiction over all the reſt.</hi> I reply, 1. that both
theſe are manifeſtly falſe. For the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is not the mother Church
in any true ſenſe. It is a ſaying indeed, <hi>that God is a believers Father, and
the Church his Mother.</hi> But however the Ancients have uſed it, yet the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſaith not ſo, nor is it in any good ſenſe true. For the church is but a
congregation of believers, who are firſt ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ore they are a church: now
then the ſenſe muſt be the church, that is, believers are the mother of believers,
that is, the church, which is ridiculous. It is true, it is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26.
<hi>The</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>which is above is free, which is the mother of us all:</hi> but that is
the Evangelical covenant, <hi>v.</hi> 24. not the church. Nor is there any thing done
by the Church, or upon the church, from which in a meet reſemblance the
church may be termed the mother of believers. They are the Preachers of the
Goſpel not the church who bring forth ſouls to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If the term <hi>[Mother
Church]</hi> be from hence, that from it the Goſpel went forth, it can be meant of
none but <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from whence the Goſpel went into all the world, not from
the <hi>Roman</hi> church. Nor is it true, that the <hi>Roman</hi> church hath the power of
headſhip over all the reſt, no not according to the Papiſts own opinion, which
is that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath this power, and that it belongs to his paſtoral
office: now I ſuppoſe they will not ſay the church hath the paſtoral office, or
that they are Paſtors; if they ſhould, they muſt make Women, who are of
the Church as well as Men, Paſtors, and all the Believers (who are the church)
Paſtors as well as the Biſhop, aud if the church be Paſtors or have power of
juriſdiction, who are the Sheep who are to be fed, and over whom this juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is to be exerciſed? But if they mean onely by the church univerſal the

is made which is the true church, and when there is no Pope, then there
is no church, and when the Pope is uncertain, it is uncertain which is the
church. So ridiculous is the Papiſts talk and diſpute about the church, that
there is no tolerable ſenſe can be made with truth of the <hi>Roman church being
catholick, the mother of churches, having power of Headſhip and Juriſdiction
over all churches.</hi> Nor is it true, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath either of right
or in poſſeſſion ſuch power; not of right, as ſhall be ſhewed <hi>art.</hi> 7. where it
will appear that the claim to it is meerly impudent, and arrogant, without any
colour of right; nor in poſſeſſion. For beſides the Proteſtant churches, the
<hi>Greek</hi> churches neither now nor heretofore, when unqueſtionably orthodox,
were ever ſubject to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Biſhop. Yet were theſe things granted to <hi>H. T.</hi>
that <hi>the</hi> Roman <hi>church were Mother and Head,</hi> is this a fit reaſon to term it
catholick? Will any call a mother of twenty children all her twenty chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?

<hi>H. T.</hi> his inſtance is frivolous: Though men call the Rulers of an
Army the Captain General, yet not a general man, or the univerſal Army;
and ſutably, if it were allowed, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> were univerſal Biſhop,
yet in no good ſenſe could he or the <hi>Roman</hi> church be termed the univerſal

                  </argument>
                  <p>H. T. entitles his fifth Article thus, The churches infallibility demonſtrated, and
ſaith, Our Tenet is, that the Roman catholick church is the higheſt viſible Judge
of controverſies, and that ſhe is infallible both in her Propoſitions and Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of all points of faith; having a power from God to oblige all men to believe
her under pain of damnation. And ſix pages after p. 70. he ſaith thus, Note
here for your better underſtanding this whole Queſtion, that when we affirm,
the Church is infallible in things of faith, by the word [Church] we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not onely the Church diffuſed over all the World, unanimouſly teaching,
whoſe Doctrine of Faith we hold to be infallible, but alſo the Church repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Council perfectly oecumenical, (that is to ſay, called out of the whole
world, and approved by the Pope) whoſe Definitions of Faith we hold to be
infallible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> WE have here a moſt arrogant proud claim like that of the King
of <hi>Tyrus, Ezek. 28. 2, 3. I am God, I ſit in the ſeat of God, there
is no ſecret that they can hide from me.</hi> For what is this leſs
which is here aſcribed to meer men, often the worſt of men, than
the prerogative of the Son of God: ſurely it's more than Angels have, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 18:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119447:54"/>
But though this Author is bold enough in the title and tenet, yet in his after
note he hath ſuch ſubterfuges as ſhew his deſpair of making it good, and his
deceitful mockage of his unwary reader. For, 1. He deals like a ſophiſter
that after his arguments ſtates the queſtion. 2. He doth ſo ſhift off this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
from one to another, that he knows not well where to fix it. Fain
he would faſten it on the Pope, as he doth in a manner at laſt; and <hi>Hart</hi> more
plainly confeſſeth with <hi>Rainold, ch. 7. diviſ. 7. though it behove the Pope to uſe
the adviſe of his brethren; and therefore I ſpake of Confiſtories, Courts and
Councils; yet whether he follow their adviſe or no his decrees are true.</hi> But
then the arguments from Scripture and Fathers which ſpeak of the church, not
of the Pope, had appeared to be impertinent. Therefore he doth not in plain
words diſclaim it's infallibility; but ſaith, <hi>When we affirm the church is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in things of faith, by the word [church] we underſtand not only the church
diffuſed over all the world unanimouſly teaching, whoſe doctrines of faith we hold
to be infallible.</hi> Wherein you may perceive. 1. Egregious vanity, in making
<hi>the</hi> Roman <hi>church Catholick. 2. The Church diffuſed over all the world
teaching. 3. Teaching unanimouſly,</hi> which are all like a ſick mans dreams of
a golden mountain, there having never been any ſuch thing as this in the
world, nor ever is likely to be. 2. Egregious deceit in the terming <hi>this church
infallible, Judge of controverſies, propounding and defining points of faith, having
power from God to oblige all men under pain of damnation to believe her:</hi> which
is meerly to delude ſilly Papiſts ſpeaking of the churches power, which they
place in the Pope and ſo draw them into his net. For I would ask this <hi>H. T.</hi>
where or when the Catholick church diffuſed over the whole world diſtinct from
an oecumenical council did teach, much leſſe teach unanimouſly, or how they
know it? he will certainly ſay, it hath been in councils or the Popes deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.
Why then doth not this Author ſay plainly, the infallibility
and judgement of controverſies is not in the Catholick church diffuſed over the
world, according to the meaning of the words (which were indeed to ſay all
believers were infallible) but ſay, he means not only, which is as if he had ſaid,
the Catholick church diffuſed over the world is infallible, but not it only, when
he means it not to be infallible at all: nor doth he deal better in placing it in
a council. For. 1. He ſuppoſeth ſuch <hi>a council perfectly Oecumenical called
out of the whole world,</hi> as never was nor is likely ever to be. 2. This council
he will not have to be infallible without the Popes approbation. 3. He placeth
the words <hi>[whoſe definitions of faith we hold to be infallible]</hi> ſo as that a
reader may conceive either he means the councils or the Popes definitions.
However it is certain he makes the council without the Pope not infallible, ſo
that the Pope hath the negative voice. But indeed this Author or many of his
fellows at leaſt hold, that if the Pope himſelf without a council define any point
of faith it muſt be received; yea <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith <hi>l. 4. de Pontifice Romano. c.</hi> 5.
<hi>if the Pope ſhould erre in commanding vices or forbidding vertues, the church
ſhould be bound to believe vices to be good and vertues to be evil, unleſs ſhe would
ſin againſt conſcience.</hi> So that however the church be pretended, it is the Pope
who is intended, who is masked under the name of the church, but ſometimes
termed the Paſtor of the Church, as if the ſame perſon could be relative and
correlative too, Paſtor and Church both. And this one perſon (as if all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
lay in his breaſt) muſt be the Judge of all controverſies of faith, though
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119447:54"/>
perhaps an infidel in heart, one of the greateſt perverters of the faith of Chriſt
in the world, and the greateſt offender, and moſt juſtly accuſed of any in the
world, being notoriouſly and horribly vitious, and maintain manifeſt ſins, (not
only <hi>erre in doubtful matters,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would ſeem to limit his ſpeech in
his <hi>recognition)</hi> even theſe monſtrous ſins, of breaking oaths and leagues,
killing Kings, allowing inceſtuous marriages, making and worſhipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
Yea though he be ſo unlearned (as it is ſaid of one) as not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
Grammer, Pope <hi>Gregory the great</hi> himſelf underſtood not Greek, Pope
<hi>Zachary</hi> condemned Biſhop <hi>Vigilius</hi> as an heretick for holding <hi>Antipodes,</hi>
though he be ſeldome a Divine, for the moſt part a meer Canoniſt, whoſe very
decrees, Breves and Bulls ſhew ſuch groſſe ignorance and pervertings of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as a graduate in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Univerſities would be aſhamed of, yet he muſt
be Judge of controverſies between the moſt learned Divines in the world and
in the moſt weighty points of faith. Surely were not Papiſts either very ſilly
or very Atheiſtical, or very much bewitched with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſorceries they
would never be ſo ſottiſh as they are to truſt to the Popes definitions in points
of faith, but of any other moſt ſuſpect them, eſpecially conſidering how much
reſpect to their own gain and greatneſſe, how little to the good of mens ſouls is
in all their determinations. No marvail though different parties appeal to the

infallibility in her propoſitions and definitions of all points of faith
and power from God to oblige all men to believe her under pain of damnation:
<hi>where firſt he brings four arguments for her infallibility. The firſt is thus.</hi>
No man by hearing (or believing) Chriſt can hear an errour in faith. But eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man by hearing the church hears Chriſt, therefore no man by hearing the
church can hear an errour in faith, therefore ſhe is infallible. The Major muſt
be granted, otherwiſe you charge Chriſt to be the Author of damning lyes. The
Minor is proved; he that beareth you (the church) heareth me, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth
you deſpiſeth me. St. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10 16. The conſequences are both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The concluſion is not the ſame with the tenet, which was that
the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick church is infallible, but in the concluſion is no mention
of the <hi>Roman</hi> church more then of any other church, to wit, the <hi>Hieroſolymitan</hi>
or <hi>Antiochian,</hi> and ſo that which was to be proved is not proved. 2. The
<hi>Minor</hi> is denyed, and in the proof from <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 16. is with a ſhameleſſe fraud
foiſted in (the church) it being certain that at that time there was no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
church diffuſed over the world, much leſſe <hi>Roman</hi> church at all, to whom
thoſe words of Chriſt could be directed, but by <hi>[you]</hi> are meant either the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119447:55"/>
ſeventy Diſciples, or the twelve Apoſtles, as comparing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 16. with
<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 40. makes it probable. Nor doth Chriſt ſay, <hi>he that heareth you
heareth me, and he that despiſeth you despiſeth me</hi> in any caſe whatſoever, for
then the high Prieſts had heard Chriſt when they heard <hi>Judas</hi> (who was one
of the Apoſtles) offer and promiſe to ſell Chriſt for money, and <hi>Peter</hi> when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e
denied Chriſt: but then when the Apoſtles or ſeventy ſpake the words and
meſſage of Chriſt. In which caſe I grant the church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Pope, yea and
Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem, Corinth</hi> or any private Chriſtian, though but a woman,
are to be heard and are infallible. So that this place is groſſely abuſed for proof
of the Catholick <hi>Roman</hi> Churches, or oecumenical councils, or Popes infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in their definitions of faith, till it be proved that they define what Chriſt
did before deliver.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Matth. 18. 17. or 18. 1 John 4. 6. Mark. 16. 15, 16. make nothing for

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe ſecond argument is this. No man can be damned for not believing an
error in faith. But every man ſhall be damned for not believing the church,
therefore no man can believe an error in faith by believing the church. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
is proved, becauſe otherwiſe God were a tyrant in damning us for not believing
a lye, which contradicts himſelf. The Minor is as evident; he that will not
hear the church let him be to thee as an heathen and a publican: ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18.
He that knoweth God heareth us, and he that heareth us not is not of God; in this
we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 6. Go ye preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The concluſion is not the ſame with <hi>H. T.</hi> his tenet, and ſo the
proof is in the ſame manner faulty as in the firſt argument. 2. The <hi>Minor</hi>
is denied: nor doth any one of the texts alleged prove it or any thing like it,
For, 1. The text <hi>Matth.</hi> 18 17, or 18. is not as this Author cites it <hi>[be
that will not hear the Church]</hi> as if it were an indefinite ſpeech equipollent to
this univerſal <hi>[every man that will not hear the Church]</hi> without which <hi>H. T.</hi>
proves not his <hi>Minor,</hi> but thus <hi>[but and if he hear not the Church]</hi> reſtraining

two or three witneſſes. 3. Of whom the Church hath been told. 4. And
he doth not obey the Church.</hi> 2. The text ſpeaks not at all of believing the
Church in a point of faith, but doing right to an injured brother. For the
phraſe of <hi>ſinning againſt a brother,</hi> ver. 15. can neither be meant of hereſie, or
error in faith, no nor ſinfulneſſe in life, which is termed commonly (though
for the moſt part miſtakingly) a publick ſcandal, or ſcandalous practiſe, but
only of a particular injury, ſuch as he, againſt whom the ſin was, might forgive,
as is manifeſt from, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. and the parable following: whereas to forgive
hereſies or errors in faith or publick ſcandalous practiſes, is not in the power of
a private brother. 3. That by <hi>[the Church]</hi> is meant, the Chriſtian Church
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119447:55"/>
is not certain, ſith it is not as <hi>Matth. 16. 18. [my Church]</hi> but <hi>[the Church]</hi>
nor if it were, can it be underſtood either of the univerſal Church diffuſed over
all the world, ſith it is impoſſible for every injured brother to tell his injury
to it, not of a perfectly Oecumenical council called out of the world; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there never was ſuch a Church, or if ever there were it hath not been in
many ages together. <hi>H. T.</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>p. 7. 25. the ſecond third and tenth ages
produced no councils.</hi> Nor if there were in every age or every year, could every
injured brother addreſſe their complaints to them. And the ſame may be ſaid
of the Pope, ſometimes there hath been none for ſome years together, ſometimes
it hath been uncertain which was the true Pope, ſometimes by reaſon of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
and for other cauſes no acceſſe could be to him, ſometimes the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
brother could not travel to him, nor he hear his cauſe. Nor is there any
direction to go to his legate, or any aſſurance that he can commit his power to
another, or that ſuch a legate is infallible. Undoubtedly by <hi>[the Church]</hi>
Matth. 18. 17. muſt be meant ſuch an aſſembly, whether regularly formed, or
otherwiſe occaſionally convening, which is of near acceſſe, and which is fit to
hear the cauſe and to determin. And I muſt confeſſe that I cannot deprehend
that by <hi>[the Church]</hi> is meant the meer Eccleſiaſtical authority, nor is here
appointed that diſciplin Eccleſiaſtical, which is termed <hi>the power of the keyes,</hi>
to excommunicate hereticks and ſcandalous livers in the Church, but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to a wronged brother how to deal in caſe of particular injuries, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> blames ſo much in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 4. Neither doth <hi>[let him be to thee as a heathen and a
Publican]</hi> import excommunication out of the Church. For it is ſaid, <hi>let
him be to thee,</hi> not to the Church, <hi>as a heathen or a Publican,</hi> nor is any power
at all therein given to the Church to excommunicate: all that the Church is
to do, is to injoyn what the injurious brother ſhould do, that excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is here mentioned is appointed or permitted to the wronged brother.
Nor did the being a Publican exclude out of the Jewiſh aſſembly or ſervice,
<hi>the Publican went up to the Temple to pray,</hi> Luke 18. 10. <hi>Matthew</hi> a Publican
was a Jew and had the priviledge of a Jew though a Publican: nor was a
heathen, as ſuch, damned, there were proſelytes, as <hi>Corn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and yet were accepted with God: only the publicans and heathens were ſuch
as the Jews would not have familiar arbitrary converſe with, as <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 2. &amp;
19. 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 3. appears, and therefore the ſpeech can have no other ſenſe
but this: If thy brother who wrongs thee will neither right thee after private
rebuke, nor after rebuke before two or three witneſſes, nor after the monition
of the Church, that is either that particular aſſembly of Chriſtians to which
ye are joyned, or ſome other competent number of Chriſtian brethren fit to
hear ſuch differences, then mayſt thou ſhun his ſociety in ſuch a manner as
Jews are wont to ſhun heathens and publicans, by not going in to them to
eat, or inviting them, or other unneceſſary ſociety, that ſo they may know how
evil their dealing is and be aſhamed and amended. Which is nothing to that
Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline or juridical excommunication which is at this day
arrogantly claimed by Popes even over Emperours, and by other Eccleſiaſtical
prelates for breaking their Canons: much leſſe doth this text infer damnation
to him that ſhall not hear the univerſal Church, or Oecumenical council, or

1. The ſequel of the Major is denied, nor is it manifeſt by the terms
of the ſuppoſition. For Chriſts preſence is with every believer, and he hath
made every believer a pillar and firmament of truth, and againſt every true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever

to Scripture, and yet it is not impoſſible he ſhould erre in faith.

granted that it is meant of the Church which is ſaid, <hi>that it is the pillar and
firmament of truth,</hi> yet it is certain from the very words, that it is meant of
that Church in which <hi>Timothy</hi> was directed how to behave himſelf, which was
the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as appears 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. not the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
therefore muſt be underſtood in ſuch a ſenſe as agrees to it: which the Papiſts
themſelves will not ſay was infallible or could not erre in faith. And therefore
they muſt yeild it to be meant either of what they were in duty to be, or what
they were actually, thus they were ſuch, as by profeſſion and practice did hold
forth, and maintain and uphold the truth in thoſe parts: not that they held
nothing but tenets, nor ſo held forth the truth, but that they might erre and
decay in their holding out the truth. For it is certain they did ſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4 5.
<hi>Act.</hi> 20. 29, 30. The terms <hi>[the pillar and firmament, or ground or ſeat of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119447:57"/>
truth]</hi> are but metaphors, and whereas there are theſe two things ſignified by
hem. 1. The upholding of the truth, ſo as that otherwiſe it ſhould fall.
2. The fixing of the truth there, ſo as that it ſhould abide and be permanent
there, doubtleſſe the former ſenſe cannot be true. For though God ſhould
have no Church on earth or in heaven, no Apoſtle, Prophet, Biſhop, yet his
truth would be upheld; <hi>his word is for ever ſettled in heaven,</hi> Pſal. 119. 89.
Chriſt who is <hi>the truth,</hi> John 14. 6. abides for ever, and the ſpirit of truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
for ever, and will uphold his truth. If it were as ſome of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>
ſay, <hi>the Church only abode in the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>at Chriſts death,</hi> or as others ſay,
<hi>in the time of Antichriſt there ſhall be no ſacrifice, nor ceremonies, nor religion,</hi>
yet the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhall be <hi>everlaſting;</hi> as the Angel terms it, <hi>Revel.</hi>
14. 6. therefore of neceſſity it muſt be underſtood in that ſenſe in which it
notes ſtability, permanency, fixedneſſe or abiding, and the ſenſe is, the Church
is the company among whom the truth abides unſhaken, in which ſenſe <hi>Revel.</hi>
3. 12. it is ſaid, <hi>him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the Temple of my
God, and he ſhall go no more out.</hi> And ſo <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>not
moved away from the hope.</hi> So that the meaning is no more but this, the
Church of the living God is not a tile which is often ſhaken and blown down
with the winde, but a pillar that abides unſhaken, and the ſeat or ground or
<hi>baſis</hi> of truth, where it abides being received and embraced by it. Which is
to be underſtood of the inviſible Church of true believers; and though not of
every truth, yet of the main <hi>truth of the Goſpel,</hi> as it is termed, <hi>Gal. 1. 5. the
Word of truth,</hi> James 1. 18. <hi>the truth,</hi> John 17. 17. which is expreſſed in
the next words, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. from which he foretels an Apoſtaſie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 1. and cannot be meant of any truth whatſoever which may be in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.
For it is certain no meer mortal man, nor all men, were ever ſo infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Which being rightly underſtood makes nothing for infallibility in all
points which the Catholick <hi>Roman</hi> Church, Oecumenical council, or Pope,
or all together ſhall define, as <hi>H. T.</hi> would have it. The next text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18.
is as little to his purpoſe. For it is not ſaid againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, much
leſſe it is ſaid againſt an Oecumenical council or the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>gates
of hell ſhall not prevail,</hi> but <hi>againſt my Church,</hi> that is, Chriſts whereſoever.
2. Nor is it proved, that by <hi>the gates of hell</hi> are meant <hi>hereſies</hi> as this Author
ſuppoſeth. The truth is, however by the modern uſe the term <hi>[hell]</hi> is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
almoſt to the place of the damned and the tormented there, yet the word
[<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] tranſlated <hi>[hell]</hi> is either never or not many times uſed in the bible for
that place or thoſe perſons, nor was of old the word <hi>[hell]</hi> appropriated to that
place of torment, but meant of the grave or the ſtate of the dead, in which ſenſe
it was meant of old that <hi>Chriſt went into hell,</hi> that is for a time to abide among
the dead, as the learned <hi>Uſher</hi> proves in his <hi>anſwer to the Jeſuits challenge,</hi> ch. 8.
and <hi>the gates of hell</hi> are no more than the gates of death or the grave, as <hi>Iſa.</hi>
38. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Pſal. 9. 13. &amp;c.</hi> is meant. So that the meaning of <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. is
no more but this, <hi>the gates of hell,</hi> or the grave, that is death, <hi>ſhall not ſo prevail
againſt my Church,</hi> but that I will <hi>raiſe it up at the laſt day</hi> to life eternal, as our
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119447:57"/>
Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 6. 39. Which being the genuine meaning, it is true
onely of the church of the elect, not of the meer viſible, nor of that is ſuch a
prevalency denied, but that they may erre in faith, however it be aſſured that it
ſhall not erre in faith finally to perdition.</p>
                  <p>The next Text <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. is ill tranſlated, <hi>[ſhall ſuggeſt to you all things
whatſoever I ſhall ſay to you]</hi> the words being <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
that is, <hi>he ſhall minde you of all things which I have ſaid to you:</hi> nor is
this meant onely in points of faith, as this Authour adds, without any reaſon
in the Text, that he might reſtrain it to them, in which he would have the
church to be accounted infallible, but alſo in matters of practiſe; and this is
meant onely of the Apoſtles, as the words <hi>[which I have ſaid to you]</hi> and
particularities expreſſed <hi>verſ. 25, 28, 29. chap. 15. 27. chap.</hi> 16 4, 6, 12, 13. ſhew.
And in like manner is the next Text, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. appropriate to the Apoſtles,
to whom the words were ſpoken. Nor are the words reſtrained to matters of
faith, but extended alſo to points of practiſe, and there is a promiſe <hi>of ſhewing
them alſo things to come.</hi> Which argues plainly, that it is not a promiſe to the
whole Church, or Pope, or Council, or every particular believer, ſith it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that to none of theſe it is verified, they have not things to come ſhewed to
them according to that promiſe, and therefore it muſt needs be impertinently
alleged by <hi>H. T.</hi> to prove his <hi>Minor.</hi>

in council, not by <hi>Peter</hi> onely, nor by a council without the Apoſtles,
much leſs by any Biſhop of one City as <hi>Rome</hi> is, and therefore proves not any
unerringneſs in any but the Apoſtles, nor in them at all times in all points of
faith, but onely their not erring in their determination at that time. So that

his Doctrine, who ſaith, <hi>pag. 202. that ſenſe cannot judge at all of ſubſtance
though it be under ſenſible accidents,</hi> there is no certainty, whether they be men

direct Infidels <hi>to ſearch the Scriptures, John</hi> 5. 39 and never to repair to the
Church to be reſolved in points of faith, if <hi>H. T.</hi> ſay true. How much doth he
abaſe the credit of the Scripture, who makes it to depend on mens (for ſuch is
the Churches pretended infallibility) report, and aſcribes it to Popes and

as if the obſcure tradition of unknown perſons from Age to Age were
more certain than the great written tradition received from Apoſtles by the

Councils, as if they were all idiots and fools, that they can underſtand no
Chapter of the Bible without the Pope, who hath been ſometimes altogether
unlearned? What Blockheads would he have men think themſelves after all

and at laſt drowned, if they have no aſſurance of the meaning of Scripture,
but from this pretended infallibility of the church, which is no better to ſtay a
Soul than an anchor of cork to ſtay a ſhip. I abhor therefore juſtly this blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous

and chiefly by the matter of them, which ſhews it ſelf to come from
God, the Spirit of God giving me a diſcerning underſtanding thereof, that
they are the Word of God, and that the meaning of them is in the main
points of faith, as the Articles of the Creed expreſs concerning one God and
one Lord, his Incarnation, Preaching, Crucifying, Death, Reſurrection,
Aſcenſion, coming to Judgement, the holy Spirit, the Church of God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs

which I know by underſtanding the meaning of the words, and thereby am

all men under pain of Damnation to believe her in her Propoſals and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions
of Faith. But ſhe could not have ſuch a Power from God unleſs ſhe
were infallible in her Propoſals and Definitions of Faith. Therefore ſhe is
infallible in her Propoſals and Definitions of Faith. The Major is proved
by all thoſe Texts above cited in the firſt and ſecond Arguments, as alſo by
the Councils of all Ages, which command all men under pain of Damnation
to believe and ſubſcribe to her Decrees and Definitions of Faith, which hath
accordingly been done by the Fathers and all true Believers. The Minor is
proved by reaſon, becauſe it were not conſiſtent with the juſtice, mercy or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity

doth the practiſe of the councils putting <hi>anathema</hi> to their canons prove it.
For, 1. It is not proved they did well in ſo doing, except when their defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
agree with the holy Scriptures, and when they do ſo, they do not more
then every believer may do, whom they will not ſay to be infallible. 2. Nor
have all the Fathers or true believers ſubſcribed to the decrees of councils and
their definitions of faith: nor do the Papiſts themſelves ſubſcribe to thoſe they
call general councils; not to the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> which gave the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>But</hi> H. T. <hi>adds</hi> an argument for the Churches ſupreme power of judicature.
That is the ſupreme Judge in every cauſe, who hath an abſolute power to oblige all
diſſenters to an agreement, and from whom there can be no appeal in ſuch a cauſe.
But the Catholick Church hath an abſolute power to oblige all that diſagree in
controverted points of faith, nor is there any appeal from her deciſion, therefore
the Catholick Church is ſupreme Judge in controverted points of faith. The

conceive their churches may be without a Pope and well governed by a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch

other flatterers of Popes, that the <hi>Roman</hi> church, or Pope, or a general council

                  <p>The words of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> l. 3. c. 40. are cited maimedly by <hi>H. T.</hi> they are

which it may appear, that truth is aſcribed to the Church by reaſon of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and that by the Church he means not only the <hi>Roman,</hi> but any where the

known or manifeſt to him, both the entire faith in one God omnipotent from whom
all things are, and in the Son of God Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, and the diſpoſitions
of him, by which the Son of God was made man; the firm ſentence which is in
the ſpirit of God, who cauſeth the acknowledging of truth, who hath expounded
the diſpoſitions of the Father and Son according to which he was preſent with
mankind as the Father willeth. <hi>By which any one may perceive, that</hi> H. T.

which is the very doctrine of Proteſtants concerning the judgement, which
each Chriſtian may have and hath in points of faith, and the certainty of it
according to the Scriptures; which while he follows he is judged of none,
nor needs any ones judgement, Popes or others, to define what he ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words of <hi>Origen, That only is to be believed for truth which in nothing

there being no reſtriction to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, much leſſe to the Pope: nor

this it is granted, that whoever is ſo ſevered from the church of Chriſt; that is
the multitude or number of believers throughout the world, who profeſſe and
are baptized into the common faith, and are nouriſhed by the ſame Goſpel, and

that he might manifeſt unity he hath diſpoſed by his authority the riſe of the ſame
unity beginning from one. Verily the other Apoſtles were alſo that which</hi> Peter
<hi>was, endued with equal allotment of honour and power, but the beginning comes
from unity, that the church may be ſhewed to be one.</hi> And a little after, <hi>which
unity we ought firmly to hold, and vindicate, chiefly Biſhops who are Preſident in
the church, that we may prove alſo Biſhoprick it ſelf to be one and undivided.
Let no man deceive the fraternity with a lye, let no man corrupt the truth of faith
with perfidious prevarication. Biſhoprick is one of which by each entirely a part
is held.</hi> By which words it is manifeſt, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> made the <hi>Roman</hi> church
<hi>the principal church,</hi> not becauſe the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was above any other in
honour and power, or that <hi>Peters</hi> chair was more infallible than other Apoſtles
chairs; or that a ſupremacy over the whole church did belong to the Pope of
<hi>Rome</hi> (for he expreſſely ſaith, that <hi>the other Apoſtles were the ſame that</hi> Peter
<hi>was, that they were endued with equal allotment or fellowſhip of honour and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,</hi>
and that <hi>in ſolidum, wholly and entirely</hi> (that is as much one as another)
<hi>each Biſhop held his part in the one Biſhoprick:)</hi> but becauſe he made the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Epiſcopacy to have its original from Chriſts grant to <hi>Peter,</hi> Matth. 16. 18.
that all Biſhops might be as one, none arrogating more to himſelf than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And that this was <hi>Cyprians</hi> minde, appears, 1. By the words in his

ſo involved in the ſame cenſure, in which ſtate he died without repentance for

or himſelf ſubject to him: but counted <hi>Stephen</hi> an uſurper over his brethren
by reaſon of his impoſing his decree on others, and cenſure of diſſenters. And
for the words in the Epiſtle to <hi>Cornelius</hi> they are not as <hi>H. T.</hi> cites them, <hi>To</hi>
Peters <hi>chair and the principal Church, infidelity or falſe faith cannot have acceſs:</hi>
But to the <hi>Romans,</hi> meaning not only the Biſhop, but the reſt of the church,
and by <hi>perfidia</hi> there is meant not any <hi>infidelity or falſe faith whatſoever,</hi> but
thoſe perfidious perſons and their treacherous action in breaking from <hi>Cyprian:</hi>
nor doth he ſay that <hi>perfidiouſneſs could have acceſs at no time, but not at that
time,</hi> which he aſcribes, not to the priviledge of the place, but their conſtancy
in the faith <hi>heretofore praiſed by</hi> Paul, and to the providence of <hi>Cornelius</hi> their
Biſhop, and their own vigilancy, as the words in the end of the Epiſtle ſhew,
<hi>Although I know there your fraternity, to wit, being fenced by your Providence,
and alſo wary enough, by their own vigilancy, cannot be taken with the poyſons
of hereticks, nor deceived, and that ſo much the magiſteries and divine precepts
prevail with them, as the fear of God is in them, yet our over abundance of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
or charity hath perſwaded us to write theſe things to you, being indeed not
altogether</hi> out of fear of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> of whom he takes notice in the beginning of
the Epiſtle. Marvailing enough, when he obſerved by his letter that he was
ſomewhat moved by the threats and terrors of them that came, and therefore
doth earneſtly preſs him to take courage and to withſtand them. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rightly underſtood, the ſpeeches of <hi>Cyprian</hi> concerning the <hi>Roman</hi> conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and the inacceſſibleneſs of perfidiouſneſs to them, appear only expreſſions of
his confidence and good hopes, not of any certainty that it would be ſo, much
leſs of any infallibility of their Biſhop or church; and this he did to engage
them to withſtand the ſchiſmaticks, it being a great argument with perſons to
be conſtant to thoſe who expreſs their confiding in them and their expectation
thereof. And therefore he would have <hi>his Epiſtle read to the moſt flouriſhing
Clergy there preſiding with</hi> Cornelius, <hi>and the moſt holy and moſt ample common
people or Laity, that if any contagion of poyſoned ſpeech and peſtiferous ſowing
had crept in, it might be all put off from the ears and breaſts of the brethren, and the
entire and ſincere love of good men might be cleanſed from all filth of heretical
detraction:</hi> which ſhews that he conceived them liable to ſuch contagion and
pollution, and that he was not certain that they were then altogether free. All
theſe things being conſidered, it will appear that theſe paſſages of <hi>Cyprian</hi> are ſo
far from proving the infallibility and ſupreme judicature and ſupremacy of
the Pope and church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>H. T.</hi> aſſerts, that they prove the
contrary.</p>
                  <p>The words of <hi>Lactantius l. 3. c. ult.</hi> that <hi>it is only the Catholick Church that
hath the true worſhip of God, this is the well-spring of truth, the dwelling place of

in all definitions of faith, or ſupreme judicature in controverſies of
faith, but the enjoying for themſelves the true worſhip, truth and faith. The
words of <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the <hi>Roman faith commanded by the Apoſtles
cannot be changed,</hi> l. 3. c. 4 in apolog. cont. Ruffinum, we ſubſcribe to, who
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119447:62"/>
profeſs our ready reception of what faith the Apoſtles commanded. The words
of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis adv. hareſ. c.</hi> 41. are thus (not as <hi>H. T.</hi> cites them)
<hi>In the antiquity of the Church two things are vehemently and ſtudiouſly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
unto which they ought altogether to ſtick who will not be hereticks;
the firſt if any thing were anciently decreed by the authority of an univerſal
council from all the Prieſts of the Catholick Church:</hi> which is nothing to the
later councils approved by the Pope, nor doth prove that the ancient councils
were infallible, much leſſe that the church or Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> are infallible. Nor
are the words of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> (which I finde not <hi>l. 4. de bapt. c.</hi> 4) <hi>I know by
Divine revelation that the ſpirit of truth teacheth it all truth,</hi> if they be as <hi>H. T.</hi>
cites them, for his purpoſe. For if by <hi>[it]</hi> he means the church, it follows not
he means the <hi>Roman</hi> church, and if <hi>the ſpirit teach it all truth,</hi> it cannot be
meant of all truth ſimply, nor at all times. But I finde theſe words <hi>l. 4. de
bapt. contra Donat. c. 5. In vain ſome, when they are overcome by reaſon, object
to us cuſtome, as if cuſtome were greater then truth, or that were not to be
followed in ſpirituals which is to the better revealed by the holy Spirit. This is
plainly true that reaſon and truth is to be put before cuſtome.</hi> The words of
<hi>Augustin, epiſt. 118. c.</hi> 5. are not fully ſet down by <hi>H. T.</hi> They are thus,
<hi>If the authority of divine Scripture preſcribe which of theſe</hi> (ſpeaking about

which we read. In like manner alſo if any of theſe things the whole Church
through the world doth frequent. For to dispute whether we are ſo to do is of moſt
inſolent madneſs.</hi> Where, 1. He means it of rites not determined in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
not in points of faith. 2. Neither doth he count it madneſs to diſpute
againſt the uſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> church; yea he makes it a rule which he had

at <hi>Rome</hi> when he was there, <hi>Epiſt. 86. ad Caſul.</hi> no nor to diſpute againſt the
whole church of one age, but againſt the whole church in every age.</p>
                  <p>Other words of <hi>Auguſt. cont. epiſt. fundam. c.</hi> 5. are brought by <hi>H. T.</hi> and
urged often by <hi>Romaniſts</hi> for the aſſerting the authority of the church above the
Scripture, thus. <hi>And I my ſelf would not believe the Goſpel, were it not that
the authority of the Church moves me to it.</hi> But the words are not thus rightly
alleged. For, 1. The word <hi>[Catholick]</hi> is left out, which ſhews he meant it
not of the <hi>Roman</hi> onely, and ſome words following ſeem to extend it to the
church comprehending the Apoſtles, or, if reſtrained to the church of that age,
it is meant of thoſe that pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hath been ſince the year 1517. termed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from the proteſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Decree made at <hi>Spires, Anno</hi> 1529. (as <hi>Sleidan lib. 6. Com.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports)
the Concluſion is granted: we yield <hi>the Proteſtant Church or Churches
are not the Catholick Church,</hi> but Members of it, conceiving it would be indeed
to hold the Errour of <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> if they ſhould appropriate the Title of the
Catholick Church to themſelves, or count all out of it that are not of that
party, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do, who are in this Succeſſours to the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> But
if by <hi>[the Proteſtant Church]</hi> be meant the whole number of them, who held
the ſame Faith in the Fundamentals, which now the Proteſtants hold, ſo it is
the Catholick Church. 2. We deny that the Proteſtants are juſtly termed Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries,
meaning by <hi>[Sectaries]</hi> a party which hath departed from the primitive
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith, or doth ſeparate from the univerſal Church as it is or was at
any time in its integrity. 3. We deny the <hi>Major</hi> to have been proved, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it of the univerſal Church of this or any Ages in which the Apoſtles
were not, and did not concur in the Propoſals and Definitions of Faith.
4. We grant the <hi>Minor,</hi> but to the proof of it, we ſay it is utterly falſe, <hi>that
we have no other way to acquit our ſelves from Hereſie, than by pretending the
whole Church erred in Faith, and taught Idolatry and Superſtition for nine or
ten hundred years together till the Reformation begun,</hi> 1517. yea, we ſay, that

in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and were oppoſed more or leſs, at leaſt ſome of them, by
a conſiderable party of the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who were far better <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
than the Popes or <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, which condemned and perſecuted them as
Hereticks. From which crime we are able to acquit our ſelves other ways than
<hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith we can, chiefly by ſhewing the agreement of our Doctrine with
the holy Scripture and firſt Churches after <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Aſcenſion, and the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Teachers in them, as will appear in anſwer to his ninth Article. It is a
meer frontleſs impudence in him to charge us with any blaſphemous evaſion
or excluding our ſelves from all poſſible aſſurance of faith or ſalvation, and to
arrogate to himſelf as if he had proved either. The Reformation which was
begun 1517. by <hi>Luther,</hi> and after by <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and others continued, hath
been bleſſed by God, notwithſtanding the Perſecutions of the Papal party, and
the Differences among Proteſtants. And the Reformation ſought in <hi>England</hi>
ſince 1641. hath been bleſſed, notwithſtanding the Troubles and Differences
fomented by the Popiſh and Prelatical parties, as the Preaching of the Goſpel
by the Apoſtles and firſt Preachers was, notwithſtanding the Perſecutions, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,

                  <p>H. T. <hi>adds, Object.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> Council <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Anſw.</hi> No wonder it was not perfectly oecumenical; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf was then
Head of the Church on earth, and the higheſt Authority was in him, not in the
<hi>Jews</hi> Council; and if the <hi>Jews</hi> Church could erre, it doth not follow, that the
Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> can; for it was built (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) on better Promiſes.</p>
                  <p>I reply, 1. This Anſwer which makes that Council not perfectly o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and therefore no wonder it erred, plainly intimates, that if a Council be
nor perfectly oecumenical, though it would be otherwiſe infallible, yet in that
caſe it may erre. Whence it will follow, unleſs the Papiſts can prove their
Councils, which they ſay are approved by the Pope to be perfectly oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
that is, called out of the whole World, they are not infallible. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that neither the <hi>Trent,</hi> nor the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councils, nor thoſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119447:64"/>

titular Biſhops, having never been at the places whereof they carried the
Titles, and theſe by the plurality of Voices ſerved the Popes ends, but in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
either ſeriouſly ſought the truth, or reformation of corruption, as the
Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> written by that intelligent man Frier <hi>Paul</hi>
of <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a ſort of men that hood-wink themſelves, they might ſee how meer a cheat that
Council was, and how juſtly it was refuſed by the <hi>French</hi> Papiſts themſelves
unto this day. 2 Though <hi>Chriſt</hi> were then Head of the Church, yet he did
not exerciſe Juriſdiction among the <hi>Jews,</hi> not act but as Prophet to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
he did not deny ſubjection to the Prieſts, he was circumciſed the eighth
day, as ſubject to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> preſented at the Temple with an Offering,
went up to the Feaſts, kept the Paſſover, denied not the Authority of the high
Prieſt, yea, directed the Leper to offer to the Prieſt for his cleanſing, as <hi>Moſes</hi>
bade him, and <hi>John</hi> notes that the high Prieſt in that <hi>he was high Prieſt that
year propheſied of Chriſt's</hi> death, <hi>John</hi> 11. 51. which are ſufficient proofs, that
if there were a Privilege of Infallibility in the high Prieſt and Council of
the <hi>Jews</hi> it was not taken away by <hi>Chriſt's</hi> being on earth. But ſure then they
did erre, and therefore were not at all infallible in their ordinary determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
3. It follows, if the <hi>Jews</hi> Church could erre notwithſtanding thoſe
paſſages in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> which the Papiſts bring for the Popes and
<hi>Roman</hi> Churches infallibility from their infallibility, then the Popes and
<hi>Roman</hi> Churches infallibility is not well proved thence. 4. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
doth not ſay, <hi>The Church of</hi> Chriſt <hi>was built on better Promiſes, than the
Church of the</hi> Jews, but that <hi>the ſecond Covenant was made a Law on better
Promiſes than the firſt,</hi> is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. But thoſe Promiſes are ſet down,

leſs a greater degree of infallibility in any chief Biſhop on earth, oecumenical
Council or Church of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> above the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> high Prieſt and Council,
and therefore this allegation doth no whit infringe the Objection.</p>

                     <hi>It follows, Object. Chriſt</hi> blamed the incredulity of his Diſciples in not
believing his Reſurrection, St. <hi>Mark 16. 14. Anſw.</hi> He onely blamed their
ſlowneſs in believing, not any errour in faith, or loſs of faith in them, ſeeing
they had it not before, for they underſtood not what <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſaid to them of it
as appears St. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. &amp; 1 St. <hi>John</hi> 20. they did not know all points of faith at

                  <p>I reply, the Queſtion now is of Infallibility not of Apoſtaſie, now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
they were not infallible, if they did actually erre, and it is certain they did
erre, who did not believe <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have been riſen from the dead, which was
ſure an errour in a point of faith, and ſo much the greater in that it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf that it ſhould be, and told by Women, that it was ſo, and
of this number <hi>Peter</hi> was one after he was termed <hi>Peter,</hi> and according to the
<hi>Romaniſt's</hi> Doctrine had been made Prince of the Apoſtles, and chief Paſtour
of the univerſal Church. Now if <hi>Peter</hi> did erre then in faith, much more
may the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> who pretend to be his Succeſſours, and to derive their
Privileges from his grant, and conſequently cannot pretend to any more than
he had.</p>

it ſo, yet the holy Ghoſt can and will teach the Church all truth, he is no friend to
truth that contradicts it: and albeit man of himſelf may erre, yet by the holy

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e erre not.</p>
                  <p>I reply, The words that make every man a Liar do ſpeak this of man in
contradiſtinction to God's being true, and thereby ſhew that this is made God's
Prerogative to be true without any errour, and that no meer man is ſuch, and
therefore not infallible, and conſequently neither <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop, nor Council,
nor Church infallible: nor doth the Anſwer avoid it. For if they be every
one a Liar in his own particular, they muſt be ſo in a community or Council,
as if each perſon in his own particular be blinde the whole company muſt needs
be ſo too. I grant, the holy Ghoſt can and will teach the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
(meaning the Church of the Elect) all truth neceſſary to their ſalvation, and
he is no friend to truth that contradicts it: but that he will teach any or all
the viſible Churches, or their Biſhops, and Teachers, or any one Biſhop, all
truth in any point controverted, ſo as that they ſhall be infallible Judges in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
controverſies of faith, is more than yet is proved by <hi>H. T.</hi> or any
other. And if man may of himſelf erre, though he may by the holy Ghoſt
be guided ſo that he erre not, then unleſs it may be known that in this or that
Definition of Faith he is ſo guided by the holy Ghoſt, no man can reſt upon
his Definition as infallible. But it is not certain that either a Council or
Pope, who are confeſſedly fallible of themſelves, and therefore do implore the
holy Ghoſt's help, as knowing they may erre, are guided by the holy Ghoſt
that they may not erre, but by examining their Definitions by the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
For there is no other way to know they have not erred, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch a not erring being uncertain their Definitions can at no time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
proof from Scripture (which each perſon is to try for himſelf) be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

                  <p>I reply, If <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are to try all things, then they are to try the Churches
authority, and therefore the Churches authority can be no Rule of trial. And
indeed the Precept had been ridiculous, if he had bid them try the Churches
Definitions whether they were good or no, and the ſpirits whether of
God by the Churches authority, unleſs the Churches authority were to be tried
by ſomething elſe, which were of it ſelf credible. For when the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines,
for examples ſake Tranſubſtantiation, to try this by the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is no more but to enquire whether the Church hath defined it, if we
muſt reſt on its authority without examining its proof, which would be all one
as to ſay, Try not at all what the church propounds, but believe it. But it is a
vain Rule till we know who are the church, by whoſe authority, and what is
their authority by which we muſt try: eſpecially conſidering it is not agreed
among Papiſts whether a Pope or council jointly or ſeverally be the church:
even <hi>H. T. pag.</hi> 70. ſpeaks as if he would fain take in all, but is doubtfull on
which to faſten. Nor are they agreed whether the Pope or council be ſuperiour,
nor which council is approved, which reprobate, nor how far that which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
is ſo. The Rule is more uncertain when council is againſt council and
Pope againſt Pope. The truth is, Papiſts contrary to the Apoſtles Precept are
not allowed by their Doctrine to try what their church, that is, their Pope and
Prelates teach them, but they are bound to believe them with an implicit aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
without any trial or explicit knowledge. As for Apoſtolical tradition, we
like it well to try by it, if it be in truth and not in pretence onely Apoſtolical
tradition: in which caſe we are to take heed that we be not deceived by ſuch
ſayings as pretend to be from the Apoſtles, but are not. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>

all Apoſtolical traditions ſo termed cannot be the Rule of trial; nor can
they give us any ſure Notes by which we may diſtinguiſh genuine Apoſtolical

condemn men as guilty of ſin, and ſo accurſed by it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. But on the
contrary <hi>the Word of God</hi> is termed <hi>living,</hi> Heb. 4. 12. <hi>the word of life,</hi> Phil.
2. 16. And our Lord Chriſt bids the Jews <hi>ſearch the Scriptures, becauſe in
them they did think they had eternal life,</hi> John 5. 39. and <hi>John 20. 31. Theſe
things are written that ye may believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God,
and believing ye might have life through his name.</hi> So that juſtly may <hi>H. T.</hi> with
ſuch other as before him have done the like, be charged with impiety in his
diſparagingly terming the holy Scriptures, eſpecially of the New Teſtament, <hi>the
dead letter,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the word of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it's likely he meant that the Scriptures cannot hear both parties, and
ſo pronounce ſentence in a point of controverſie. If this be his meaning he
might term the churches ſentence printed or written in parchment, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
tradition unwritten <hi>the dead letters,</hi> as well as the holy Scriptures. For
ſurely the authority of the church in an Oecumenical council approved by the
Pope, ſuppoſe the <hi>Trent</hi> council approved by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
tradition doth no more hear or ſpeak then the Scripture. And it ſure
diſcovers an extream perverſneſs and malignity of ſpirit in Papiſts that refuſe
to be tried by Scripture as being dead, and require a living Judge to end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,
when the council and Pope and Apoſtolical tradition they would try
by are as much dead as the Scripture: which there is reaſon to conceive they
do as foreſeeing that if their proſelytes would try their doctrines by the Scripture
they could not ſtand.</p>
                  <p>As for humane reaſon no Proteſtant that I know makes that the rule by
which he is to try the ſpirits, nor his own private ſpirit, if by it be meant his
own councils. But we ſay that every man is to make uſe of his own reaſon or
judgement of diſcretion, and the ability of his own intelligent ſpirit, as the
inſtrument or means by which he is to try whether that doctrine which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to him be according to holy Scripture, and in this he doth no more
then Chriſt requires, <hi>Luke 12. 57. yea, and why even of your ſelves judge ye not
what is right?</hi> without the uſe of which it is impoſſible for men to make trial
as men. And this the Papiſts themſelves muſt allow men to do according to
their own principles. For how elſe can they hear and believe the church, if they
do not uſe their reaſon to know the church, and what it ſaith: they muſt
make men blocks or brutes if they allow them not the uſe of reaſon to try by.
When <hi>H. T.</hi> brings arguments from <hi>texts of Scripture, Councils, Fathers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe and experience</hi> (as his title page pretends) would he not have men
to uſe their reaſon to try whether he do it rightly? would he have us go to a
council approved by the Pope to know whether his arguments be good? what a
meer mockery is this of men to write books, to teach people; and yet not permit
people to uſe humane reaſon to try their tenets whether they be according to
Scripture, Council, Fathers, common ſenſe and experience, as if we muſt not

every Popiſh writer, whoſe book is licenſed to be infallible? If he write, is it
not that we may read, and will he have us read and not judge, and can we
judge without humane reaſon? But it is the faſhion of theſe men to write and
ſpeak in points of controverſie, but not to permit their Diſciples, unleſs they
judge them firm to them whatever they meet with to the contrary, to examine
their adverſaries tenents, arguments and anſwers by reading the Scripture and
ſuch impartial writers as would diſcover their deceit, but either by ſome device
or plain prohibition to deter them from ſearching after the truth, that they may
reſt on the Popes and prelates determinations without examining.</p>
                  <p>H. T. <hi>further adds.</hi> Obj. The Church may erre at leaſt in points not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.
<hi>Anſw.</hi> All that God hath revealed is fundamental, at leaſt for the
formal motive of belief, to wit, the Divine authority revealing (though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
for the matter) and if it be once ſufficiently propoſed to us by the Church,
as ſo revealed, we are then bound to believe it, ſo that their diſtinction of funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
and not fundamentals is idle: Beſides if the Church be infallible in
fundamentals, then Proteſtants are Schiſmaticks at leaſt in revelting from her in
points not fundamental, or neceſſary to ſalvation, and ſin againſt charity by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
us of Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>I reply 1. Sure this exception is idle to argue the diſtinction of funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
and not fundamental points of faith, which the uſers of it take from the
matter, according to which he confeſſeth all is not fundamental that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth
to be idle, becauſe all is fundamental which God revealeth at leaſt for
the formal motive of belief; to wit, the divine authority revealing, in reſpect
of which the Authors, who uſe the diſtinction, acknowledge all fundamental
likewiſe, as Dr. <hi>Potter, Chillingworth</hi> and others, who make thoſe articles of
faith fundamental, which in reſpect of the matter are neceſſary to ſalvation to
be explicitly known and believed by all: nor is it by them denied, but if it be
ſufficiently propoſed to us by the church as ſo revealed, all that is revealed by
God we are then bound to believe, otherwiſe we ſhould deny Gods infallibility
and veracity. But we deny the bare determination of the church, that is a
Pope, O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cumenical council, or prelates to be a ſufficient propoſal without proof
from Scripture or other demonſtration, that the revelation is divine. 2. It is
an idle inference which he makes, that becauſe Proteſtants grant the church
doth not erre in fundamentals; therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> church doth not erre or is
infallible in fundamentals. For that which we grant of the church is meant
of other churches beſides the <hi>Roman.</hi> 3. It is idle that he chargeth Proteſtants
with ſchiſm at leaſt in revolting from the church for points not fundamental.
For he cannot prove the Proteſtants did or do revolt from the church, but from
the <hi>Roman</hi> court faſhion, nor that they revolted till they were driven out by
excommunication and cruel perſecution, and could not enjoy communion
without yeilding to ſin, nor that they revolted at all for thoſe errors, which are
about points not fundamental; but for the errors about points fundamental, to
wit, one Mediator, ſalvation by faith in him, not by our own works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
4. It is idle that he imputes to the Proteſtants uncharitableneſs for accuſing
Papiſts of Idolatry, when their profeſſion and worſhip is openly Idolatrous in
their adoration of bread, Images, wooden croſſes, invocation of Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed,
of Angels with other innumerable practiſes uſed and maintained by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119447:67"/>
them about croſſes, reliques, feaſts of Saints, Temples dedicated to them, vows,
ſwearing, Prieſts of them, of which their own Liturgies, Canons, writers are
undoubted witneſſes. 5. The framing of the Proteſtants objection by <hi>H. T.</hi>
againſt the infallibility of the Pope or his council is idle, ſith it is urged by
Proteſtants againſt them by ſhewing its errors even in fundamentals, that
Popes and councils approved by them have been heretical. 6. His anſwer is
much more idle, in that it is not at all to the argument by him brought, which
in form is this. That church which may erre in non-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ndamentals is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
judge of controverſies. But the <hi>Roman</hi> church, whether Pope or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
by him approved may erre in non-fundamentals, <hi>Ergo</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> church is
no infallible Judge of controverſies. Now in his anſwer, there is neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of <hi>Major, Minor,</hi> nor concluſion, but only a denial of the fit uſe of one
term in the premiſes againſt which his own exception is but idle, as hath been
ſhewed, yea and if there be no ſuch diſtinction of fundamentals and non-fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
in points of faith the objection is more ſtrong againſt them. For
then if it be proved that the <hi>Roman</hi> church errs in points of faith, it errs in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,
if all points of faith be fundamental, which will prove not only the
fallibility, but alſo the nullity of the <hi>Roman</hi> church: and ſo <hi>H. T.</hi> will pull
down what he endeavours to build up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> H. T. <hi>goes on thus.</hi> Ob. Thoſe things only are fundamental which are
abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, and every man is bound explici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly to know and
believe. <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this were true, the Bible or written Word (which you will
have to be the onely rule of faith and Judge of controverſies) were not a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental;
for faith depends not eſſentially on writing, but on hearing: many
were good Chriſtians and ſaved before any of the new Scripture was written or
received among them, the firſt Goſpel being not written till ſeven or eight years
after the death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I reply, 1. This ſcribling is idle alſo, in which that is brought in as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
objection againſt the infallible and ſupreme judicature of the <hi>Roman</hi>
church in controverſies of faith, which is only an explication of one term they
uſe in their diſpute againſt the aſſertors of it. 2. It is idle that he ſaith <hi>they
will have the Bible or written Word to be the only Judge of controverſies,</hi> when
ſome of them, as <hi>Chillingworth</hi> whom he after names, <hi>Anſw. to Char. Maint.
part. 1. ch. 2. p. 114. deny it properly to be the Judge of controverſies, but make
it only the rule of faith, or the rule to judge by,</hi> yea <hi>p. 75. H. T.</hi> himſelf chargeth
this on <hi>Chillingworth</hi> (as if he had forgotten what he ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 73.) <hi>that right
reaſon is the only Judge of controverſies,</hi> and others, who term the Bible the
Judge of controverſies do not make it the only Judge, but the Spirit of God
by it, and the teachers of the church and each believer for himſelf by it. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It
is idle again that he makes that an abſurdity which they will not own, when
<hi>Chillingworth Anſw. to Char. Maint. part. 1. ch. 2. p.</hi> 114. and ſome others do
<hi>grant that the Bible or written Word is not a fundamental point of faith in their
ſence, becauſe if the matter of the Bible ſhould be believed by one that never ſaw
or heard of a Bible, yet he ſhould have a true faith to ſalvation:</hi> And yet they
make it neceſſary to be believed by all to whom it is made known. 4. It is
yet more idle, that he gives that for a reaſon why it ſhould be abſurd to ſay the
written Word is not fundamental; to wit, <hi>for faith depends not eſſentially on
writing, but on hearing,</hi> which concludes it is not abſurd. For if <hi>faith depend
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119447:67"/>
not eſſentially on writing, but on hearing,</hi> which concludes it is not abſurd. For if
<hi>faith depend not eſſentially on writing,</hi> then is the written Word not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
for that is not fundamental without which faith may be. 5. It is idle which he
ſaith in oppoſing writing to hearing, whereas faith may be by both, and if he had
ſpoken accurately, he ſhould have ſaid, not by ſeeing, but by hearing, or not by
writing, but by ſpeaking. 6. It is idle alſo and falſe, that <hi>faith depends eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
on hearing.</hi> For then it could never be that deaf men ſhould believe for
want of hearing. 7. That which he adds to confirm it is as idle. For though
<hi>there were good Chriſtians afore the Goſpel was written,</hi> yet it being written
upon ſuppoſition there were no other means but writing to beget faith, it would
depend eſſentially on writing. 8. This diſcourſe of <hi>H. T.</hi> overthrows himſelf
and his party, For if <hi>faith depend eſſentially on hearing, not on writing,</hi> then
they have not faith who read, except they hear the infallible Judge, whether
Pope or council approved by him, nor is the point of faith ſufficiently propoſed,
unleſſe it be delivered <hi>viva voce,</hi> and if ſo, there is no Papiſt hath faith, but he
onely who hears the Pope ſpeak by word of mouth from his chair, or a council
approved by him ſpeak with audible voyce, the reading of the <hi>Trent</hi> canons, or
the Popes Bull is not ſufficient to beget faith, much leſs the hearing a Prieſt or
Prelate tell us their determination. By which it may appear, that if <hi>H. T.</hi> his
dictates hold, then there is neither church nor faith among the greateſt part
of Papiſts. 9. All this diſcourſe is idle, becauſe Papiſts themſelves do grant in
effect the diſtinction he excepts againſt; and his own words do in a manner
confeſſe it is right, as the objectors explain it, and therefore in this is but a meer
humour of quarrelling, as having a minde to ſay ſomewhat againſt Mr.
<hi>Chillingworth</hi> and Dr. <hi>Potter,</hi> the Lord <hi>Falkland</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who
have fully beaten them out of this their laſt hold of the infallibility of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
church, which they would fain have fortified, being unable to keep the field
in the ſeveral points of controverſie between us and them.</p>
                  <p>H. T. <hi>goes on thus</hi> Ob. In <hi>Gregory</hi> the greats time the diſcipline and doctrine
of the Church was altered and corrupted. <hi>Anſ.</hi> That cannot be, for from <hi>Gregory</hi> the
greats time to this day even the leaſt ſubſtantial part of either hath not been loſt, or
changed as is viſible in all the councils, liturgies, and conſtitutions of the Church.</p>
                  <p>I reply, this is ſo notoriouſlly falſe, and the contrary ſo fully demonſtrated
even out of the confeſſions of Popiſh writers themſelves, and in the points of the
Popes ſupremacy, out of <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf, <hi>l. 4. Epiſt.</hi> 32, 34, 38, 39. in the
point of worſhipping of Images in his Epiſtle to <hi>Serenus,</hi> and in other points by
Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> in his firſt book of the <hi>Proteſtants appeal</hi> againſt <hi>Brerely</hi> his
<hi>Apology,</hi> that were not this Author reſolved to out-face the moſt manifeſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
againſt the now <hi>Roman</hi> tenents, he would never have vented ſo groſſe a
falſhood. The very confeſſions of Popes, the decrees of reformation even in
the <hi>Trent</hi> council prove the contrary to what <hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith. <hi>Claudius Espentaeus
com. in 2 Tim. c. 4. digreſ.</hi> 21. confeſſeth <hi>that toyes and lyes were in almoſt all
their porteſſes.</hi> And if there were no more to prove this Author an egregious
lyar; yet this is enough (which is apparent to all the world) that they have had
councils oppoſing councils about the ſuperiority of a Pope above a council ſince
the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, and even in their Miffals and Bibles many things
have been changed and purged, <hi>Clemens</hi> the eighth hath altered many things in
<hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth his Bible, and thereby ſhewed how corruptions have crept into
their own authentick tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:119447:68"/>
H. T. <hi>adds.</hi> Object. That which may happen to any one particular man or
Church may happen to all: but it may happen to any one particular man or Church
to erre in faith, therefore to all. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I diſtinguiſh the firſt propoſition, that
which may happen to one may happen to all in a diviſive ſenſe I grant, in a colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
I deny, and granting the ſecond propoſition I deny the conſequence; for it
proceeds from a divided to a compound ſenſe, and is as equivocal as this. That
which may happen to any one egge in the Pariſh may happen to all. But it may
happen to any one egge in the Pariſh to go into your mouth at once, therefore it may
happen to all the eggs in the Pariſh to go into your mouth at once.</p>
                  <p>I reply, I know not whoſe argument this is: Dr. <hi>Rainold</hi> in his <hi>Theſis</hi> ſaith
thus, <hi>but it may happen to every Church which may happen to any; certainly what
happened to the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which had much more ample promiſes, then
ever the Church of any City.</hi> As it is formed by this Author I think the <hi>Major</hi>
is not univerſally true: but being formed thus, that error which may be in
each man and church ſingly, and it's not aſſured ſhall be removed from them
met together, may happen to them ſo met. But error in faith may be in each
man and Church ſingly, and it's not aſſured to be removed from them met
together, therefore error in faith may happen to them ſo met. The <hi>Major</hi> is I
conceive without queſtion. The <hi>Minor</hi> conſiſts of two parts. 1. That all
men and Churches ſingly or ſeverally may erre in faith, I think will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
That the Popes as private Doctors may erre in faith it's not denyed, by
the ſtiffeſt aſſertors of the Popes infallibility. That any particular Church alſo,
even the <hi>Roman,</hi> may erre it's not denied, the infallibility, which <hi>H. T.</hi> would
have to belong to it, is as Catholick, and this muſt be when the whole Church
diffuſed over the world unanimouſly teach a point of faith, or it's repreſentative
in a perfectly Oecumenical council called out of the whole world and approved
by the Pope 2. That to none of theſe is ſuch infallibility aſſured, which is
proved in that there is no promiſe of ſuch infallibility to any of them. The
texts urged by <hi>H. T.</hi> in this article yeild not that promiſe: nor that text <hi>Mat.</hi>
18. 20. For, 1. Chriſt may be in the midſt of men, and yet they not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.
<hi>He walks in the midſt of the Churches,</hi> Revel. 2. 1. yet they might and
did erre in faith. So God hath promiſed inhabitation to every true believer,
and walking with them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. and yet they were not infallible. 2. If
infallibility were there promiſed, it was promiſed to <hi>two or three gathered in
Chriſts name,</hi> and ſo to a Church neither collectively nor repreſentatively Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.
3. The promiſe is but conditional upon ſuppoſition of being gathered
together in Chriſts name, which whether any council be, it is uncertain to us.
As for <hi>H. T.</hi> his diſtinction and application they ſeem to me to ſavour of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulneſſe
in the meaning of Logick terms. A propoſition is true in a divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſenſe which is not true in a compound, when the predicate agrees to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
conſidered as at different times upon an alteration; as when it is ſaid, the
blind ſee, the deaf hear, the dumb ſpeak, this is not true in a compound ſenſe,
that at the ſame time that perſons are blind, deaf, dumb, they ſee, hear, ſpeak,
but in a divided ſenſe. But the <hi>Major</hi> propoſition as ſet down in the objection,
is underſtood of the ſame time without alteration. And ſo it is not true, that
it proceeds from a divided to a compound ſenſe. Nor is there any conſequence
in the propoſition, as he unskilfully ſpeaks, but the propoſition is a ſimple or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegorical
propoſition. As for his ſimilitude of eating eggs they may be kept for
his breakfaſt as now being unſeaſonable.</p>

                     <hi>But he proceeds.</hi> Object. The Apostles were not each of them to depend on
the decrees of the Church. <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, the Church was to depend on them as on
the firſt maſters and propoſers of faith, who had each of them a peculiar preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of divine aſſiſtance and infallibility in matters of faith, yet were they each
conſonant to other in all their doctrines of faith, and whatever was taught by any
of them was ſtedfaſtly believed by all.</p>
                  <p>I reply, <hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith in his Epiſtle to the reader, that <hi>it is agreed by all parties
that Chriſt our Lord hath founded and built a Church in his own blood, which was
the onely M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>stris of divine faith, and ſole repoſitory of all revealed truths at leaſt
for an age or two;</hi> which if true, then the Apoſtles were in that age to depend
on their decrees. But here he eats his words, in the Epiſtle <hi>the Church was the
ſole Miſtris of divine faith, here the Church was to depend on the Apoſtles, as on
the firſt maſters and propoſers of faith.</hi> How theſe hang together I underſtand
not. That which he ſaith here of the Apoſtles is very true underſtanding by
maſters, not Lords but teachers. The Church neither now nor in any age was
Miſtris of faith, it is not the Church in right ſenſe, that is the teacher or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder
of divine truths, but the learner. It is the meer ſophiſtry of Papiſts to
term the Pope and Prelates the Church, and to call a hundred or two of Biſhops,
ſome of them meer titulars without any Dioceſſe, ſuch as never knew what the
office of a Biſhop was, nor ever preached the Goſpel to any people, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church. The conceſſion that <hi>the Apoſtles had each of them a peculiar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of divine aſſiſtance and infallibility in matters of faith proves,</hi> that this
was not <hi>Peters</hi> prerogative, and if it were a peculiar prerogative to each Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
then it deſcends not to any ſucceſſors, and ſo by this Authors own words
the infallibility of the Pope or council is a meer figment. Nor is infallibility
to be ſought from any, but Chriſt and his Apoſtles doctrin, who do ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
matters of divine faith to us in the holy Scriptures. Nor hath the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> any more priviledge of keeping or conveying to us the truths
revealed by the Apoſtles then that at <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Epheſus, Alexandria</hi>
or any other which the Apoſtles founded, and therefore <hi>Ireneus, Tertullian</hi> and
ſuch of the Fathers as direct us to repair to the Apoſtolick Churches for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment

                  <p>
                     <hi>It is further objected,</hi> the Church hath now no new revelations, nor can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he

<hi>H. T. Anſwers,</hi> I grant the antecedent, but deny the conſequence,
for though ſhe can make no new points, yet ſhe can explicate the old, and render
that clear, which was before obſcure, and can define againſt new herefies.</p>
                  <p>I reply, The grant of the antecedent is ſufficient to prove, that if the
Church, as it is termed, teach any other points of faith then were revealed to
the Apoſtles, we are not bound to believe her definitions, and conſequently ſhe
muſt prove her definitions by Apoſtolical tradition, and not only ſay they are
Apoſtolical, ere we are bound to believe them, it being ſtill to be heeded, which
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal. 1. 8. If he or an Angel from heaven, or any man preach</hi> (I may
adde or believe) <hi>any other Goſpel then what was preached by</hi> Paul, <hi>and received
by the</hi> Galatians <hi>he is accurſed,</hi> and conſequently each perſon is to examine and
judge for himſelf whether that which is preached or defined for him to believe by
Pope or council agree with the Apoſtles Goſpel or no, and if the Church can
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119447:69"/>
onely explicate the old, then an hereſie cannot be made by a council, which was
not before; and if Pope <hi>John</hi> the two and twenteth his tenet condemned in the
council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> were hereſie after the council condemned it, it was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
contrary to what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>l. 4. de Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pontif. c.</hi> 14. and it follows
he that can beſt explicate the old and render it clear which was before obſcure,

Gods laws (though in their Prefaces to their corrected editions of their miſſals,
and the vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> tranſlations of the Bible they confeſſe they uſed the help of
learned men, and one Pope alter what a former did) and Judge of controverſies
from whom none may appeal, and all are bound in conſcience to ſtand to his

2. 15. <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the Rule of Apoſtolical tradition I grant, by humane reaſon
or the private ſpirit I deny, and ſuch a ſpiritual man is in the Church as a part in
the whole, not out of it, with Sectaries.</p>
                  <p>I reply, It is true, <hi>the ſpiritual man judgeth all things by the Rule of Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
tradition,</hi> I mean that which is truly and confeſſedly Apoſtolical in the holy
Scriptures, not by that unwritten tradition which Papiſts falſly call Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
And it is true alſo that the ſpiritual man judgeth all things by humane
reaſon not as the rule of faith, but as the Organ or means of diſcerning, as
the buyer judgeth whether he hath meaſure by the Ell as the rule, and by the
eye as the Organ by which he compareth the thing bought and the Ell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And if by <hi>private ſpirit</hi> be meant nothing but his own ability to diſcern,
the ſpiritual man judgeth by his private ſpirit, and ſo doth a Papiſt, that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by the rule of the Councils definition, and Popes approbation, judge what
his Prieſt ſuggeſts to him to be ſuch by humane reaſon, and his private ſpirit.
Nor can it be otherwiſe, if the judging be his act, but it ſhould be by humane
reaſon, unleſs we imagine a man as a man to act without reaſon. However
this is clear by his confeſſion, that a ſpiritual man is not onely the Pope, or
the Catholick Church, but <hi>a part in the whole,</hi> and that he not onely receives
all that the Church propounds, but <hi>judgeth,</hi> and therefore doth not reſt on the
judgement of the Church with a blinde aſſent, and that he <hi>is in the Church</hi>
nevertheleſs, and this ſuppoſeth that a ſpiritual man is not to preſuppoſe the
Church, or Pope, or Prelate, or Prieſt, infallible, but to examine what they ſay,
and to judge for himſelf whether they ſpeak right or not.</p>
                  <p>H. T. <hi>proceeds thus. Object.</hi> Right reaſon is the onely Judge of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,

                     <hi>I reply, No Proteſtant that I know ſaith, Right reaſon is the onely Judge of

Scripture is not a Judge of controverſies, but a Rule to judge them by, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

of places on no ſide gainſaid, that each mans own reaſon is Judge for himſelf,
that there is no ſuch perſonal Judge appointed by God, as <hi>Knot</hi> would have, that
his Reaſons from the neceſſity of a perſonal Judge in civil controverſies hold not
in this matter, that every mans particular reaſon is that by which he is to judge
whether this or that Doctrine be agreeable to Scripture, that even according to the
way of the Papiſts the giving of the Office of Judicature to the Church comes to
confer it upon every particular man. For, 1. Before any man believes the
Church infallible he muſt have reaſon to induce him to believe it ſo, elſe why do
they ſet down Arguments to prove it. 2. Suppoſing they are to be guided by the
Church they muſt uſe their own particular reaſon to finde out which is the Church,
and to that end Popiſh Doctors give notes and marks whereby to diſcern it,
which are to no end, if a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> muſt not uſe his reaſon to judge whether they
be right or no. <hi>So that in effect this is Mr.</hi> Chillingworth<hi>'s Argument, as I
conceive it,</hi> There is neither a neceſſity of an infallible perſonal Judge among
men to determine all controverſies in Religion among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor is any ſuch
appointed by God, but each is to try for himſelf what is taught, and even by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Writers own way he muſt uſe his particular reaſon to diſcern the validity of
their proofs for the Churches infallibility, and which is the Church, which muſt
be his guide by the marks of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore it muſt of neceſſity be yielded, that
every mans particular reaſon muſt be Judge for himſelf. <hi>Now this which</hi> H. T.
<hi>unskilfully calls</hi> the conſequence, <hi>it being the conſequent onely, is no unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
much leſs groſs Aſſertion, and may very well be Mr.</hi> Chillingworth<hi>'s ground
in anſwering</hi> Knot, <hi>notwithſtanding that which here</hi> H. T. <hi>produceth to the
contrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, ſaith</hi> H. T. As contradicting the Word of God, wherein we are taught,
that the things which are of God, no man knows but the Spirit of God, 1 Cor.
2. 11. No man can ſay Our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> (with true faith) but in the holy Ghoſt,
1 Cor. 12. 3. By which grace we are ſaved through faith, and that not of our
ſelves, for it is the gift of God, Epheſ. 2. 8. We are not ſufficient to think any
good thing our ſelves as of ſelves, but our ſufficiency is from God, 2 Cor. 3. 5.
We muſt captivate our underſtanding to the obedience of faith.</p>
                  <p>I reply, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s tenet being rightly underſtood contradicts none
of theſe Texts. For, 1. when he ſaith, <hi>Every mans private reaſon is to
judge for himſelf,</hi> he means whether this or that be the meaning of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and whether that which ſome ſay is revealed in Scripture be ſo or not,
ſo that the judging which he aſſerts is of things revealed by the words wherein
it is revealed, not a finding out what is not revealed. But 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 11. ſpeaks of
a knowledge of invention by ſearch into the things without revelation, a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of invention, not of diſcretion, as the words <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. ſhew, <hi>But God
hath revealed them to us by his Spirit, for the Spirit ſearcheth all things, even
the deep things of God.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> (ſo far as I diſcern) did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
aſſert, that every mans private reaſon by its own ſearch could ever finde out
the myſtery of the Goſpel, had not the Spirit revealed them to the Apoſtles,
and they to us, but that each mans private reaſon ſince the Apoſtles have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
them in their Writings may judge whether that which one Teacher
ſaith is the Apoſtles meaning, be truer than what another ſaith, he makes Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
not the Judge of the Spirits revelation, but of mens interpretation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
2 When Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> makes each particular mans reaſon or his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119447:70"/>
private ſpirit, the Judge for himſelf, he means right reaſon, not every fancy
which hath no proof, and that reaſon which he calls right reaſon muſt be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Spirit of God and his influx upon the underſtanding, and ſo the
Text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. is not againſt Mr. <hi>Chillingworth.</hi> 3. When he means that
every private mans reaſon or private ſpirit is a Judge to each man, he conceives
(as the matter of his diſcourſe lead him to ſpeak) this judgement to be onely
of the meaning of the ſpeech, wherein the things revealed are made known,
whence comes a a ſpeculative notional knowledge, upon which a bare dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
faith follows, but he aſſerted not right reaſon rectified by common influx of
the ſpirit, which underſtands onely the true meaning of ſuch a Text or the
truth of ſuch a Propoſition, to be ſufficient without a ſpecial work of the Spirit
of God enabling a man to ſee the beauty, worth, goodneſs of the things thus
believed above any other thing propounded to be choſen, to beget an affective
practical knowledge, which begets faith of adherence, of which 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3.
<hi>Epheſ 2. 8. 2 Cor. 3. 5. &amp;</hi> 10. 5. are to be underſtood. So that Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s
Aſſertion rightly underſtood doth well conſiſt with theſe Scriptures, it
being no whit contradictory to theſe ſpeeches, that <hi>no man can know</hi> by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
<hi>the myſtery hid in God but by the revelation of the Spirit,</hi> and yet when
it is revealed each mans private reaſon may judge of the meaning of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
in which it is revealed, and whoſe Doctrine is moſt agreeable to thoſe
Scriptures, and though no man can fiducially and electively <hi>ſay,</hi> Jeſus <hi>is the
Lord but by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> yet without the ſanctifying and renewing or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
of God's Spirit a perſon may by his private reaſon underſtand the
meaning of this ſpeech, <hi>Jeſus is the Lord,</hi> and aſſent to it upon credible motives
with a bare dogmatical faith. And though ſaving <hi>faith be the</hi> ſpetial <hi>gift of
God</hi> to his Elect, yet in working faith God uſeth mans reaſon to underſtand
what he is to believe, and to judge it to be true, and as <hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith here, <hi>p. 77. The
diſcourſe and approbation of reaſon is always a previous and neceſſary condition to
our deliberate and rational acts of faith, and the very acts themſelves, are acts of
reaſon.</hi> And though <hi>we are not of our ſelves ſufficient to think any good thing,</hi>
yet our ſelves do think good things, and by reaſon rectified by God's Spirit do
judge them to be good. And though <hi>we are to captivate our underſtanding to
the obedience of faith,</hi> yet that obedience of faith to which our underſtanding
is captivated is by the aſſent of the underſtanding upon the apprehenſions
which our reaſon hath of the good of that we aſſent to, and that which we
obey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But ſaith</hi> H. T. Secondly, becauſe divine revelations are not to be admitted
or rejected for their ſeeming conſonancy or repugnance to every mans private rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but for the authority of the Church propoſing as the immediate motive, and
the Authority of God revealing as the higheſt Motive of our Faith into which
it is ultimately reſolved, nor can any thing be more rational than to captivate
and even renounce private reaſon, where God the Authour of Reaſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
it.</p>
                  <p>I reply, I doubt not but Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> would have ſaid ſo too, and have
counted it an injury done to him to ſuggeſt it (as <hi>H. T.</hi> ſeems to do) to any as
if he meant otherwiſe, provided that by the authority of the Church propoſing
be meant, not the pretended infallible authority of the Church or Prelates of
it, but either the infallible authority of the Primitive Church comprehending
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119447:71"/>
the Apoſtles, or the probable and credible authority of the preſent Church or
Teachers in it. But it is likely <hi>H. T.</hi> meant it of the infallible authority of
the preſent Church or Prelates of it, which is not yet proved, and till it be Mr.
<hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Aſſertion is not overthrown.</p>
                  <p>H. T. <hi>adds,</hi> Thirdly, becauſe if every mans private reaſon is to judge for himſelf
in matters of Religion, then all the Hereſies that ever yet were in the World were
good and ſound Doctrines; for there was never any Sect of Hereticks who did
not pretend both to Reaſon and Scripture for their Tenets (how damnable ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver)
and ſome of them ſuch as were unaſwerable by humane reaſon, ſetting aſide
the Churches authority and Apoſtolical tradition: for who can prove by private
reaſon or by all the reaſon of man againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> that a ſpiritual and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
ſubſtance (ſuch as God is) could beget a natural Son of himſelf without a
Mother? or againſt the <hi>Sabellians</hi> and <hi>Trinitarians</hi> that the ſame indiviſible
eſſence or divine nature can be at once in three diſtinct perſons, the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghoſt? or againſt <hi>Neſtor</hi> and <hi>Eutiches,</hi> that one perſon can
ſubſiſt in two different natures, the Divine and Humane in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
are high Fundamentals in <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> In all theſe and many
others private reaſon muſt either bend the knee and be captivate to faith, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Atheiſm.</p>
                  <p>I reply, I conceive Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> would have ſaid ſo too, to wit, that
<hi>private reaſon muſt bend the knee, and be captivate to faith in points revealed,</hi>
though it cannot comprehend how thing revealed ſhould be ſo, and yet his
Aſſertion hold, that <hi>each ones private reaſon is to judge theſe to be matters of
faith;</hi> and it will judge them to be ſo by the evidence it hath, that theſe are
divine revelations, which right reaſon knows to be ſo from the agreement with
the Scriptures without the preſent or late Churches authority or unwritten tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
though termed Apoſtolical. And thoſe Tenents which a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
mans reaſon findes to be agreeable to holy Scripture, though the whole
Church of this or former Ages ſince the Apoſtles days ſhould judge them He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
and the <hi>Nicene</hi> or any other Council condemn them, yet is that perſon to
hold them as truth, provided he do uſe his reaſon aright to diſcover the truth.
And though it be that Councils may be and have been uſefull, when good
choice hath been made of perſons and undue practiſes to miſ-lead and over-aw
them have been removed, yet as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in his five and fiftieth Epiſtle <hi>ad
Procopium</hi> complained, <hi>that he knew no good iſſue of them,</hi> ſo he that ſhall
examine the cariage of things in Councils, even the beſt of them ſince the
Apoſtles days will finde reaſon not to take any thing from them on truſt meerly
by reaſon of their authority, and for the Councils which have been above a
thouſand years by reaſon of the activity and prevalency of Factions, and the
unlearnedneſs of moſt of the Biſhops in them will find more reaſon to be jealous
of what Councils have determined, them to acquieſce in them. Nor will it
follow, that if this judgement be allowed to every private man, <hi>then all or any
Hereſies whatſoever have been good and ſound Doctrine,</hi> but that thoſe who have
pretended Reaſon and Scripture have abuſed both. Nor is <hi>H. T.</hi> his Reaſon
of force, becauſe <hi>Hereticks pretend to reaſon and Scripture, therefore every one
is not to judge for himſelf, and all Hereſies were ſound Doctrine,</hi> any more than
than this, cavillers pretend Law and Reaſon, therefore Judges that uſe their
knowledge in the Law, and their Reaſon in paſſing Sentence do juſtifie cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119447:71"/>
or determin no better then cavillers. Were the Churches authority infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
hereticks might and did pretend to it's authority, and Apoſtolick traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and therefore notwithſtanding theſe, yet hereſie may be taken for ſound
doctrine as well as if private reaſon be made a Judge for each ones ſelf: yea
many hereſies have alledged unwritten tradition, and have had ſome council or
other perhaps more and more numerous to patronize them then the Orthodox:
ſo that I may ſay, ſetting aſide the holy Scripture (which is now the rule by
which to determine what is error, what not) neither the Churches authority,
nor unwritten tradition can prove a point to be hereſie or extirpate it, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
propagate and eſtabliſh error, as by experience is manifeſt, there being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more hereſies eſtabliſhed and propagated by any one, or more private mens
following their reaſon, then have been by the Popes and Councils ſuppoſed to
be Oecumenical and infallible, nor is there any greater cauſe of erring then the
confidence of infallibility, nor any error ſo faſt rooted as that which is decreed
by men that will confeſſe no error. As for thoſe hereſies which he reckons as
<hi>unanſwerable by humane reaſon,</hi> if he mean they are <hi>unanſwerable by humane
reaſon,</hi> how or in what manner the things oppoſed by them are, it is granted;
but of this Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> doth not make humane reaſon Judge: if any
humane reaſon cannot comprehend how a thing ſhould be, nor can anſwer all
objections, yet if it judge that God hath revealed it is ſo, it is to believe it, even
as <hi>Mary</hi> was to believe her having a ſon though ſhe knew not how, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 34.
That which each mans reaſon is to judge, is not how a thing can be which God
hath revealed is or ſhall be, but whether it be ſo revealed, and this he is to do not
by a blind aſſent to what the Church or his teachers ſay, but <hi>by ſearching</hi> (as
the <hi>Beraeans</hi> did <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. with Gods approbation even when <hi>Paul</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them) <hi>the Scriptures</hi> whether they ſay right. And if the Scripture ſay the
contrary to what thoſe named hereticks ſay, then are their tenents to be rejected,
of which each perſons reaſon is to judge for himſelf he being to be ſaved or
damned according to his own faith: if not, the determination of councils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it is not to be received. And this manner of judging by reaſon, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
promote herefie, nor Atheiſm, but on the contrary, if the Popes, Councils,
Churches determination be counted infallible, it will perpetuate an error if once
received, as too much woful experience ſhews in the <hi>Roman</hi> Papacy, wherein
the error of tranſubſtantiation though it be ſuch as is ſo contrary to Scripture,
reaſon, ſenſe, Fathers, that a man unprejudiced would think them meer mad
men, or phrenetick perſons who hold it, yet it is by Papiſts maintained (I
dare hardly ſay, by the learned believed) moſt obſtinately and furiouſly to
this day.</p>
                  <p>Finally, <hi>ſaith</hi> H. T. becauſe if private reaſon were the onely Judge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,
it would evidently follow the general councils of all former ages
(which have commanded all perſons under pain of damnation to obey their defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
and ſubmit to their decrees) were the moſt tyrannical and unjuſt aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
that ever were, in uſurping ſuch a power over mens conſciences, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that there neither is nor ever was any ſuch thing on earth as a Church (or
obliging guide in matters of faith) and Church Government,</p>
                  <p>I reply, though Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſay not private reaſon to be the onely
Judge of controverſies, nor denies the Church or Council to be Judge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,
but only the infallibility of them; yet, if he did ſay either, neither
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119447:72"/>
of theſe things would follow which <hi>H. T.</hi> makes conſequent thereon. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſuch ſaying he might deem councils to have followed Scripture,
and therefore not unjuſt in thoſe commands, and that there was a Church and
Church government obliging men in matters of faith though not by vertue of
their own authority, yet by vertue of Gods revelation in the holy Scriptures.
Nevertheleſſe (if I may be allowed to ſpeak my judgement freely) I do think
that if not all, yet moſt of the Councils termed general have been for more then
one hundred years too unjuſt and tyrannical in their commands, uſurping the
words of the Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 15. 28. too arrogantly, as if their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
were equal to the Apoſtles, and impoſing on mens conſciences burdens
too intolerable, and that this hath been a moſt pernicious engine of Satan to
cauſe diviſions and miſchiefs in the Church of Chriſt. And certainly if any
have followed humane reaſon and a private ſpirit in deciding controverſies of
faith, and judging matters of religion they have been Popes, and the Councils
approved by Popes, who do almoſt in every thing, in ſome things expreſſely,
forſake the Scripture, and adhere to their own reaſon in their Canons and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees:
and Papiſts who receive their determinations do forſake the guidance
of Gods Spirit and follow humane reaſon and a private ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>H. T, <hi>ſaith further.</hi> Ob. Your therefore believe the Church to be infallible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and whatever elſe you believe, becauſe you judge it reaſonable to believe it, and
your very act of faith it ſelf is an act of reaſon: therefore reaſon is the only Judge
of controverſies. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The diſcourſe and approbation of reaſon is alwayes a
previous and neceſſary condition to our deliberate and rational acts of faith, and
the very acts themſelves are acts of reaſon, not diſcourſing but ſimply aſſenting:
All this I grant, yes I deny your conſequence, becauſe our acts of faith are not ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
reſolved into private reaſon (which faith often is inforced to captivate)
but into the authority of God revealing, and the Church propoſing. I believe it
(ſaith <hi>Tertullian)</hi> becauſe it is impoſſible <hi>(viz.</hi> to humane reaſon.)</p>
                  <p>I reply, 1. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> makes not <hi>reaſon the only Judge of controverſies,</hi>
nor any Proteſtant, therefore the concluſion is ill fathered on them. 2. The
reaſon of <hi>H. T.</hi> his denial of the conſequence is inſufficient. For it ſuppoſeth
the conſequence to imply, that <hi>our acts of faith are ultimately reſolved into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
reaſon, and this private reaſon judging that onely to be true, of which it
conceives how it is poſſible.</hi> But the truth is, they that make reaſon the Judge
of controverſies neither reſolve ultimately their acts of faith into private reaſon,
neither do they conceive they have reaſon to believe onely what they conceive
how it is poſſible to humane reaſon, but reſolve their faith into Gods authority
as the formal and ultimate reaſon of their believing, and make their reaſon one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the means or inſtrument by which they finde that God hath revealed that
which they believe, not excluding their teachers credit, and Churches example
as a fit motive to hearken to it as a thing credible. Which opinion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by this authors own words, making <hi>faith an act of reaſon, and diſcourſe
and approbation of reaſon alwayes a previous and neceſſary condition to it,</hi> and
therefore in all acts of faith, even when it reſts on the Churches Authority,
yet eachmans private reaſon is the Judge for himſelf diſcerning in controverſies
why he is to believe one and not another; all the difference is, the Papiſt
thinks he hath reaſon to believe tranſubſtantiation, Popes ſupremacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he takes the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or Pope to be infallible. The Proteſtant
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119447:72"/>
doth not believe them, becauſe the Scripture doth not ſay thus, which alone he
takes for an infallible rule to judge by in ſuch controverſies. Whether Papiſts
faith be ultimately reſolved into the Authority of God revealing hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſidered a little and will more in that which follows. To <hi>Tertullians</hi>
words I can return no anſwer till I know where to finde them. As they are here
cited they ſeem nor right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet again ſaith</hi> H. T. <hi>Ob.</hi> There is no Apoſtolical tradition for the Churches
infallibility. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes a more univerſal one, then for the Canon of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
it ſelf: (which notwithſtanding you believe on that ſcore if at all) For
there is not any one book either of the old or new Teſtament, which hath not been
rejected by ſome heretick or other: if therefore it be a ſufficient proof of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
tradition for the whole Canon of Scripture, that ſome one or two general
Councils have ſet down the number and names of all the books of Scripture, though
not without ſome variety, and that the Fathers have given teſtimony to them, ſome
to ſome books, ſome to others, but few to all; and that the Church in after ages
hath accepted them for ſuch, how much more univerſal is the tradition for the
Churches infallibility, which is virtually decided and atteſted by the <hi>Anathema</hi>'s
and definitions of all the general Councils that ever were, condemning all who
did not humbly obey, and ſubſcribe to them, every deciſion being atteſted by all the
Fathers (no one contradicting or condemning the ſtile) and moſt unanimouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by the whole Church of after ages.</p>
                  <p>I reply, the ſpeech of <hi>H. T.</hi> here, <hi>that there is a more univerſal Apoſtolical
tradition for the Churches, that is not only the Church diffuſed over all the world
unanimouſly teaching, but alſo the Church repreſented in a Council perfectly Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical
(that is to ſay, call'd out of the whole world and approved by the Pope)
it's infallibility in definitions of faith then for the Canon of the Scriptures it ſelf,</hi>
is ſo monſtrouſly falſe, and ſo pernicious, as tending to the undermining of the
fabrick of Chriſtian Religion, that it ſhews an impudent face and an impious
heart in the aſſertor. For, 1. The tradition of the Canon of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is by the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt, and from
Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who have teſtified that <hi>to them were committed the
Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 1, 2. and this witneſſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> unto the death,
and by the complement and events verifying it. And though it be, that ſome
hereticks have been adverſaries to the Law and Prophets, yet ſcarce any but ſuch
as have been little better then phrenetick, have denied it to be divine, however
they have conceived them not binding. And for the Canon of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
though ſome parts have been a little while ſomewhat doubted of in the
ſecond and third ages by ſome few, yet the reſt have had univerſal and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
tradition from the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and primitive teachers, who
witneſſed the truth of the doctrine by many evident undeniable divine miracles,
and by their martyrdome, by which alſo in after ages many of the Fathers and
other Chriſtians gave teſtimony to it, and ſince the Churches Greek and Latin,
Proteſtant and Popiſh Heretical and Orthodox in <hi>Aſia, Africa, Europe</hi> have
atteſted it as divine. But for the Churches infalibility in that ſenſe, in which
this Author means it, how little hath been brought appears by the anſwer here
made, and that much may be ſaid againſt it will appear by that which follows.
Yea I dare bodly ſay, that (as <hi>H. T.</hi> holds it) no one Council or Father of
eſteeme held the Churches infallibility in the firſt thouſand years from Chriſts
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119447:73"/>
incarnation, and I think I may ſay for half a thouſand more, but many not
onely of thoſe who are reckoned for hereticks by <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> but alſo ſuch as
have been judged Catholicks have oppoſed it in the ſecond and third ages, yea
whole Nations, Emperors, Kings, and ſtates have oppoſed the definitions,
which the ſo termed Generals Councils approved by the Pope have made, and
many learned men have written againſt it, none died for it in that time, nor
were any miracles wrought to confirme it. Nor hath the queſtioning of ſome
few of the books of Scripture, either by ſome hereticks or a few Fathers for a
while abated the credit of thoſe parcels queſtioned in the Churches of Chriſt
throughout the world. So that if it were true, that we believed the Canon (as I
know nothing but uncharitableneſſe can make this Author queſtion whether we
do) onely on that ſcore (as we do not) yet we have far more abundant tradition
for it then is for the Churches imagined infallibility. 2. I ſay the <hi>Anathema's</hi>
and definitions are neither formal nor virtual proofs of an univerſal tradition
or atteſtation to the Churches infallibility. For, 1. <hi>p.</hi> 7. He confeſſeth <hi>in
the ſecond and third ages were no councils, nor in the tenth, in which any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
of moment were decided,</hi> p. 25. and therefore here this univerſal traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fails. 2. Thoſe that were not approved by the Popes, but rejected by them,
and thoſe which were not Oecumenical have not uſed ſuch <hi>Anathema's,</hi> and
yet <hi>H. T.</hi> thinks not his infallibility proved thereby. 3. That they did well
in uſing ſuch <hi>Anathema's,</hi> or the Church in ſubmitting to them may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
4. But if that be yeilded that they did well, yet ſurely they did not ſet
their <hi>Anathema's</hi> to their deciſions, becauſe they took themſelves to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
either by their own authority or the Popes approbation; yea it is certain the
Councils did ſet to their <hi>Anathema's,</hi> when they oppoſed the Popes and depoſed
them, and defined themſelves above him. And even the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> put
their <hi>Anathema's</hi> to their definitions afore they were tendred to the Pope, or <hi>Pius</hi>
the fourth had approved them: but they took it they might ſet their <hi>Anathema</hi>
to their definitions, becauſe they thought them right, though not themſelves
infallible in them. And thus may any particular perſon pronounce <hi>Anathema,</hi>
as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. and yet not be thereby demonſtrated infallible. So
vain is this no better then blaſphemous ſpeech of <hi>H. T.</hi> which will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by examining what follows.</p>

to images, as you may ſee in the Preface to the Carolin books. Anſw. The
ſecond Nicene Council allows no ſuch honour to images, but onely a ſalutation
or honorary worſhip, not true Latria (or ſoveraign honour) which it defines to
be due to God onely, Act. 1. 7. The Carolin books are of no authority, they
ſay that Council was not approved by the Pope, which is falſe, and that it was

I Reply, That honour to Images, which Papiſts will not have to be termed
<hi>Latria</hi> or <hi>ſoveraign honour proper to God;</hi> the Scripture makes ſoveraign
honour to be given to God onely in a religious reſpect; to wit, bowing down
the body to them, kiſſing, burning incenſe, offering gifts, holding up the
hands, lifting up the eyes, praying to them, which the Scripture appropriates to
God, and denies to images, <hi>Matth. 4. 10. Revel. 19. 10. 1 Kings</hi> 19. 18.
<hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 4, 5. Nor doth the Scripture make ſuch diſtinction of <hi>Latria</hi> and
<hi>Dulia,</hi> but that it forbids ſuch worſhip to be given to any image of an inviſible
being, which ſhews ſubjection to them, or dependence on them; for ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is religious, and is an acknowledgement of a Deity in them. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
doth no where appropriate <hi>Latriam</hi> or the ſoveraign honour or worſhip due
to God onely to offering of ſacrifice, but that it alſo condemns as idolatrous the
other acts named, if they be not given to Magiſtrates or ſuperiors out of civil
reſpects, but to Images, Angels, or Saints alive or deceaſed in a religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
as ſuperiors to us to whom we are ſubject and on whom we depend for
help and ſuccour. And therefore this plaiſter of <hi>H. T.</hi> is too narrow to cover
the foul ulcer that came from the falſe Synod called the ſecond <hi>Nicene.</hi> For
what is that <hi>ſalutation</hi> or <hi>honorary worſhip,</hi> H. T. ſaith the ſecond council of
<hi>Nice</hi> allows to Images? Is it not bowing down to them, which Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
call adoration, and difference from veneration, which conſiſts onely in a
decent uſage without defiling, defacing, or ſuch uſage as ſhews hatred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the thing or perſon repreſented, ſuch as is done to monuments or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
laid up to be kept, but not as things ſet up higher then our ſelves to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped,
for that is plain Idolatry, and the very ſame with the Gentiles adoration
of their Idols? now this did the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council require to be given to
Images, <hi>ut erigerentur &amp; adorarentur,</hi> &amp;c. yea if <hi>Bellarm. lib. 2. de Imagin,
Sanct. c.</hi> 21. ſay true, <hi>that Council would have them adored not only by accident,
that is becauſe joyned with the thing adored, but alſo of themſelves as that, in
which is the reaſon of veneration, nor onely improperly that is in the place of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo as that the proper term of the adoration ſhould not be the Image, but
Chriſt himſelf, but properly ſo as that the Image be honoured ratione ſui ipſius in
reſpect of it ſelf, as he explains his diſtinctions,</hi> ch. 20. And this adoration it
was conceived by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and the Synod of <hi>Francfurt</hi> that <hi>Nicene</hi>
Council intended to give to Images, and was refuted by the four books ſet forth
by <hi>Charles</hi> the Greats authority yet to be ſeen, and condemned by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Synod of <hi>Francfurt,</hi> Anno 794. at which were preſent the Popes
legats and did approve of the Synods determination, or diſſembled the Popes
opinion. I finde not that the <hi>Carolin</hi> books ſay, that the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

makes the more againſt the infallibility of Councils approved by the Pope,

a Council to be above a Pope. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neither part was ever yet owned
by the Church for an Oecumenical decree or definition, and if it were, it would be
anſwered that the Lateran Council defined onely a Pope to be above a Council
taken without a Pope, or not approved; and that the Council of Conſtance onely
defined a Council approved by a Pope to be above a Pope without a Council, which
definitions are not contradictory, no more than to ſay, one part of any thing is
bigger then another, and the whole bigger then both; ſo that from hence it cannot
be inferred that either Council erred: nor was either decree approved by the
Pope.</p>
                  <p>I reply, this is impudent outfacing with ſhifts the truth in things manifeſt to
all that enquire into them. He cannot deny that theſe contrary definitions
were of two Councils which he himſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 33, 36. terms <hi>general Councils,</hi> and

ſhews that when it likes them the Council ſhall be approved, when not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
and thereby take upon them to be above Pope and Council. But if this
be the faſhion of their Councils who can tell when one decree is contrary to
another if theſe were not? or who can tell when a decree is approved by a Pope
if neither of theſe were? where's the agreement? where's the infallibility they
ſo vainly arrogate to their Church? <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth expreſſely confirmed the
acts of the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> in the 45. <hi>Seſſion,</hi> of which one was in the
fourth <hi>Seſſion, that every one though of Papal dignity was bound to obey a gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Council in the things pertaining to faith.</hi> That which <hi>Bellarm. l. 2. de
Concil. aut. c.</hi> 19. ſaith that <hi>he onely approved ſome things not others, becauſe he
ſaid, ſic conciliariter facta</hi> is but a ſhift; for that expreſſion is not ſet down by
way of limitation and diſtinction, but explication, noting the reaſon of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all becauſe they were done <hi>conciliariter,</hi> as the word <hi>ſic</hi> ſhews, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
his acknowledgment that they were all ſo done. Beſides he not excepting
it expreſſely could not be interpreted to except that from his confirmation more
then any thing elſe there acted, it might as well be ſaid he excepted the decree
about half communion; yea if he had excepted that decree of the Councils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above the Pope he had meerly deluded the Council, that decree being their
principal decree, and for which it was called. Add hereto that the words of his
Bull thereupon do more fully manifeſt that he did not except it; and the decree
of the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> called after by vertue of his Bull ſhews, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
it to confirm that decree proceeding againſt Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to it. And for the other Council that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth did <hi>not confirm
the decree of the Popes being above a Council</hi> is contrary to <hi>Bellarmin l. 2. de
Concil. aut. c.</hi> 18. who recites the decree as a proof, and <hi>c.</hi> 5. reckons it among
the general Councils approved by the Pope, as <hi>appears,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in that he was
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119447:74"/>
preſident in perſon.</hi> And for the other anſwer of <hi>H. T.</hi> it is ridiculous, ſith the
Councils words are expreſſe that <hi>any perſon though of Papal dignity was to obey
the general Council,</hi> and the decree was made of purpoſe to juſtifie their fact in
putting down a Pope. And there was no queſtion nor need be, who is above
other when both joyn, but all the queſtion is and ſo the definition muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued,
when they are ſevered. Yea it would be trifling to ſay the Pope ſhould
obey the Council, when the Pope concurred, for it's all one as to ſay be ſhould
obey himſelf: and to ſay the Council is above the Pope when the Council and
Pope are one is frivolous, for in all ſuch compariſons the words expreſſe what
each is ſeverally as they ſtand in competition according to their ſeveral autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
and therefore the ſimilitude of <hi>H. T.</hi> is frivolous as being not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Laſtly, with what face can this man ſay that <hi>neither Council err'd,</hi> when
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith <hi>c.</hi> 7. that <hi>in the Florentin and laſt Lateran the Council of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
was rejected in reſpect of the firſt Seſſions, wherein it defined a Council to
be above a Pope?</hi> ſo that all the wit of man is not able to avoid this objection,
but that according to the ſuppoſitions of Popiſh Doctors either a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
approved by a Pope may erre in a point of faith, or elſe there is no error in a
main point of their faith, when one general Council approved by a Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
a former general Council approved by a former Pope of greater freedome
and celebrity by reaſon of the Emperours preſence and for other cauſes, which
was ſeconded by another Council not long after, as appears by the next objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is thus ſet down by <hi>H. T.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> defined, that a Council was above a Pope.
<hi>Anſw.</hi> The decree was not approved, nor any other of that Council, but
onely ſuch as concerned Church benefices. See <hi>Eugenius</hi> with <hi>Terrecremata</hi>
l. 2. c. 100.</p>
                  <p>I reply, I finde no ſuch diſtinction in Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the fifth his Bull, but
that it is confirmed altogether. But it ſeems when it pleaſeth theſe men the
Council ſhall be approved, when not rejected. So that it is not either the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a Council by a Pope, or the univerſality of the Fathers, or the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Pope can confirm it, if another Pope reject it, which they will do
when it's againſt their power and profit. And hereby is proved that Popes are
vertiginous, that Popery is as mutable as the weathercock, that there is ſo little
ſhew of agreement, unity and infallibility in Popes and Councils approved by
him, that ſcarce any ſtates are more full of changes in matters civil then they are
in matters Eccleſiaſtical and of faith, nor in any part of the world more diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
then among Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Further ſaith</hi> H. T. <hi>Ob.</hi> The Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> defined Arianiſm.
<hi>Anſw.</hi> It did not, and that equivocal decree that was there made was never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the Pope; and the Fathers themſelves (who were deluded by the <hi>Arians</hi>
with words that bare a double ſenſe when they perceived the fraud) lamented and
renounced the fact.</p>
                  <p>I reply, <hi>H. T.</hi> his own words confirm the objection. For, 1. If the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were deluded by the <hi>Arians</hi> then they were not infallible; and ſo a general
Council approved by the Pope may erre in a main point of faith. 2. If that
Council did not define Arianiſm, how were they deluded? wherein was the
fraud but in that the words being of double ſenſe, yet indeed decreed <hi>Arian</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?
what need they lament or renounce the fact if it were not ſo? why

expreſſely denied the books of <hi>Maccabees</hi> to be canonical, <hi>l. 19. Moral. c.</hi> 17.
As for the third Synod of <hi>Carthage</hi> it was not an Oecumenical Synod, and it
is over ballanced by the Synod of <hi>Laodicea</hi> before it, who omitted them. And
if the ancients termed the Apocryphal books canonical or divine, they are to be
underſtood according to <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his explication in his <hi>Expoſition on the Creed,</hi>
and others, that <hi>they were canonical in a ſort as being read in the Churches by
reaſon of ſome hiſtories or moral ſentences, but not ſo as that they were brought to
confirm the authority of faith by them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>H. T. <hi>further ſaith. Ob.</hi> The Fathers err'd ſome in one thing ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Anſw.</hi> A part I grant, all together (ſpeaking of any one age) I deny, and
they all ſubmitted to the Church and ſo do likewiſe our Schoolmen, who differ one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in opinion concerning School points undefined, not in faith.</p>
                  <p>I reply. 1. That the Fathers of ſome ages did generally hold errors is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
in many particulars. <hi>Auguſtine held it an Apoſtolical tradition that the
Sacrament of the Euchariſt was neceſſary for infants,</hi> as appears <hi>l. 1. de pec. meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
&amp; remiſſ. c.</hi> 24. and elſewhere, and <hi>Maldonat</hi> on <hi>John 6. v.</hi> 53. ſaith <hi>that it
was the opinion of</hi> Auguſtin <hi>and Pope</hi> Innocent <hi>the firſt, and that it prevailed.
in the Church for ſix hundred years,</hi> and yet the council of <hi>Trent, ſeſſ. 21. c.</hi> 4.
<hi>can.</hi> 4. ſaith, <hi>If any ſay the communion of the Euchariſt to be neceſſary for lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ones afore they come to years of diſcretion, let him be</hi> Anathema. The like
might be ſaid of ſundry other points, as that of the <hi>Millenary</hi> opinion, the ſouls
not ſeeing God till the day of judgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. That all the Fathers did
not ſubmit to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is manifeſt by the <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops oppoſition
to <hi>Victor</hi> about Eaſter, to <hi>Stephen</hi> about rebaptization by <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others, to
<hi>Boniface, Zozimus</hi> and <hi>Celeſtin</hi> about appeals from <hi>Africa</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Aurelius
Auguſtinus</hi> and a whole council. 3. That the Schoolmen differ in points of
faith defined is manifeſt in <hi>Peter Lumbard l. 1. ſent. diſt.</hi> 17. who held <hi>the holy
Ghoſt to be the charity whereby we love God,</hi> and the diſſent from him in that
point, the differences about the Popes authority above a council, power to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
ſubjects from the oath of allegiance, certainty of faith concerning a mans
own juſtification, Gods predetermination of mans will, and many more yet
controverted between <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits, Janſeniſts</hi> and <hi>Moliniſts.</hi> 4. All
ſubmit not to the Pope, but ſome appeal from him to a council, others by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in diſputes and otherwiſe decline his ſentence in their cauſe, of which
the oppoſition againſt Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth his interdict by the republick of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
about their power over Eccleſiaſticks is a famous inſtance, evidently
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119447:75"/>
ſhewing that all that live in communion with the See of <hi>Rome</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
not ſuch a ſupremacy and infallibility to it as the modern <hi>Jeſuits</hi> aſcribe
to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet again, ſaith</hi> H. T. <hi>Ob.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> tells St. <hi>Hierom</hi> that he eſteems
none but the writers of the Canonical books to have been infallible in all they
write, and not to erre in any thing. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neither do we, we eſteem not the
writers of councils infallible in all they write, nor yet councils themſelves, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Oecumenical decrees or definitions of faith.</p>
                  <p>I reply, <hi>Auguſtin Epiſt.</hi> 19. to <hi>Hierom</hi> doth not onely ſay thus, <hi>I confeſs to
thy charity, that I have learned to give this reverence and honour onely to thoſe
books of Scriptures, which are now called canonical, that I do moſt firmly believe
no author of them to have erred any thing in writing;</hi> but he adds alſo, <hi>But I
ſo read others, that how much ſoever they excel in holineſs and doctrine, I do not
think it true becauſe they have ſo thought, but becauſe they could perſwade me
either by thoſe Canonical authors or by probable reaſon that it abhors not from
that which is true.</hi> Which plainly ſhews. 1. That he counted only the
writers of Canonical Scriptures and thoſe books infallible. 2. That the
ſentence of others however excellent in ſanctity and doctrine, is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
becauſe they ſo thought. 3. That their ſentence prevailed with him ſo
far as it's proof did perſwade. 4. That this proof muſt be by the Canonical
Scriptures or probable reaſon.</p>
                  <p>H. T. <hi>adds. Ob.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin Epiſt.</hi> 112. ſays we are onely bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Canonical Scriptures without dubitation, but for other witneſſes
we may believe or not believe them according to the weight of their authority.
<hi>Anſw.</hi> He ſpeaks in a particular caſe in which nothing had been defined by
the Church, namely whether God could be ſeen with corporal eyes? But the
decrees of general councils are of divine authority, as we have proved; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
according to St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> to be believed without dubitation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I reply, though he ſpeaks upon occaſion of one particular caſe, yet the ſpeech
is univerſal</hi> [but for other witneſſes or teſtimonies <hi>(beſides the Canonical
Scriptures)</hi> by which any thing is perſwaded to be believed, it is lawful for thee
to believe or not to believe, as thou ſhalt weigh how much moment thoſe things
have or not have to beget faith:] <hi>There's not a word of exception concerning
a thing defined by the Church; yea the opinion of</hi> Auguſtin <hi>is full and plain
in his ſecond book of</hi> baptiſm againſt the Donatiſts, <hi>ch. 3. to take away infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
from any Biſhops or councils Oecumenical, which I think fit to tranſlate
to ſhew how contrary it is to</hi> Austin <hi>to make any councils after the Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi>
Who knows not, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> the holy Canonical Scripture as well of the
old as of the new Teſtament to be contained in it's certain bounds, and that it
is ſo to be preferred before all the later letters of Biſhops that a man may not doubt
or diſpute of it at all, whether that which it is manifeſt to be written in it be
true or right, but for the letters of Biſhops which have been or are written after
the Canon confirmed, it is lawful that they be reprehended, if perhaps in them any
thing have deviated (or gone out of the way) from truth, both perhaps by the
wiſer ſpeech of any man more skilful in that thing, and by the more grave au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of other Biſhops, and the prudence of the learned, and by councils. And
thoſe councils which are held in ſingle Regions or Provinces are to give place
without any windings to the authority of more full councils, which are gathered
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119447:76"/>
out of the whole Chriſtian world, and oft times thoſe former fuller councils may
be mended by later, when by ſome trial of things that is open which was ſhut up
and known which did lye hid, without any ſmoke of ſacrilegious pride, without any
ſwollen neck of arrogance, without any contention of wan envy, with holy humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with Catholick peace, with Chriſtian charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet once more, ſaith</hi> H. T. <hi>Ob.</hi> St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> (in his Epiſtle to the Biſhops
of <hi>Africa)</hi> tells the <hi>Arians</hi> they in vain ran about to ſeek councils, ſince the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is more powerful then all councils. <hi>Anſw.</hi> He ſays it was vain for them
who had rejected the general council of <hi>Nice,</hi> nor doubt we but the Scripture hath
in many reſpects a preheminence above the definitions of general councils,
and a higher degree of infallibility, yet theſe alſo are infallible in points of
faith.</p>
                  <p>I reply, the reaſon of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſhews it was in vain for <hi>Arians</hi> to ſeek to
councils, becauſe the Scripture was againſt them, not becauſe the council of
<hi>Nice</hi> was againſt them, as the very words recited by <hi>H. T.</hi> ſhew, who doth
well to acknowledge the Scriptures preheminence, which juſtifies Proteſtants
who ſtick to the Scriptures againſt councils, which do often ſwerve from them
and ſometimes oppoſe them. As for the degree of infallibility (if there be any
degrees of infallibility, which perhaps a Logician will deny, infallibility being
a meer negation of liableneſs to error or being deceived) <hi>H. T.</hi> aſcribes to them,
it is ſo uncertain what it is, and ſo weakly proved, that none that loves his ſoul
ſhould reſt on it, and not try, what they hold, by the Scriptures confeſſedly
more infallible. As for the ſpeech of the council of <hi>Baſil</hi> there's no reaſon why
Proteſtants or others ſhould reſt on it, when Papiſts themſelves, even <hi>H. T.</hi> p.
79. rejects it, and ſays <hi>it was not approved in any decree, but ſuch as concern
Church benefices;</hi> and yet this man concludes with it's ſpeech about the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a general council, as if it were certain. So vertiginous is this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>H. T. proceeds thus, Article 6. The true Church demonſtrated by her Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Miracles. Our Tenet is, that the Roman Catholick Church is known
and evidently diſtinguiſhed from all falſe Churches, not onely by the marks
and properties by us premiſed, but alſo by her ſanctity and power of doing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and is proved thus, That is thé true Church and lawfull Spouſe of
Chriſt which is eminent for Sanctity of Diſcipline, and Doctrine, and for
Miracles. But the Roman Catholick Church and no other is eminent for
Sanctity of Diſcipline and Doctrine, and for Miracles; therefore the Roman
Catholick Church and no other is the true Church and lawfull Spouſe of Chriſt.
The Major for Sanctity is proved by that Article of the Apoſtles Creed, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the holy Catholick Church, as alſo by theſe Texts of holy Scripture;
Chriſt gave himſelf for his Church, cleanſing her by the Laver of Water
(Baptiſm) in the Word, that he might preſent her to himſelf a glorious
Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, but that ſhe might be holy and unspotted,
Epheſ. 5. 27. Theſe things ye were (ſaith St. Paul) but ye are waſhed, but ye
are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
and the Spirit of our God, 1 Cor. 6. 10. A good Tree bringeth forth good
Fruit, by their Fruit ye ſhall know them, St. Matth. 7 17, 20. Strait is the
Gate, and narrow is the Way which leadeth to Life, &amp;c. If thou wilt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. THe Syllogiſm is not good, the words <hi>[and no other]</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wanting in the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition, and, if they be
put in, the <hi>Major</hi> is falſe. <hi>That which is eminent for
Sanctity of Diſcipline and Doctrine, and for Miracles,
and no other, is the true Church and lawfull Spouſe of
Chriſt.</hi> For a Chnrch may be true and a lawfull Spouſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which is
not eminent for Miracles. Elſe it would go ill with all the Churches ſince Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles

Diſciples. But as it is now expreſſed by <hi>H. T.</hi> I grant the <hi>Major,</hi> though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the words of <hi>Chriſt, Matth</hi> 7. 17, 20. the Texts are all impertinent. The
Article of the Creed is not meant of the meer viſible church, but of the
church which is alſo the inviſible of the elect perſons, nor is it meant of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of outward Diſcipline and Doctrine, but of inward real holineſs, and ſo
are <hi>Epheſ. 5. 27. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 10, 11. yea the former is meant of that holineſs,
which is perfect <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle, when the Church is preſented to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>
at his appearing, and the other of <hi>that ſanctifying which is by the Spirit of
God,</hi> and not onely by Baptiſm. The Texts <hi>Matth. 7. 13, 14. &amp;</hi> 19. 11, 12.
<hi>&amp; Mark 10. 21. Heb.</hi> 13. 17. are not expreſſions of properties, which are
marks of the church, but Precepts, and ſignifie what duty ſome did or ought to
do. Now the doing of ſome duties is not a mark of the church, as <hi>v. g.</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
juſtice, giving to the poor, relieving the Saints, ſelling all we have, which
may be in Infidels; and thoſe duties which are in the three later Texts are
ſpecial duties of ſome, and therefore not marks which agree to the whole
church, but ſuch as all members are not tied to, every member (not a woman)
is not to geld himſelf, but he that can take it, nor to ſell all (Papiſts make theſe
Evangelical counſels of more perfection than is ordinary) nor to obey Prelates,
and therefore in ſuch they are no parts of Sanctity, much leſs marks of a true
church.</p>

ſuch as <hi>John Fox, John Dod, Richard Grenham,</hi> and many more whoſe Lives
and Works ſhewed them to have been men of holy converſation, and of much
acquaintance with God, whom this Scribler and ſuch like ſuperſtitious Papiſts,
who place holineſs in obſervance of humane inventions rather than in Gods
commands, obeying the Pope rather than <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and believing the lying Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends
of Friers before the true reports of godly Preachers of the Goſpel, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

in following the Rules of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not humane traditions, do judge
them to have been holy and bleſſed men, ſuch as have had not onely a form, but
alſo the power of godlineſs. As for what <hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith out of <hi>Hollingſhead</hi> of
<hi>Auſtin</hi> and his followers, it ſpeaks only what they did at the beginning, but it is
certain that <hi>Auſtin</hi> did not ſo perſevere, but that he ſhewed much pride towards
the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops, and ſo much malice to the <hi>Banchor</hi> Monks, men of more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
holineſs than himſelf, that he was ſuſpected at leaſt to have been Inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of a cruel Maſſacre of two thouſand of them for not ſubmitting to him,
and receiving the <hi>Roman</hi> Rites. And for his converting of <hi>England,</hi> though I
am willing to let him have his due commendation, yet neither is it true that
he converted all <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe he did convert he did alſo pervert by his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Orders, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> never appointed, whence a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
of Superſtition ſpread over <hi>Britain,</hi> and much diſcord and miſery followed
thereupon, as may be ſeen in the Writers of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtories. As for <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict</hi>
who was before <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, and <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Dominick</hi> after, that
which I finde in the Relation of their Lives by <hi>Villegas,</hi> tranſlated by <hi>Heig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
gives me no ſuch cauſe as to judge them to have been men of ſuch holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as the Popes and Friers have judged them to be, but at the beſt deluded
perſons with the Errour of thoſe times, in which holineſs was placed in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtical

are no better than old wives tales, upon the report of which Popes as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

Life and Doctrine, but that they ſpake againſt the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of whoſe
idolatry, pride, cruelty, avarice, uncleanneſs of body, there is ſo much in all
the Writers of thoſe times as is ſufficient to ſhew, that thoſe men had cauſe to
abhor them, and to fear the yielding ſubjection to them, who had departed
from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by their ſetting up other Mediatours beſides him, and changed pure

                  </argument>
                  <p>H. T. proceeds thus, Adde hereunto what the Catholick Church teaches, that
the Commandments are poſſible, nay, muſt be kept, ſhe teaches the neceſſity of
Contrition, Confeſſion, aud Satisfaction, with many other practices of ſelf-denial;
ſhe teaches obedience to Priests and ſpiritual Paſtours, in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the ſoul and the government of the Church; ſhe teaches much faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
prayer, and mortification; ſhe exhorts to good works, voluntary poverty,
chaſtity, and obedience. The contrary to all which Doctrines are taught by
Proteſtants and other Sectaries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> THe Papiſts teach not onely that the Commandments of God are
poſſible, and that they muſt be kept (which Proteſtants teach alſo)
but they alſo teach, that in this life a perſon in the ſtate of grace may perfectly
keep the whole Law of God, ſo as not to ſin, (except venially, which is with
them not a ſin properly, as being beſides, not againſt the Law) and thereby be
juſtified, and that many things, which are horrid evils, are venial ſins, and
that a perſon may ſatisfie for them, by Works of Penance, which are for the
moſt part eaſie things, yea, they teach that a man may by his good works merit
of condignity (either by virtue of Gods promiſe, or the worth of the work)
eternal life, yea, that he may do Works of Supererogation, and merit for
others, and that thereby is made up a Treaſury in the Church, which with the
redundance of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ſufferings may by Indulgences be laid out for others,
for the relaxation of their puniſhment in Purgatory. But this Doctrine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
abhor, as being ſo far from being holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they deteſt it as anti-evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,
proudly evacuating the grace of the Goſpel, and they teach that moſt

man is unable in this life, though regenerate according to the meaſure of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
grace, he hath to keep the Law of God perfectly, ſo as to fail in no
point, or ſo as to be juſtified before God by pleading any Works of his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or after Regeneration, or can merit of condignity in proper acception any

by faith in</hi> Chriſt <hi>freely by the grace of God through the Redemption that is
in</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, and that <hi>eternal life is the gift of God through</hi> Jeſus Chriſt
<hi>our Lord,</hi> and this we are ſure as far exceeds in holineſs Popiſh Doctrine as
<hi>Chriſt</hi> exceeds <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Goſpel the Law, the new covenant the old. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
teach the neceſſity of contrition of ſpirit for ſin, and confeſſion of ſin
to God, and ſatisfaction to men whom we have injured, if able: but the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of confeſſion to a Prieſt, and ſuch power of abſolution and enjoyning
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:119447:79"/>
Penance, as Papiſts aſcribe to a Prieſt, and ſuch ſatisfaction to God for ſin, as
they teach and practiſe, we deny, as being injurious to the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> an
arrogant uſurpation of what <hi>Chriſt</hi> never conferred, but a fruit of ignorance of
the nature of repentance, and of the myſtery of the Goſpel, and a meer En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to rob the people, and to hold them in ſlaviſh ſubjection to their Prieſts.
We ſay, that it is true ſelf-denial when <hi>Chriſt</hi> requires it, and either the glory
of God, the truth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and obedience to him muſt be forſaken, or our
goods, liberties and lives, than to deny our ſelves by not retaining them: but
that it is no part of that ſelf-denial which <hi>Chriſt</hi> requires, nor any part of
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> mortification for a man unneceſſarily to leave his eſtate and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to whip himſelf, creep to a croſs, go on pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and
ſuch other things as <hi>Chriſt</hi> never required, but are meer ſuperſtition and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.
Proteſtants teach obedience to ſpiritual Paſtours in things belonging to
the ſoul, and the government of the Church, when they teach them to obſerve
what <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanded: but they juſtly refuſe to ſubject their conſciences to
ſuch commands of Prelates and Prieſts as <hi>Chriſt</hi> never appointed, but judge it
neceſſary <hi>to ſtand faſt in the liberty they have by</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and not be entangled
with the yoke of bondage,</hi> which Popes, and Prelates, and Prieſts, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Church (of which they are the leaſt part) about difference of
Meats, Marriage, Holy-days, Temples, and ſuch like things endeavour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
on their conſciences and practiſe, as being injurious to their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and an heavy burden. Proteſtants teach much faſting when God calls
for it in time of affliction, and for more advantage in prayer, but they reject
Popiſh ſet faſts, and their mock-faſts, in forbearing fleſh of beaſts, eggs, milk,
butter, yet eating and drinking other food, and drink perhaps more delicious
in fulneſs, as a meer deluſion. Proteſtants teach praying much in ſpirit with
underſtanding of what they ask with faith, and truſt to be heard through the
Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for ſuch good things as God hath promiſed: but they deride
juſtly Popiſh praying in <hi>Latin</hi> by thoſe who underſtand not what they ſay,
their ſaying <hi>Ave Maries</hi> and the Creed for Prayers, their ſuperſtitious ſaying
Prayers with Beads by tale, their tying themſelves to canonical hours, as more
holy than other times, their Prayers for Souls in Purgatory, which is a meer
figment, ſerving onely to affright ſilly people that they may draw money from
them for ſaying Maſſes, they deteſt that moſt abominable invocating of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> wherein ſhe is extolled as <hi>Authour of Grace, Mother of Mercy,</hi>
having authority over or upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with abundance of wicked Superſtitions
which are uſed in Popiſh devotion to canonized Saints, Crucifixes, a piece of
Bread, imagined Relicks of Saints. Proteſtants preſs on men true mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſins of the fleſh or deeds of the body by the ſpirit working hatred of
the inward luſts, and forſaking the evil practiſes of them; but they reject the
fooliſh practiſes of whipping themſelves, tearing the fleſh with lying on Briars,
as they ſay <hi>Benedict</hi> did, tumbling in the Snow, as they ſay <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Aſſiſium</hi>
did, girding the body with Iron, and lying on the ground, as they ſay <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
did, which neither ſubdue luſt, nor the Devils temptations, but are like the
acts of <hi>Bedlams,</hi> and may be, and perhaps are done out of vain-glory and
proud conceit of meriting by them. Proteſtants exhort to good works, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the building of Monaſteries to be ſuch, for idle Monks, that in ſtead of
working with their hands that they might give to him that needs eat the bread
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119447:80"/>
to the full, which belongs to the needy poor, under pretence of praying, which is
no ſpecial function. Proteſtants teach men to be poor in ſpirit, to bear patiently
poverty, when Gods providence allots it; but the voluntary poverty of Monks and
Friers they reject as being a curſe, or elſe a meer hypocritical counterfeiting of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
when they enjoy greateſt plenty, and live in fulneſs, as Monks and Friers
uſually do, or elſe a meer madneſs, as in <hi>Anchorites</hi> and <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

teach true chaſtity in Marriage and ſingle life, but they deteſt Popiſh vows of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
life in Prieſts, Friers, and Nuns, as ſuperſtitious ſnares, when few of them
have the power of continence, and they abhor the terming of the uſe of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-bed
in Presbyters unchaſt and unholy, and moſt of all the helliſh Doctrine
of thoſe that teach it to be better for Prieſts to uſe Concubines than Wives, and
tolerate fornication and other unclean luſts when they forbid Marriage, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate,
and deprive, and impriſon, and perſecute Prieſts and Biſhops for
it. We Proteſtants teach obedience to Parents and Magiſtrates, and all that
are over us in the Lord: but abhor the Vow of blinde obedience to Superiours
never appointed by God, as ſlaviſh, and oft-times miſchievous and deſtructive of
the neceſſary obedience due to Parents, and Governours, whom God hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.
All which things being conſidered, we are fully aſſured that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
Doctrine in theſe things is moſt holy, and the Popiſh impure, though
to men that know not the Scripture it have a ſhew of wiſdom and holineſs.
Yea, we avouch that there is ſcarce a Church in the World that is more unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than the <hi>Roman</hi> in their maintaining the Worſhip of Images, which hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> in their adoration of the Bread they eat as their

the infallible Power of the Pope, though a moſt wicked man by himſelf,
or in a Council of his liking to ſet down what is to be held in point of Faith, to
diſſolve Leagues, and break Oaths upbraided by <hi>Amurath</hi> the great <hi>Turk</hi> to

which <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond a Pope thought fitter to be reſtored, forbidding ſome
Meats as unclean at ſome times, the Cup at the Euchariſt, and the ordinary
reading of the Bible in their own Language to the Lay-people, directing men
to invocate Saints, teaching them to aſcribe ſalvation to their own Merits,
making the man of ſin the Vicar of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> beſides what ſome have taught
about depoſing and deſtroying Princes, giving equivocating Anſwers to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
upon Oath, exempting Prieſts from ſubjection to Princes, allowing the
breach of faith to thoſe they judge Hereticks, making curſing Parents in paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

on all Sundays and Holy-days, but every day in the week, and that the greateſt
part in the forenoon. There is five times more preaching and catechizing,
and ten times more faſting and praying in the Catholick Church than in the
Proteſtant; her Sacraments are more, and more frequented, and in ſtead of
an innumerable multitude of religious men and women that are in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, who have freely forſaken all things to follow Chriſt, and totally
relinquiſhed the riches, pleaſures, and preferments of this life to ſerve him in
the remainder of their days in vows and practiſes of holy poverty, obedience,

that daily ſpring out of their ſtock, ſuch as are continually broaching new
Hereſies, and always at defiance one with another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw</hi> THe Popiſh devotion is ſo far from proving the holineſs of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church falſly and moſt impudently termed the Catholick Church,
that it rather proves them a Synagogue of Satan than a Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
Their Churches as they term them, ſtand open, but that which is to be ſeen or
heard in them is more like the Temples of Pagan gods than <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.
In the primitive times <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had no Images in their places of
meeting, but Popiſh Temples are full of Images and Pictures, and the ſervice
to them like the Pagans to their Idols, bowing down to them, burning Incenſe
before them, offering gifts to them, lifting up and adoring a piece of Bread,
with a great deal of outward pomp of Lights, Garments, garniſhing of the
houſe, attendance of Officers, ſuiting better to womaniſh and childiſh perſons
than holy ſpiritual <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Their Maſs, which is that they glory in, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

his laſt Supper to be continued, but a meer ſhew with many ridiculous ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
motions, actions, with Lamps burning in the day, Copes and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in imitation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which make it unlike the primitive ſimplicity of
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which was without them many hundreds of years. Their many
Holy days were juſtly heretofore complained of as a great grievance to
people, and it is a great happineſs to be freed from them all, as begetting idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
luxury, and penury, the Lord's Day excepted, which is no where among
them obſerved as a Day ſet apart for God, and ſpent in Prayer, Hearing,
Reading the Word of God to the edification of the people, and ſuch other Duties
of Religion as God hath preſcribed, but after ſome time ſpent in hearing Maſs,
and Even-ſong, the reſt of the day is ſpent in feaſting, ſporting, and in many
places in ſuch worldly affairs, as ſhew little minding of God or any heavenly
affections. Their Churches are open in the week days upon an ignorant and
ſuperſtitious conceit, as if God would hear them there by reaſon of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
of the place, or the Relicks of ſome Saint, or ſome other fond imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which their Prieſts, or anceſtours inſtill into them, and therefore they

ſay there their <hi>Ave-Maries</hi> and <hi>Pater-noſters</hi> by tale, without underſtanding or
attention to what they ſay or do, or to God, but obſerving onely their geſtures
after their manner, ſtay out their time without learning any thing which may
improve them in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> knowledge, but in their houſes in the mean time cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon God with underſtanding and feeling of their wants, the reading of
holy Scriptures is neglected, and many other Duties which ſhould be done are
omitted, and which is worſt of all much wantonneſs and other evils occaſioned
(if credible perſons ſay true) and cloked by the often repair of perſons to their
Churches. That there is more Preaching and Catechizing among Papiſts than
among Proteſtants is ſtrange news to me, nor do I think any <hi>London</hi> Merchant
or other perſon who hath travelled into <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> will believe it. What

other parts of <hi>England,</hi> and their Preaching and Catechizing, conceive, that
<hi>H. T.</hi> tells here a manifeſt untruth. However it is eaſie to diſcern by reading
the Sermons and Catechiſms of both, which are printed, that their preaching
and catechizing, how often ſoever it be in reſpect of Goſpel doctrine, ſpiritual
truths and holy directions comes as ſhort of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Preachers

Death: neither name nor thing of Sacrament, as Papiſts define it is from
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:119447:81"/>
Scripture, nor is any thing almoſt right in Papiſts doctrine or uſe of theſe
rites, but their uſe of them is almoſt quite changed into another thing then
what Chriſt inſtituted, and therefore the more they are frequented, the leſſe is
there of true Religion and the more of vain ſuperſtition. There's far better
adminiſtration of the Lords Supper among the Proteſtants, who uſe it after
Chriſts inſtitution to remember his death: not as Papiſts for a propitiatory
ſacrifice for quick and dead with addition of many hiſtrionical mimical inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men, and mangling it by the half in keeping the cup from the laity,
and making a private Maſſe of a communion. Baptiſm is better adminiſtred
without addition of oil, cream, and ſpittle, and <hi>Ephphatha,</hi> and ſuch toyes as
Papiſts uſe. Ordination is better uſed by Proteſtants who ordain Preachers
of the Goſpel, not ſacrificing Prieſts. And yet in theſe and in other matters
ſome things may be better'd, which through the great aberration from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
inſtitution remain yet to be amended. As for the multitude of religious
men and women as he calls them, not only the relations of Proteſtants, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of Popiſh writers give us cauſe to think there's little of religion or morality
in them except gluttony, idleneſſe, whoredom, and other lewdneſs be religion.
The common proverb makes a Frier a lyer. If they freely forſake any thing it
is not to follow Chriſt, but <hi>Bennet, Francis, Dominick, Bruno, Ignatius</hi> and
ſuch like hypocrites, by following whom there is more reaſon to judge they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
Chriſt, then by adhering to their rules to adhere to Chriſt, there being
none more malicious and bitter and cruel enemies to the ſincere preaching and
profeſſion of the Goſpel then Friers, Monks, Nunnes, and eſpecially the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
crew of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who have been within one hundred years and ſomewhat
more authors of more bloody warrs, maſſacres, cruel perſecutions, treaſons,
murthers and other helliſh villanies then ever ſuch a number of men beſides were
guilty of ſince the world ſtood. Is any man of ſuch a ſottiſh ſpirit as to believe
that <hi>theſe men have relinquiſhed the riches, pleaſures and preferments of this life
to ſerve Chriſt the remainder of their lives,</hi> who knows what goodly ſtructures
they live in, what full tables they have, what great revenues they are inriched
with? will any man that views the very ruins of Abbys, Nunneries, Priories
and other houſes, which they termed religious here in <hi>England,</hi> that reads
the catalogue of their revenues at the end of <hi>Speeds Chronicle</hi> judge theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed
the riches of this life? Are the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> in <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
the Colledge of <hi>La Flech</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> with innumerable more in thoſe countries,
and in <hi>Germany, Italy,</hi> &amp;c. Cottages for poor Almeſmen? what an arrant
gullery and cheat is this of this frontleſſe ſcribler to perſwade <hi>Engliſh</hi> people,
that their votaries have relinquiſhed all riches when they poſſeſſe revenues in
ſome countries equal to Kings and Princes, fair Palaces, full tables, good
cloathing, great attendance, large command of tenants with furniture and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of all ſorts of things commodious for this life in their convents? And
to ſay they ſerve Chriſt when all the world knows the Monks ſerve none but
their own bellies, and the Jeſuits are true to none but the Catholick Biſhop
and Catholick King, who may perhaps in time finde them as pernicious to
themſelves as they are to other Princes and States, what a monſtrous fiction is
it? their vows and practiſes are not of true but counterfeit poverty, and if it
were voluntary poverty indeed which they make ſhew of, it would be the more

of the doctrine by the Scripture we are not meerly upon the pretence of miracles
to judge men to be true teachers and true Churches, (except they ſhould be ſo

miracles are not a ſufficient note of a true Church.</p>

                     <p>The Popiſh pretended miracles prove not the truth of their Church, nor the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
related by ſome of the Fathers.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>But H. T. taking his Major, as to the power of miracles, ſufficiently proved pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
thus. The Minor is proved by theſe enſuing undeniable teſtimonies.
Firſt, Proteſtants and other Sectaries pretend that miracles have ceaſed ever
ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles time, becauſe they and their Sectmaſters have
never yet been able to do any, a ſure conviction that they want this
mark.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. PRoteſtants do not pretend that all working of miracles is ceaſed
ſince the Apoſtles time, but ſuch frequent working of miracles
as was in the Apoſtles time. 2. That they do not for the reaſon which this
author allegeth ſay ſo, but becauſe the truth is ſo, and if they have not been
able to do any, no more have the Papiſts; if they could they would do them to
convince the Sectaries (as he terms us) ſith <hi>ſigns are not for them to believe, but
for them that believe not,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 22. And therefore if Papiſts could do any
miracles, ſurely they would do them openly to convince the hereticks who deny
their Popes and Churches infallibility, of which ſurely we are all ſuch infidels,
as that without miracles done by Popes and the Preachers of his vicarſhip we
ſhall never be brought to believe it. But they chooſe rather to cheat fooliſh
Papiſts with counterfeit tricks, as of the boy of <hi>Bilſon, Garnets</hi> ſtraw and ſuch
like devices, then to let any underſtanding Proteſtants have any ſight of them,
who would diſcover their knavery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> H. T. <hi>tells us.</hi> Secondly, hiſtories (as well of enemies as friends) have
recorded many famous miracles in all ages wrought by the Catholick Church. The
<hi>Magdeburgian</hi> Centuriſts, although Proteſtants (ſuch is evidence and force of

truth) have recorded many great miracles done by Catholicks in their 13. c. of
every century for one thouſand three hundred years together after Chriſt. St.
<hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Aſſiſium</hi> fifteen dayes before his death had wounds freſhly bleeding
in his hands, feet and ſide, ſuch as Chriſt had on the Croſs, and this by miracle,

Church ſold one of them to the Jews, who out of malice and contempt ſtab'd it,
ſaying; If thou be the God of Chriſtians manifeſt thy ſelf, whereupon blood

in <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and all the reſt of the Jews were baniſhed out of that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſate.</hi>
This is recorded by <hi>Pontianus</hi> in his fifth book of memorable things,
and by <hi>John Mandevil</hi> a Protestant in his book <hi>de locis communibus p.</hi> 87. as

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The <hi>Magdeburgian</hi> Centuriſts have indeed in their ſeveral cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies
one chapter of marvellous things, but many of them are ſuch as were
wrought immediately by divine providence and are liable to various conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
few of them, done by men in teſtimony of the truth of any religion,
doctrine or Church, and fewer yet of any certain credit. 2. There's no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any of them that are ſaid to be done as wrought by the Catholick
Church, either <hi>Roman</hi> or properly ſo called, however there be ſome related as
done by perſons of the Catholick Church, who are more juſtly to be accounted
Proteſtants in reſpect of the doctrine they taught then Papiſts, whom they
falſly call Catholicks. 3. It is not denied that <hi>Socrates l. 7. hiſt. c.</hi> 17. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
a miracle of <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>Novatian</hi> Biſhop, and <hi>Auguſtin. tract.</hi> 13. on <hi>John,</hi>
and <hi>de unit. Eccleſ. c.</hi> 16. denies not, that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> alleged miracles, and
he calls them by contempt <hi>Mirabiliarios,</hi> and judged that the Church was to
be judged by Scripture and the miracles by the Church, as <hi>Bellarm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confeſſeth
de notis Eccl. l. 4. c.</hi> 14. 4. Thoſe that are ſaid to be done by perſons of the
Catholick Church for the firſt five hundred years, were not done by perſons
that held the now Romiſh doctrine or in confirmation of it or the verity of the
now <hi>Roman</hi> Church. 5. All the reſt in all the ages following are of none or
very ſmall credit. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great is himſelf judged by Romaniſts to have
been too credulous of tales, thoſe <hi>Dialogues</hi> which are ſaid to be his (in which
are related ſome of the miracles which the Papiſts rely on) being either none
of his or ſhewing too much credulity in him: the reſt of the miracles in the
legends are ſo ridiculous fopperies, as even diſcreet Papiſts themſelves have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited.
Dr. <hi>Rainold Conf. with Hart ch. 8. diviſ.</hi> 2. allegeth <hi>Canus</hi> as in

falſe ſtories which were rehearſed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Porteſſes, if <hi>Eſpencaeus Comment.
in 2. Epiſt. ad Tim. c. 4. digreſſ.</hi> 21. be to be believed. The two pretended
miracles which this Author hath choſen for inſtance have nothing like divine
miracles or truth. The miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles were ſuch as were
done openly in the ſight of all ſo as they could not be denied, but even adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
confeſſed them, theſe were things only in private, ſo as that there might be
ſome device uſed to delude the ſight, or might be fancied to be ſo by ſome
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119447:83"/>
doating perſons, or might be by the illuſion of Satan, which is not improbable
to have been uſed in them, there being great cauſe to conceive, that in thoſe
dayes of darkneſſe by ſeeming wonders, apparitions, viſions, prophecies, Satan
promoted the worſhip of Saints, eſpecially of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the opinion of
purgatory, prayer for the dead, worſhip of reliques, by which Idolatry and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition

Synod. Nor is there any likelihood that the wounds of <hi>Francis</hi> ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
fifteen dayes afore death, in which time he was likely covered, and not
after his death, in which his body being naked they might have been more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
were not the time afore death more convenient for the impoſture. And
the like may be ſaid of the other tale. What likelihood is there that a man
ſhould venture his life to ſteale two pieces of bread, or little water cakes, or that
a <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould buy one, or do ſuch an act before witneſſes, which would bring
ſo much evil on him? the thing ſeems more likely to have been a deviſed tale to
pick a quarrel with the <hi>Jews,</hi> as it was in thoſe dayes uſual for a pretence to get
their goods as it had been done to the <hi>Templars.</hi> Sure there was no juſtice to
burn thirty eight for the fact of one, much leſſe to baniſh all <hi>Jews</hi> thence.

up rage againſt the Jews, that they might prey on their goods. 6. Were it
yeilded (as it is not) that there was truth in theſe relations, yet the moſt that
can be collected is, that God would vindicate <hi>Francis</hi> from ſome ill opinions
or reports of him, not that he might be extolled, as <hi>Horatius Turſelin</hi> in his
blaſphemous <hi>Epigram</hi> did, as if he were comparable with Chriſt, or that either
the Popes ſupremacy or the order of Friers, or the verity of the doctrine of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church then, much leſſe the truth of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhould
be confirmed. Nor, if the other accident were true, doth it follow, that God
would thereby confirm the opinion of tranſubſtantiation, but the verity of
Chriſts being the Son of God, and we may more juſtly anſwer concerning i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth concerning the miracle of the <hi>Novatian</hi> Biſhop, <hi>that it
was done, not to confirm the Novatian faith, but Catholick baptiſm,</hi> ſo the other
was done, not to confirm the Popiſh opinion of tranſubſtantiation, but the
Chriſtian doctrine of the man Chriſt his being the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>H. T.</hi> adds, <hi>notwithſtanding this confeſſion of adverſaries, I will alſo all
ſome Fathers,</hi> of whoſe relations of miracles it is not worth while to conſider
whether they were true or not, there being not one of them that proves this
point, that the Church which wants miracles is not the true Church, or that
the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> doctrine or Church are the true doctrine or Church. That
which <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Optatus</hi> relate, if true, did only vindicate the Lords Supper
from contempt, that of <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus,</hi> whether it were ſo or onely a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
(of which good men were ſometimes too credulous) it proves not the truth
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but rather, if any, of the Greek Church which owned not
the Popes ſupremacy, nor their doctrines in that age. Much leſs is that which
he brings out of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> concerning the reliques of <hi>Babylas</hi> for his purpoſe,
ſith it is expreſly ſaid to have proved againſt infidels that <hi>Chriſt was the Son of
God, and the Idols of the Gentiles were vain things,</hi> which no more proves the
truth of the <hi>Roman</hi> then of the Proteſtant Churches, nor ſo much as of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Churches who hold the ſame. That of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> concerning his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119447:83"/>
                     <hi>Satyrus</hi> proves not tranſubſtantiation, but rather the contrary, ſith <hi>Satyrus</hi>
adored not the Euchariſt, when he kept it, and that he did keep him from
drowning was but a conjecture, nor is it proved that God by that accident
approved his ſuperſtition, though he might reward his faith and love, of which
that was a ſign. What <hi>Auguſtin l. 22. de civit. Dei c.</hi> 8. writes of things

were preſſed in conſcience to divulge them, as there <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith was done by

them might be by medicines working beyond expectation though attributed, as
the faſhion is, to that which was laſt uſed; ſome of them perhaps fell out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

none of them like the miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which were more
frequent and open and manifeſt in the preſence of the adverſaries, as the raiſing
of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and many more were, and therefore he allegeth them for the ſtopping
of their mouths, who called for miracles, rather then for any evident proof of
religion, uſing this very preface in the beginning of the Chapter, <hi>Why, ſay they,
are not thoſe miracles now done which ye ſay have been done? I may ſay indeed
they were neceſſary before the world ſhould believe for this that the world might

of all Chriſtendom.</p>
                  <p>I Reply, 1. The objection is not as <hi>H. T.</hi> frameth it, but that ſo frequent
and manifeſt working of miracles as was in the days of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and which may be a note of the true Church or doctrine without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonancy
to the Scripture hath ceaſed, and therefore by this mark of it ſelf the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church is not proved to be the true Church. 2. The contradictory to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119447:84"/>
this is not proved by Chriſts promiſes or the Churches records For, 1. The
Promiſes, <hi>John 14. 10. Mark.</hi> 16. 17. are indefinite in reſpect of perſons and
time, and an indefinite propoſition is true in a contingent matter, if verified
but of ſome at ſome times, and therefore theſe promiſes may be true of ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
onely, and of the time wherein the Apoſtles lived, and conſequently by
the promiſes it cannot be proved that there muſt be a power of working mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in the Church in every age. 2. That they cannot be underſtood of any age
after the Apoſtles unto this day is manifeſt, becauſe they are not true of any
age after that. For however ſome miracles have been done, yet not <hi>greater</hi>
then Chriſt did, which is promiſed, <hi>John</hi> 14. 10. nor was <hi>the speaking with
new tongues</hi> which is promiſed <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 17. in any age, but that in which
the Apoſtles lived. 3. Theſe promiſes are as much made to believers in other
Churches as the <hi>Roman,</hi> but now they grant there's no power of Miracles in
any other Church, and therefore they muſt yield to underſtand the words with
ſuch a limitation as may make the Propoſition true, though there be no power
of Miracles in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. 4. There's no promiſe of the power of
Miracles to confirm the truth of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, nor of any other point
but the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith, and therefore none of the Miracles done by virtue of
thoſe promiſes prove the truth of the now <hi>Roman</hi> Church or Doctrine, but
onely the true faith, which is believed by Proteſtants, who believe the Creed
as well as Papiſts. As for the Records, there are very few of them of any
certainty after the Apoſtles days, and Popiſh Writers themſelves do confeſs,
that not onely in their Legends, but alſo in their Liturgies, fabulous things
have crept; ſo that by ſaying Miracles are altogether now ceaſed, or elſe
are very rare, and are unfit to demonſtrate the verity of any preſent Church,
is no contradicting <hi>Chriſt's</hi> promiſes, or any good Records of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>

                  <p>H. T. <hi>adds. Object.</hi> Signs and Miracles were given to Unbelievers not to
Believers, therefore they are now unneceſſary. <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, they are not, for they
very much confirm the immediate care and providence of God over his Church,
they excellently demonſtrate his omnipotence, and there be many disbelievers ſtill,
the more is the pity.</p>
                  <p>I reply, that <hi>Tongues are for a ſign to them that believe not,</hi> is the Apoſtles

of other Miracles; and therefore is this juſtly urged by Proteſtants, that to
believers to prove the truth of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine or of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church
Miracles are unneceſſary. Now the Anſwer of <hi>H. T.</hi> is quite from the point,
when he tells us that they are neceſſary for other ends. And yet it is not true,
that <hi>Signs and Miracles are neceſſary to confirm the immediate care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

intended Miracles to prove the Popes Supremacy or the verity of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, but the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith, and therefore till both or either of them be
proved from Scripture, if we be disbelievers we muſt be disbelievers ſtill,
knowing this, that if there ſhould be never ſo great Miracles in ſhew done by

and ſome other late canonized Saints long after their death ſworn by
ſome admirers of them, or credulous receivers of reports concerning things of
them not openly done and commonly known as the Miracles of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his
Apoſtles were, I hear of none. The <hi>Paralipomena</hi> of <hi>Franciſcus a Sancta Clara</hi>
or <hi>Davenport,</hi> who endeavoured to reconcile the nine and thirty Articles of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is,
Light with Darkneſs, a little afore theſe Wars, I never ſaw, nor do I expect to
finde any thing from ſuch a man but fraud and falſhood, who had the face to
endeavour to draw the Articles purpoſely framed againſt the Popiſh Doctrine
to a ſenſe conſiſtent with it. What <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> writ of the Miracles done by
the Idol at <hi>Halles,</hi> and <hi>Zichem, Turſelin</hi> of the Chapel at <hi>Lauretto,</hi> and ſuch
like Relations, there is no man that heeds the Scripture will give any credit to
them, but take them either as fictions or illuſions of Satan to confirm men in
the idolatrous Worſhip of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and to promote the Prieſts gain,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119447:85"/>
which is a great part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. But the frequent Impoſtures of
Papiſts in this kinde, as of the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the Abby of <hi>Hales,</hi> that of
<hi>Boxley</hi> Abby, and the holy Maid of <hi>Kent,</hi> related by <hi>Speed</hi> in his <hi>Chronicle</hi> of

and perſons yet alive can teſtifie of the Prieſts deceit in it, with many more,
give juſt cauſe to diſcredit all ſuch Narrations as meer jugling tricks. Nor
have the Legends of Saints, which this man calls <hi>the Records of the Church</hi>
any better credit with the more ingenuous of their own Church, of whom
though ſome mince the matter, calling them <hi>Pious Frauds,</hi> as if Piety might

                  <argument>
                     <p>Neither is it proved nor probable that Peter was Biſhop of Rome, or that he was
to have a Succeſſour.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>Our Tenet, ſaith H. T. is that the Pope or Biſhop of Rome is the true Succeſſour
of St. Peter and Head of the whole Church of God, which hath in part been
proved already by our Catalogue of chief Paſtours (who were all Popes of
Rome) and by the Councils of all Ages, approved by them, and owning them
for ſuch, and is yet farther proved thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> THat <hi>Peter</hi> was Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been ſaid, but never yet
proved but by the tradition of the Ancients, who might be
as eaſily deceived in that as they were about <hi>Chriſt's</hi> age, the
keeping of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and many other things. Thoſe very men
who relate <hi>Peter's</hi> ſitting at <hi>Rome</hi> as Biſhop do not agree
about his immediate Succeſſour, whether <hi>Linus,</hi> or <hi>Clemens,</hi> or <hi>Cletus,</hi> as <hi>H. T.</hi>
confeſſeth here <hi>pag.</hi> 52. And the relation it ſelf is ſo inconſiſtent with that
which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>by conſent he and</hi> Peter <hi>agreed that</hi> Peter <hi>ſhould go to the</hi>
Jews, <hi>and had the Gospel of the Circumciſion committed to him,</hi> his not ſaluting
<hi>Peter</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> his being at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and according to
<hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in other places ſo long a time as they mention in the <hi>Acts of
the Apoſtles,</hi> and the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> makes it altogether improbable
that he ſhould be Biſhop at <hi>Rome</hi> ſuch a time as they ſay he was, and be put to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119447:86"/>
death in <hi>Nero's</hi> time as the tradition inſiſted on bears in hand. Nor was it
agreeable to <hi>Peter's</hi> Office appointed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be as a fixed Paſtour in one
Place. And if he were ſettled in any place it is more probable it was at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
where <hi>Paul</hi> mentions him to have been, than at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor of his tranſlation of
his Seat from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> is there any proof, but what is by ſuch tradition,
as in this and other things appears to be very uncertain and unlikely. Yet were it
yielded that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop or chief Paſtour, how will it be proved that he
was to have a Succeſſour? <hi>Paul</hi> it is certain was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and did while he
was there, undoubtedly execute the Office of a Paſtour, yet Popes do not
challenge themſelves to be <hi>Paul's</hi> but <hi>Peter's</hi> Succeſſours, however they put
<hi>Paul's</hi> Sword in their Arms with <hi>Peter's</hi> Keys, and in their Writings ſay the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was founded by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and uſe <hi>Paul's</hi> name with
<hi>Peter's</hi> in their Sentences. Nor can indeed in any true ſenſe the Pope of
<hi>Rome</hi> be termed <hi>Peter's</hi> Succeſſour. For if he be his Succeſſour, he is Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
in his Work or in his Power. The Work of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was by
preaching the Goſpel to found Churches to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to that end was to go to
ſeveral places; but the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceeds not in this, he neither goes up
and down unleſs in a pompous Proceſſion, or to a worſe end, nor preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Goſpel, nor founds any Churches thereby, nor doth think it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but to ſtay at <hi>Rome,</hi> and there to live in pomp, and wealth, and luxury,
and to lord it tyrannouſly over the Flock of God. Nor is he Succeſſour in his
power. <hi>Peter</hi> had power to give the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. to ſtrike <hi>Ananias</hi>
and <hi>Sapphira</hi> dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. But the Pope cannot do theſe things. Nor in the
Government of the whole Church. For this <hi>Peter</hi> onely had not, nor above
other Apoſtles, but together with the reſt. Nor was <hi>Peter's</hi> or the Apoſtles
power any ſuch viſible Monarchy as the Pope claims, to receive Appeals
from all Churches, to appoint Legates to hear parties in all controverſies of
faith, to be an infallible Judge of ſuch controverſies, an infallible Expounder
of the Scriptures, determining what is Hereſie, and what of Faith, calling ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils, crowning Emperours, depoſing Princes, diſpenſing with
Oaths, Marriages of perſons in near degrees, otherwiſe prohibited, impoſe
Laws about Faſting, and many other things which God never appointed.
Such an Headſhip of the whole Church as the Pope claims <hi>Peter</hi> never had.
Nor is any ſuch thing proved or ſo much as offer'd to be proved by <hi>H. T.</hi> his
Catalogue, which how inſufficient it is hath been alread ſhewed. I go on to
his Arguments here.</p>

                     <p>From being the Foundation, Matth 16. 18. and feeding the Sheep of Chriſt,
John 21. 15, 16, 17. neither Peter's nor Popes Supremacy is proved.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>The firſt Argument, ſaith H. T. is this, The foundation hath a preheminence of
firmitude and ſtability before the rest of the building which is founded on it,
and the Shepherd is Head of his Flock, and above his Sheep. But St. Peter
next after Chriſt himſelf was the Foundation of the whole Church, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour
of the whole Flock: therefore St. Peter next after Chriſt had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence
over the whole Church, and was Head of the whole Flock, and
above all the other Sheep, of which number were the reſt of the Apoſtles.</p>

                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:119447:86"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> THe Headſhip and paſtoral power which <hi>H. T.</hi> would prove to be due
to the Pope is not a guidance onely by teaching, but a princely
dominion, ſo as that all may appeal to him, none from him, his ſentence muſt
be obeyed by all under pain of damnation in matters of faith, and muſt be
judged infallible, and 'tis likely he holds with <hi>Bellarmine, lib. 4. de Rom. pont.
cap. 5. that if the Pope ſhould erre by commanding vices, or forbidding virtues,
the Church ſhould be bound to believe vices to be good and virtues to be evil, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it would ſin againſt conſcience;</hi> and if he diſſent herein from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
yet in the Canon Law <hi>diſtinct.</hi> 40. ſuch an abſolute dominion is given him,
<hi>that though he ſhould draw innumerable ſouls with him to Hell, no man muſt ſay to
him, Why doſt thou ſo?</hi> and ſome Flatterers of the Pope have given him <hi>all
power in Heaven and Earth,</hi> yea, and more than <hi>Chriſt</hi> had, in Purgatory alſo,
allowing no Appeal from the Pope to God, as <hi>having one Conſiſtory with God,</hi>
calling him <hi>our Lord God the Pope;</hi> nor did I ever read or hear that any Pope
hath by any Cenſure corrected ſuch blaſphemous Titles, but they have by their
commands contrary to Gods, diſpenſing with his Laws, depoſing Emperours,
and innumerable other practiſes ſhewed that they owned ſuch power as theirs.
Now ſure this power was never given to <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any ſuch like power under
the term of <hi>a Foundation,</hi> which is for the ruine, not for the eſtabliſhing of the
Church, nor under the charge of <hi>feeding,</hi> eſpecially of anothers Sheep, of
whom he is no Owner or Lord. Is this to feed <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Sheep, to do what he
will with them, appoint what Penance he will, put what Laws he pleaſe on the
Sheep, to excommunicate, deprive of Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Dignity and
Office at pleaſure? ſuch a Supremacy is indeed ſo like that which <hi>Paul</hi> foretold
concerning <hi>the man of ſin,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 4. that <hi>he oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf
above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped: ſo that he as God ſitteth in the
Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God;</hi> that till I meet with ſome
more likely than the Popes to be there meant, I ſhall take it be a part of my
Creed, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is the very <hi>Man of ſin</hi> there meant. And for
this <hi>H. T.</hi> who gives ſuch a ſupreme Headſhip to <hi>Peter</hi> and the Pope over the
other Apoſtles, ſo as to make him a Shepherd, to rule, excommunicate, deprive,
<hi>John, James, Paul,</hi> as his Sheep, it is ſo monſtrouſly falſe an Aſſertion as none
but he that hath ſold himſelf to teach Lyes would ever aſſert it. As for his
Syllogiſm it is moſt groſly naught, as having four terms at leaſt. The term
<hi>[hath a preheminence of firmitude and ſtability before the reſt of the building
which is founded on it]</hi> being different from this in the Concluſion, <hi>[had a
preheminence over the whole Church]</hi> and ſo likewiſe are theſe <hi>[the Foundation]</hi>
and <hi>[the Foundation of the whole Church]</hi> and therefore the <hi>Major</hi> ſhould have
been <hi>[the Foundation of the whole Church hath a preheminence over the whole
Church]</hi> the <hi>Minor</hi> thus, [Peter <hi>next after</hi> Chriſt <hi>is the Foundation of the
whole Church]</hi> and the Concluſion thus, [Peter <hi>next after</hi> Chriſt <hi>had a prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
over the whole Church]</hi> or elſe thus, <hi>[The Foundation hath a prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of firmitude and ſtability before the whole Church. But</hi> Peter <hi>next after</hi>
Chriſt <hi>is the Foundation, therefore</hi> Peter <hi>had a preheminence of firmitude and
ſtability before the whole Church]</hi> now neither of theſe Concluſions had been
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119447:87"/>
the point to be proved, but might have been granted, and the Aſſertion not
gained. And in the other Metaphor the Syllogiſm hath the ſame fault. For
in the <hi>Major</hi> it is <hi>[Head of his Flock, and above his Sheep]</hi> in the <hi>Minor</hi> it is
<hi>[Paſtour of the whole Flock]</hi> and in the Concluſion not <hi>[Head of his Flock and
above his Sheep]</hi> but <hi>[Head of the whole Flock, and above all the other Sheep]</hi>
and there is added too this tail of which there is no offer of proof <hi>[of which
number were the reſt of the Apoſtles.]</hi> Now to diſcover beſides the fallacy in the
form the deceit in the matter of this Argument, it is to be conſidered, 1. That
the Metaphor of <hi>a Foundation</hi> doth not at all import Rule or Government,
but inchoation and ſupport, and therefore is unfit to prove that Rule and
Power of Government which <hi>H. T.</hi> derives from it. 2. That he that is a
Shepherd is Head or Lord of his own Sheep, but a Shepherd is not Lord or
Head of anothers Sheep of which he is no Owner; and therefore though he is
to rule and feed them, yet he is not to rule them after his own will, but the
Owners, nor is he to take the profit of the Sheep, but the Owner is to have it, the
Shepherd is not to look, but for his pay and encouragement according to the will
or contract of the Owner. Now the Flock of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were none of <hi>Peter's</hi> Sheep,
nor were all the Sheep of <hi>Chriſt</hi> univerſally taken to be fed by <hi>Peter,</hi> for then
he ſhould feed, that is, rule himſelf, who was one of the Flock, and ſo excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
himſelf, abſolve himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſith the Pope hath <hi>Peter's</hi> power, if he
be one of the Sheep of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by this Doctrine he is to rule, that is, to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
abſolve, and deprive himſelf. And for the other Metaphor of <hi>a
Foundation</hi> it hath the like abſurdity: For if <hi>Peter</hi> be the Foundation of the
whole Church, and the term <hi>[Foundation]</hi> imports the ruling of the whole
Church, <hi>Peter,</hi> who is a part of the Church, is the Foundation of himſelf,
and the Pope of himſelf, and ſith he is the Vicar of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he is in ſtead of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> to himſelf, and ſo hath preheminence over himſelf, and the Pope in like
manner; yea, unleſs they deny the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to have been one of <hi>Chriſt's</hi>
Sheep, they muſt aſſert <hi>Peter,</hi> and after him the Pope to have been the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Shepherd of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to have had a power to rule, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
and abſolve her. The truth is this, the preſſing of a Metaphor
beyond that for what it is uſed draweth with it many abſurdities; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Metaphors of <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>Building, Shepherd</hi> and <hi>Sheep</hi> can infer
no more than that uſe of theſe which the Authour of the Speech intended by
them, which what it is will be conſidered by examining the Texts brought for
proof. And for the Arguments, if they did conclude the thing in queſtion
they ſhould be thus framed, or to this purpoſe. <hi>He that is the Foundation or
Builder of the whole Church of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>hath ſupreme unerring dominion or rule
of the whole Church of</hi> Chriſt. <hi>But ſuch was</hi> Peter, <hi>and by conſequence the
Pope of</hi> Rome. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Again, <hi>He that is to feed all the Sheep of</hi> Chriſt <hi>hath
dominion or rule as aforeſaid. But that was</hi> Peter, <hi>and conſequently the Pope of</hi>
Rome <hi>is to do. Ergo.</hi> In both I ſhould deny the <hi>Major</hi> underſtood of the
under Foundation, Builder, and Shepherd, though it ſhould be yielded by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of an impoſſibility, yet he ſhould not have ſuch a ſupreme unerring
Rule thereby: and I deny the <hi>Minor</hi> alſo, and in both as they ſtand or ſhould
ſtand, there are many Propoſitions in theſe and his forms expreſſed or implied,
which are apparently falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As, 1. That every Foundation of the Church
hath preheminence of firmitude above every Building founded on it. There
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119447:87"/>
were ſome as firm in the Faith as the Apoſtles, and of the Apoſtles ſome as
firm or more firm than <hi>Peter.</hi> 2. That every Foundation or Builder of the
Church hath rule over it. 3. That the Metaphor of a Foundation or Builder
do note Rule or Dominion. 4. That as applied to <hi>Peter,</hi> they note in him
ſupreme unerring Rule or Dominion. 5. That he that is a Shepherd is Head
of his Flock. 6. That he is above his Flock. 7. That the perſon that is bid
to feed <hi>Christ's</hi> Sheep is bid to feed, the whole Flock of <hi>Chriſt</hi> univerſally taken.
8. That the charge of feeding them is as much, as have ſupreme dominion, be
a viſible Monarch over them. 9. That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Peter's</hi> Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
in that charge and power which <hi>Chriſt</hi> committed to him over his whole
Church. 10. That what is ſaid of <hi>Peter</hi> in this point is true of every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> be he never ſo unlearned and vicious. All which I have diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
noted, that it may appear upon how many ſuppoſitions the Popes Supremacy
hangs, and yet how looſe, and empty of proof from Scripture or Reaſon the
Diſputes of Papiſts are about this which is with them a fundamental point
of their Religion, in ſo much that were it not for the heavy curſe, that is befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Papiſts, that ſith they <hi>receive not the love of the truth, that they might be
ſaved, they ſhould believe Lyes, that they might be damned, 2 Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12.
it could not be that underſtanding perſons among them ſhould ever aſſent to
the claimed Supremacy of the Pope over the whole Church upon theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But let us view what is ſaid here.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is proved, becauſe the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſupporteth the reſt of the Building (we are built on the Foundation of the
Apostles and Prophets, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf being the chief Cornerſtone,
Epheſ. 2. 20.) and the Shepherd hath a power to govern his whole Flock.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Argument framed hence muſt be this, <hi>That which ſupporteth
the Building hath a preheminence of firmitude and ſtability before the reſt of
the Building which is founded on it. But ſo doth every Foundation. Ergo.</hi>
But the <hi>Major</hi> is not true of perſonal Metaphorical Foundations, of which we
now ſpeak, not of material proper Foundations. A man may be a Foundation
of a Common-wealth, and ſupport it by his wiſdom, and example, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and yet not have a preheminence of firmitude and ſtability above that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
founded on him or it; and ſo in the founding of the Church, a
man that founds it may fall away, and yet the Church ſtand firm. Neither is
the <hi>Minor</hi> true of every perſonal metaphorical Foundation, he may be ſaid to
be a Foundation, that is, begin a Church or Common-weath who doth not
after ſupport it. The Text <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. proves neither of the Propoſitions, nor
do I know to what purpoſe it is produced, except to prove <hi>Peter</hi> to have been a
Foundation: But then it proves not <hi>Peter</hi> alone, but the reſt of the Apoſtles
and Prophets to have been Foundations, and ſo proves no preheminence to
<hi>Peter</hi> above them, which is the Aſſertion of this Authour. But to me it is
doubtfull whether the Apoſtles are termed Foundations. 1. Becauſe this
ſeems to be appropriated to <hi>Chriſt, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 11. 2. Becauſe it is not ſaid, <hi>Ye
are built on the Foundations,</hi> but <hi>the Foundation,</hi> and therefore ſeems to have
this ſenſe, ye are built on that Foundation which the Apoſtles and Prophets
have laid, not, which they are, and ſo the genitives are of the efficient, not of
the ſubject, and the Foundation muſt be that Doctrine or truth they declared,
<hi>of which</hi> Chriſt, that is, the Doctrine or Faith of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>the chief Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</hi>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:119447:88"/>
Nor is this againſt that which is <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 14. that <hi>the names of the
twelve Apoſtles are written in the twelve Foundations of the Wall of the new
Jeruſalem.</hi> For that may be ſaid, becauſe they were chief workmen in the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Foundation, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. according to the
cuſtom of maſter-builders, whoſe names are written in their work, not becauſe
they were themſelves the Foundations, as the twelve Tribes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. in the
twelve gates, becauſe by them entrance was in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> they being
prime beginners of the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Yet if they be ſaid to be Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they were Foundations as the Prophets were, to wit, by their preaching:
nor doth their being Foundations prove their Rule or Dominion any more
than the Prophets being Foundations; and certainly <hi>Peter</hi> is here made no
more a Foundation than the reſt. The other proof ſeems to be this. <hi>He that
hath power to feed and govern his whole Flock is Head of his Flock, and above
his Sheep. But every Shepherd hath ſuch ſuch power. Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
A Pariſh-prieſt hath power to feed and govern his whole Flock, of
which a King may be a part, and yet he is not Head of the King, nor above
him in dignity or authority, nor perhaps in knowledge. And the like may
be ſaid of his Phyſician.</p>

                     <p>The Text Matth. 16. 18. proves not any Rule or Dominion in Peter over the
Apoſtles, but a promiſe of ſpecial ſucceſs in his preaching.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>H. T. adds, The Minor is proved, Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I
build my Church, St. Matth. 16. 18. (the whole was built on him.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> THe Argument ſeems to be this. <hi>He who is the Rock on which</hi> Chriſt
<hi>would build his Church he was next after</hi> Chriſt <hi>the Foundation of
the whole Church. But</hi> Peter <hi>was the Rock on which</hi> Chriſt <hi>would build his
Church. Ergo.</hi> In which there are theſe things ſuppoſed. 1. That the
term <hi>[Rock]</hi> is as much as a Foundation, and ſo it is not the abſolute quality
of firmneſs onely, but alſo the relative uſe of a ſtone or a rock in building,
which is imported by it. 2. That the term <hi>[Rock]</hi> notes <hi>Peter's</hi> perſon.
3. That it notes <hi>Peter's</hi> perſon alone. 4. That it notes <hi>Peter's</hi> perſon as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Rock ſo as no other, but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was a Rock as he was. 5. That the
Building upon this Rock notes <hi>Peter's</hi> perſon in reſpect of his ſingular Rule
not given to other Apoſtles. 6. That he was the Foundation next after
<hi>Chriſt.</hi> 7. That the Church comprehends the militant Church viſible.
8. That it notes the whole Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> even the Apoſtles themſelves: each
of theſe is to be examined. 1. The term [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] here uſed, whether it be
tranſlated <hi>[Rock</hi> or <hi>ſtone]</hi> I deny not to denote not ſo much the abſolute
property of ſtability, as the relative uſe of a foundation in a Building.
2. Though ſome of the Ancients make <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Rock, others the confeſſion
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the faith in him, which <hi>Peter</hi> had profeſſed, yet by reaſon of the
occaſion of the ſpeech, and the Preface <hi>[I ſay unto thee]</hi> and the commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of his Name <hi>[Thou art</hi> Peter] and the alluſion to that Name in the choice

                     </gap>, or <hi>Cephas</hi> in <hi>Syriack]</hi> I deny not that by <hi>[this Rock</hi> or
<hi>ſtone]</hi> is meant <hi>Peter's</hi> perſon, nor thirdly, that it notes his perſon alone, nor
fourthly, that it notes <hi>Peter's</hi> perſon in a ſingular manner, ſo as that there is
ſomething peculiar to <hi>Peter</hi> intimated thereby. But I deny, 1. That it
notes <hi>Peter's</hi> ſingular Rule or Dominion not given to other Apoſtles.
2. That he was ſo a Foundation next after <hi>Chriſt</hi> as that the other Apoſtles
were laid on him as a ſtone ſupporting them, as is the conceit of ſome of the
<hi>Romaniſts.</hi> 3. That the term <hi>[Church]</hi> notes the viſible Church as viſible.
4. That it notes the whole viſible Church univerſally taken. And each of
theſe I prove thus.</p>
                  <p>1. If the term <hi>[Rock</hi> or <hi>Stone]</hi> note <hi>Peter's</hi> perſon as becoming a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Foundation-ſtone by ſuch an act as notes not any Rule or Dominion,
and was common to other Apoſtles with <hi>Peter,</hi> then it doth not note <hi>Peter's</hi>
ſingular Rule or Dominion not given to other Apoſtles: but the term <hi>[Rock</hi>
or <hi>Stone]</hi> notes <hi>Peter's</hi> perſon, as becoming a Foundation or Foundation-ſtone
by ſuch an act as notes not any Rule or Dominion, and was common to
other Apoſtles with <hi>Peter. Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is of it ſelf evident. The
<hi>Minor</hi> is thus proved. That act whereby <hi>Peter's</hi> perſon became a Foundation
or Foundation-ſtone was <hi>Chriſt's</hi> building his Church on him. But that act
notes not any Rule or Dominion, and was common to other Apoſtles with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is of it ſelf evident. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The act whereby <hi>Chriſt</hi> built his Church on <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>Peter's</hi> preaching of
the ſame Doctrine which he profeſſed. But that act notes not any Rule or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
and was common to other Apoſtles with <hi>Peter. Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi>
I take for granted: Papiſts do not aſcribe Rule or Dominion to Friers that
preach, and other Apoſtles preached <hi>Chriſt</hi> as well as <hi>Peter.</hi> Now that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
builded his Church on <hi>Peter</hi> by his preaching is proved thus. That act by
which and no other the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be built, is that act whereby
<hi>Chriſt</hi> built his Church on <hi>Peter.</hi> But it is the preaching of the Doctrine
that <hi>Peter</hi> profeſſed and no other act by which the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to
be built. The <hi>Major</hi> is evident of it ſelf. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, 1. By
thoſe places which ſpeak of building the Church, they ſtill import teaching
not rule, as appears by an induction, <hi>Acts 9. 31. Rom 15. 20. 1 Cor.</hi> 8. 1, 10.
<hi>&amp; 10. 23. &amp; 14 4. 17. Gal. 2. 18. 1 Theſſ. 5. 11. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 5. and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
Verb uſed <hi>Acts 20. 30. 1 Cor. 3. 10, 12. Epheſ. 2. 20, 22. Col. 2. 7. Jude</hi> 20.
and the Noun <hi>Rom. 14. 19. &amp; 15. 2. 1 Cor. 3. 9. &amp; 14. 3, 5, 12. 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 8.
<hi>&amp; 12. 19. &amp; 13. 10. Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12, 16, 29. do all ſhew that the Building of the
Church or Saints is by inſtruction, not by rule, the work being ſometimes mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
as 1 <hi>Theſſ. 5. 11. Epheſ. 4. 10. Jude</hi> 20. and ſometimes the matter by which
the building is, being for informing and teaching, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 29. and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Builders are termed Teachers, as <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4. 11, 12. and that Text
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. (which <hi>H. T.</hi> allegeth) the Building being by Prophets as well
as Apoſtles can be underſtood of no other Building than by teaching, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo alſo muſt be underſtood <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18.</p>
                  <p>2. It is further proved from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. where the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
that <hi>as a wiſe Maſter-builder he had laid the Foundation,</hi> and that
<hi>Foundation which he laid was</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. he ſhews how
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119447:89"/>
that was, to wit, in that <hi>he was a Miniſter by whom with</hi> Apollos <hi>the</hi> Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<hi>believed,</hi> and that thereby they were <hi>God's Building,</hi> and <hi>God's Husbandry,
verſ.</hi> 9. to wit, by <hi>his planting,</hi> Apollos <hi>watering,</hi> and <hi>God's increaſe, verſ.</hi> 6.
which can be referred to no other acts but teaching or preaching of the faith of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> in which <hi>Paul</hi> counts himſelf <hi>a Maſter-builder,</hi> that <hi>built not on</hi> Peter<hi>'s
foundation,</hi> or any others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 20. and his <hi>edifying</hi> is there the effect of
his <hi>Evangelizing</hi> or <hi>Preaching the Gospel,</hi> and conſequently the building of
the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. muſt be interpreted to be by preaching the
Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>3. It is further proved by thoſe places which make the Foundation of the
Building ſpecial Doctrine, ſuch as are <hi>Heb. 6. 1. 1 Cor. 3. 11. Rom.</hi> 15. 20.
whence it follows, that the building of the Church is by Doctrine, and <hi>Matth.</hi>
16. 18. muſt be underſtood of it, not of Rule or Dominion. Yea, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 3. terms <hi>the Creed the firm and onely Foundation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail;</hi> and thereby intimates the
Foundation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. to be chief points of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>4. By the appoſiteneſs of the Phraſe to ſignifie planting and increaſing of
knowledge and ſtrengthening by teaching, not impoſing commands by way of
Rule or Empire. No where is a Prince ſaid to edifie, but Prophets, Apoſtles,
and other Teachers; nor is Excommunication, Ordination, calling of
Councils, and ſuch acts as ſhew Dominion termed Edification, but teaching
and reproving, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10. therefore ſuch princely power as the Popes claim
cannot be meant by building <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18.</p>
                  <p>5. The ſame may be proved from the matter of the Promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18.
which is not of what power <hi>Chriſt</hi> would give to <hi>Peter,</hi> but of what <hi>Chriſt</hi>
would do by him, and conſequently cannot be underſtood of ſupreme power,
but of ſingular work.</p>
                  <p>6. The end of the power, which the Pope claims, is for the exalting of
himſelf, and his viſible Monarchy, but the thing promiſed <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. is
not the advancement of <hi>Peter,</hi> but the uſe of him for ſetting up his Church.
The Popes power is (as all experience witneſſeth) for the deſtruction of the
Church, not for edification; and therefore is not meant <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18.</p>
                  <p>If any ſay, How then hath <hi>Peter</hi> ſomething ſingular aſcribed to him? I
anſwer, in that he did firſt begin to lay the Foundation of the Churches after
<hi>Christ's</hi> Aſcenſion by his preaching, as <hi>Acts 2. &amp; 3. &amp; 4. &amp;</hi> 10. appears:
and ſeems to be obſerved by <hi>Peter,</hi> as the accompliſhment of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Promiſe,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. 7. who uſed <hi>Peter</hi> at the firſt more eminently than any other, though
afterwards he choſe <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>did labour more abundantly than the reſt, 1 Cor.</hi>
15. 10.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſecond thing that <hi>Peter</hi> was not ſo a Foundation next after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as
that the other Apoſtles were laid on him, as a ſtone ſupporting them, is proved
1. From <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. where the building of the Church is ſaid to be <hi>on the
Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>himſelf being the chief
Corner-ſtone, in whom the whole Building compacted together groweth to an holy
Temple in the Lord;</hi> therefore the Apoſtles and Prophets have equal place in
the Building, and it is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not <hi>Peter, in whom all the Building is fitly
framed together.</hi> 2. From <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 14. where <hi>the Wall of the City of new
Jeruſalem</hi> is ſaid to <hi>have twelve Foundations,</hi> and not one ſingular one ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:119447:89"/>
the reſt, but the Foundations are as many as the Apoſtles, none of
whom is the Foundation of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>3. That the term <hi>[Church] Mat.</hi> 16. 18. notes not the viſible Church as viſible,
is proved, 1. In that it is termed <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Church, but the viſible as viſible is
not termed <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Church, but as it is inviſible by faith and <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Spirit
dwelling in it. 2. In that <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed, that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhould not
prevail againſt it.</hi> But they have and do prevail againſt the viſible Church as
viſible, many viſible Churches have been corrupted and periſh.</p>
                  <p>4. That <hi>[my Church, Matth.</hi> 16. 18.] is not the whole Church univerſally
taken is proved in that 1. Then the whole Church univerſally taken ſhould
be built by or on <hi>Peter,</hi> but that cannot be true, ſith a great part of the Church
ſpecially of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was built by <hi>Paul,</hi> and he denies he <hi>built on anothers
Foundation, Rom. 15. 20. 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 10. 2. Then <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be built on
himſelf, ſith <hi>Peter</hi> was part of the univerſal Church, and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
ſhould be built on <hi>Peter,</hi> which are abſurd.</p>
                  <p>Which things being evinced it appears, 1. That this was a Promiſe to the
ſingular perſon of <hi>Peter</hi> of a ſingular ſucceſs of his preaching which no other
had, and ſo belongs not to any Succeſſour. 2. That it is not a Promiſe of
Government and Juriſdiction, (in which <hi>H. T.</hi> placeth <hi>Peter's</hi> Headſhip,
<hi>pag.</hi> 75.) for that <hi>Chriſt</hi> expreſly forbade, but of ſingular honour to <hi>Peter</hi> in
his happy ſucceſs in preaching the Goſpel, recompenſing his readineſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<hi>Chriſt.</hi> And this <hi>Chriſt</hi> had elſewhere promiſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 10. under
the Promiſe of being <hi>a Fiſher of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n.</hi> Now this is nothing to the Dominion
claimed by the Pope. As for <hi>being a Rock on which the Church of</hi> Chriſt
<hi>might be built;</hi> we would moſt gladly it were true, that the Pope were ſuch,
we ſhould then honour him and kiſs his Toe: but as he is and hath been for
many hundreds of years, he is to be judged the Butcher who hath ſlain the
Saints of God, and a tyrannical <hi>Antichriſt</hi> domineering over the Church of
<hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I marvel that <hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith nothing here <hi>of the Keys of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
which the Pope is painted with, as having them in his hands, and by
which he was wont to claim his power. But perhaps he findes it too ſhort for
the proof of that peerleſs power which the Pope claims, ſith even in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi> and the <hi>Roman Catechiſm</hi> in handling the Prieſts and Biſhops
power of Abſolution, the Keys are in their hands, and ſo it is no more than
others have beſide the Pope: therefore I need not inſiſt on that here, ſith <hi>H. T.</hi>
hath thought fit to omit it.</p>

enjoyned to Apoſtles, Biſhops, or Presbyters, note teaching, not impoſing
Laws on perſons, excommunicating, depriving, and ſuch like acts, as Popes
claim as belonging to them as Paſtours, as may appear by viewing the places
<hi>Epheſ. 4. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3. Acts 20. 28, 29, 30, 31. Mark</hi> 6. 34.
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 25. and therefore if it prove Supremacy of Power, Juriſdiction, and
Government in <hi>Peter,</hi> it proves every Biſhop, and Presbyter to be alſo a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Head, and Governour over the Church of God. 2. That <hi>Peter</hi> had
no ſuch Headſhip of Government, and Juriſdiction given him in thoſe words
<hi>John</hi> 21. 17, 18. is proved by the deſcription of the perſons to whom theſe acts
of feeding were to done, they are <hi>the little Lambs</hi> and <hi>Sheep of</hi> Chriſt, not

any ſuch acts: but teaching them, being guides to them, directing, exhorting
and comforting them, (which the Pope regards not to do) were to be done to
them. Wherefore it is plain, that lordly rule was not appointed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but
fatherly care and tenderneſs in that injunction, and that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> enjoyned

thinks it his work; but another thing, to wit, princely dominion, which <hi>Chriſt</hi>
forbade. 3. The third thing ſuppoſed is, that becauſe the terms are indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
<hi>[my Lambs, my Sheep]</hi> therefore he meant all his Lambs and Sheep, even
the whole Catholick Church; which if true, then it is falſe which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,

<hi>Gal. 2. 10. they agreed that we ſhould remember the poor,</hi> that is, ſo many as we
could; and when <hi>Chriſt</hi> bids, <hi>Matth. 10. 8. Heal the ſick, cleanſe the lepers,
raiſe the dead;</hi> it is meant without exceeption of any, yet not an injunction
to heal every individual, or to raiſe every dead perſon, but ſuch as there was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of healing and raiſing. And when <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. the Apoſtles are bid <hi>to
preach the Gospel to every creature;</hi> the Command is to preach to any one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception, yet not to every individual, which had been impoſſible; ſo here
<hi>Peter</hi> is bid to feed any indefinitely, yet not all univerſally; which had been
an impoſſible task. 4. It is ſuppoſed that <hi>John</hi> 21. 16, 17. was a Commiſſion
conferring <hi>power, authority, rule, and that over the very Apoſtles themſelves,
and that as a privilege conferred on</hi> Peter <hi>for his ſpecial dilection of</hi> Chriſt.
Whereas the thing enjoyned him is work requiring skill and care, not dignity
or authority of empire, and hath nothing in it of juriſdiction, as a Judge or
Commander, but of faithfulneſs and diligence as a ſervant and guide. And in
this the Apoſtles were equal to him. <hi>H. T.</hi> himſelf confeſſeth here, <hi>pag.</hi> 97.
<hi>The Apoſtles were equal in their calling to the Apoſtleſhip;</hi> to which this of

been to bid him feed the Shepherds. The Doctrine of the Goſpel is not term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

muſt needs be greater than thoſe others in power and dignity. But St. <hi>Peter</hi> by
our Saviour's own appointment was to confirm the Apoſtles in the faith, and is
generally preferred before them all in the holy Scriptures, therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> was
above the reſt of the Apoſtles in power and dignity, and therefore the Head and
Primate of the reſt.</p>

Headſhip not proved. <hi>The power</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hart Conf. with Rainold, chap. 1. diviſ.</hi>
2.) <hi>which we mean to the Pope by this Title of Supreme Head is, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the whole Church throughout the World doth depend of him: in
him doth lie the power of judging and determining all Cauſes of Faith, of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Councils as Preſident, and ratifying their D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſuspending, or inflicting other Cenſures and Penalties on any that
offend, yea, on Princes and Nations; finally, of all things of the like ſort for
governing of the Church, even whatſoever toucheth either preaching of Doctrine
or practiſing of Diſcipline in the Church of</hi> Chriſt. Now a perſon may be
above others in power and dignity, yea, the Head and Primate of them, and
yet not have this power. The Lord Chief Juſtice of one of the Benches, the
Speaker of the Parliament, Chair-man of a Committee, Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi>
Preſident in a Council of Biſhops, the Head of a College, the Dean of a
Cathedral, may have power and dignity above other Juſtices of the ſame
Bench, over Counſellours in the ſame Council, over Knights and Burgeſſes in
the ſame Parliament, Prelates in the ſame Council, Fellows in the ſame Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
Canons in the ſame Chapter, and in a ſort Primates and Heads of the
reſt, yet not ſuch ſupreme Heads over the reſt, as the Popes claim to be. Yea,
notwithſtanding ſuch power, he may be limited ſo as that he cannot act without
them in making any Laws, or paſſing any Sentence binding, but they may
act without him, and legally proceed againſt him. So that the Concluſion
might be yielded; and yet the Popes Supremacy not proved. The truth is,
the Pope claims ſuch a vaſt and monſtrous power in Heaven, and Earth,
and Hell, as exceeds the abilities of any meer mortal man to diſcharge, and
is, as experience ſhews, the Introduction to a world of miſeries and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But let us view his proof of the power of <hi>Peter,</hi> which <hi>H. T.</hi> aſcribes
to him.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This doth not prove his <hi>Major,</hi> for a perſon may be weaker and leſs
worthy, and yet above others in power and dignity. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was a

Woman, and ſo weaker in reſpect of her Sex, and perhaps leſs worthy in reſpect
of parts than ſome of her great Commanders and Privy Counſellours. Will
<hi>H. T.</hi> ſay ſhe was below them in power and dignity? Many a Father and
Maſter may be weaker and leſs worthy, and yet ſuperiour in power and dignity.
Many a Prelate is ſtronger in knowledge and wiſdom, and more worthy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

<hi>Bennet</hi> the Boy, but alſo than <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond or any other of the beſt of their
Popes; and yet <hi>H. T.</hi> will not yield ſuch Prelates to be above Popes in power
and dignity. Me thinks he ſhould yield <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to be ſtronger and of more

he would be loath to aſcribe more power and dignity to them than to the Pope.
Nor is it true, that <hi>the ſtronger is not confirmed by the weaker,</hi> whether we
mean it of moral or natural ſtrength or weakneſs and confirmation. <hi>Apollos</hi>
was confirmed by <hi>Priſcilla, David</hi> by <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by <hi>[generally ſpeaking]</hi> be meant very frequently, is the ſpeech true, that <hi>the
more worthy is ſet before the leſs worthy.</hi> I think in the <hi>Acts of</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles
Barnabas</hi> is more often before <hi>Paul</hi> than after, as <hi>Acts 11. 30. &amp; 12. 25. &amp;</hi>

13. 2. whereupon they were ordained, and in the Decree of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi>
15. 25. <hi>Barnabas</hi> is firſt. Will <hi>H. T.</hi> ſay <hi>Barnabas</hi> was more worthy than
<hi>Paul?</hi> Me thinks a man ſhould be aſhamed to utter ſuch frivolous toys in ſo
weighty a matter, and fear to aſcribe to a ſinfull man ſo great and immenſe a

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Text doth not ſay, Confirm the Apoſtles in the faith, nor do
we finde that they did, but that he doubted as well as they, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 14. yea,
there is mention of another Diſciples believing the Reſurrection afore <hi>Peter,
John</hi> 20. 8, 9. yea, <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to have confirmed <hi>Peter</hi> in the faith, when <hi>he
walked not with a right foot according to the truth of the Gospel, Gal. 2. 14. &amp;
Acts 14. 22. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> are ſaid <hi>to confirm the ſouls of the Diſciples,</hi>
and <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did the ſame <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 32. So that this Act ſhewes no
Headſhip in <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any privilege at all, much leſs ſuch a ſupreme Headſhip
over the Apoſtles, as <hi>H. T.</hi> allegeth it for, but a common duty of charity,
which not onely may but muſt be done by an equal or inferiour, to an equal or
ſuperiour. Sure, if <hi>Paul</hi> had known of this as a Privilege in <hi>Peter</hi> he would
not have ſaid, that <hi>he went not up to the Apoſtles before him, nor conferred with

for <hi>his being preferred generally before the reſt,</hi> it is not proved by his being

Primacy of his Succeſſour the Pope of Rome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> THe proof of a Primacy is ſhort of the proof a Supremacy, which was
the thing <hi>H. T.</hi> undertook; there is a Primacy of order, where
there is not a Supremacy of power. And the ancient Churches which gave
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> the primacy of order afore the Patriarchs of <hi>Antioch, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,
Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that is, to ſit in a general Council higheſt,
and to have ſome other Privileges, yet did never acknowledge the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> their ſupreme Head, but reſiſted this claim, when it began to be uſurped.
That Primacy which was given to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was given him chiefly
becauſe of the dignity and power of the City: <hi>Peter's</hi> name was after by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Popes uſed to ſerve their Deſign in lifting up the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop. But
the Ancients did look to the eminence of the City, as being the Seat of the
Empire in their preferring of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops: from whence when the Seat
of the Empire was tranſlated to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Biſhop of it was made a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
equal to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for a time contended for prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
above him. It was not at firſt by reaſon of <hi>Peter's</hi> imagined Headſhip,
or any ſucceſſion to him, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was preferred before other
Patriarchs: but by reaſon of the amplitude and eminency of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the
third Canon of the ſecond <hi>Conſtantinopolitan,</hi> and the eight and twentieth of
<hi>Chalcedon</hi> Councils ſhew. As for Succeſſion to <hi>Peter</hi> it is contrary to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that the Apoſtles ſhould have Succeſſours as Apoſtles, ſith they were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be Apoſtles, who were Witneſſes of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Reſurrection, which neither
the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, nor any after the Age in which the Apoſtles lived, could be.
That they were either fixed Biſhops of certain places, or did appoint any to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in their Apoſtleſhip is falſe. All Apoſtles were by ſpecial election of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
thoſe that came after were by election of men, and ſucceeded the Apoſtles in
preaching the Goſpel, but not in Apoſtleſhip, nor did the Apoſtles make Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119447:92"/>
of certain places their Succeſſours, but every Paſtour, who preached the
faith aright, was their Succeſſour, and ſo are all Goſpel Preachers at this day.
<hi>John Calvin</hi> at <hi>Geneva</hi> did ſucceed <hi>Peter</hi> more truly than Pope <hi>Aldobrandin,</hi>
or <hi>Barberin,</hi> or <hi>Ghiſi,</hi> or any other of the Popes for many hundred of years.
Till the Popes prove themſelves Preachers of the Goſpel as <hi>Peter</hi> was, they
vainly talk of Succeſſion to him As of late they have been they have been
Succeſſours to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> rather than to <hi>Simon Peter.</hi>

the <hi>Areopagite's</hi> tale proved to be ſuch by Dr. <hi>John Rainold Conf.</hi> with
<hi>Hart, chap. 8. diviſ.</hi> 2. and from that place, in which the contrary, to what it is
alleged for, to wit, <hi>Peter's</hi> Supremacy, may be evinced, in that the Authour,
who ever he were, makes the power of binding and looſing to be given to all
the Apoſtles, There ſaith <hi>H. T.</hi> Peter <hi>is ſtyled the ſupreme and moſt ancient top
of Divines:</hi> which though it have no credit there, being too much known of
the forgeries and dreams in the Writings of <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> and that countefeit <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius:</hi>
yet were it granted, that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Arcopagite</hi> ſhould have ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as he ſaith he did, terming <hi>Peter, the ſupreme and moſt ancient top of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
this would not infer that he was the univerſal Paſtour of the Church
with ſuch a power of juriſdiction, as this Authour aſſerts he had over the
whole Church, even the Apoſtles themſelves. For this doth not expreſs ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of power, but of knowledge, and aſſerts his eminency for underſtanding
Theology, to which me thinks <hi>H. T.</hi> ſhould not annex the ſupremacy of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
and power, leſt that ſome ſuch as <hi>Aquinas, Andradius,</hi> or ſome other
challenge the Popedom, which is ſeldom conferred on any for his eminence in

though he were <hi>a man of great learning,</hi> was rejected, as not fit to be choſen
Pope; ſuch as <hi>Bellarmine, Tolet, Baronius,</hi> are not choſen to be Popes, but
ſuch crafty men as <hi>Paul</hi> the third, or ſuch ſtout ſpirits as <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, or
ſuch as are great Canoniſts and Politicians, that know the arts of the Papacy
better than the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are choſen for Popes, yea, men ſo ignorant
in Divinity, and ſo unfit to take the charge of Souls have been choſen for
Popes, that of all the Popes for many hundreds of years paſt there are but a
very few who had knowledge in the Myſtery of the Goſpel, or any meaſure of
godlineſs competent for a Pariſh Prieſt. Yea, <hi>Bellarmine lib. de notis Eccleſ.
cap.</hi> 9. is feigned to aſſert <hi>that there may be members of the body of</hi> Chriſt,
<hi>who are no parts of it as a living body, but onely as inſtruments,</hi> leſt otherwiſe
the Pope being proved evil ſhould be uncapable of being Head of the Church
in that he is no member of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> body, thereby making a dead equivocal
member an univocal Head of the univerſal Church, being conſcious that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

that ſhift the Popes would all or moſt of them be caſhiered out of the

by reaſon of their notorious pride, luxury, cruelty, perfidiouſneſs, covetouſneſs,

<hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Smyrna</hi> for the ſame end, but he means of the parts of the Weſtern

make the reſort to be to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> always, but becauſe at that time
there was a ſucceſſion of men that knew the Apoſtles, or had the Doctrine of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> delivered from them, among whom he reckons <hi>Linus</hi> as made Biſhop by

Apoſtles Doctrine about God the Creatour againſt <hi>Valentinus,</hi> and the rather,
becauſe he was acquainted with the Teachers there as he had been with <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus</hi>

ſpeaks of, whether it be meant of the Church or the State Eccleſiaſtical or
Civil it is uncertain; if of the Civil Principality, becauſe then it was the
Seat of the Empire, the neceſſity of reſort thither muſt be becauſe civil affairs
would enforce them to go thither upon other occaſions, and then they might
inform themſelves being there moſt commodiouſly; if of Eccleſiaſtical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality,
yet there is nothing that ſhews it meant of univerſal juriſdiction and
power over all Churches, but of a more powerfull Principality it had in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Doctrines and ordering Church-affairs in thoſe parts by reaſon of
the eminency of their Founders, and ſucceeding Teachers who were in
thoſe times of great note for purity of Doctrine and conſtancy in the Faith
for which they were Martyrs. And indeed were the queſtion now between
us and any ſuch as <hi>Valentinus</hi> or <hi>Marcion</hi> concerning the Doctrine which the
Apoſtles taught about another God beſides the Father of our Lord <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſuch Biſhops as then they had who had
acquaintance with the Apoſtles, or received their tradition from them ſo near
to the Apoſtles days as the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops did then, we ſhould alſo think it

But in ſo doing we ſhould not acknowledg a perpetual Prerogative of

nor did ever <hi>Irenaeus</hi> intend it, who is known to have oppoſed <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of

finde theſe words about the beginning of the Epiſtle, <hi>Nos autem qui Eccleſiae
unius caput &amp; radicem tenemus,</hi> that is, <hi>But we who hold the Head and Root of
one Church, &amp;c.</hi> in which <hi>Peter</hi> is not named, nor do I finde any thing that
ſhould infer that <hi>by the Head and Root of one Church,</hi> he means <hi>Peter</hi> but
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom in his Book <hi>of the Unity of the Church</hi> he makes <hi>the onely Head
of his Church,</hi> and having alleged immediately before <hi>one Baptiſm,</hi> as it is
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5. it is likely he meant by <hi>one Head</hi> the <hi>one Lord,</hi> mentioned <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.
as after alſo he mentions <hi>one Faith,</hi> or elſe the meaning is this, we have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the unity of the Church which is one, and the Head and Root of the
faithfull: of which ſeveral particular Churches are members and branches.
Nor, did he call <hi>Peter the Head and Root of the Church,</hi> would it be for <hi>H. T.</hi>
his purpoſe, unleſs he meant it in reſpect of univerſal Juriſdiction and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
over the whole Church belonging to him and his Succeſſours Biſhops of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which is not proved, and there may be another reaſon given of ſuch a
Title given to <hi>Peter's</hi> perſon onely, becauſe of his eminent confeſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi>
16. 16. and his preaching, <hi>Acts 2. &amp; 10, &amp;c.</hi> And though he term the
Church of <hi>Rome Peter's Chair,</hi> or rather the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Peter's</hi>
Doctrine and teaching there, yet that proves not he held the Popes Supremacy,
but that <hi>Peter's</hi> Doctrine was then held there. Yea, it is certain out of his
Treatiſe of <hi>the Unity of the Church,</hi> and his Epiſtle to <hi>Cornelius</hi> mentioned
before, and his oppoſition to Pope <hi>Stephanus,</hi> that <hi>Cyprian</hi> did account all
Biſhops equal, and the Biſhops of <hi>Africa</hi> equal in Juriſdiction to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Biſhop, and the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to be but his Collegue, from whom
he diſſents, and to whom he denied Appeals, and whom he reproved of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and pride, when he ſought to impoſe his Judgement on others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what <hi>Cyprian</hi> and a whole Synod of <hi>African</hi> Biſhops beſides <hi>Aſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
held, and therein oppoſed the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>Cyprian</hi> never acknowledged the Supremacy of the Pope now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>
                  <p>Of thoſe which <hi>H. T.</hi> allegeth in the fourth Age, not one of them giveth
<hi>Peter</hi> that Supremacy of Juriſdiction over the Apoſtles and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which
the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> claim as belonging to the Pope over all Biſhops and Churches,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:119447:94"/>
but either a primacy of order, or preheminence of gifts, or zeal, or eſteem, or
uſe in moderating in Aſſemblies. The words which ſeem to be moſt for it
are falſly aſcribed to <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> For however <hi>Trapezuntius</hi> have tranſlated
them, yet in the four and fiftieth Homily (as it is in <hi>Eaton</hi> Print) the words
are not as <hi>H. T.</hi> cites them, <hi>The Paſtour and Head of the Church was once a
poor Fiſherman.</hi> But on <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. he hath theſe words, <hi>And I ſay unto
thee, Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Stone or Rock I will build my Church, that is,
on the faith of confeſſion or confeſſed. There he ſhews that many ſhould believe,
and raiſeth up his minde, and makes him Paſtour.</hi> And after on <hi>verſ 19. Theſe

him, that they are againſt the principal grounds, by which they endeavour to
prove it, and therefore I will recite them at large.</hi> This <hi>(following</hi> Chriſt) the
Church doth, bleſſed by hope in this ſorrowfull life, of which Church <hi>Peter</hi> the
Apoſtle by reaſon of the Primacy of his Apoſtleſhip bare the perſon by a figured
generality. For ſo much as pertains to him properly he was one man by nature, by
grace one <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> by more abundant grace one and the ſame firſt Apoſtle.
But when it was ſaid to him, To thee will I give the Keys of the Kingdom of
Heavens, and whatſoever thou ſhalt binde on Earth ſhall be bound alſo in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on Earth ſhall be looſed alſo in the Heavens:
he ſignified the whole Church, which in this World is ſhaken with divers tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as it were ſhowres, flouds, and tempeſts, and falls not, becauſe it is founded
upon the Rock, from whence <hi>Peter</hi> alſo took his name: For the Rock is not called
from <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> from the Rock, <hi>Petrus a Petra,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not called
from a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For therefore, ſaith the Lord,
upon this Rock will I build my Church, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> had ſaid, Thou art <hi>Chriſt</hi>
the Son of the living God. Therefore he ſaith, Upon this Rock which thou haſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:119447:94"/>
confeſſed will I build my Church. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Rock upon which Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>Peter</hi> himſelf alſo was built. For no man can lay other Foundation beſides
that which is laid, which is <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The Church therefore which is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on <hi>Chriſt</hi> received from him the Keys of the Kingdom of Heavens in <hi>Peter,</hi>
that is, the power of binding and looſing ſins. For what the Church is by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, by ſignification, <hi>Peter</hi> in the Rock: by which ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is underſtood to be the Rock, <hi>Peter</hi> the Church. <hi>In which paſſage
though there are conceits not right, yet clear it is that</hi> Peter's <hi>primacy is here
aſſerted to be onely in this</hi> that he repreſented the whole Church, that the Rock on
which it is built is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he had his firſt Apoſtleſhip by more abundant
grace in that he was made a figure of the whole Church to ſignifie, its unity, that
in him the whole Church had the Keys of the Kingdom of Heavens, that is, the

commanding in ſtead of dominion <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 26. 27. Rather <hi>Miniſtery</hi> and
<hi>ſervice</hi> ſhews he would have none among them ſuperiour, but all equal.
7. <hi>Chriſt's</hi> propounding his own Example, <hi>Matth. 20 28. Mark 10. 45. Luke</hi>
22. 27. as that which they were to follow evinceth the ſame. And though it is
true he was <hi>their Maſter and Lord, John</hi> 13. 13. yet both there <hi>verſ</hi> 14, 15. and
here he propounds himſelf an Example onely in ſervice. 8. He expreſſeth
that which he would have them to be ſo emphatically, that he not onely forbids
that which all counted unlawfull, to wit, tyrannical rule, but alſo requires in
thoſe places ſuch a mutual debaſement, voluntary ſubjection, condeſcenſion,
Miniſtery yielding to each other as takes away all aſſuming of ſo much as was
lawfull in others, even the taking to themſelves priority of order or place, prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
ſeniority affected, empire or rule over one another, as the words <hi>Matth.</hi>
20. 26, 27. <hi>Mark 10. 43, 44. Luke</hi> 22. 26. do plainly ſhew. 9 This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by other places upon a like occaſion, <hi>Matth. 18. 1. 2 3 4. Mark</hi> 9. 33, 34,
35. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 46, 47. in which places <hi>Chriſt</hi> reſolves them that they ſhould <hi>be as
a little childe,</hi> that aſſumes not empire, but is humble and accounts others as
equal to him. 10. It is further evident from <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 28, 29. 30. that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
having forbidden Supremacy or ſuperiority in any of them among themſelves
doth promiſe them <hi>a Kingdom</hi> afterwards, and that then they ſhould <hi>be in his
Kingdom, and eat and drink at his Table, and ſit upon twelve Thrones judging
the twelve Tribes of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in recompenſe of their abiding with him in his
temptations.</hi> And in very truth, if there were no more than the conſideration
of the preſent ſtate of <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles their deſpiſed and perſecuted
condition and the future accidents that <hi>Chriſt</hi> foretold ſhould befall <hi>Peter</hi> in
particular, <hi>John</hi> 21. 28. and the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24 9. no man
could reaſonably imagine that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould make <hi>Peter</hi> a viſible Monarch to
rule the Apoſtles and the Church ſcattered over the World, he himſelf being
in priſon and they alſo, and in ſo remote places, he unknown to them, and they
to him, they having no acceſs or means of acceſs to him, nor knowing where
to finde him, but all judicious men muſt conceive that this device of <hi>Peter's</hi>
Supremacy over the Apoſtles and whole Church given by <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a meer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
forgery, as was after <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> donation to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by
which wicked means the Popes have uſurped the greateſt tyranny that ever was
in the World.</p>
                  <p>Out of all this I gather, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> intended, 1. That there ſhould be
no Kingdom, Monarchy, or Empire in any of the Apoſtles over the reſt, or
any part of the Church till he came; but that their ſtate ſhould be a ſtate of
ſervice in preaching the Goſpel, and laying the foundation of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> till
his coming. 2. That then he onely would be King, and they all equals, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon twelve Thrones with him; and therefore that he would make none
of them ſupreme Monarch over the reſt, nor Vicar to himſelf, as the Pope doth
blaſphemouſly and arrogantly challenge.</p>
                  <p>And for that which <hi>H. T.</hi> ſaith, <hi>that</hi> Chriſt <hi>expreſly mentions a greater and
a leſſer, a ſuperiour and inferiour among them,</hi> it is frivolouſly added, ſith it is
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:119447:96"/>
plain that what in <hi>Luke</hi> is <hi>verſ. 26. he that is greater, he that is chief,</hi> is in
<hi>Matthew 20. 26, 27. Mark 10. 43. He that would be great among you, he that
would be firſt,</hi> and that which is in <hi>Matth. 20. 26, 27. let him be</hi> in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.
43, 44. <hi>ſhall be your Miniſter, your ſervant,</hi> is in <hi>Luke 22. 26. Let him be as
the younger, as the Miniſter;</hi> which ſhews the meaning to be this, If any
affect to be as the elder, greater or ſuperiour to the reſt, be ſo far from aſcribing
or yielding to him ſuch precedency, greatneſs, or ſuperiority, that my will is,
that you ſhould account of him as the younger, Servant and Miniſter to the
reſt, and ſo it ſhall be, ye ſhall be all equal, none above another. This is the
very drift and purport of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> determination, that there ſhould be no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
or inferiority among them, but an equality; and that which <hi>H. T.</hi>
ſpeaks of the mention of ſuperiority and inferiority is meant of ſuperiority that
might be affected, but not of any ſuperiority allowed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it being plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forbidden.</p>
                  <p>And for what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> urgeth from the term <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had
appointed one Ruler or Prince in the College of the Apoſtles, though the term
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a Leader,</hi> is not the ſame with <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a Prince,</hi> or Ruler, yet
if it did note Princedom, it is manifeſted, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks of a Prince
among them not by due conſtitution, but by inordinate uſurpation; and
therefore to infer from thence, as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have one ſuperiour over the
reſt, when he determines there ſhould be equality, is the act of a man that is
reſolved to be luſtily impudent. By this whole diſcourſe the Objection is fully
vindicated againſt the ſhifts of <hi>H. T.</hi> and other <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and ſtands thus.
That Supremacy is not to be yielded to have been granted to <hi>Peter</hi> which
<hi>Chriſt</hi> forbade to every one of the Apoſtles. But to be a ſupreme Ruler over
the reſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> forbad to every one of the Apoſtles; therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> forbad
<hi>Peter</hi> to be a ſupreme Ruler over the reſt of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>I yet add, that were it granted, <hi>that</hi> Chriſt <hi>did onely forbid ſpiritual Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
to lord it over Inferiours,</hi> this very grant would prove the Papal Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which Popes claim and exerciſe, to be certainly forbidden. For if ever
there were a Superiour, that did lord it over Inferiours, the Pope is ſuch a one,
yea, I may aver and eaſily prove it, that let all the tyranny and lording, which
any Tyrants or Princes have exerciſed from the beginning of the World to
this day be conſidered, they will be found incomparable to the Papal tyranny
and lording over the Church of God. If this be not the higheſt lording to
impoſe on mens conſciences ſuch Laws as <hi>Chriſt</hi> never impoſed, to enjoyn the
holy, as they term it, inquiſition with rigour, to excommunicate, deprive,
burn men and women old and young who yield not to the Popes Laws,
though contrary to <hi>Chriſt's,</hi> to take on him to diſpenſe with Gods Laws, to
challenge the defining of all controverſies, ſupremacy over all Councils, power
to depoſe and deſtroy Emperours and Kings, if they acknowledge not his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
power, yea, if they be not his Butchers to kill their beſt and moſt peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Subjects, if he once term them Hereticks, to interdict a whole State for
limiting by Law Donations to Eccleſiaſticks, and impriſoning notorious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours,
who were Eccleſiaſticks, the uſe of divine ſervice, to ſubject a King
to whipping on the Bare for the death of an Eccleſiaſtick not by him killed,
to depoſe Emperours for inveſting Biſhops, to canonize Saints, whom he will,
to be invocated even ſuch an one whoſe holineſs was diſobedience to his lawfull
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:119447:96"/>
Prince, and to have a Feaſt proper to him, beſides innumerable other acts done
againſt the Laws of God and Man I do utterly deſpair ever to know what it is
to lord or tyrannize over others. Surely it is eaſier to praiſe <hi>Buſiris,</hi> or to
juſtifie <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to acquit them from
lording, than the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for many hundreds years laſt paſt, if we
ſtand to the Relations of Writers of their own Church, who ſpeak too favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
of them.</p>
                  <p>H. T. <hi>proceeds. Object. Chriſt</hi> is the foundation (of the church) and
other foundation can no man lay, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 11. Anſw.</hi> Other principal founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can no man lay, I grant, other ſubordinate, I deny: for that he himſelf

St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. and the reſt of the Apoſtles were built on the foundation of
them all, although not equally, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
                  <p>I reply, when it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Foundation of the Church, and other
Foundation can no man lay, it is meant of a principal Foundation not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
a ſubordinate. But ſith the term <hi>[Foundation]</hi> as hath been proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this Article, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2, 3. as applied to the Apoſtles doth not note ſettling or
upholding by rule or dominion, but by teaching, the Papiſts who aſcribe to the
Pope ſuch a Supremacy and Infallibility in teaching, as is proper to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> do
lay another principal Foundation beſides <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> not ſubordinate, but
coordinate to him. Which that they do is proved by two things, which are
aſcribed by them to the Pope either by himſelf or with his Council.</p>
                  <p>1. That they can alter the plain expreſs precepts of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as namely in
determining, that it is not neceſſary that other faithfull people beſides the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
Prieſt ſhould drink the Wine in the Euchariſt, though the precept of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is as expreſs for all the faithfull drinking of it, as it is for their eating
of the Bread, and that it is not lawfull for a Prieſt to marry, though the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
expreſly ſaith, <hi>Marriage is honourable in all men, Heb.</hi> 13. 4.</p>
                  <p>2. In enjoyning under pain of Hereſie, Excommunication, and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
things to be believed, and practiſed, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> never enjoyned to be
believed or practiſed, as namely, Tranſubſtantiation, the unbloody Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Sacrifice, properly ſo called in the Maſs, Purgatory Fire, confeſſion of all
a perſons known ſins into the ears of a Prieſt, the keeping of the Vow of a
Monaſtick profeſſion, when the perſon cannot contain, and to live an idle
begging life, when the perſon is able to work, and hath no other imployment,
nor pretends to any, which is uſefull to men, beſides praying, which is the
common duty of all <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Now ſurely he that takes on him to alter
<hi>Chriſt's</hi> commands, and to put his own in ſtead thereof doth make himſelf
the principal Foundation equal to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is contrary to <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi>
3. 11. and to <hi>Chriſt, Matth.</hi> 23. 8, 11. and ſo makes himſelf a Foundation co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate,
as indeed more than <hi>Chriſt,</hi> however he pretend himſelf the Vicar of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the authority of the Church for his Warrant. As for that which is
ſaid of <hi>Peter</hi> here, it was anſwered before, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2, 3. that it doth not import
any Rule or Dominion, but ſome peculiar ſucceſs in his preaching, beſides
what others had, which was but a perſonal preheminence derivable to no Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour,
much leſs to the rank of <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops in theſe laſt Ages, who never
build the Church by preaching, but pull down Princes, and oppreſs thoſe that
would build up <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Church. Yet it is obſervable, that he allegeth <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:119447:97"/>
to prove that <hi>the reſt of the Apoſtles were built on the foundation of them all
though not equally,</hi> when the Text doth not at all mention the Apoſtles being
built on the Foundation, but the <hi>Epheſian</hi> believers, nor are the <hi>Epheſian</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ſaid to be built on them unequally, on <hi>Peter</hi> as the ſupreme, on others
after him, but <hi>on them</hi> all without any difference, and not onely on them, but alſo

                  <p>It is added thus by H. T. Object. St. Cyprian (de unit. Eccleſ.) ſays, The
Apoſtles were equal in dignity. And St. Hierome affirms the church was
equally founded on them all, lib. cont. Jovin. Anſw. They were equal in
their calling to the Apoſtleſhip I grant, in their power of Government and
Juriſdiction I deny: And the church was equally founded on them all before
a Head was conſtituted, I grant; after a Head was constituted, I deny, and
ſo do the Fathers, St. Cyprian ſaying in the ſame place, that Chriſt
dispoſed the origen of unity beginning from one (Peter) And St. Hierome

                  <p>I Reply, <hi>Cyprian's</hi> words in his Book <hi>de unitate Eccleſia,</hi> are recited above
<hi>Art. 5. Sect.</hi> 6. in which he expreſly ſaith thus, <hi>Hoc erant utique &amp; caeteri

had no more power and honour than other Apoſtles; and for Biſhops he ſaith
preſently after, <hi>Epiſcopatus unus eſt cujus a ſingulis in ſolidum pars tenetur,</hi> that
is, <hi>Biſhoprick is but one, of which wholly or entirely a part is held by each.</hi>
Which words plainly ſhew this to be his meaning, 1. That the Epiſcopacy
or charge of looking to the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is but one and the ſame in all
the World, even as the Church Catholick is but one and the ſame. 2. That
each Biſhop hath but his part, none the whole, none is an univerſal Biſhop over
the whole Church. 3. That each Biſhop, who hath his part, holds it <hi>in ſolidum,</hi>
that is, <hi>wholely</hi> or <hi>intirely,</hi> the power and charge is as much in one as another.
4. That Epiſcopacy was firſt inveſted in <hi>Peter</hi> for all, that Epiſcopacy might
be one, and undivided, and the Church one, ſo as that no Church break from
another, nor any Biſhop be above another.</p>
                  <p>As for the words of <hi>Hierome, lib. 1. adverſ. Jovin.</hi> they are thus. <hi>At dick,

Marriage) <hi>upon</hi> Peter (a married man) <hi>the church is founded, although that
thing in another place is done upon all the Apoſtles, and all receive the Keys of
the Kingdom of Heavens, and equally upon them the ſtrength of the church is

the occaſion of Schiſm might be taken away.</hi> In which words it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
that he makes the other Apoſtles equally Foundations of the Church
with <hi>Peter,</hi> and to have the Keys of the Kingdom of Heavens, and terms
<hi>Peter</hi> not a Head in reſpect of Power or Juriſdiction over the reſt, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Order, that for want of it no occaſion of Schiſm might be. Which
to have been the minde of <hi>Hierome</hi> appears fully in his Epiſtle to <hi>Euagrius,</hi> in
which he determines that <hi>in the Scripture Biſhops and Elders were the ſame,
that</hi> Peter <hi>calls himſelf a fellow-elder, and</hi> John <hi>an Elder, but after one was
choſen who might be ſet before the reſt, that was done for a Remedy of Schiſm,
leſt each one drawing to himſelf the church of</hi> Chriſt <hi>might break it.</hi> And
then he makes the Church and Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> equal with other Churches

<hi>or at</hi> Rhegium, <hi>or at</hi> Alexandria, <hi>or at</hi> Tanis, <hi>he is of the ſame merit, and of the
ſame Prieſthood. Power of riches, and humility of poverty, makes a Biſhop nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
higher nor lower. But all are Succeſſours of the Apoſtles.</hi> Whence theſe
things may be inferred, 1. That Biſhops are not above Elders originally.
2. That their ſuperiority is by poſitive order. 3. That the Apoſtles were
Elders. 4. That all Biſhops are their Succeſſours. 5. That the Biſhop of

                  <p>I reply, to make a thouſand metaphorical ſubordinate miniſterial Heads of
the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be without monſtroſity. But to make a ſupreme
viſible Head over the whole Church, aſcribing to him ſuch a power as agrees
to none but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor can be exerciſed by any but <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the good of his
body, hath monſtroſity in it, or rather treaſon againſt <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But ſuch a
Head is the Pope made by <hi>H. T.</hi> therefore this conceit of him and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
induceth monſtroſity. The <hi>Minor</hi> is partly ſhewed before, and may be

what the whole Church is to believe, what is the ſenſe of Scripture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Appeals from all places, judging cauſes, ſetting up and putting down

other Apoſtles but he. You ſee in what ſenſe he rejects the word (Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.)</p>
                  <p>I reply, <hi>Gregory</hi> not onely rejected the Title of <hi>Univerſal Arch-biſhop</hi> or
<hi>Patriarch,</hi> but alſo rejected it as <hi>proud, wicked, perverſe, profane, blasphemous,</hi>
aud the Uſurper of it as <hi>a Fore-runner of</hi> Antichriſt, and not onely as not
agreeing to the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but alſo as not agreeing to him or
any of his Predeceſſours, <hi>lib. 6. Epiſt. 24. &amp; lib. 4. Epiſt. 32. &amp; 36. None of
my Predeceſſours conſented to uſe this profane name of Univerſal Biſhop: none
of my Predeceſſours ever took upon him this name of ſingularity, neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to uſe it. We</hi> (the Biſhops of <hi>Rome) do not ſeek nor yet accept this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Title being offered unto us.</hi> Nor in the ſenſe onely as <hi>H. T.</hi> denies it due
to the Pope, as if it excluded all others from being Biſhops, but even in the
ſenſe in which the Pope now uſurps it. For, 1. He rejects it in the ſenſe
in which <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did affect it. But he did not affect it as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
aſſuming to himſelf to be the onely Biſhop, but the ſupreme, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
1. In that a Synod of the <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhops did agree to give it him,
<hi>Habita Synodo ſeipſum Patriarcham univerſalem creaſſet,</hi> that is, <hi>Holding a
Synod he had created himſelf univerſal Patriarch, Platina</hi> in the Life of Pope
<hi>Gregory.</hi> But doubtleſs the Synod would not give him the Title as importing
him the onely Biſhop, for then they ſhould have unbiſhopt themſelves, which
neither he nor they did. 2. <hi>Gregory</hi> when he chargeth him with his arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that Title to himſelf tells <hi>John</hi> himſelf, <hi>lib. 4. Epiſt</hi> 38. that <hi>he ſought
this Title that he might ſeem to be under none, and he alone before all, that be
endeavoured that by the appellation of univerſal Biſhop he might put under him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
all the members of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>that he deſired to be called in the World not onely
the Father, but alſo the general Father, that he deſired by that word of elation
to put himſelf before Biſhops, and to hold them under him,</hi> which ſhews he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
not to be accounted the onely Biſhop, but the ſupreme. 3. He affected
no more than what after <hi>Boniface</hi> the third of <hi>Rome</hi> obtained of <hi>Phocas,</hi> as
appears by the words of <hi>Platina</hi> in the Life of <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, who ſpeaks
thus. Boniface <hi>the third a</hi> Roman <hi>by countrey obtained from</hi> Phocas <hi>the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
yet with great contention, that the See of bleſſed</hi> Peter <hi>the Apoſtle,
which is the Head of all churches ſhould be both ſo called and accounted by all:
which place indeed the Church of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>endeavoured to challenge to it,
ſometimes evil Princes favouring, and affirming that in that place ſhould be the
firſt See where the Head of the Empire was.</hi> And <hi>Baronius Annal. Eccleſ.</hi>
at the year 606. relates the Decree of <hi>Phocas</hi> thus, <hi>that the</hi> Roman <hi>Biſhop
alone ſhould be called oecumenical or univerſal, but not the</hi> Conſtantinopolitan.
And <hi>Bellarmine lib. 2. de Pontif. Rom. cap.</hi> 31. ſaith, <hi>They would equal the
See of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>to the</hi> Roman, <hi>and make it univerſal,</hi> ſpeaking of the
<hi>Greeks</hi> in the buſineſs of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> whence it may be plainly
gathered, that the thing which the Patriarchs of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> affected, was
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:119447:98"/>
not to be accounted the onely Biſhop, ſo as that none but he ſhould be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a biſhop, but that he ſhould be the Head or Supreme of all Biſhops by reaſon
of the Seat of the Empire there, and that this <hi>Gregory</hi> diſclaimed as proud.
4. That was affected by <hi>John,</hi> which he and <hi>Cyriacus</hi> his Succeſſour uſed for
twenty years, but neither of them uſed it ſo by word or deed, as to exclude
others from being Biſhops as well as themſelves (for in <hi>John's</hi> own writing to
them extant in the body of the <hi>Romam Greek</hi> Law, he terms them fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
Metropolitans, and Biſhops, to whom he writes, and others in their
Writings to the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when they term him oecumenical
Arch-biſhop, yet ſtyle themſelves Biſhops and fellow-prieſts) but they would
be accounted ſupreme or prime Biſhops of the whole Church, ſo as to be under
none, but above all.</p>
                  <p>2. It is proved that <hi>Gregory</hi> rejected the Title of Univerſal Biſhop in the
ſenſe of the ſupreme Biſhop, in that he, <hi>Regiſt. lib. 11. Epiſt.</hi> 54. reſolves thus
<hi>If any man accuſe a Biſhop for whatſoever cauſe, let the cauſe b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> judged by his
Metropolitan. If any man gainſay the Metropolitan's judgement, let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Arch-biſhop and Patriarch of that Dioceſe, and let him end it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Canons and Laws.</hi> And for what he addeth, that <hi>if a Biſhop have
no Metropolitan nor Patriarch at all, then is his cauſe to be heard and determined
by the See Apoſtolick, which is the Head of all Churches,</hi> it is added beyond the
Canons of Councils and Laws of Emperours, and though it prove that he
claimed a reference of cauſes in difference between Biſhops within his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate,
yet not where there were other Patriarchs to which the Biſhops were
ſubject, much leſs through the whole World. And that he termeth <hi>the See of</hi>
Rome <hi>the Head of all Chuches,</hi> doth not prove a Supremacy of Government
by any inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but a preheminence of order and ſome Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Privileges, by reaſon of that Cities being the Seat of the Empire. And
hereby is underſtood what <hi>H. T.</hi> cites out of the ſeventh Book <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 62. of
<hi>Greg.</hi> Epiſtles, <hi>Indict.</hi> 2. that it is not meant of all Biſhops univerſally, but
of the Biſhops within that Patriarchate, but this was in caſe of fault onely;
for it follows, <hi>But when no fault requires it, all according to reaſon of humility
are equals:</hi> So that <hi>Gregory</hi> doth not by that ſpeech ſhew that he had an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
ſupreme Juriſdiction and power over all Churches, ſo as that they were
ſubject to his commands and deteminations in points of faith, but that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the <hi>African</hi> Churches ſubject to his reproof, as he had a common care
of the Church every where, in which <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf and all other Biſhops
and Churches are ſubject to any Biſhop whereſoever. Certainly <hi>Gregory</hi> had
moſt abſurdly argued againſt the arrogance of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> calling
the Title of <hi>univerſal Biſhop</hi> new, <hi>profane, proud, blasphemous, fooliſh, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,</hi>
and him <hi>a Fore-runner of</hi> Antichriſt <hi>whoſoever ſhould uſe it,</hi> if he had
imagined it belonged to himſelf, or any Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for what <hi>H. T.</hi> allegeth, that <hi>John claimed to be univerſal Biſhop, as
excluding all others,</hi> it is but an abſurdity which <hi>Gregory</hi> preſſed him with, as
following upon it, not acknowledged by <hi>John,</hi> but rather denied, as when we
urge men with abſurdities following their tenets which they do not own; and
how he urgeth, it appears from his words, <hi>lib. 4. Epiſt.</hi> 38. when he ſaith to
John, <hi>Thou deſireſt to tread under the name of Biſhops in compariſon of thy ſelf,</hi>
which ſhew that he charged him not to have affected the Title of Univerſal
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:119447:99"/>
Biſhop, as if he would be the onely Biſhop abſolutely, but comparatively to
himſelf, in that ſenſe as he which is ſingular in ſome thing is ſaid to be alone,
and as he who is not what he was, is ſaid not to be; and ſo <hi>Gregory</hi> chargeth
him as if by conſequence he would exclude all others, and unbiſhop them in
compariſon. And yet if <hi>Gregorie's</hi> words were underſtood to condemn no
more than this, that any ſhould arrogate to himſelf the Title of Univerſal Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
as if he were the onely Biſhop and others but as his Vicars or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes,
all that <hi>Gregory</hi> imputes to the uſe of that Title in this ſenſe falls
on the late <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, who deny that any Biſhop hath power of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
but from them, that Biſhops are not immediately by divine right,
but mediately from the Pope, concerning which what paſſed in the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi> may be ſeen in the Hiſtory of Frier <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſeventh and eighth Book,
in which may be ſeen how ſtifly the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> held it, and the Pope
eluded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that <hi>Gregory</hi> did diſclain ſuch a Supremacy as Popes now uſurp is
manifeſt from the obedience which <hi>Gregory, lib. 1. Epiſt. 32 lib. 2. Epiſt.</hi> 61. 31.
<hi>lib. 7. Epiſt.</hi> 1. and elſewhere acknowledged, he did ow to <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

ever approved by the Pope, though it owned the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to
be the See Apostolick, and ſought but Primacy in the ſecond place and
after it.</p>
                  <p>I reply, 1. Though it had been gainſaid by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet
there was no reaſon the oppoſition of one Biſhop ſhould weigh down the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conſent of the reſt. 2. It is apparant that the Popes approbation was
not then judged neceſſary, but that the Synod could determine without him.
3. That Canon of the firſt Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was not gainſaid by
the Pope that then was, nor many years after. 4. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great eſteemed
the four firſt general Councils as the four Goſpels without exempting that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.

notwithſtanding the regret of the Popes Legates, who could not obtain any

<hi>Greek</hi> Text ſaith, Becauſe to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> alſo this is accuſtomed, which
argues him to be above the other.</p>
                  <p>I reply, this Anſwer is frivolous, or rather impudent. For the ſame thing
is allowed to the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which was accuſtomed to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> but that was not a power to permit any thing to the biſhops of <hi>Egypt,
Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> but to take care of the Churches therein as their Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan,
namely, to look to the Ordination of biſhops and compoſing of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.
And the meaning is, that each of thoſe biſhops of <hi>Rome, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
and <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſhould, according to the cuſtome of the biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in his,

the Canon, and the <hi>Arrbick</hi> and other Interpreters, and <hi>Paſchaſinus</hi> the

                     <hi>power over all, becauſe ſo it was accuſtomed to
the Biſhop of</hi> Rome. Which cannot be meant of all ſimply; For then it
ſhould have been thus meant, the biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> is to have power of all,
becauſe the biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath power of all, and ſo the biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi>
ſhould be ſupreme biſhop as the Pope, and ſo in ſtead of one viſible ſupreme
Head there ſhould be more, which <hi>Romaniſts</hi> brook not, but it muſt be meant
of equal power and charge given to the biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in his Province
with that which by cuſtome the <hi>Roman</hi> had in his. And for the inference
from the words <hi>[Becauſe to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>alſo this is accuſtomed] that it
argues him to be above the other,</hi> it is vain, it proving onely the biſhop of
<hi>Rome's</hi> power to have been the Pattern of the biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> his power,
but not greater, yea, it proves an equality between them, ſith it aſcribes the

I Reply, that the Emperours called the firſt General Councils, it is ſo manifeſt

it; <hi>that they called them inſtrumentally,</hi> (meaning doubtleſs as the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments)
is ſo far from truth, that the Popes ſought to the Emperours to call
them, as <hi>Leo Epiſt.</hi> 24. 26. 23. and in the ſixth General Council at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>

that the calling of perſons to meet to conſult of matters of Religion to be
a point of ſpiritual Juriſdiction, who ever he be that calls them, whether Pope
or Emperour: calling an Aſſembly is no part of Juriſdiction at all, it may be
lawfully done by a brotherly invitation in many caſes, and the Aſſembly may
be by agreement without any ſuperiority. Nor is there any ſpirituality in it,
except in reference to the end, which doth not make it an act of ſpiritual Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
any more, than a Fathers, or Mothers, or Maſters, cauſing ſervants or

It may mean, they will defend their Prince who is their Prince, yet

and otherwiſe duly to proceed againſt them, and to puniſh them, as much as
juſtice ſhall perſwade, if they ſhall refuſe ſtifly to revoke their Errours, although

otherwiſe would not have come: nor doth he that ſo promiſeth, when he hath

being in this tenet no better than blaſphemous <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> flattery, aſcribing
to ſome of the worſt and oftentimes moſt ignorant men that which is due to

                  </argument>
                  <p>H. T. intitles his eighth Article of Apoſtolical Tradition, and ſaith, Our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
is, That the true Rule of Chriſtian Faith is Apoſtolical Tradition, or a
delivery of Doctrine from father to ſon, by hand to hand, from Chriſt and his
Apoſtles, and nothing ought to be received as Faith, but what is proved to
have been ſo delivered, which we prove thus.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Argument. That is now the true Rule of Faith which was the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
means of planting and conſerving it at firſt: But oral and Apoſtolical
Tradition, not written Books, was the eſſential means of planting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
it at firſt; therefore oral and Apoſtolical Tradition not written Books
is the true Rule of Faith. The Major is proved, becauſe the Rule of Faith
muſt be immutable, and the ſame in all Ages, as the Faith it ſelf is. The
Minor is proved, becauſe the firſt Gospel was not written till eight years after
the Death of Chriſt or thereabouts; in which ſpace the Apoſtles had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and planted the Faith of Chriſt in many Nations over almoſt all the
World. Add to this that many Ages were paſſed before all the Books of
Scripture were disperſed and accepted for Canonical by the whole Church; ſo
that when any difference aroſe in points of Faith among the Chriſtians of
the firſt Age they were not to inquire what had been written, but whether the
Apoſtles ſo taught.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw</hi> THis Doctor, whether it be by reaſon of his ignorance, or
heedleſneſs, or malignity to the holy Scriptures, determines
worſe than his fellows, yea, againſt the Doctrine of the <hi>Trent</hi>
Council and Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourths Bull. For whereas in
the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 4. it is ſaid, that <hi>the truth and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline
of</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his Apoſtles is contained in written Books and Traditions
without writing,</hi> and would <hi>have both to be received with equal affection and
reverence of piety;</hi> and Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth his Bull requires <hi>the admiſſion of
the ſacred Scripture and Apoſtolical Tradition. H. T.</hi> concludes, <hi>that written
Books are not the true Rule of Faith, but oral and Apoſtolical Tradition.</hi> If he
had ſaid, they had not been the entire Rule of Faith he had agreed with the
<hi>Trent</hi> Council, and the Popes Bull; but now he contradicts them as well as
the Proteſtants, and his Argument doth as well conclude, that the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is no part of the Rule of Faith, as that it is not the whole. But leaving
him to be corrected by his fellows, let's view his Diſpute.</p>
                  <p>Setting aſide his non-ſenſe ſpeech of being <hi>received as Faith,</hi> in ſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
received as the object of Faith, and taking <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition</hi> to be
meant of that which is truly ſo called, I grant his Tenet, and ſay with him
that <hi>the true Rule of</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Faith is Apoſtolical Tradition,</hi> that is, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which the Apoſtles delivered, or that <hi>delivery of Doctrine from father to
ſon, by hand to hand, from</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his Apoſtles, and that nothing ought to be
received as Faith,</hi> that is, a thing to be believed with a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> divine Faith,
which all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are bound to believe, <hi>but what is proved to have been ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi>
For though in general any divine revelation is to be the object of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Faith by whom or what way ſoever it be delivered, and God hath delivered
divers revelations in the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which are objects of Faith,
yet ſith now <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apoſtles have delivered thoſe divine revelations as
the oracles of God, and what the Apoſtles preached and thought needfull for
us to know, and believe to ſalvation is written, and theſe Writings are conveyed
from father to ſon by hand to hand, we grant the Tenet being meant of them,
and yield further, that if they can prove there are Traditions truly Apoſtolical
beſides thoſe which are written, and this Tradition, that thoſe <hi>Books</hi> which
we call holy Scripture are divine Writings, we will embrace them as things to
be believed. But then, 1. We ſay it is manifeſt that in the Apoſtles days
there were Traditions put on the Apoſtles which were not theirs, 2 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 2. 1.
2. That the Apoſtolical Tradition written is ſufficient for faith to ſalvation.
3. That unwritten Traditions are uncertain, and much corrupted. 4. That
there is no certain Rule to know which are Apoſtolical Traditions but by the
Scripture or Apoſtolical Writings. 5. That neither the Popes nor Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> nor general Councils determination is a ſufficient aſſurance of Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Tradition unwritten. 6. That therefore to us now the holy Scripture is
the onely Rule of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith and life. And to the Argument of <hi>H. T.</hi>
I anſwer, 1. By denying the <hi>Major,</hi> giving this as a Reaſon, becauſe the
means of planting and conſerving faith, though it were the eſſential means,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119447:103"/>
yet is not the rule of faith neceſſarily, there being great difference between
theſe two. The means of faith is any way God uſeth to beget it, as by
dreams, viſions, the ſpeech of <hi>Balaam's</hi> Aſs, his Prophecy, <hi>Caiaphas</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
the Star which guided the Wiſe-men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. the Wives good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. yet theſe are not the Rule of Faith, but the divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
it ſelf. And if it were ſuppoſed any one of theſe, or any other, were the
eſſential means of Faith, that is, that means by which Faith is, and without
which it were not, yet it were not therefore the Rule of Faith, but the divine
revelation or truth delivered by that means. And to the proof of the <hi>Major</hi>
which ſeems to be thus formed, <hi>That is the true Rule of Faith which is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and the ſame in all Ages, as the Faith it ſelf is. But the eſſential means
of planting and conſerving it at firſt is immutable, and the ſame in all Ages, as
the Faith it ſelf is. Ergo.</hi> I anſwer, 1. By denying the <hi>Major,</hi> there are
many things immutable, and the ſame in all Ages, as the Faith it ſelf is, and
yet are not the true Rule of Faith, as namely, Gods Decrees and purpoſes,
the being of the Heavens, the obedience of the Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. By denying

15. or <hi>Chriſt's</hi> preaching by himſelf were the eſſential means of planting and
conſerving Faith at firſt, or any other, yet it is not immutable, and the ſame in
all Ages, as Faith it ſelf. God's Declaration immediately, or <hi>Chriſt's</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by himſelf are not the ſame in all Ages; yea, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. it is ſaid, that
<hi>God hath ſpoken to us in divers manners, ways and times by the Prophets, and
in theſe laſt days onely hath ſpoken to us by his Son, verſ 2. &amp; chap. 2. 3. The
ſalvation was at firſt begun to be ſpeken by the Lord, and ſince was confirmed by
them that heard him:</hi> which ſhews the means to be variable, by which Faith is
planted and conſerved. The Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. that <hi>without the
Word thoſe that believe not the Word may be won by the converſation of the
Wives:</hi> ſo that their good converſation was at firſt a means of converting
them, and yet that was not to be the Rule of their Faith. Whence it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that this Argument goes upon theſe falſe Suppoſitions.</p>
                  <p>1. That there is ſome means eſſential to the planting and conſerving of Faith
at firſt. 2. That the ſame means is eſſential to the planting and conſerving of
Faith at firſt. 3. That this means is immutable and the ſame in all Ages as
Faith it ſelf. 4. That what is the means of planting and conſerving Faith at
firſt muſt be the true Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>2. I deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> that <hi>oral and Apoſtolical Tradition, not written Books,
was the eſſential means of planting and conſerving Faith at firſt.</hi> And to his
proof I anſwer, that by <hi>oral and Apoſtolical Tradition,</hi> in his Tenet he means,
<hi>a delivery of Doctrine from father to ſon, by hand to hand, from</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his
Apoſtles:</hi> now if it be granted, there was no Goſpel written till eight years
after the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or thereabouts, it muſt be granted alſo, that there was
no delivery of Doctrine from father to ſon, by hand to hand, from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and
his Apoſtles, but onely their preaching <hi>viva voce, with living ſpeech,</hi> in their
own perſons, and therefore if that which was according to <hi>H. T.</hi> the eſſential
means of planting and conſerving Faith at firſt muſt be the true Rule of Faith
ſtill, and no other, then that Rule muſt neither be unwritten nor written deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of Doctrine from father to ſon, by hand to hand, from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his
Apoſtles, but their own perſonal Tradition <hi>viva voce,</hi> which now ceaſing there
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:119447:104"/>
is no Rule of Faith at all left; but the <hi>Quakers</hi> device of each mans light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him to be his Rule muſt take place. But to me the Rule of Faith is divine
revelation, by what means ſoever it be delivered: be it the Law written in the
heart or in the Book, by the ſigner of God in Tables of ſtone, or delivered by an
Angel in a Dream, Viſion, Apparition, by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Apoſtles, or any other.
But ſith God hath been pleaſed to order it, be it ſooner or later, that what <hi>Chriſt</hi>
and his Apoſtles taught ſhould be written, we are aſſured God would have us to
take it for the Rule of our Faith, and if Scripture be not the Rule of our Faith
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles did not well to commend it to us, <hi>Luk. 16. 31. Joh.</hi> 5. 39.
and to commend them that ſearched the Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. nor the Apoſtles
to direct us to them, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 19, 20. 2 Tim. 3. 16. Rom.</hi> 15. 4. nor to allege them,
<hi>Act. 3. 22. &amp;</hi> 13. 33, 34, 35. nor <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have uſed them againſt the Tempter,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 4. 7. 10. nor to have imputed errour to the ignorance of them, <hi>Matth.</hi>
22 29. nor to have ſent the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John</hi> to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
with declaration of bleſſedneſs to the obſervers of it, and denunciation of a
curſe to the corrupters and infringers of it, <hi>Revel. 1. 1, 3. &amp;</hi> 22. 18, 19. nor the
Apoſtles to write a Letter to the Churches, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 23. nor the Apoſtles to write
ſeveral Epiſtles to ſeveral Churches. And if <hi>many Ages</hi> (though I think
<hi>H. T.</hi> therein doth exceed) <hi>were paſſed before all the Books of Scripture were
disperſed and accepted for Canonical by the whole Church;</hi> yet it is certain
ſome were, and they muſt be the Rule of Faith which were accepted. And
when any difference aroſe in points of Faith among the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the firſt
Age, though they were to inquire of the Apoſtles what they taught, yet when
they could not ſpeak with them, they made uſe of their Letters written, as <hi>Acts</hi>
15. 31. 1 <hi>Cor. 7. &amp;c.</hi> And if we are not to do ſo ſtill, why doth this Authour
allege Scripture for the Churches Infallibility, the Popes Supremacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
tells us here, <hi>pag. 113. There is no better way to decide Controverſies than by
the Scripture expounded by the Church, and according to the Rule of Apoſtolical
Tradition?</hi> But this is an evidence of Gods infatuating theſe <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> that
though they have no ſhew of proof for <hi>Peter's</hi> Supremacy, and conſequently
the Popes, without the Scripture, and therefore allege it, yet determine it not to
be the Rule of Faith, and ſo make void their own proof, and the very Rule of
Faith, which they would fain eſtabliſh.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Unwritten Traditions are not proved to be the true Rule of Faith from the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
thereby of the Doctrine and Books of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>But let us view what he adds. A ſecond Argument is, That is the true Rule
of Faith by which we may be infallibly aſſured both what Doctrines Chriſt
and his Apoſtles taught, and what Books they wrote, and without which we
can never be infallibly aſſured of theſe things. But by Apoſtolical Tradition
we may infallibly be aſſured both what Doctrines Chriſt and his Apoſtles
taught, and what Books they wrote, and by no other means. Therefore Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Tradition is the true Rule of Faith. The Major is manifeſt, becauſe
in the Doctrine which Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught, and the Books which
they wrote are contained all things that are of Faith; therefore the infallible
means of knowing them is the infallible and true Rule of Faith. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
is proved, becauſe a full report from whole worlds of fathers to whole
worlds of ſons of what they heard and ſaw is altogether infallible, ſince
ſenſible evidence in a world of Witneſſes unanimouſly concurring is altogether
infallible, how fallible ſoever men may be in their particulars; and ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
ſuch an evidence is Apoſtolical Tradition, for all the Doctrinos Chriſt
and his Apoſtles taught and all the Books they wrote therefore infallible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:119447:104"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> THe Popiſh Tenet is, that unwritten Traditions of other points than
what are in the written Books are the Rule of Faith, that ſo what
they cannot prove out of Scripture of <hi>Peter's</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> being Biſhop there,
Purgatory-fire, Invocation of Saints, Adoration of the Hoſt, mixing Water
with Wine in the Euchariſt, and many more, which Popes and Popiſh Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
obtrude on the Church of God as Apoſtolical Traditions, may be received
as Objects of Faith. But here <hi>H. T.</hi> concludes <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition is the
true Rule of Faith,</hi> and proves it of no other Apoſtolical Tradition but that
whereby the Books written are known to be the Apoſtles, which I might
grant, and yet <hi>H. T.</hi> gain nothing for his purpoſe, ſith Apoſtolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
may be the true Rule of Faith, and yet not Apoſtolical Tradition
unwritten, much leſs that which Popes and Councils call Apoſtolical Tradition,
which is every corruption that hath been any long time received in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church: and this Apoſtolical Tradition infallible <hi>[that the Books of holy
Scripture were written by the holy men whoſe names they bear, and that the
things in them related are certain]</hi> and yet other Traditions of other things
not ſo. But to his Argument, I ſay, the <hi>Major</hi> is not true, nor is it proved by
his reaſon, which in form is this, <hi>That is the true Rule of Faith in which are
contained all things that are of Faith. But in the Doctrines which</hi> Chriſt <hi>and
his Apoſtles taught, and the Books which they wrote, are contained all things
that are of Faith.</hi> The Concluſion which followeth from theſe premiſes is
not his <hi>Major, [that is the true Rule of Faith, by which we may be infallibly
aſſured both what Doctrines</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his Apoſtles taught, and what Books
they wrote, and without which we can never be infallibly aſſured of thoſe
things]</hi> nor the Concluſion ſet down, <hi>[therefore the infallible means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them is the infallible and true Rule of Faith]</hi> for theſe terms, <hi>[that by
which we may be aſſured of the Doctrines or Books, the infallible means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them]</hi> are not the ſame with <hi>[the Books or Doctrines in which are contained
all things that are of Faith]</hi> and therefore the <hi>Major</hi> is not proved, but indeed
the very Proteſtant Doctrine which he gainſays is proved unawares thus.
<hi>That in which are contained all things that are of Faith is the true Rule of
Faith. But in the Doctrines which</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his Apostles taught, and the
Books which they wrote, are contained all things that are of Faith; therefore the
Doctrines which</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his Apoſtles taught, and the Books which they wrote,
are the true Rule of Faith.</hi> Which proves directly what <hi>H. T.</hi> denies, that
<hi>the Scripture is the true Rule of Faith,</hi> and ſhews, that he miſtook the means
of Faith for the Rule of Faith, between which there is manifeſt difference,
the means of Faith being any outward or inward efficient, principal or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:119447:105"/>
by which a perſon comes to believe, the Rule is that by which we
know what we are to believe: the ſame means may be the means of believing
contrary things: <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> may propheſie right things of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
and be a means of expectation of the <hi>Meſſiab,</hi> and yet alſo be a means of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſtumbling-block to overthrow them. A meſſenger, that brings a grant,
wherein a Prince grants a thing, is the means of belief, and ſo is the Seal, but
the Rule of believing is the words of the grant: <hi>Thomas</hi> his ſeeing and feeling
were the means of his believing <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Reſurrection, but the Rule was <hi>Chriſt's</hi>
words.</p>
                  <p>2. I deny his <hi>Minor.</hi> For though I grant ſuch a full report, as he ſpeaks of,
is infallible, nor do I deny, that there is ſuch a a report, or ſuch an evidence for
all the Doctrines <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles taught, and all the Books they wrote,
yet I ſay, 1. That this is not the Apoſtolical Tradition, which Papiſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert;
for with them any thing uſed in their Church a long time, and approved
by a Pope, or a Council confirmed by him is an Apoſtolical Tradition,
though it have not ſuch report, or evidence. 2. That there are other means
by which we may be aſſured, what Doctrines <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles taught,
and what Books they wrote, beſides this full report, as, 1. The inward teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the holy Spirit. 2. The innate characters of the Doctrine, and
Books themſelves foretelling things to come, opening the Myſteries of God,
advancing Gods glory, enlightning and converting the ſoul, with many more
which ſhew whoſe the Doctrine and Books were. Yet by the way I obſerve,
1. That notwithſtanding he makes here ſuch an Infallibility in the report and
evidence of ſenſe, yet <hi>pag.</hi> 205. he <hi>denies evidence of ſenſe infallible in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
and thereby overthrows his Poſition here. 2. From his words here
I argue againſt his opinion of Tranſubſtantiation thus, <hi>A full report from
whole worlds of fathers to whole worlds of ſons of what they heard and ſaw
is altogether infallible, ſince ſenſible evidence in a world of ey-witneſſes unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
concurring is altogether infallible, how fallible ſoever men may be in their
particulars.</hi> But there are worlds of ey-witneſſes, and hand-witneſſes, and
tongue-witneſſes, and noſe-witneſſes, and ear-witneſſes of fathers and ſons
who all unanimouſly concurring diſcern, and ſay of what they have ſeen, felt,
heard, taſted, ſmelled, that there is no fleſh nor blood, but Bread and Wine in
the conſecrated Hoſt, therefore the report that there is no fleſh and blood but
Bread and Wine in the Euchariſt after Conſecration or conſecrated Hoſt, and
conſequently no Tranſubſtantiation is altogether infallible. So inconſiſtent
are this Authours ſayings in one place with that he ſaith in another, as indeed
Popiſh Doctrine being a Lie muſt of neceſſity be ſelf-repugnant.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The obligation of the Church not to deliver any thing as a point of Faith, but
what they received, proves not unwritten Traditions a Rule of Faith.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>H. T. proceeds thus. A third Argument. If Chriſt and his Apoſtles have
given to the Church of the firſt Age [together with all points of Faith] this
for the Rule of Faith, that nothing on pain of Damnation ought to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Faith, but what they had received from them as ſuch, then is was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that they ſhould deliver any thing for Faith to the ſecond Age, but
what they had received from them as ſuch, and ſo from Age to Age to this
time. But Chriſt and his Apoſtles did give to the Church of the firſt Age,
[together with all points of Faith] this for the Rule of Faith, that nothing
on pain of Damnation ought to be delivered for Faith, but what they received
from them as ſuch. Therefore it was impoſſible that the Church of the firſt
Age ſhould deliver any thing to the Church of the ſecond Age for Faith, but
what they had received as ſuch from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or conſequently
that they ſhould erre in Faith. The Major is proved, becauſe to make her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
more for Faith than ſhe had received, in this ſuppoſition the whole Church
muſt either have forgotten what ſhe had been taught from her infancy in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Salvation and Damnation, which is impoſſible in a world of ear and
ey-witneſſes, as hath been ſhewed; or elſe the whole Church muſt have ſo far
broken with Reaſon, which is the very nature of man, as to conspire in a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Lie to damn her ſelf and poſterity by ſaying ſhe hath received ſuch
or ſuch a point for Faith, which in her own conſcience ſhe knew ſhe had not
received; and this is more impoſſible than the former, even as impoſſible as
for men not to be men; as ſhall be ſhewed in the next Argument. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
is proved by theſe poſitive Texts of Scripture, Therefore brethren ſtand
ye faſt, and hold the Traditions which ye have learned, whether by word or
our Epiſtle, 2 Theſſ. 2. 15. Thoſe things which ye have been taught, and
heard, and ſeen in me, theſe do ye, Phil. 4. So we have preached, and ſo ye
have believed, 1 Cor. 14. 15. How ſhall they believe in whom they have not
heard? and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? Rom. 10. 17. The
things that thou haſt heard of me before many witneſſes, the ſame commend
thou to faithfull men, which ſhall be fit to teach others alſo, 2 Tim. 2. 2. If
any man ſhall preach otherwiſe than ye have received, let him be Anathema,
Gal. 1. 9. Although we or an Angel from Heaven preach to you beſides that
which we have preached to you, be he Anathema, Gal. 1. 8.</p>

                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:119447:105"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. THe Concluſion, were it granted, is not the Poſition to be proved,
that <hi>the true Rule of</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Faith is Apoſtolical oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not Books;</hi> nor is it included in it, ſith ſome in the Church, although
not the whole Church of the firſt Age, might deliver to the Church of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Age, and ſo from father to ſon that for Faith, which was not received
from <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his Apoſtles, and it be after received as from the Apoſtles, as is
manifeſt in the reports of keeping <hi>Eaſter</hi> on the fourteenth of the Moon, of
the Millenary opinion, as from <hi>John,</hi> and in points of Faith the whole Church
might miſtake or forget, not deliver all truth, yea, might erre, and ſo not be fit
to be a Rule of Faith. 2. Were it granted that unwritten Traditions of the
whole Church of the firſt Age to the ſecond were a Rule of Faith, yet are not
the <hi>Romanists</hi> Traditions unwritten proved Rules of Faith, unleſs they be
proved to be delivered by the whole Church of the firſt Age to the Church of
the ſecond Age, and ſo from father to ſon without alteration, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prove. Nevertheleſs, ſith this Argument tends to the aſſerting of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119447:106"/>
in the Church of the firſt Age diſtinctly taken from the Apoſtles and
their Writings; I grant the <hi>Minor,</hi> and omit the examining of the Texts
brought to prove it, though ſome of them yield a good Argument againſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
Tradition: But I deny the <hi>Major,</hi> as being contrary to experience
both in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, to whom it was forbidden to add to, or diminiſh
from Gods commands, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. and yet they did, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 8. 9. and in the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, as is moſt evident in the Traditions of the <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> about
<hi>Eaſter,</hi> and ſundry other things. And though the whole Church of the firſt
Age did not deliver points of Faith to the ſecond Age, yet in the ſecond and
after-ages corruptions did come in, which were taken for univerſal Traditions,
as in giving Infants the Euchariſt, which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi>
took for an Apoſtolical Tradition, though the <hi>Trent</hi> Council condemn it.
And many things there are now taken for Apoſtolical Traditions, as Worſhip
of Images, praying to Saints, not allowing the Wine to be drunk by all the
Communicants, which yet are manifeſtly repugnant to the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>As for the proof of <hi>H. T.</hi> I ſay, 1. The eye and ear-witneſſes of all the
points of Faith are not a whole World. 2. Errours may be traduced as from
the whole Church of the firſt Age, and from the Apoſtles which were not from
them. 3. The Church delivers not Doctrines, but the Teachers in them,
whereof many ſometimes are Hypocrites, ſometimes weak in underſtanding,
all of them being men are liable to miſtakes, paſſion, forgetfulneſs, inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
and thoſe that are not ſincere may againſt their conſcience deliver er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
Sure if <hi>Polycarpus</hi> an Auditour of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, and <hi>Anicetus</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſecond Age, <hi>Polycrates</hi> and Pope <hi>Victor</hi> in the ſame
Age, <hi>Cyprian</hi> and Pope <hi>Stephanus</hi> in the next contradicted each other about
Traditions, no marvel later and inferiour Teachers, ſuch as <hi>Papias</hi> a credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
man, and others miſtook about them, and the after Churches follow them
in their miſtakes. 4. The Churches were in the Apoſtles days eaſily drawn
away from the Doctrine, which <hi>Paul</hi> had evidently taught them by hearkening
to Seducers, as the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 3. 1. though the Apoſtle warned them
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. neither therefore the warning given them, nor any ſtate of the
Church in this life yields ſufficient ſecurity of not being deceived, nor decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
others. The Church and Teachers thereof may not onely be men, and
have reaſon, but alſo good men and conſcionable, and warned not to deliver
any thing but <hi>Chriſt's</hi> and his Apoſtle's Doctrine to be believed under pain of
Damnation, and yet may build Hay and Stubble, and be ſaved as through fire,
though their Building ſuffer loſs, keeping the Foundation, and repenting of all
ſins and errours, though ſome be ſecret and unknown to them. Let us ſee what
is in the next Argument, which he terms the laſt Argument for Traditions.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> THis Argument concludes for the Churches Infallibility, which was
the fifth Article, not for Traditions, as is pretended in this Article.
But that the Church militant and all their Teachers ſetting aſide the Apoſtles,

own nature ſo far as to conspire in a notorious Lie to damn themſelves and their
poſterity, and without ſuch a force of fears or hopes falling upon them all at once
as may be ſtronger than nature to them,</hi> hath been ſhewed before both by reaſon
and experience, and our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath told us it would be, that <hi>while men
ſleep the Enemy would come and ſow Tares, Matth.</hi> 13. 25. and the Apoſtle tells
us, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 19. that there muſt be Hereſies by Gods permiſſion, that they
which are approved may be made manifeſt: Jude 4. there were certain men
crept in unawares ordained of old to this condemnation: 2 Pet. 2. 1. 1 John</hi> 4. 1.
And accordingly it fell out in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> notes out of
<hi>Egeſippus lib. 3. hiſt. cap. 29. The Church of</hi> Chriſt <hi>remained a pure and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Virgin unto the times of the Apoſtles, but after their deceaſe, and thoſe
that heard them, there was a conspiracy of corrupters, which did lurk before that
boldly vented knowledge, falſly ſo called,</hi> much of which was publiſhed under
the name of Apoſtolical Tradition. <hi>Irenaeus lib. 2. adverſ. haeret. cap.</hi> 39. ſaith,
<hi>In his days it was reported as from</hi> John, <hi>that</hi> Chriſt <hi>lived to the fiftieth year
of his Age by all the Elders of</hi> Aſia, <hi>which met with</hi> John <hi>the Diſciple of the
Lord, that</hi> John <hi>delivered it to them.</hi> Nor is this to imagine <hi>men to break

imperfect. As for what <hi>H. T.</hi> tells us <hi>of a whole World of wiſe and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:119447:107"/>
of Scripture. He that ſhall reade the Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Frier <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> (in which Council Traditions unwritten
were firſt equalled to Scripture) may perceive, that if ever there were a pack of
deceivers and deceived men it was at <hi>Trent,</hi> the Biſhops generally being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
in the Scriptures, many of them meer Canoniſts, and ſuch as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
not the Diſputes in the Congregations, and the Divines a company of
wrangling Sophiſters inured onely to School-principles and arguings without
skill in the Scriptures, and the Popes Legates and <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops depending
on the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> never applying themſelves to ſearch out truth, but to
hinder any the leaſt breaking forth of it, if it oppoſed any profit or advantage
of the Popes and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and any thing that tended to juſtifie the
Proteſtants, whom they would never permit to ſpeak for themſelves: nor were
they willing any thing ſhould be concluded, but what the Pope (of all that
ever were in the World the moſt notorious corrupter and Tyrant in the Church
of God) liked. And he that ſhall reade the Book not long ſince publiſhed,
intituled <hi>the Myſtery of</hi> Jeſuitiſm, will finde, that the chiefeſt Leaders now in
the Popiſh Churches, the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who are for the Traditions of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> are wholly bent, though againſt Scripture and Fathers, to carry on their
own intereſt by any devices whatſoever without regard either to Rules of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
or of Morality delivered by infidel Philoſophers. So that the talk of
<hi>H. T.</hi> concerning a World of wiſe and diſintereſted men among Popiſh
Teachers is like the talk of a company of honeſt Women in a ſociety of noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Whores, or of juſt men in a Band of Robbers.</p>
                  <p>H. T. <hi>adds.</hi> It is the aſſurance of this impoſſibility that moves the Church
of the preſent Age to reſolve her Faith and Doctrines into the precedent Age,
and ſo from Age to Age, from ſons to fathers up to the mouth of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his
Apoſtles teaching it, ſaying, We believe it becauſe we have received it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This reſolution of Faith not into the Scriptures teſtimony,
but the teſtimony of the next age, and ſo upwards, and thereby judging what
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles taught, can beget no other than a humane Faith, ſith in
this way <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles are ſuppoſed to teach what the ſucceeding ages
have taught: nor is it any better than an uncertain way, ſith in ſome ages it
cannot be known what was taught in many points of controverſie, for as much
as this Authour confeſſeth, <hi>pag. 25. There was no general or provincial Council
that decided any Controverſies of moment in the tenth Age,</hi> which and the next
before it <hi>are by</hi> Genebrard <hi>and</hi> Bellarmine <hi>counted unhappy for want of learned
men:</hi> nor can this be any other than a fraudulent device to draw men from
immediate ſearching into the Scriptures for their Faith, and prepoſſeſſing
them with the Doctrines of the preſent age, which once received, very few, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
men very learned and impartial inquiſitours into the truth, will be able to
examine, and in effect that which the Pope and his Council have or ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
muſt be taken for unqueſtionable: nor is this reaſonable, but againſt
all right way of underſtanding, that we ſhould apply our ſelves to know what
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles taught ſixteen hundred years ago, rather by the preſent
and precedent ages after the times wherein they lived, than by their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119447:107"/>
and fictitious, and refuted by experience. Surely if there were ſuch an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
as this Authour ſpeaks of, the whole World had not been corrupted as it
was in <hi>Noa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>'s</hi> and <hi>Abraham's</hi> days, nor the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as it was in the
days of the <hi>Judges,</hi> of <hi>Elias, Manaſſeh,</hi> our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> at his coming in the
fleſh, in the time of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> when as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaid, <hi>The whole world groaned
that it was become</hi> Arian, there would not be ſuch a falling away, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
foretold, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 1. 2. Theſſ.</hi> 2 4 at which time the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> grant in
their note on that place, that even the ſervice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall be ſuppreſſed.
And therefore the impoſſibility here ſuppoſed by <hi>H. T.</hi> is but imaginary out of
inadverteney of what the Scripture hath related and foretold, and ignorance of
the great corruption of man and the power of the <hi>old Serpent called the Devil
and Satan, which deceiveth the whole World, Revel.</hi> 12. 9.</p>
                  <p>3. But what Church is there that ſo reſolves her Faith? none that I know
of beſides the <hi>Roman,</hi> or rather the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> For I do not yet think
that either the <hi>Greek, Aſiatick,</hi> or <hi>African</hi> Churches do ſo reſolve their Faith,
no nor yet ſome of thoſe Churches who do hold communion with the <hi>Roman</hi>
See; nay, I hardly think the Church or Court of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf doth reſolve
it's Faith (ſuch as it is) as <hi>H. T.</hi> here ſpeaks: I inſtance in one main point,
<hi>that the Pope is above a Council.</hi> For ſure if that be their reſolution they will
be caſt, ſith the precedent age, I mean the fifteenth century did deliver by hand
to hand from father to ſon that a general Council is above the Pope, as the
two ſo termed general Councils of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Conſtance</hi> did expreſly determine.
And in other points in difference between Proteſtants and Papiſts, if they go
from age to age upwards, Papiſts would finde themſelves deſtitute of Tradition
unwritten as well as written, in the half communion, Papal indulgences,
worſhip of Images, and many more beſides. So that however this Authour
pretend Tradition <hi>of a world of fathers to a world of ſons,</hi> when he and his
party are put to it they have not any ancient univerſal Tradition elder than the
ſixteenth century for the chief point of the Papacy the Popes Supremacy and
Infallibility, and therein the Pope and his packed Council of <hi>Trent</hi> are the
great World, he means at which were at ſome determinations of great moment
about fifty Biſhops ſuch as they were, and ſome of them but titular, and in other
points there hath been no Tradition, but what hath been gainſaid; and therefore
in fine, the Papiſts faith is reſolved into the Popes and Council of <hi>Trents</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
which is the Catholick Church with Papiſts, as is manifeſt by the
words of this Authour here, <hi>p.</hi> 70. where he makes the Church which he counts
infallible, <hi>A Council called out of the whole World, and approved by the Pope,</hi>
which he judgeth the <hi>Trent</hi> Council to be, <hi>pag.</hi> 76. and if the Catholick
Church do reſolve its faith into the catholick churches tradition, what is this
but to reſolve its faith into its own tradition? at leaſt the catholick church
repreſented in an oecumenical council approved by the Pope muſt reſolve its
faith into it ſelf, <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth and the <hi>Trent</hi> Biſhops muſt reſolve their faith
into their own tradition, and ſo muſt believe what they believe in points of
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, becauſe they hold ſo, and judge themſelves infallible; and if
ſo, it would be known whether they did believe the ſame things before they did
determine them in a council; if not, they defined what they did not believe;
if they did, then it would be known upon what tradition they did believe them,
if they name the tradition of the foregoing age, the ſame queſtions will be put,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119447:108"/>
and the anſwer muſt be either at laſt to reſolve it into Scripture, or ſome fallible
men, or the proceſs will be endleſs, or it muſt reſt in the determination of the
preſent church catholick, properly ſo called, or general council, or Pope, or elſe
the queſtions wil return, and the arguing will be circular. Yet there are theſe
Reaſons why Papiſts make ſhew of this way of reſolving their faith into the
churches tradition unwritten, 1. Becauſe they would not have their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Faith tried by the holy Scriptures alone, nor in the firſt place, nor
by the Doctours of the firſt five hundred years. 2. Becauſe they know that few
either of the learned or unlearned can track them in this way, it being impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for any but men of very great reading and very accurate criticks to diſcern
truth in this way by reaſon of the multitude of Nations in which the Church
hath been, whereof ſome are unknown to ſome other Churches, the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to know what each church throughout the World held in every age, the
difficulty of travel, the variety of Languages, the multitude and uncertainty
of Authours, eſpecially ſince they have been gelded and altered by the <hi>Indices
expurgatorii,</hi> and practiſes of Monks and other Scribes, the foiſting in baſtard
treatiſes under the names of approved Authours. For which reaſon it is that
they decline as much as they can trial of their Doctrine by Scripture, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
difficulties where there are either none, or ſuch as might be removed,
though by their courſe they caſt men into inſuperable difficulties, and
when they are neceſſitated to let people have the Scripture in the vulgar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
by reaſon of importunity of adverſaries, yet they ſo pervert it by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Tranſlations and notes (as in the <hi>Rhemiſt's Teſtament</hi> is manifeſt) that
people have much ado without much diligence to finde out their deceits.</p>

                     <p>The Romaniſts can never gain their cauſe by referring the whole trial of Faith
to the arbitrement of Scripture, but will be proved by it to have revolted
from Chriſtianity.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>Yet H. T. hath the face to ſay, But if we refer the whole trial of faith to
the arbitrement of Scripture, I ſee nothing more evident, than that this one
Argument ad hominem, gives the cauſe into our hands, ſince it clearly proves
either many controverted Catholick Doctrines are ſufficiently contained in
Scripture, or many Proteſtant ones are not; and thus I frame my diſcourſe.
All Proteſtant Tenets (ſay you) are ſufficiently contained in Scripture; but
many Catholick Doctrines (ſay I) denied by Proteſtants are as evident in
Scripture, as divers Proteſtant Tenets; therefore many Catholick Doctrines
denied by Proteſtants are ſufficiently contained in Scripture. He that has
hardineſs enough to deny this Concluſion let him compare the Texts that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the Churches authority in deciding controverſies, and expounding Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith with theſe that ſupport the Proteſtant private ſpirit, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
judgement of diſcretion; let him compare the places that favour prieſtly
Abſolution with thoſe on which they ground their neceſſity (not to ſtand upon
the lawfulneſs) of Infant-baptiſm, let him compare the paſſages of the Bible
for the real preſence of our Saviours body in the Euchariſt, for the primacy of
St. Peter, for the authority of Apoſtolical Traditions, though unwritten, with
what ever he can cite, to prove the three diſtinct perſons in the bleſſed Trinity,
the conſubſtantiality of the Son with the Father, the proceſſion of the holy
Ghoſt from both, the obligation of the Sunday in ſtead of the Sabbath, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
commanded in the Moral Law; and when he has turned over all his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as often as he pleaſes, I ſhall offer him onely this requeſt, either to admit the
Argument or teach me to anſwer it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:119447:108"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> H. T. ſure hath a ſingular eyeſight, which ſees ſuch an evidence
in this Argument, as that he ſees nothing more evident. What?
is not this more evident, that the whole is bigger than a part, that God made
the World, that the Word was made Fleſh (Sure an Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi>
is no demonſtration, ſpecially when what the man holds at one time upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and better thoughts he relinquiſheth: nor is an argument <hi>ad hominem</hi>
fit to eſtabliſh any truth, but ſomewhat to leſſen the opinion of the man who is
thereby convinced of holding inconſiſtencies; and therefore the cauſe is not
given into <hi>H. T.</hi> and his fellows hands, that unwritten traditions are a
Rule of Faith, or that Popiſh Doctrine is grounded on Scripture, becauſe
ſome Proteſtant tenets have no better proof thence than ſome Popiſh tenets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to be contained in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But that I may gratifie <hi>H. T.</hi> (as much as in me lieth) in his requeſt, I tell
him, The Syllogiſm is in no Mood or Figure that I know, nor (if I would
examine the form of it) do I doubt, but that I ſhould finde four terms in it at
leaſt, and then <hi>H. T.</hi> it is likely knows his Sy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>logiſm is naught. Nor do I
know how to form it better, unleſs it be formed diſ-junctively: but it belongs
not to me to form his Weapons for him. To it as I finde it I ſay, that if he
mean, that all Proteſtant tenets ſimply are ſufficiently contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
who ever he be that ſaith ſo, yet I dare not ſay ſo: But this I think,
that all, or moſt of the tenets which the Proteſtants hold againſt the Papiſts
in the points of Faith and Worſhip, which are controverted between them,
are ſufficiently contained in the Scripture, and all of them ought to be, or elſe
they may be rejected. And for his <hi>Minor</hi> I deny it, if he mean it of thoſe
Proteſtant tenets in points of Faith, which are held by all, or thoſe that
are avouched by common conſent in the harmony of their confeſſions, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome about Diſcipline, Ceremonies, and Sacraments. And for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
to the firſt I ſay, I am willing any Reader, who reades what is written
on both ſides in the fifth Article here, ſhould judge whether hath more evidence
in Scripture, the Churches imagined infallible authority in deciding controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
or that each perſon is to uſe his own underſtanding to try what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to be believed without relying on any authority of Pope, general
Council, or Prelates, who are never called the Church in Scripture. And for
the ſecond, I do not take it to be a Proteſtant tenet, that Infant-baptiſm is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;
and for the lawfulneſs, I grant, there is as much evidence in Scripture
for Prieſts judiciary ſacramental authoritative Abſolution as for it, that is
none at all for either. And for the third, there are Proteſtants, that grant a
real preſence of our Saviour's body in the Euchariſt, as the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and
ſome <hi>Calviniſts</hi> grant alſo a real preſence to the worthy receiver, but not bodily,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119447:109"/>
but for the real preſence by Tranſubſtantion there <hi>is not the leaſt in Scripture of
it ſelf,</hi> as <hi>Scotus</hi> long ago reſolved. And for the Primacy of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> it hath
been told this Authour, that a Primacy of order, of zeal, and ſome other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
is yielded by Proteſtants, but Supremacy of Juriſdiction over the
Apoſtles is denied, and it is proved before, <hi>Article</hi> 7. to have no evidence in
Scripture. And for the authority of Apoſtolical traditions, though unwritten,
(if there were any ſuch truly ſo called) I ſhould not deny it, but that there are
any ſuch which are a rule of faith now to us, he hath not proved in this Article,
nor brought one Text for it, but ſome far-fetcht Reaſons of no validity. But
I preſume his brethren will give him little thanks for gratifying ſo much the
<hi>Antitrinitarians, Arians, Socinians,</hi> as to yield, that thoſe points which are in
the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed, and were determined in the firſt general
Councils are no better proved from Scripture than Tranſubſtantiation, the Popes
Supremacy and unwritten Traditions being a Rule of Faith. Are not theſe
Texts <hi>Matth. 28. 19. 1 John 5. 7. John 1. 1. 1 John</hi> 5. 20. and many more
which <hi>Bellarmine lib. 1. de Chriſto</hi> brings to prove the Trinity of perſons, the
Sons conſubſtantiality, the Spirits proceſſion more evident than, <hi>this is my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
for Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, for the Popes Supremacy; and
<hi>H. T.</hi> his Scriptureleſs reaſoning for unwritten Traditions? <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 4.

and the union of natures in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be plainly in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>As for Sunday being in ſtead of the Sabbath, he ſhould me thinks allow
ſomewhat in Scripture for it, <hi>Col. 2. 16. Acts 20 7. 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2. Revel.</hi> 1. 10.
more evident than for his real preſence, <hi>Peter's</hi> Supremacy, unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But I ſee prejudice doth much to ſway men, and make them ſee what
others cannot. The Crow thinks her own Bird faireſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet again, ſaith</hi> H. T. The ſame Syllogiſm may with equal evidence be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the negative, as well as poſitive Doctrines on either ſide. All Catholick
points denied by Proteſtants are ſufficiently (ſay you) condemned in Scripture.
But many points imbraced by Proteſtants are as clearly (ſay I) condemned in
Scripture, as divers they deny in oppoſition to Catholicks; therefore many points
embraced by Proteſtants are ſufficiently condemned in Scripture. Where does
the Bible ſo plainly forbid Prayer for the Dead, as this darling Errour and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Principle of Protestancy, that any one however ignorant, however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,
ought to reade the holy Scriptures, and unappealably judge of their ſenſe
by his private interpretation? Where is it ſo plainly forbidden to adore <hi>Chriſt</hi> in
what place ſoever we believe him to be really preſent, as it is to work upon the
Saturday? Thus if the Bible be conſtituted ſole Rule of Religion, Proteſtants
clearly can neither condemn the Catholick, nor juſtifie their own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Concluſion may be granted, that many points embraced by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
are ſufficiently condemned in Scripture without any detriment to the
Proteſtant cauſe: Proteſtants do not pretend to Infallibility, but that the tenets
in point of Faith, which in oppoſition to Papiſts their <hi>Harmony of Confeſſions</hi>
avoucheth are ſufficiently condemned in Scripture, is more than <hi>H. T.</hi> or any
other can prove. To his Syllogiſm I anſwer, by denying his <hi>Minor.</hi> And to
his inſtances I anſwer, the Prayer for the Dead, which Proteſtants ſay is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
plainly in Scripture, is Popiſh Prayer for the Dead to have them eaſed
or delivered out of Purgatory: now this we ſay is condemned plainly in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119447:109"/>
1. Becauſe it ſuppoſeth a belief of a Purgatory-place in Hell, which is
an Errour, and every Errour is condemned in Scripture, as contrary to truth.
2. All Prayer is condemned, which is not agreeable to the Rules of Prayer;
now the Rules of Prayer in Scripture are, that we <hi>ſhould pray in Faith,
James 1. 6. Ask the things which are according to the will of God, 1 John</hi> 5. 14.
<hi>Not for him that ſins unto death, verſ.</hi> 16. But to ask for deliverance out of
Purgatory, when there is no ſuch place, nor God hath promiſed any ſuch
thing, is not in Faith, nor according to Gods will, but is as vain as to ask for
him that ſins unto death, it is all one as to pray that the elect Angels or Devils
ſhould be delivered thence, which were a Mockery of God. 3. God forbids
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> to pray for that which he would not hear him, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 11. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Prayer for the Dead to be delivered out of Purgatory, in which God
will not hear, is by parity of reaſon condemned, as if a man ſhould
pray that the Reprobate ſhould not be damned, or the Elect ſhould not be
ſaved.</p>
                  <p>The Proteſtants ſay not, that <hi>every one, however ignorant or unſtable, ought
unappealably to judge of the ſenſe of all Scriptures by his private interpretation.</hi>
There are plain Scriptures and Points fundamental, and of theſe they ſay they
may and ought to judge of their ſenſe each one by his own private interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if by it be meant his own underſtanding, but not if by it be meant a
peculiar fancy ſuch as no man elſe conceives, nor the words import: but they
ſay in difficult places and points not fundamental they ought not to judge of
their ſenſe unappealably, that is, ſo as not to uſe the help of the learned, in
which number Fathers and Councils have their place, and eſpecially their own
Teachers, to finde out the meaning of them: yet when they have uſed means,
they may, and muſt ſuſpend any judgement at all, or ſtick to that which in their
own underſtanding ſeems moſt probable, or elſe they muſt go againſt their
own conſcience, which were ſin, or they muſt be Hypocrites, ſaying, they judge
that to be ſo, which they do not, yea, there ſhould be an impoſſibility in nature
granted, that a man at the ſame time doth judge that to be the ſenſe of the ſame
thing which he doth not: but they deny, that a man ought ſo to reſt on any
Pope, or Councils, or Doctours judgement, as to hold what they hold without
any other proof, though it be in their apprehenſion againſt Scripture, ſith that
is plainly condemned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 10. And they hold that every man, that hath
the uſe of natural underſtanding ought to reade the Scripture, <hi>John 5. 39. Col.</hi>
3. 16. <hi>Rom. 15. 4. 2. Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16. and to judge their ſenſe in this manner,
and this is no Errour, much leſs <hi>a darling Errour of Proteſtancy.</hi> Nor can
<hi>H. T.</hi> prove it any where condemned in Scripture. As for the place 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.
16. to which his words ſeem to allude, it proves not the reading of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
or judging of the ſenſe to be condemned, yea <hi>ver.</hi> 3. 15. proves the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould reade <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles, <hi>in which thoſe things are
which are hard to be underſtood.</hi> onely it condemns <hi>the wreſting of them to
their perdition by the unlearned and unſtable,</hi> which Proteſtants do condemn as
well as Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>It is not forbidden <hi>to adore</hi> Chriſt <hi>in what place ſoever he is,</hi> but 1. It is
an Errour contrary to an Article of Faith to conceive <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a Wafer-cake
on earth, called the Hoſt by Papiſts, whom we believe to be in Heaven at the
right hand of God, and of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>the Heaven muſt contain him
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119447:110"/>
till the times of the reſtitution of all things. Acts</hi> 3. 21. and ſo it is forbidden
to adore that Bread, as if <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body were there, it being a belief of an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
contrary to an Article of Faith. 2. It is flat Idolatry to adore with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worſhip a piece of Bread, though taken to be the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it being
forbidden, <hi>Matth. 4. 10. Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God and him onely
ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Nor can the imagination of a perſon acquit the perſon that

Mediatours to God they are departed from the two great points of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>

their ſubſtituting of another Rule of Religion than the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi>

nothing elſe but the Determinations of Popes and Councils approved by him,
they do prove themſelves not to be Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is all one with

                  <p>H. T. recites the ſayings of eight Fathers and two Councils for Tradition.
The firſt of <hi>Irenaus lib. 3. cap.</hi> 4. doth not at all prove that we have
now unwritten Traditions for a Rule of Faith, but that <hi>if the Apoſtles</hi> (in
ſtead of which fraudulently, as I fear <hi>H. T.</hi> puts, <hi>If the Fathers) had left
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119447:110"/>
us no Scripture at all, ought we not to follow the order of Tradition which they
delivered, to whom they committed the Churches.</hi> To underſtand which it is
to be noted, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> having proved <hi>Valentinus</hi> his Doctrines of <hi>Aeones</hi>
or more Gods and Lords than one to be falſe out of the Scriptures, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. he
ſpeaks thus of the <hi>Valentinian</hi> Hereticks, <hi>When they are reproved out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
they are turned into accuſation of the Scriptures themſelves, as if they
were not right, nor from authority; and becauſe they are diverſly ſaid, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the truth cannot be found out of theſe by thoſe who know not Tradition.
For that truth was not delivered by Letters, but by living voice,</hi> (which is the
very Plea for Traditions, which <hi>H. T.</hi> here uſeth) <hi>for which cauſe</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid, We
ſpeak wiſdom among them that are perfect,</hi> as they took themſelves to be, and
ſaid, <hi>They were wiſer than either Presbyters or Apoſtles,</hi> and would neither
conſent to Scriptures nor Tradition; and then <hi>cap.</hi> 3. ſhews the Tradition of
the Apoſtles by what was preached in the Churches founded by them; and to
avoid prolixity refers to <hi>Linus, Anacletus, Clemens</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to <hi>Polycarpus</hi>
and his Succeſſours at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and after uſeth the words mentioned <hi>chap.</hi> 4.
which do not at all mention Tradition in all after ages as a Rule, but the
Tradition from the Apoſtles to them that knew the Apoſtles, and that onely
in the main point of Faith concerning God the Creatour, and onely upon
ſuppoſition there had been no Scripture, and that after he had alleged the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to ſtop the courſe of Hereticks that declined the Scripture. Whence it is
apparent, 1. <hi>That</hi> Irenaeus <hi>counted Scripture the conſtant Rule of
Faith. 2. That he counted Tradition unwritten a Rule onely upon ſuppoſition,
that the Apoſtles had not left us Scripture. 3. No Tradition to be that Rule,
but what was from men acquainted with Apoſtles. 4. To be uſed onely in caſe
men were ſo perverſe as to decline Scripture:</hi> which is our caſe in dealing with
Papiſts, which moved Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> in his <hi>Sermon</hi> at <hi>Paul's Croſs</hi> to offer,
that <hi>if the Papiſts could prove the Articles then enumerated by antiquity of the
firſt five hundred years after</hi> Chriſt <hi>he would ſubſcribe:</hi> which neither <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
nor <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> nor <hi>Perron,</hi> nor any of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> could or can do.
The words of <hi>Tertullian lib. de praeſcript. adverſ. Haeret. cap.</hi> 21. 37. are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that <hi>the Doctrine is to be held which the Church had from the Apoſtles, the
Apoſtles from</hi> Chriſt, Chriſt <hi>from God.</hi> But he expreſſeth how he means it,
when he ſaith in the ſame place, <hi>But what the Apoſtles have preached, that is,
what</hi> Chriſt <hi>hath revealed to them, I will alſo preſcribe that it ought to be no
otherwiſe proved but by the ſame Churches, which the Apoſtles themſelves built,
they themſelves by preaching to them, as well by living voice (as they ſay) as by
Epiſtles afterwards.</hi> Which plainly ſhews that <hi>Tertullian</hi> mentioned no other
Doctrine to be received from the Churches than what the Apoſtles after wrote,
nor from any other Churches than thoſe which the Apoſtles by preaching
built, by which he means the <hi>Corinthian, Philippick, Theſſalonian, Epheſian,</hi> as
well as <hi>Roman, chap.</hi> 36. And though he uſe againſt <hi>Valentinus, Marcion,</hi> and
other Hereticks, the Tradition of thoſe Churches, yet <hi>chap.</hi> 8. he plainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
to the Scriptures, as the way to finde <hi>Chriſt</hi> by uſing his words to the
<hi>Jews, John 5. 39. Search the Scriptures in which ye hope for ſalvation: for
they do ſpeak of me. This will be, Seek and ye ſhall finde.</hi> Which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
it will appear, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> was far from aſſerting unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of things not contained in Scripture delivered in theſe later ages, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:119447:111"/>
Apoſtolical by Popes and Councils, the Rule of Faith. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> words
<hi>lib. 2. Epiſt. cap. 3. ad Cacilium</hi> in ſome Editions, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 63. ſhew his miſtake
about Traditions, as he counted the mingling of Water and Wine in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt
to be the Lord's tradition, ſo he did alſo Rebaptization, in which the
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> deſert him: neither ſhew he held unwritten tradition a Rule of
Faith; yea, arguing againſt them that uſed Water without Wine, he proves
<hi>the Lord's tradition</hi> out of Scripture, and urgeth it againſt them, and though
his Reaſons be frivolous, yet theſe expreſſions ſhew he adhered to the Scripture
as his Rule. <hi>But if it be commanded by</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and the ſame be confirmed
and delivered by his Apoſtle, that as oft as we drink in commemoration of the
Lord we do the ſame thing, which the Lord alſo did, we are found that it is not
obſerved of us which is commanded, unleſs we alſo do the ſame things which the
Lord did, and mingling the Cup in like manner recede not from the divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery.</hi>
Again, <hi>I marvel enough whence this hath been uſed, that againſt the
Evangelical and Apoſtolical Diſcipline in ſome places Water is offered in the
Lord's Cup, which alone cannot expreſs</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s Blood.</hi> Whence may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that even in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> days corrupt uſages came in by following other
Traditions than thoſe that are written. In the ſame Epiſtle <hi>Cyprian</hi> adds this
remarkable ſpeech, <hi>Wherefore if</hi> Chriſt <hi>alone be to be heard, we ought not to
attend what any one before us hath thought is to be done, but what</hi> Chriſt <hi>who is
before all; neither ought we to follow the cuſtome of a man out the truth of
God, ſith God ſpeaks by the Prophet</hi> Eſay, <hi>and ſaith, Without reaſon do they
worſhip me, teaching Mandates and Doctrines of men.</hi>

ſaith, <hi>This Doctrine we have demonſtrated to have been delivered from hand to

Pope <hi>Stephanus,</hi> in which both ſides pretended Tradition, <hi>Cyprian</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization,
and here <hi>Auguſtine</hi> pretends Tradition for the contrary; by
which and by <hi>Auguſtine's</hi> words <hi>lib. 1. de pecc. merit. &amp; remiſſ. cap.</hi> 24. in
which he makes <hi>the giving of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt to Infants an
ancient and Apoſtolical tradition,</hi> which Pope <hi>Innocentius Epiſt.</hi> 93. among
<hi>Augustine's</hi> Epiſtles determined to be neceſſary, yet is now condemned in the
<hi>Trent</hi> Council, it is apparent how unſafe it is to rely on a Popes determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or <hi>Auſtin's</hi> opinion of Apoſtolical tradition, and that groſs Errours
have been received under the name of Apoſtolical traditions. As for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

Council condemned by the Synod of <hi>Francford</hi> and at <hi>Paris</hi> for their impious

Scripture. The Church of God, that is, the company of believers, who are
the Church of God by Papiſts own definition, having the help of their godly

them, and I will embrace them. Sure I am Popes Expoſitions and Popiſh
Councils, Canons, are ſo far from being Apoſtolical traditions, that they are
rather the moſt ridiculous, profane, and blaphemous pervertings of Scripture
that ever any ſober man uſed, as may appear by their Canon Law. Yea, the

and many more tranſlate and expound according to the Letter? Is the
Scripture any more a dead Letter than the Popes Breves or <hi>Trent</hi> Canons?
Are they any more a living Judge than the Scripture? Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth
ties Papiſts <hi>to expound the Scriptures according to the unanimous conſent of the

Decrees are in their Canon Law.</p>
                  <p>But me thinks all the learned <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> even the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> themſelves, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thoſe that have written large Commentaries according to the literal ſenſe,
as <hi>Salmeron, Maldonat, Lorinus, Cornelius a Lapide, Tirinus,</hi> and many more

not according to the literal ſenſe, which he calls <hi>the dead Letter,</hi> or elſe at once
blot out all they have written for finding it as a meer encumbrance to the
World. And the ſame may be ſaid of <hi>not expounding by the private ſpirit.</hi>
For why do theſe private men take ſo much pains to publiſh Commentaries?
Is not their ſpirit as much private, as <hi>Calvin's, Beza's, Luther's,</hi> and others, and
theſe mens ſpirit as publick as theirs? Let any man aſſign Reaſons if he can
why all the Commentaries of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſhould not be caſhier'd under this
pretence as well as the Proteſtants, who are as learned, induſtrious as they,
and far more ſincere and impartial. Why ſhould not the Popes expoſitions be
rejected as well as others? Have they any more than a private ſpirit? Do
not their very Breves, and Monitories, and Decrees, ſhew that it is a private
ſpirit they act and decide by? Sure the Spirit of God would not dictate ſuch
vain things as they utter, and which ſometimes they are fain to recall, leſt their
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:119447:112"/>
nakedneſs appear. Do not the Popes by their own confeſſions in correcting the
vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation, and other things they ſet forth, declare, that they
uſe induſtry and the help of learned men? If they have a publick ſpirit, why
do not the Popes make us an Expoſition of Scripture, which all muſt own?
Is it not becauſe they are for the moſt part a race of ignorant and unlearned
men, ſpecially in the Scriptures, and, ſhould they attempt ſuch a thing, would
make themſelves appear ridiculous, and ſhew their aſinine ears, though now
they ſeem terrible, and to carry majeſty with their Lions skin? Is there any
thing the Popes can do more neceſſary than this, that they may end all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,
and guide all ſouls aright? But the truth is, the Popes have been ſo
unhappy in alleging Scripture in their Bulls, and Breves, and Monitories, in their
diciſions of controverſies, that no ſide will acquieſce in their determinations
they are ſo vain or ſo partial, but as of old in the controverſies between <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans</hi>
and <hi>Franciſcans</hi> about the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> immaculate Conception, ſo of

holds what they held, notwithſtanding the Popes deciſion, which for the moſt
part is ſo compoſed, that each party may think it makes for him, and he may
looſe neither. And about the Edition of the vulgar Tranſlation in <hi>Latin</hi> of
the Bible, how much have the two Popes <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth and <hi>Clemens</hi> the
eighth diſcovered their unskilfulneſs, when after ſuch profeſſion of diligence

                  <p>I reply, that <hi>which is profitable to teach, reprove, correct, inſtruct in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo as that the man of God may be entire, fitted, or inſtructed for every
good work.</hi> Sure that is a ſufficient Rule for Doctrine of Faith and good
Works, and ſo to ſalvation. But ſuch is the Scripture, as the Text tells us.
<hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is apparent, ſith no more is required to a ſufficient Rule of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:119447:113"/>
Doctrine, if there be, let it be ſhewed, that it may be known wherein this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.
Sure that which is profitable for all uſes to which Doctrine ſerves is a
ſufficient Doctrine. The Anſwer of <hi>H. T.</hi> here is ſo far from being a full
Anſwer to the Objection (as he vainly vaunts in the Title page of his Book)
that indeed it is a confirmation of the Objection. For if the old Scriptures
were ſo profitable as to make <hi>the man of God</hi> a Teacher of the Church, <hi>entire,</hi>
that they <hi>were able to make him wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> and <hi>furniſh him with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to every good work,</hi> much more when the Books of the New Teſtament
were added, of which one of the Goſpels is by <hi>H. T.</hi> here <hi>pag.</hi> 104. ſaid <hi>to
have been written eight years after the Death of</hi> Chriſt, and doubtleſs <hi>Timothy</hi>
knew it, and however he had the former Epiſtle to himſelf before the Epiſtle
in which this paſſage is, which is ill printed, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 3. 16, 17. it being 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
3. 15, 16, 17. and therefore the Scripture he had was a ſufficient Rule to him a
Biſhop without Traditions, much more to others, and ſo Traditions unwritten
are proved unneceſſary and ſuperfluous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again ſaith</hi> H. T. <hi>Object.</hi> If any one ſhall add to theſe God ſhall add to
him the Plagues written in this Book, Apoc. 22. 18, 19. Therefore it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to add Traditions. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It follows immediately, And if any one ſhall
diminiſh from the words of this Prophecy God ſhall take away his Part out of
the Book of Life, verſ. 19. By which St. <hi>John</hi> evidently reſtrains that Text
to the Book of his own Prophecies onely; which is not the whole Rule of Faith;
and therefore by that you cannot exclude either the reſt of the Scriptures or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Traditions from that Rule.</p>
                  <p>I reply, there is no reaſon why the ſame thing is not to be underſtood of the
whole Canon, and each particular Book, ſith there is the like <hi>Deut. 4. 2. Prov.</hi>
30. 6. <hi>Jer. 7. 31. 2 Theſſ.</hi> 2. 1, 2. wherein are general Warnings of not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
additions to the Scripture, yea, though the names of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were
pretended, eſpecially when the Traditions do adulterate the written Word as
Popiſh traditions about Images, Faſting, ſingle life, of the Clergy, Monaſtick
Vows, and others of their Traditions do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet he adds. Object.</hi> We may have a certain knowledge of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſalvation by the Bible or written Word onely. <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not;
for there have been, are and will be infinite Disputes about that to the
worlds end, as well what Books are Canonical as what the true ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is of every Verſe and Chapter. Nor can we ever be infallibly aſſured of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but by means of Apoſtolical tradition; ſo that if this be interrupted, and
failed for any one whole Age together (as Proteſtants defend it for many) the
whole Bible, for ought we know, might in that ſpace be changed and corrupted:
nor can the contrary ever be evinced without new revelation from God: the
dead Letter cannot ſpeak for it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>I reply, this profane Wretch it ſeems takes delight in this blaſphemous Title
which he gives to the holy Scripture often in reproach terming it <hi>the dead Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
which he hath no Warrant to do. For though it is true that <hi>Ro. 7. 3, 6. 2 Cor.</hi>
3. 6. the Law or old Covenant be termed <hi>the Letter,</hi> and is ſaid to be <hi>dead</hi> and
<hi>killing,</hi> yet this is not meant of the holy Scripture of the Law, becauſe it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
but becauſe it was abrogated in the Goſpel, as killing by its Sentence <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
that continued not in all things written in it, Gal.</hi> 3. 10. And yet it can ſpeak
for it ſelf as well, yea, incomparably better than any Writings of Popes, Councils,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:119447:113"/>
or Fathers from whence he hath his Traditions, which are as dead a Letter
as the Scripture. And in this his expreſſion there is ſo much the more iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in that he prefers before the holy Scripture the uncertain reports of credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ſuperſtitious men, and the Decrees of doating Popes, as more lively than
the holy Scripture inſpired of God And for this man who but the next Page
before confeſſed, that the words of the Apoſtle, which tell us, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>the holy written Letters were able to make</hi> Timothy <hi>wiſe to ſalvation,</hi>
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 15. to be meant of the old Scripture, and yet here to ſay, <hi>that we
cannot have a certain knowledge of all things neceſſary to ſalvation by the Bible
or written Word onely,</hi> what is it but flatly to gainſay the Apoſtle? which is
the more impiouſly and impudently done, in that he aſcribes that to uncertain
unwritten Tradition, which neither he nor any of his Fellows are able to
ſhew where it is, or how it may be certainly known, which he denies to holy
Scripture. As for his Reaſon it is frivolous. For a man may have a certain
knowledge of that of which there will be infinite Diſputes to the Worlds end,
elſe hath he no certain knowledge of the Popes Supremacy, Infallibility, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in Temporals, ſuperiority to a Council, of which yet there have been and
are likely to be infinite Diſputes. As there have been Diſputes about the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Books, ſo there have been about unwritten Traditions, as about the
time of keeping <hi>Eaſter,</hi> Rebaptization, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor is it true that <hi>there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Disputes about the true ſenſe and meaning of every Verſe and Chapter of
the Bible.</hi> Sure among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there is no diſpute of many fundamental
truths, which every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> acknowledgeth; and yet if there were, it is no
other thing than what is incident not onely to Philoſophers Writings, but alſo
to the Popes Decrees, about which there are infinite Diſputes among the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts,
to the Canons and Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> about which
there were Diſputes between <hi>Catharinus, Soto, Vega, Andradius,</hi> and others, to
the Popes Breves, as to Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth his Breves about the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance,
which were not onely diſputed by King <hi>James</hi> and other Proteſtants,
but alſo by <hi>Widrington</hi> and other Popiſh Prieſts, and to his Monitory and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict
of <hi>Venice</hi> diſputed by Frier <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> and others againſt <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
Baronius,</hi> and others. And if we can never be infallibly aſſured of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Canonical Books or their ſenſe but by Apoſtolical tradition unwritten,
then can <hi>H. T.</hi> never be aſſured of the Popes Infallibility, or Supremacy but by it,
and if ſo, then the Scripture is not his ground of it, and ſo he cannot demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
the truth of his Catholick Religion by Texts of holy Scripture, as he
pretends in his Title-page, and therefore they are impertinently alleged by him,
he ſhould onely allege Tradition: which whether it be Fathers, Councils, or
Popes ſayings, it cannot aſſure better than the Scripture, they being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
than it, and therefore by his reaſoning there can be no certainty in
his Faith, and then he is mad if he ſuffer for it, as he is who ſuffers for any
mans ſaying, who may be deceived. But we are aſſured both of the Books of
Canonical Scripture, not onely by Apoſtolical tradition unwritten, but alſo by
univerſal tradition, and the evidence of their authour by their matter, and of
the meaning without Popiſh tradition, not onely by common helps of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and arts gotten by ſtudy, and the benefit of later and elder Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
but alſo by the Spirit of God aſſiſting us when we ſeek it duly. And
for the interruption of this Tradition the Proteſtants do not pretend it to have
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:119447:114"/>
been one whole age or day, though it have been ſometimes more full than at
other times: and we have infallible aſſurance that the whole Bible hath not
been changed or corrupted ſo but that by reaſon of the multitude of copies,
and ſpecial providence of God, the chiefeſt points are free from change, and
what is corrupted may be amended ſo far as is neceſſary for our ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>And conſidering Gods providence for the keeping of the Law, we aſſure our
ſelves the Lord will preſerve the Scripture, which me thinks to <hi>H. T.</hi> ſhould
give good aſſurance, ſith <hi>pag.</hi> 119 he ſaith, <hi>The Church is by</hi> Chriſt <hi>the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory
of all divinely revealed veritie, neceſſary to be known by all, and hath
the promiſe of divine aſſiſtance to all;</hi> whereby and by other arguments it may
be evinced without new revelation from God, that though <hi>H. T.</hi> his apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
tradition unwritten ſhould have failed for any one whole age together, yet
the whole Bible ſhould not in that ſpace be changed or corrupted. And this is
Reply enough to his venemous Anſwer to that Objection, which tends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the Scriptures authority (which confeſſedly comes from God) to exalt the
authority of the worſt of men, the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the ſtories of their
Lives proves ſufficiently</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is further urged. Object.</hi> Many other ſigns alſo did <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the ſight of
his Diſciples, which are not written in this Book, but theſe are written, that you
may believe that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Son of God, and that believing you may have Life
in his Name, St. <hi>John</hi> 20. 30, 31. Therefore St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel contains all
things neceſſary to ſalvation. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny your Conſequence; for St. <hi>John</hi>
omitted many things of great moment, as our Lord's Prayer and his laſt Supper,
which are both neceſſary to be believed. And though he ſay, Theſe things are
written that we may believe and have life, he ſays not, that theſe things onely
were written, or are ſufficient for that purpoſe, which is the thing in queſtion, ſo
that he excludes not the reſt of the Gospels nor Apoſtolical traditions. And it
is no unuſual thing in Scripture to aſcribe the whole effect to that which is but the
cauſe in part; thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſeth beatitude to every ſingle <hi>Chriſtian</hi> virtue.
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 5. and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Salvation to every one that ſhall call on the Name
of our Lord, or confeſs with his mouth the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and believe that God hath
raiſed him from the dead, Rom. 10. 4, 9, 10. Yet more than this is requiſite to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>I reply. He that ſaith, <hi>Theſe things are written that you may believe, and
believing have life,</hi> doth inculcate that theſe are ſufficient ſo far as writing or
revealing is requiſite to theſe ends, or elſe he ſhould make a vain attempt. <hi>Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra
ſit quod non aſſequitur finem, That is done in vain which attains not the
end,</hi> and that is vainly done even deliberately, which is attempted to be done
by that means which is foreknown to be inſufficient. And therefore <hi>H. T.</hi>
muſt either yield St. <hi>John's</hi> Goſpel ſufficient to beget ſaith and procure life, or
elſe <hi>John</hi> to have been imprudent to intend and attempt it by writing it. And
therefore he doth ill to deny the Conſequence till he can avoid theſe abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
As for his Reaſon it is inſufficient. For though <hi>the Lord's Prayer and
the Lord's Supper omitted by</hi> John <hi>be neceſſary to be believed,</hi> yet they are not
ſo neceſſary but that we may believe, <hi>that</hi> Jeſus <hi>is the Son of God, and have
life in his Name</hi> without them. And though he ſay not, <hi>that theſe things one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were written,</hi> yet he ſaith, <hi>Theſe things onely which were written were for
belief and life;</hi> and therefore ſufficient thereto. And though he excludes
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:119447:114"/>
not the reſt of the Goſpels, nor Apoſtolical Traditions, yet he determines that
they might believe and have life without them. As for the aſcribing beatitude
and ſalvation to each ſingle <hi>Chriſtian</hi> virtue, it is either becauſe the beatitude is
meant of a beatitude in part, or in ſome reſpect, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 5. the reaſon doth
import, or elſe becauſe all other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> virtues and duties neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are connex or comprehended in that one which is named. And thus this
Objection is vindicated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The next is. Object.</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us he hath written of all thoſe things
which <hi>Jeſus</hi> did and taught, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 1. Therefore all things neceſſary to ſalvation
are contained in his Gospel. <hi>Anſw.</hi> He writ of all the principal paſſages of
his Life and Death, I grant, (and that was the whole ſcope and intent of the
Evangeliſts) of all abſolutely which he did and taught, I deny; for in the ſame
Chapter he tells us, that during the fourty days which <hi>Chriſt</hi> remained with them
after his Reſurrection, he often appeared to them, inſtructing them in the things
concerning the Kingdom of God, very few of which inſtructions are mentioned by
St. <hi>Luke,</hi> nor does he or any other of the Evangeliſts ſay any thing in their Goſpels
of the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, or of the things by him revealed to the Church,
which were great and many according to that, I have many things to ſay to you, but
you cannot now bear them, but when the Spirit of Truth cometh he ſhall teach
you all Truth, and the things which are to come he ſhall ſhew you, St. <hi>John</hi> 16.
12, 13, 14. Add to this, that if all things which <hi>Jeſus</hi> taught and did ſhould be
written, the whole World would not contain the Books, St. <hi>John</hi> cap. 21.
verſ. laſt. Therefore your Conſequence is falſe, and that ſaying of St. <hi>Luke</hi> is to
be limited.</p>
                  <p>I reply, I grant the ſaying of <hi>Luke</hi> is to be limited, and yet the conſequence
is not falſe. It is true, <hi>that St.</hi> Luke <hi>did not write all abſolutely without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
which</hi> Jeſus <hi>did and taught,</hi> neither doth he ſay it, nor is the argument
ſo framed as if he did; but thus, Luke <hi>wrote of all the things which</hi> Jeſus <hi>began
to do and teach untill the day that he was taken up,</hi> and theſe were all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſalvation, therefore <hi>Luke's</hi> Goſpel contains all things neceſſary to
ſalvation. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſay, <hi>that things of meer belief neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are contained in the holy-days, Creeds, and Service of their Church,</hi> and
<hi>H. T.</hi> himſelf in the next leaf, <hi>pag.</hi> 118. ſays, <hi>The whole frame of neceſſary
points of</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Doctrine was in a manner made ſenſible and viſible by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and uniform practiſe of the Church</hi> Now theſe are onely the principal
paſſages of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Life and Death, beſides which many more practical points
and all fundamental Goſpel-truths are delivered therein, therefore even by
their own grant all neceſſary points of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine are taught in the
Goſpel of <hi>Luke.</hi> It is certain their intent eſpecially of <hi>John</hi> was to write of
his divine nature, and ſuch Sermons as tend to rectifie the Errours of the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and predictions of his Death, Reſurrection, and ſtate
of the Church after his Aſcenſion. It is true, he did inſtruct them for fourty
days after his Reſurrection in the things concerning the Kingdom of God,
but whether they are mentioned by <hi>Luke</hi> or not it is uncertain; that they are
delivered by Tradition oral, unwritten or neceſſary to ſalvation, ſo as that
without an explicit knowledge of then it cannot be had, is not proved. The
ſame may be ſaid of the things mentioned <hi>John 16. 12, 13, 14. &amp; 21. verſ. laſt,</hi>
and therefore the conſequence is not infringed by theſe Exceptions. I add that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:119447:115"/>
                     <hi>H. T.</hi> ſays not true, <hi>that</hi> Luke <hi>ſays not any thing in his Gospel of the coming
of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 33. the Prediction of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>ſending the
Promiſe of the Father,</hi> which <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 33. is expreſly termed <hi>the Promiſe of the

to ſalvation, either for belief or practiſe for all ſorts of men
whatſoever, and that explicitly and plainly. Therefore the Bible is the Rule
of Faith. Anſw. I deny both Antecedent and Conſequence. The three
Creeds are not there, the four first Councils are not there; there is nothing
expreſly prohibiting Polygamy or Rebaptization, nor expreſly affirming three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Perſons in one divine nature, or the Sons conſubstantiality to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from both, or that the Holy Ghoſt is
God, or for the neceſſity of Infant baptiſm; or for changing the Saturday into
Sunday, &amp;c. all which notwithſtanding are neceſſary to be known by the
whole Church, and to be believed by us in particular (as Proteſtants will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge)
if they be once ſufficiently propoſed to us by the Church. Nor is it
ſufficient we believe all the Bible, unleſs we believe it in the true ſenſe, and be
able to confute all Hereſies out of it (I ſpeak of the whole Church) which ſhe
can never do without the Rule of Apoſtolical Tradition in any of the Points
forementioned.</p>
                  <p>I Reply, unleſs the man had a minde to plead for <hi>Arians, Photinians, Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorians,</hi>
and <hi>Socinians,</hi> I know not why he ſhould ſo often <hi>make the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of three diſtinct Perſons in one divine nature, the Sons conſubſtantiality
to the Father, the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from both, and his Godhead as
Apoſtolical unwritten Tradition.</hi> Sure this is the way to bring into queſtion
theſe Doctrines, which if they be not in Scripture, will never be believed by
intelligent <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for the Pope and Council of <hi>Trent's</hi> ſayings, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
never tended to clear truth, but to juggle with the World. This is one
certain evidence that they never intended to clear truth, becauſe they condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Doctrines of Proteſtants unheard, nor would ever permit them to come to
plead for themſelves in any impartial aſſembly, till which be done no man can
conſtrue the proceedings of a Council to be any other than practiſes to ſuppreſs
truth. And for their juggling they were ſo notorious, that many Papiſts
themſelves have obſerved them, as may be ſeen in the Hiſtory of the Council
of <hi>Trent,</hi> eſpecially about the divine right of Biſhops, of the Laity having
the Cup, Prieſts Marriages, in which Papiſts themſelves found that they were
meerly mocked by the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> As for this mans denying
the Antecedent, it ſeems to me to ſavour of ſuch an imputation of a defect in God
as tends to Atheiſm: For ſure he is not to be termed a provident and juſt God,
who declaring his minde in the Scripture, and promiſing life to them that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:119447:115"/>
his Word, and threatning Death and Damnation to them that do not
believe and obey, yet doth not ſet down all neceſſary points therein to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and obeyed unto life. Yea, doth not <hi>H. T.</hi> by denying it contradict
himſelf, who ſaith, <hi>pag. 105. In the Doctrines which</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his Apoſtles
taught, and the Books which they wrote are contained all things that are of
Faith.</hi> And for the Conſequence if it be not good, The Bible contains all
things neceſſary to ſalvation, either for belief or practiſe for all ſorts of men
whatſoever, and that explicitly and plainly; therefore the Bible is the Rule of
Faith, neither is his own ſecond argument good for Tradition, <hi>pag. 105. In
the Doctrines which</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his Apoſtles taught, and the Books which they
wrote, are contained all things that are of Faith, therefore the infallible means
of knowing them is the infallible and true Rule of Faith;</hi> in both the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
being the ſame.</p>
                  <p>As for his Inſtances, I ſay, If the three Creeds and four firſt Councils be
not in the Scripture they are not neceſſary to be known for the whole Church,
and to be believed by us in particular, though they be ſufficiently propoſed to
us by the Church, that is, in their non-ſenſe gibberiſh the Pope or a general
Council approved by him require us to receive them. Neither hath <hi>the Church</hi>
(as he terms it) power <hi>to propoſe any thing as neceſſary to be known for the
whole Church, and to be believed by us in particular,</hi> but what is contained in
the Bible; nor hath it ſuch authority as that we are bound to believe them if it
do propound them, though never ſo ſufficiently, but are bound to reject them as
contrary to the duty we ow to <hi>Chriſt</hi> of acknowledging him our onely Maſter;
much more reaſon have we to contend againſt them, when they are propounded
by the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> who teach not the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but cruelly and
proudly tyrannize over the ſouls and bodies of the Saints in a moſt <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi>
manner, and impoſe on them as Apoſtolical traditions things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles in the Bible. Nor is it true, <hi>that all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
will acknowledge all thsſe Points he mentioneth as neceſſary to be known
for the whole Church, and to be believed by us in particular.</hi> I grant <hi>it not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for us to believe all the Bible, unleſs we believe it in the true ſenſe,</hi> but
aver we can believe it in the true ſenſe, and be able to confute all Hereſies out of

in which the Errour is, as our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> was able by it to vanquiſh Satan,
for which reaſon it is termed <hi>the Sword of the Spirit, Epheſ.</hi> 6. 17. And for
Traditions, or Popes Decrees, they are but a Leaden Sword without Fire

Apoſtles own hands we have not) or who can convince that any one Text of the
Bible can have no other ſenſe and meaning than what is convenient for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
inſiſting onely on the dead Letter? All which dangers, and difficulties are
avoided by relying on Apoſtolical tradition, which bindes men under pain of
Damnation, to deliver nothing for Faith, but what they have received as ſuch by
hand to hand from Age to Age, and in the ſame ſenſe in which they have received
it. Think me not fooliſh (ſays St. <hi>Auguſtin)</hi> for uſing theſe terms; for I have
ſo learned theſe things by Tradition, neither dare I deliver them to thee any other
way than as I have received them, Lib. de utilit. cred. cap. 3.</p>
                  <p>I reply, A more impudently and palpably falſe Diſcourſe than this is a man
ſhall ſeldom meet with, it being contrary to all experience and uſe among men,
and condemns all the cuſtomes of the moſt civil people of folly in Writing
and Printing their Statutes, Records, Deeds, Wills, Hiſtories, that they may
be more certain and ſafely preſerved, as knowing, that oral Traditions are apt
to be loſt, and corrupted, perſons underſtandings, memories, reports, lives,
and all their affairs being mutable and liable to innumerable caſualties. Yea,
hereby God himſelf is condemned of imprudence, in cauſing <hi>Moſes</hi> and all
the ſacred Writers to write Books, and our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> in giving <hi>John</hi> expreſs
charge to write, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 19. commending the Scripture, <hi>Rom. 15. 4. 2 Tim.</hi>

not Printing a great Benefit to the World? Was not the finding of the Book
of the Law, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34 15. the reading of it by <hi>Ezra, Nehem.</hi> 8. the having of

than ears? Do not men complain of the Darkneſs of Times for want of
Books? Are not the ninth and tenth ages ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> counted unhappy for
want of learned Writers? Was not this the great unhappineſs that came into
the Weſt by the Inundations of barbarous Nations in that they ſpoiled Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries?
Is it not a thing for which <hi>Ptolomaeus Philadelphus</hi> was renowned,
that he ſtored the Library at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> with Books? do not we
count them great Benefactours who build and preſerve Libraries? Are not
therefore Students encouraged, and they that ſearch Libraries the men that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
truth to the World? Were the things done before the Flood or ſince
better preſerved by oral Tradition than by <hi>Moſes</hi> Writing? Were the things
done before the Wars of <hi>Troy</hi> better preſerved thereby than theſe Wars by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's</hi>
Poems? Or the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Antiquities by the Songs of <hi>Bardes</hi> than by
<hi>Julius Caeſar's</hi> Commentaries, <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and other Hiſtorians Writings? How
quickly are men apt to miſtake and miſreport ſayings appears by the miſtake of
<hi>Christ's</hi> ſpeeches, <hi>John 2. 19. Matth. 26. 62. John</hi> 21 23. That which <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>

Elders of <hi>Afia lib. 2. adverſ. Haeret. cap.</hi> 39. and innumerable other inſtances
prove, there is nothing more uncertain than oral Tradition from hand to hand.
A man may eaſily perceive this man is reſolved to outface plain truth, who is
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:119447:116"/>
not aſhamed thus to aver <hi>that it is a miſtake to ſay that Books are a more ſafe

proves the contrary: For why did he write but for more ſure conveying and

Oral Reports are infinitely more liable to caſualties and corruptions than
Books, as well by reaſon of the variety of Languages in which Reports are
uttered, as the diverſity of Interpreters, ſcarce any two Interpreters agreeing, but
all pretending one to mend the others, beſides the multiplicity of expreſſions
and relatours one not agreeing with the other, as <hi>Mark</hi> 14 56, 59. with the
equivocations and uncertainties or Witneſſes words, if captiouſly wreſted or
literally inſiſted on. Who can prove any one oral Tradition, which is not
univerſal and written alſo to be infallible or uncorrupted (thoſe that were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the Apoſtles own tongues we have not) or who can convince that any
one oral Tradition can have no other ſenſe or meaning than what is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for his purpoſe inſiſting onely on the ſound of a reporter? All which dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and difficulties are avoided as much as is neceſſary by relying on the
written Word of the Bible, which under pain of Damnation bindes men to
deliver nothing for Faith, but what they have received as ſuch from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and
his Apoſtles in their Writings by hand to hand from age to age, and in the
ſame ſenſe in which they have received it. It is true, Books are ſubject to
caſualties and corruptions, yet not to ſo many as oral Tradition, and the
caſualties are better prevented by Writing, which remains the ſame,
than by Reports which vary. <hi>Fama tam ficti pravique tenax quam nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia

the World of Bibles, ſo the providence of God hath been wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in preſerving them and their genuine writing and meaning even by
the diſperſing of Copies, that what is amiſs in one may be mended in another,
by ordering variety of Tranſlations to the ſame end, perſecutions that they
ſhould not be in all places at once, ſtirring up others to make Tractates, and
Commentaries on them, all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (till the late Faction at <hi>Trent,</hi> and the late
Papal tyranny denied the liberty of tranſlating and reading of the Bible in the
vulgar Tongue without leave, and began to puniſh in their Inquiſition the
having them) reverencing and reading the holy Scripture, however the
Decree of Councils and Popes were neglected, yea Traditours of the Bible to
be burnt were moſt infamous.</p>
                  <p>As for the words of <hi>Auſtin lib. de util. cred. cap.</hi> 3. they are falſly cited and

                     <hi>But</hi> H. T. <hi>in his ſottiſh vein adds,</hi> As to your difficulty of ſpeculative
Points, I anſwer, that the whole frame of neceſſary Points of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was in a manner made ſenſible and viſible by the external and uniform
practiſe of the Church. The incarnation and all the Myſteries thereof by the
holy Images of <hi>Chriſt</hi> erected in all ſacred places, the Paſſion by the ſign of the
Croſs uſed in the Sacraments, and ſet up in Churches. The Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by
the unbloody Sacrifice of the Maſs, which is a lively Commemoration of it.
The Trinity and Unity by doing all thing in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. now who can doubt but that oral Tradition
thus ſeconded by the outward and uniform practiſe of the whole World is a much
ſafer, and more infallible Rule for conſerving revealed verities than Books or
dead Letters, which cannot explicate themſelves.</p>
                  <p>I reply, were not this man bewitched, or as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſai</hi> 44. 20.
<hi>Fed on Aſhes, having a deceived heart that turneth him aſide, ſo as that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſay, Is there not a Lie in my right hand?</hi> he would never have preferred
<hi>oral Tradition ſeconded by erecting and uſe of Images</hi> made by idolatrous Sots,
and termed <hi>Teachers of Lies</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Hab, 2. 18. as a ſafer and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Rule of Faith than the holy Scriptures</hi> inſpired by God, and his great
gift to men, though impiouſly termed by this Wretch <hi>dead Letters.'</hi> But it is
the juſt judgement of God that <hi>they that make Images</hi> and adore them <hi>ſhould
be like them. Pſalm</hi> 115. 8. that is, as blockiſh as the Images are. How uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
oral Tradition is hath been ſhewed, and how impoſſible it is to be a true
and right Rule ſince the departure of thoſe who could preach infallibly. <hi>That
there is any ſuch uniform and outward practiſe of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, which can
ſecond oral Tradition, aud make any Point of</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Doctrine, much leſs the
whole frame of neceſſary Points of</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Doctrine in a manner viſible and
ſenſible is a Lie</hi> with a witneſs. <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine doth not conſiſt in the
Hiſtory of the things ſenſible to the eye, but in the opening of the true cauſes,
and ends, and uſes of things done, which can onely be apprehended by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and is brought to it by hearing and reading, whence <hi>Faith is</hi>
ſaid <hi>to come by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God, Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15, 17.
It is moſt falſe, <hi>that the erecting of Images of</hi> Chriſt <hi>and of the Croſs hath
been the uniform practiſe of the Church.</hi> It is certain by many Writers that
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> had no Images in their Churches for many hundred years, yea, it is
certain that the beſt Emperours and Biſhops of the Eaſt and Weſt were againſt
the having them in Churches, however <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> by his
ſuperſtitious oppoſing <hi>Serenus</hi> his taking them down counting them <hi>Lay-men's
Books,</hi> opened a Gap to that Deluge of Ignorance and Idolatry, which hath
ſince ſpread over the Weſtern Churches, which have gone a whoring after them.
This Authour calls them <hi>holy Image</hi> which the Scripture counts abominable,
as defiling places, and making them not ſacred but polluted. He ſaith, <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
and all the Myſteries thereof are made ſenſible by the Images of</hi> Chriſt
<hi>erected in all ſacred places, the paſſion by the ſign of the Croſs uſed in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and ſet up in Churches.</hi> But what a notorious falſhood is this? One
Myſtery ſure is the Holy Ghoſt's overſhadowing the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> another the
Union of the two Natures? Can any Image of <hi>Chriſt</hi> teach theſe? What
can the ſign of the Croſs teach, but that there was ſuch a kinde of puniſhment
to put men to Death? If Images did teach theſe Myſteries, then Image-makers
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:119447:117"/>
would be <hi>Stewards of the Myſteries of God,</hi> and Succeſſours of the Apoſtles,
and <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> and ſuch like Painters and Carvers more truly <hi>Peter's</hi>
Succeſſours and Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> than Popes, as doing more to teach the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of God than Popes do. <hi>The unbloody Sacrifice of the Maſs</hi> is a meer
figment of a thing preſent, which all the ſenſe of all the men in the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts,
full of apiſh geſtures and toyiſh faſhions, fitter for a Stage-play than a
ſpiritual Service of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, and being in a Tongue not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
underſtood, without teaching, informs not the Hearers or Seers in the
Myſtery of the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor makes any lively Commemoration of his
Paſſion, but pleaſeth ſuperſtitious and womaniſh or childiſh ſpirits, which are
taken with ſuch ſhews; the Sacrament opens no Myſtery thereof without the
Word written. <hi>Accedat Verbum ad Elementum &amp; fit Sacramentum,</hi> was the
old reſolution, <hi>Put the Word to the Element then it is made a Sacrament.</hi> Nor
is it true, <hi>that the practice hath been uniform therein,</hi> the variety of Miſſals,
and the corruptions purged out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Miſſal, as is confeſſed in Pope
<hi>Pius</hi> the fifth his Bull according to the Decree of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council prove the
contrary. The Trinity is known by the inſtitution and practiſe of Baptiſm,
but that is learned out of the written Word, not oral Tradition. None of theſe
practiſes do at all open the Myſtery of the Goſpel, as experience ſhews, it being
manifeſt by conference that none of the People in <hi>Italy</hi> and elſewhere, who go
to Maſs, and look on Pictures, and have no other teaching, do underſtand any
thing of the Myſtery of the Goſpel, the end, reaſon, uſe of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Birth, or
Death, but content themſelves with a meer theatrical ſhew without any true
underſtanding of the grace of God, inward feeling or effectual change in their
ſouls thereupon. Perhaps it is better with Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> where their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions
are not altogether ſo groſs, and their underſtanding bettered by
neighbourhood and converſe with Proteſtants. But that Images ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
revealed verities, or oral Tradition ſeconded with Images more explicate
them than Books, which this man again impiouſly terms <hi>dead Letters,</hi> unleſs
the Images be animated, as that was that it's ſaid told <hi>Thomas Aquinas,
Thou haſt written well of me,</hi> which was fit to be ſilenced by telling it, that it
<hi>had no allowance to ſpeak in the Church,</hi> is to me unintelligible. And if theſe
be <hi>ſuch a ſafe and infallible Rule or means to teach and conſerve the whole frame
of</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Doctrine,</hi> then ſure <hi>Chriſt</hi> did inconſiderately appoint Writers
and Preachers to teach and guide the Church, <hi>till we all meet in the unity of
the Faith, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. he ſhould rather for the times after the Apoſtles
have appointed, Maſſing Prieſts and Painters to have taught the People: nor
were the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> and ſome of the Popes ſo adviſed, as they might
have been, in appointing the unneceſſary buſineſſes of framing a Catechiſm,
and amending the vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> Edition of the Bible, and much more fooliſh
have been all the learned Papiſts, who have in late years and formerly made
large Commentaries and other Treatiſes to conſerve revealed verities, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a more compendious way by oral Traditions with the uſe of Images, and
Maſſes, and ſome other things, if this impudent Scribler ſay true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet</hi> H. T. <hi>continues thus. Object.</hi> If all things neceſſary to ſalvation be
not contained in the whole Bible, now ſhall a man ever come to know what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:119447:118"/>
to be known, either by the whole Church in general, or himſelf in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar?
<hi>Anſw.</hi> For the whole Church in general, ſhe is obliged to know all divinely
revealed verities, which are neceſſary to the ſalvation of all mankinde, ſhe being
made by <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Depoſitory of all, and having the Promiſe of divine aſſiſtance
to all. And for each particular man ſo much onely it neceſſary to be believed, as is
ſufficiently propoſed to him by the Church and her Miniſters for the Word of God,
or would at the leaſt be ſo propoſed, if he himſelf were not in fault; all which
we may eaſily come to know by means of Apoſtolical tradition, without which we
can have no infallible aſſurance of any Point of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>I reply, neither the Church nor her Miniſters can ſufficiently propoſe to any
man for the Word of God any other than the Scripture, by which we may have
infallible aſſurance of any Point of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine without oral Tradition
unwritten. And to ſay that the whole Church in general, and not each man in
particular, is obliged to know all divinely revealed verities which are neceſſary
to the ſalvation of all mankinde, is to ſpeak contradictions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet once more ſaith</hi> H. T. <hi>Object.</hi> You dance in a vicious Circle, proving
the Scripture and the Churches infallibility by Apoſtolical tradition, and tradition
by the Scripture, and the Churches infallibility. <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, we go on by a
right Rule towards Heaven. We prove indeed the Churches infallibility and
the credibility of the Scriptures by Apoſtolical tradition, but that is evident of
it ſelf, and admits no other proof. When we bring Scripture for either we uſe it
onely as a ſecondary teſtimony or argument <hi>ad hominem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I reply, if this be ſo, then doth <hi>H T.</hi> in his Title-page pretend demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his falſly called Catholick Religion by Tents of holy Scripture in the
firſt place onely as a ſecondary teſtimony or argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> but it is
oral Apoſtolical tradition which he principally relies on for his demonſtration,
as being evident of it ſelf, and admits no other proof; which oral Apoſtolical
Tradition being no other than what Popes and Councils approved by him have
approved, it follows, that what Papiſts call Catholick Religion is not what the
Scriptures teach, but what Popes and their Councils define, into which their
Faith is ultimately reſolved. No marvel then they decline Scripture, or if
they uſe it do it onely becauſe of Proteſtants importunity, not becauſe they
think it is to be reſted on, and if ſo, ſure <hi>H. T.</hi> plays the Hypocrite in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to demonſtrate his Religion out of Texts of holy Scripture. If other
Papiſts would ſtick to this which <hi>H. T.</hi> here ſaith, we ſhould take it as a thing
confeſſed, that Popery is not Scripture doctrine, but onely unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to have for its bottom foundation the Popes determination, and ſo to
be imbraced upon his credit; which ſure can beget no other than a humane
faith, and in fine doth make the Pope Lord of their Faith, which is all one as
to make him their <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that is to make him an <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Therefore I
conceive other <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will diſown this reſolution of <hi>H. T.</hi> and ſeek other
ways to get out of this Circle, and herein they go divers ways. Dr. <hi>Holden</hi>
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man and Doctor of <hi>Paris,</hi> in his Book of <hi>the Analyſis of divine
Faith, chap.</hi> 9. rejects the common way, and ſticks to that of univerſal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:119447:118"/>
which by natural reaſon is evident and firm: But when he hath urged
this as far as he can, this muſt be the evidence, that what all ſay and was ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
know by ſo many Miracles as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles wrought muſt
be infallibly true. But the being of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Moſſiah,</hi> and his Doctrine from
God, as the holy Scriptures declare, is avouched by all the Church and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
known by Miracles, therefore it muſt be true: which is no other than
<hi>Chillingworth's</hi> univerſal Tradition, confirming the truth of the Scriptures,
and deriving our Faith from thence, which if Papiſts do relinquiſh and adhere
to the Popes reſolutions, whether they be with Scripture or without, they do
expreſly declare themſelves Papiſts or Diſciples of the Pope, not <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
that is, Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I conclude therefore that <hi>H. T.</hi> and ſuch as hold
with him according to the Principle he here ſets down are not Believers in
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Doctrine is delivered in the Scripture, but in men whether Popes,
or Councils, or the univerſal Church, or any other who delivers to him that
oral Tradition, which is his Rule, as being evident of it ſelf, and admits no
other proof, though I have ſhewed it to be uncertain, yea, not ſo much as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.

intrenching more on the Rule of Faith or the Authority of the Church
than Schiſm or Hereſie: we ſhall here briefly ſhew what they are, and who are
juſtly chargeable therewith. Our Tenet is, that not onely Hereſie (which is a
wilfull ſeparation from the Doctrine of the Catholick Church) but alſo Schiſm
(which is a ſeparation from her government) is damnable and ſacrilegious, and
that moſt Sectaries are guilty of both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Think Infidelity doth more intrench on the Rule of Faith than
Hereſie, and Hereſie may be where there is no intrenching on the
Authority of the Church in this Authour's own ſenſe, as when a
man living in communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and owning
the Pope, or being the Pope himſelf is an <hi>Arian,</hi> as Pope <hi>Liberius,</hi> or a <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelite</hi>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:119447:119"/>
as Pope <hi>Honorius.</hi> And for his definition of Hereſie, it is in mine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
too obſcure and imperfect. For it neither ſhews what is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, the ſeparation from whoſe Doctrine makes Hereſie, nor what
Doctrines of it the ſeparation from which makes Hereſie, nor what ſeparation
in heart or profeſſion, or other act, nor when it is wilfull when not, nor how it
may be known to be wilfull. Nor doth this definition agree with their own
Tenets, who acquit many from Hereſie, who wilfully ſeparate from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Catholick Church, as they define it, to wit, that which is defined
by a general Council approved by a Pope. As for inſtance, The Popiſh
<hi>French</hi> Church is acquitted from Hereſie, yet they hold a Council to be above
the Pope, contrary to the laſt <hi>Lateran</hi> Council approved by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth.
Nor is this definition at all proved by this Authour, but taken as granted,
though it may be juſtly queſtioned. And for the uſe of the terms <hi>[Hereſie]</hi>
and <hi>[Hereticks]</hi> in the Ancients it is certain, that many are put in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of Hereticks by <hi>Philaſtrius, Epiphanius, Auguſtin,</hi> and alſo by other
Writers elder and later, and thoſe opinions termed Hereſies, which were not ſo.
The like faults are in the definition of Schiſm, in not ſetting down which is the
Catholick Church, what is her government, what ſeparation of heart, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
profeſſion, or other act it is which makes Schiſm. Nor is this a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Popes ſeparated from the government of the Pope, and the <hi>French</hi> in their

fifth his Monitory, deny themſelves to be Schiſmaticks. Nor is it ſhewed how
either is damnable or ſacrilegious, nor how Proteſtants are Sectaries, or which
Sectaries are guilty of both or either. So that in this Tenet there is nothing
but ambiguity and imperfection: yet ſith by what follows we may gheſs his

                  <p>The Argument, ſaith H. T. All ſuch as are wilfully divided both from the

Sectaries are wilfully divided both from the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the
Catholick Church. Therefore they are Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
in a damnable ſtate. The Major is manifeſt out of the very notion
and definition of Schiſm and Hereſie: The ſequel of it proved thus by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                     <hi>Roman</hi> Church falſly by him called Catholick. There is no need of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining

                  <p>The <hi>Minor, ſaith he,</hi> is proved, becauſe <hi>Luther</hi> and his fellow Proteſtants di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
themſelves from the Communion of all Churches, therefore from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Catholick Church, and that as well in Points of Doctrine as
matters of Government, as plainly appears by all we have ſaid, and is yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
becauſe when they began their Separation <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>Germany, Tyndal</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. the Catholick Church was in moſt quiet poſſeſſion of her Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
in perfect peace and unity, her Doctrine and Government being the ſame
they had been, not onely to the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great (as Proteſtants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs)
but to the very time of the Apoſtles, as is manifeſt both by the publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,
Councils, and Records of all Ages, in which no one Doctrine of Faith,
or ſubſtantial Point of Diſcipline, then profeſſed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick
Church, and oppoſed by Proteſtants, had ever been cenſured and condemned as
heretical or ſchiſmatical, but all for the most part actually defined and eſtabliſhed

<hi>Luther</hi> and his fellow Proteſtants, and <hi>Tyndal</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> now it is no good
proof againſt us, that we are Schiſmaticks, becauſe <hi>Luther</hi> and his fellow Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
were ſo, and <hi>Tyndal</hi> began Separation in <hi>England.</hi> It is told them by

and ſo a Schiſm in the Leaders, and yet no Schiſm in the Followers in after

Government and Governour in the firſt Authours, and yet none in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
to continue them, but rather their duty to maintain them in order to the
peace and liberty which was unjuſtly obtained at firſt.</hi> 2. It is denied that
<hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Tyndal divided themſelves wilfully,</hi> that is, without neceſſity. It is
known in the Hiſtory of <hi>Sleidan,</hi> and others, that <hi>Luther</hi> at firſt ſpake ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
of the Pope, and was willing to have continued in communion with
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church till <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth did by his Bull condemn his Doctrine,
afore he had heard him, and he ſaw plainly (as the World found by experience)
that the Popes and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> did never by good proofs out of Scripture
go about to refute them, but by Excommunications, Fire, and War, (to
which Emperours and Kings were ſtirred up by them) endeavour to root them
out. And for <hi>Tyndal</hi> it is manifeſt by the Book of <hi>Acts and Monuments of
the Church</hi> written by Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, that <hi>Tyndal</hi>
was perſecuted by the Popiſh Biſhops, and his body burnt in <hi>Brabant.</hi> Now
ſure were the Proteſtants never ſo erroneous, yet the Law of Nature ties them
to run away from ſuch cruel Wolves, as in ſtead of teaching them with love, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to deſtroy them with cruelty. 3. It is moſt falſe, that <hi>Luther</hi> and his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
divided themſelvs from the communion of all Churches: It is certain, that
they actually joyned with the remainder of the <hi>Huſſites</hi> in <hi>Bohomia,</hi> and the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi>
about the <hi>Alpes,</hi> who were true Churches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> however the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>
term them: nor did they ever renounce communion with the <hi>Greek.</hi> Eaſtern
or Southern Churches, though by reaſon of diſtance, and the Power they were
under, they could not have actual communion with them. And by their deſire
of a free Council in <hi>Germany</hi> not called by the Pope, but the Emperour and
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, nor of Biſhops ſworn to the Pope, but of men that were
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:119447:120"/>
equal Judges by whom their Doctrine might be examined, and by their often
Colloquies for Reconciliation they plainly ſhewed, that they tried all means
they could with a good conſcience to have prevented the breach between them,
and the Popiſh party, who were certainly the cauſe of the Schiſm, and truly
the Schiſmaticks (as may be gathered from their own ſtories, ſuch as <hi>Thuanus,</hi>
Frier <hi>Paul's Hiſtory of the</hi> Trent <hi>Council.</hi> and others, who relate the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of thoſe times) and not the Proteſtants. 4. It is moſt falſe, that they
ſeparated from the Catholick Church in point of Doctrine. It is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the party from whom the Proteſtants ſeparated had relinquiſhed the
Catholick Doctrine of the Scripture, and Primitive times for five hundred
years at leaſt, and had brought in a new upſtart Doctrine of Invocation of
Saints, worſhiping Images, Tranſubſtantiation, half-communion as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
denial of Prieſt's Marriage, Popes univerſal Monarchy, Purgatory-fire,
Indulgences, Sacrifice of the Maſs, Juſtification by Works, and many more,
which were unknown to the firſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor hath the contrary appeared by
any thing <hi>H. T.</hi> hath ſaid before, as the Reader of this Anſwer may perceive.
5. It is moſt falſe, that they ſeparated from the Catholick Church in the point of
her Government. The Government of the whole Church by one univerſal
Biſhop was never the Government of the Catholick Church. It is manifeſt by
the firſt general Councils that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was not acknowledged ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to other Patriarchs, and the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches have always reſiſted his
claim of Supremacy, and many, as <hi>Nilus</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
and others have written againſt it as an unjuſt claim. 6. It is falſe,
that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (falſly by <hi>H. T.</hi> called Catholick) was in moſt quiet
poſſeſſion of her Tenets, when <hi>Luther</hi> began his Separation in <hi>Germany,
Tyndal</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> It is manifeſt by <hi>Cochlaeus</hi> his Hiſtory of the <hi>Huſſites,</hi>
that there were a remnant of them in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by <hi>Thuanus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Morland</hi>
that there was a remnant of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in the <hi>Valleys</hi> of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> by
Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> that there was a remnant of <hi>Lollards</hi> or <hi>Wicteviſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who
did reject the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine then and ſince taught, in many, if not all the
points, in which Proteſtants do now oppoſe it. 7. It is falſe, that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church was in perfect peace and unity when <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Tyndal</hi> began their
Separation. For the controverſies about the Virgin <hi>Marie's</hi> immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
about the Popes Supremacy above a Council, and ſundry other were
rather ſuppreſſed than compoſed, as the event ſhewed, no party relinquiſhing the
holding their Tenets to this day, but each when occaſion is offered contending
for their way. 8. It is falſe, that the Doctrines and Government of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church had been the ſame from that time <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Tyndal</hi> began their
Separation to the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, or that Proteſtants do confeſs it.
It is moſt certain to the contrary, that ſince <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great his time the
Popes univerſal Epiſcopacy, the Worſhip of Images, Tranſubſtantiation, half-Communion
in the Euchariſt, and many other points were brought into the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, as Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> in his <hi>Appeal from</hi> Brereley<hi>'s Apology to King

to it without Hereſie or Schiſm, yea, it is certain, that <hi>Irenaeus, Cyprian,</hi>

of the Eaſtern Biſhops for not holding <hi>Eaſter</hi> with him, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
oppoſing Pope <hi>Stephanus</hi> about Rebaptization, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> oppoſing Popes
<hi>Boniface, Zozimus,</hi> and <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> about the Appeal of <hi>Apiarius.</hi> But let's
view their Sayings.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is thus cited by <hi>H. T. In the ſecond Age</hi> Irenaeus; <hi>God will
judge thoſe who make the Schiſms in the Church, ambitious men, who have not
the honour of God before their eys, but rather embracing their own intereſts than
the unity of the Church, for ſmall and light cauſes divide the great and glorious
body of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c. for in the end they cannot make any Reformation ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
as the evil of Schiſm is prejudicious, lib. 4. cap.</hi> 62. It is likely <hi>H. T.</hi>
ignorantly put <hi>[prejudicious]</hi> for <hi>[pernicious]</hi> or his Authour whence he had
it, for it is in <hi>Irenaeus, Quanta eſt Schiſmatis pernicies.</hi> But it appears,
1. That he hath either not read the place, or not conſidered it, becauſe he puts
in <hi>[God will judge]</hi> whereas it is manifeſt out of the words following <hi>[But he
will judge alſo all thoſe who are out of the truth, that is, without the Church, but
he himſelf is judged of no man]</hi> and from <hi>chap.</hi> 53. and following to be meant
<hi>of every ſpiritual Diſciple of</hi> Chriſt <hi>that had received the Spirit of God, and
the Apoſtolical Doctrine, chap.</hi> 52. alluding to <hi>Paul's</hi> words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. and
he alters <hi>[the love of God]</hi> into <hi>[the honour of God before their eys.]</hi>
2. That the place makes nothing againſt Proteſtants; for it condemns onely
them that <hi>make Schiſms for ſmall and light cauſes,</hi> which was moſt true of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in excommunicating the <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops for not
keeping <hi>Easter</hi> as he did, reprehended by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his Epiſtle recited by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,
hiſt. 1. lib. 5. cap.</hi> 24. but is nothing againſt Proteſtants, who neither
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119447:121"/>
make nor continue Schiſms, and that Separation which they make, they do it
for very great cauſes. And he ſaith, <hi>No Reformation can be made ſo important
by them who divide upon light cauſes, as is the miſchief of the Schiſm they make,</hi>
but this hinders not but that the Proteſtants Reformation, or <hi>correption</hi>
(which is <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his word) is ſo neceſſary, that it countervails the evil of the
Schiſm conſequent. I add, the words of <hi>Irenaeus [the ſpiritual man who is a
Diſciple of</hi> Chriſt <hi>will judge all them who are out of the truth]</hi> do juſtifie the
Proteſtants in judging the Popes and Popiſh Doctors, and Churches as Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Hereticks, who by their Doctrine of Popes Supremacy, Invocation of
Saints, humane Satisfactions, inherent Juſtice juſtifying, Merit of Condignity,
have departed from the Apoſtolical Faith, and by their cruel tyranny and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of Reformation have the moſt horrible and pernicious Schiſm that ever
was in the Church of God, and the Proteſtants are warranted thus to judge by
the holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The words of <hi>Cyprian de unit. Eccleſ.</hi> in the third Age againſt the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
of the inexpiableneſs of their crime of Schiſm, <hi>that it could not be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by ſuffering for</hi> Chriſt, <hi>nor they be Martyrs, though they died for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of his Name,</hi> is too heavy a cenſure, yet if it were true is nothing againſt
Proteſtants, who are not guilty of that Schiſm.</p>
                  <p>The words of <hi>Chryſoſtom hom. 11. in Epheſ.</hi> ſhew how grievous an evil
Schiſm is, but prove not, that they are all Schiſmaticks, that ſeparate from the
<hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop and Church, nor that the Proteſtants are guilty thereof, or the
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> free.</p>
                  <p>The words of <hi>Optatus lib.</hi> 2. are not to any of the points now in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
except he mean by the unity of the Epiſcopal Chair holding communion
with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and aſſert that to be the one Epiſcopal Chair to
which all other are to be ſubject: which if ſo meant, the words are not true;
if meant as <hi>Cyprian</hi> meant, that <hi>there is one Biſhoprick of which each Biſhop
holds a part intirely,</hi> in reſpect of unity of Doctrine, the ſpeech is good, but
not againſt Proteſtants, who hold the unity of that Epiſcopal Chair.</p>
                  <p>The words of <hi>Auguſtine lib. 4. de Symb. fidei ad Catech. cap.</hi> 10. if they
were true, yet are they nothing to the purpoſe, unleſs it were ſaid, that by <hi>the
holy Church</hi> he meant the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that he who is found out of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a ſtranger from the number of ſons, that he hath not God
for his Father, nor will have the Church for his Mother, none of which are
ſaid by him. It is true, there are theſe words in <hi>Auſtin's</hi> ſecond Expoſition on
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 21. with us 22. <hi>ver. 18. He who hath charity is ſecure or ſafe. No man
moveth it out of the Catholick Church.</hi> But theſe words are not againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
but againſt Papiſts, who move it out of the Catholick Church, and
confine it to the <hi>Roman,</hi> and moſt uncharitably damn them, who are not of
their party, therein following the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> whom <hi>Auſtin</hi> there condemns,
who confined the Church to the part of <hi>Donatus</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> And there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
paſſage in the ſame Expoſition which doth juſtifie the Proteſtants and
condemn the Papiſts in the main point of controverſie between us, what ſhall
determine controverſies between us, they ſay the Church, when the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troveſie
is which is the Church, we ſay the Scripture, and ſo doth <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in
theſe words. <hi>The Teſtament of our Father</hi> (that is, the Scriptures, as the words
a little before ſhew) <hi>is come out of any hole, I know not what Thieves would
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:119447:122"/>
take it away, I know not what Perſecutours would burn it. Whenceſoever it is
brought let it be read. Why ſtriveſt thou? We are brethren, why do we ſtrive?
The Father died not without a Will, he made his Will and ſo died, he is dead and
riſen again. So long there is contention about the Inheritance of the Dead untill
the Will be publickly produced, and when the Will is brought into the publick all
are ſilent, that the Tables may be opened and recited. The Judge hears within,
the Advocates are ſilent, the Criers make ſilence, all the People is ſuspended, that
the words of the Dead not perceiving it in the Tomb may be read. He lies
without ſenſe in the Monument, and his words are in force,</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſits in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and is his Teſtament contradicted? Open, let us read, we are Brethren,
why do we contend? Let our minde be pacified, our Father hath not left us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Will. He that made the Will lives for ever, hears our voices, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
his own. Let us read, why do we contend? Where the Inheritance it
ſelf is found, let us hold it.</hi> Theſe words were ſpoken by <hi>Auſtin</hi> againſt <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts,</hi>
and may rightly be applied to Papiſts, who are the true canſe of all the
horrible Schiſms and bloodſheds among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe they will not try
who hath the Inheritance of the Church by the Scriptures, which are God's
Will, but uſurp the name of the Catholick Church, as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did, and
under that pretence trample under foot all their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Brethren in the
World, who have as great and better Portion in the Inheritance of God their
Father and of the Church than themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The words of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Sermon <hi>ſuper geſtis Emeriti,</hi> are not, <hi>that out
of the Church an Heretick may have all things but Salvation.</hi> For he ſaith, <hi>He
may have the Faith,</hi> which he would not ſay of the Heretick, but he ſpeaks it
of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> which whether it be true or no is nothing to Proteſtants,
who are and may be in the true Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and have ſalvation, though
they be not in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The words of</hi> Auguſtine Epiſt. 48. <hi>concerning the</hi> Donatiſts, <hi>that</hi> they were
with other Chriſtians in Baptiſm, in the Creed, and in the other Sacraments of
the Lord, but in the ſpirit of unity, in the bond of peace, and finally in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church you are not with us; <hi>do not at all touch Proteſtants, who are in
the Catholick Church with other</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>though not with the</hi> Roman <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who are moſt like the</hi> Donatiſts; <hi>and the Proteſtants hold with</hi> Auguſtine
<hi>in the ſame Epiſtle,</hi> that that kinde of Letters <hi>(to wit, of Biſhops, ſuch as</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,
Cyprian, &amp;c.) is to be diſtinguiſhed from the authority of the Canon of the

<hi>for you ſeparate from the Catholick Church in that you do not communicate
with the Proteſtant Church of</hi> Chriſt <hi>in</hi> England. It is falſe, that thoſe who
held the ſame truth with Proteſtants under other names, held no communion
with any Nation before <hi>Luther:</hi> For as far as they could, and ought, they
held communion with a. called on the Name of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> in
<hi>France, Bohemia, England,</hi> and elſewhere, under the names of <hi>Waldenſes,

ſame then that they have been in all precedent Ages. Did the Church periſh
(ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to the Donatiſts, or did ſhe not? If ſhe did, what Church
brought forth the Donatiſts? (or the Proteſtants?) If ſhe did not, what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
moved you to ſeparate your ſelves from her, on pretence of avoiding the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of bad men? <hi>lib. 1. cont. Gaudent. cap</hi> 7. And again, We are certain
no man can juſtly ſeparate himſelf from the communion of all Nations (yet <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin

                  </p>
                  <p>I reply, it is a Scolds trick to ſay <hi>we ſlander,</hi> and not to prove it. We prove
out of <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church then held Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by Faith without Works, that every Soul even Popes were to be ſubject
to Princes, that the Scriptures are to be the Rule of Faith, that the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> might fail, that the <hi>Roman</hi> church is but a particular Church, that it is
evil to judge <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for not obſerving difference of Meats and Days, that it
is Idolatry to do, as Papiſts now do, worſhiping the Creature with ſuch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the <hi>Roman</hi> church is not the ſame now as it
was in all precedent Ages, for he rejected the Title of Univerſal Biſhop now
uſurped by the Pope, and diſavowed the Worſhip of Images, with other things
now received at <hi>Rome,</hi> and before him Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> termed the denying the
Cup to the Lay-people <hi>ſacrilegious. Auguſtine</hi> himſelf hath taught us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

the Popiſh church is impoſed on conditions of acknowledging ſuch Errours,
and practiſing ſuch Idolatry as are damnable. We do not ſay, that the church

univerſal or Catholick, and in what ſenſe ſhe is particular, take it in which accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

true Member of the Catholick Church (and ſuch the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
then was in her particular) he conſequently ſeparates from the whole, and is an
Heretick or Schiſmatick.</p>
                  <p>I reply, neither as it is taken for the congregation of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> nor as it
notes a collection of all the Churches holding communion with the See of
<hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>Roman</hi> Church rightly termed <hi>the Catholick Church:</hi> the non-ſenſe
and falſhood thereof is ſhewed before <hi>Art. 5. Sect.</hi> 8. Nor is it true <hi>that
he that ſeparates from the Catholick</hi> Roman <hi>Church,</hi> in either ſenſe <hi>is an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
or Schiſmatick.</hi> And to his proof I ſay, 1. That many Proteſtants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church a true Member of the Catholick Church when <hi>Luther</hi>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:119447:123"/>
ſeparated, but call it an <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> and malignant Church; and they that
acknowledge it a true Church, in reſpect of the truth of being, yet not of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and they that ſay it had the truth of being, ſay it not of the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
part, but of the latent, conceiving it was with them as it was with <hi>Iſrael</hi>
in the days of <hi>Elijah,</hi> that they did not own thoſe Errours and evils which
were practiſed in them, or avouched by them, though living among them, or if
they did yield to them, or ſome of them, they had pardon, as doing it in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
retaining the old Creed of the Apoſtles: And they attribute the truth
of it to the few fundamental Articles which they held, who were in it, though
very unſoundly by reaſon of the errours and corruptions mixed with them,
which made the Church among the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> as a leprous man unfit for
converſe and communion, with whom though they might continue for a
time in expectation of their repentance, yet they might ſay to <hi>Rome</hi> being
found u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>rable, as the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Babylon, Jer. 51. 9. We would have healed</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
<hi>but ſhe is not healed: forſake her, and let us go every one into his own
countrey: for her Judgement reacheth unto the Heaven, and is lifted up unto the
Skies.</hi> 2. That it is not univerſally true, that <hi>he who ſeparates from an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
true Member of the Catholick Church ſepartes from the whole</hi> there
may be a Separation partial not total, privative not poſitive, out of prejudice
and paſſion, in heat not in heart, as between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 15. 39.
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> temporary not perpetual, in prudence though not
out of abſolute neceſſity, neceſſary not voluntary, juſt and not raſh, without
revolt from the Faith, or perſecution of thoſe from whom it is made. In many
of theſe ſorts there may be a Separation which may be from an acknowledged
true Member of the Catholick Church, and yet no Separation from the whole.
And therefore this Poſition of <hi>H. T.</hi> will not be yielded him without better
proof and demonſtration, <hi>that the Separation from the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>which
Proteſtants have made cannot ſtand with union with the Catholick Church in
Doctrine and Diſcipline.</hi> Which ſure he hath not yet proved, nor is it likely he
ever will: but as the faſhion of theſe Scriblers is, ſing over again and again
their Cuckoes Song of the Catholick <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and that Proteſtants
are Hereticks and Sectaries, with other Popiſh gibberiſh, though the folly and
frivolouſneſs thereof hath been a thouſand times demonſtrated.</p>
                  <p>I have thus at laſt examined theſe nine Articles, being moved thereto out of
hope to do ſome ſouls good by recovering them out of the ſnare in which they
are held by Satan and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries. If they ſhut their eys againſt the
light, their judgement will be of themſelves. I ſhall add prayer for them,
that God would open their eys, and, if time, health, and other concurrences
ſuit with my aims, diſcover the vanity of the reſt of <hi>H. T.</hi> his <hi>Manual.</hi> In
the mean time, not as ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> blaſphemouſly <hi>Praiſe be to the Virgin
Mother,</hi> in the end of their Writings, but as <hi>Paul</hi> concluded his Epiſtle to the
<hi>Romans</hi> ſo do I, <hi>To God onely wiſe be glory through</hi> JESUS CHRIST
<hi>for ever. Amen.</hi>
