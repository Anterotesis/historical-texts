            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AS touching the first namely, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> we may obserue &amp; vse a kinde of imitation of men, occasioned to communicate with <hi>mortal Princes,</hi> who are obserued to preponder with themselues; first, how to shape their behauiour, and externall <hi>gesture:</hi> Secondly, how to frame their speech to gaine <hi>Attention</hi> of him to whom they speake: and how to auoide the censure of <hi>indiscretion,</hi> in the deliuery of what they affirme, or defend. If such curiosity and carefulnesse be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily obserued, in our communication with men whose breath is in their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils: how much more obseruant and carefull ought we to be, when we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse our selues to speake vnto the <hi>Maiesty of the immortall God?</hi> To intrude abruptly into the presence of this great God, and vnaduisedly to speake vnto him, becommeth not a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner, but bewrayeth an vnsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb facs="tcp:6307:15"/>
and an vnprepared heart; rather tempting and dishonouring, then glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the name of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before we presume to present our petitions to God, in hope to be heard; we must prepare our selues, not in our outward gesture, onely in eloquence of words, and Pharisaicall outward holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: But in rightly ordering &amp; dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the affections of the inner man; which, if they be set on carnal, or earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>vanities,</hi> if our harts delight in <hi>the fruits of the flesh,</hi> and <hi>the vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table works of darknes:</hi> (though our words be neuer so good of themselues) we may feare the reward of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife, who brought a <hi>part of their substance</hi> (hypocritical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Concealing therest) &amp; laid that part at the <hi>Apostles</hi> feet. So, if we come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God giuing him good words, keeping back our harts, to serue our own carnal and prophane appetites: Shal we thinke that God wil be content with the leaues
<pb facs="tcp:6307:16"/>
of our good words, when we giue the fruits of our hearts to the world? will God take such <hi>hypocrites</hi> by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d? we must know, that vnlesse we can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnfainedly cast off our <hi>carnall thoughts, corrupt desires,</hi> and <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affections,</hi> it cannot be that God, who <hi>loueth holinesse and truth, in the inward affections,</hi> can looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, as vpon his <hi>children,</hi> who speake vnto him, as to a <hi>father,</hi> with counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit words, proceeding from vnsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied hearts. When we come therefore vnto God in prayer, <hi>we must depart from all iniquity,</hi> knowing that <hi>hee heareth not sinners,</hi> such as the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> of God cannot win to obedience; nor his threats inforce to <hi>forsake their sinnes;</hi> who yet will aduenture to rush rashly into the presence of God, in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall kinde of praying with the lips, without any premeditation, preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or reformation of the heart, at all. These offer <hi>words</hi> for <hi>deeds: leaues</hi>

for <hi>fruits: Wolues</hi> for <hi>Lambes;</hi> and all manner, halt, lame, blinde, and blemished <hi>sacrifices,</hi> and yet would seeme holy: And so in stead of a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, procure a curse vnto themselues for their hypocrisie. We must consider that <hi>God is a iealous God, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth none guiltlesse, that taketh his name in vaine</hi> as they manifestly doe, <hi>that come neere him with their lips, when their hearts are far from him.</hi> It is a kinde of spirituall adultery, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to seeme wholy to be Gods, and yet inwardly to be meere worldlings. Before we open our mouthes therefore to God, we must cast out of the Temple of God (which is our heart) <hi>all buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and sellers,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> did out of <hi>the Temple of Ierusalem:</hi> for as long as our hearts doe harbour the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of worldly profits, and carnall pleasures, aboue the sincere seruice of God, our heart, the Temple of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, becommeth a den of theeues,
<pb facs="tcp:6307:17"/>
that steales away all our godly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to settle them on <hi>Belial.</hi> Let vs looke vnto <hi>the man Christ Iesus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> by whose bloud we are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by whose mediation we are sure to haue our prayers heard of God, and granted; especially, if for our further and more perfect preparation, we can truly obserue the rule of <hi>Christ,</hi> to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue our Enemies,</hi> knowing that <hi>if we forgiue not our brother that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth vs, God wil not forgiuevs, that farre more grieuously offend him.</hi> And therefore Christ counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that <hi>if we bring our sacrifice to the Altar,</hi> namely, if we intend to pray; and <hi>there remember that a brother hath ought against vs, we ought to leaue our offering before the Altar,</hi> that is, forbeare for the time to pray, yet to continue our holy intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to pray; and <hi>to goe first, and be reconciled to our brother,</hi> &amp; <hi>then to come to offer our gift;</hi> namely,

               <p>BEing thus prepared, let vs indeuor to yeelde due and true <hi>Attention</hi> in our Prayers, that is, to giue heede to what we pray, to whom we pray, for what we pray, and with what zeale we pray: which are the truest tokens, and greatest arguments, that our prayers are liuely, powerfull, effectuall, and of faith; which properties can neuer be in lip-labour: for there cannot be a more apparant discouery of a rancke Hypocrite, then to make outward shewes of <hi>Deuotion,</hi> with the gesture and lips, and yet the heart to be busied in the cogitation of idle, earthly, and prophane things. And nothing more discouereth an idle heart outwardly, then the wandering of the eye in the time of diuine prayer: for it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and often found by experience, that the eye withdraweth the heart: and if the eye be inconstant, the prayer hath not, nor can haue the due <hi>Attention</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:6307:18"/>
the heart: yet it doth not follow, that although the eye be fixed on any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine obiect, or be shut, that therefore the heart is rightly set on God, for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the eye followes the heart, the cogitation of the heart making the eye to forget it obiect: as when the heart is wandring in the fields of Corne, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heards of Cattell, and flocks of Sheepe, when it is in the Ware-house, in the Shop, in the Chest, minding bands and payments, ouer-come with pride, plotting reuenge, oppressed with feare, besotted with pleasure, intangled with cares, or otherwise peruerted by any prophane and vngodly cogitations. Prayers made with such an extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant heart, be they in words neuer so holy they are imputed vnto vs as sin: for shall we thinke, that God will heare our prayers, to our profit or comfort, when the thoughts of our harts in the meane time dishonor him?

                  <pb facs="tcp:6307:20"/>
yet consider no more what they speake (for want of Attention) then if they spake in an vnknown tongue: &amp; yet such men will hold themselues very deuout, &amp; to haue power in themselues to pray when they list: as if true prayer were of that facility and ease, to vtter, as in an idle tale, and as it seemes by <hi>Beggars,</hi> that tumble out <hi>the Lords Prayer,</hi> with one breath at a dore, &amp; yet minde nothing but their Almes. Such men are to be pittied, and to be wished better to aduise themselues, before they attempt this seruice of God most holy; for <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> is not an easie worke, it is of a deeper straine then a tale, that is but from the tongue to the teeth, from the teeth to the lips, &amp; so into the ayre. <hi>True Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> is cordial, &amp; of that force &amp; efficacy, as it constraineth the heart to <hi>sighes, groanes,</hi> &amp; <hi>teares,</hi> with such <hi>inward feruency</hi> of holy zeale, as tenters the heart with such internall gripes, as may betruly said, <hi>the renting of the heart.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6307:20"/>
And the more we feele our hearts thus inwardly sharply touched: so much the more comfort it yeeldeth to the soule of the faithfull Petitioner, yea such, and so great consolation, as he that feeles it cannot expresse it with his tongue, be he neuer so eloquent; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any conceiue or apprehend the sweetnesse of it, that is not exercised and experienced in the same; for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture apprehendeth it not. <hi>No man can say that Iesus is Christ, but by the holy Ghost:</hi> and none can desire <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> but by <hi>the Spirit of God, Flesh &amp; bloud</hi> cannot as much as desire <hi>spirituall things,</hi> spiritually; for <hi>spirituall things are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with spirituall things,</hi> and <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts</hi> are obtained by <hi>spirituall meanes:</hi> And therefore are <hi>words</hi> without the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as naked and bare Incense without fire: but, being inkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in the heart, and sanctified by the holy Spirit of God, who is promised to
<pb facs="tcp:6307:21"/>
assist our spirits, they are as a <hi>liuely and acceptable sacrifice to God,</hi> working so powerfully with him, through <hi>Christs</hi> mediation, as they neuer returne empty of whatsoeuer blessing we desire. Prayer can neuer be effectuall, vnlesse there be some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne spirituall obiect of the minde, to moue the attention of the heart, which obiect is God: and we must consider, that when we pray vnto him, or yeeld him any other worship, that we are not to conceiue him, in the forme of any earthly or heauenly, bodily or spiritual creature whatsoeuer: for <hi>in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not to conceiue him, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of conceiuing him aright, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Master</hi> Perkins. God must be conceiued of vs in our prayers, as subsisting in the whole three <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. The Vnity in Trinity, &amp; Trinity in Vnity,</hi> is to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, retayning in minde the distinction
<pb facs="tcp:6307:21"/>
and order of all the three <hi>persons,</hi> without seuering or sundring them: for, as they are conioyned in nature; so are they to be conioyned in worship. And therefore, he that prayeth vnto God the <hi>Father,</hi> for the forgiuenesse of his sinnes, must aske it of him, for the merits of <hi>the Sonne,</hi> and by the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>the holy Ghost:</hi> and he that prayeth for the remission of sinnes to <hi>God the Sonne,</hi> must pray that he would procure <hi>the Father,</hi> to grant him pardon, and to assure it by <hi>his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> He also that praieth for the same to God the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> must pray that he would assure vnto him the remission of his sinnes, from <hi>the Father,</hi> for, and by the merits of <hi>his Sonne.</hi> Thus must we apprehend the <hi>Trinity</hi> in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: so shall we auoide that Idolatrous conceiuing of him, imbraced of some, who cannot pray, vnlesse they haue the figure of a humane Creature, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto their bodily eyes, the shape of
<pb facs="tcp:6307:22"/>
God <hi>the Father,</hi> in likenesse of an old Man and a <hi>Crucifix</hi> figuring <hi>Christ,</hi> suffring on the Crosse, and the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> by a <hi>Doue,</hi> whose worship can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reputed spirituall, but carnall; and their prayers, not heauenly, but prophane. Prayer is a spirituall action, proper onely to the <hi>children of God, who are Saints by calling, sanctified in Christ:</hi> And they, and none other truly <hi>cal vpon the name of the Lord IESVS:</hi> prophane persons pray not, though they seeme to pray. But most happy is that man, that commeth vnto God, <hi>Father, Sonne, &amp; holy Ghost,</hi> truly prepared, and duly attentiue; he may boldly aske, and confidently assure himselfe, to receiue <hi>grace for grace, and all blessings spirituall,</hi> without limitation, and all <hi>benefits corporall</hi> needfull.

            <p>The first step therefore of true prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereunto, is to search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who teach the Mysterie of this holy Communion, and the institution of the same, as also the signification of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signes, which are Bread and Wine; the things signified, the Body and Bloud of Christ shed for all beleeuers: the end of the receiuing whereof, is to retayne the remembrance of the Death &amp; Passion

of Christ, which he suffered for our sins.</p>
            <p>By the true receiuing of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are vnited vnto the loue of God, in, and by the death of Christ, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> being separated from him by the fall of the first.

            </p>
            <p>The true receiuing of this blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, must be in sincerity, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant heart, and faith vnfained.</p>
            <p>And because it is not prouided for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (who comming thereunto vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, receiue their owne damnation) wee must, before we repaire thereunto, cleanse our soules from all sinne: which cannot be done without diuing into our own soules, with an impartiall search, to finde out our owne corruption, and truely to repent our sinnes.

for the belly, how much more an vnwasht heart, this sacred Sacrament, the foode of the Soule? Inward examination, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall accusation, and an absolute condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our selues for sinne, is the best preparation to this holy Table. For hee that looketh into, and examineth the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den prophanenesse lurking in the heart, cannot, but (vpon due view of the same) accuse himselfe of deepe disobedience to God, which deserueth death. Finding this, he cannot but iudge himselfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be reiected from this communion of Saints, and so condemne himselfe that he be not condemned of the Lord: for he that confesseth his sinnes to God, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them: and he that coueteth to hide them, increaseth them. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle willeth all men to <hi>trye and examine themselues,</hi> which importeth repentance, and so to eate.</p>
            <p>This caueat is no inhibition, but a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the soule, not to presume to come to this holy Table, without purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and sanctification.</p>
            <p>Herein doth the Lord Iesus discouer his wonderfull loue towards vs, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee inuite vs to come to this Table to eate, doth instruct vs how wee should come, and how we should feede. He layes

not this Table to snare vs, as <hi>Absalom</hi> did <hi>Amnon:</hi> and yet forewarnes vs, that there is danger in receiuing it, namely, with polluted hands, with hands full of bribery and extortion, to take it with lips defiled with blasphemy, cursing, and lying; to put it into a stomacke gorged with drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and gluttony, and with a heart ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no difference of the Lords body.</p>
            <p>We must therefore lay aside all our old sinnes, and put on the new man, a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, a Holy, and Christian conuersation and disposition. Wee must be holy and heauenly minded towards God, we must be louing to our Neighbours, slow in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aduantages, or reuenging wrongs, wee must be lowly and little in our owne eyes, meeke and sober in all our actions.</p>
            <p>And because things of so wonderfull value are herein exhibited and offered to the worthy Receiuers, wee must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who wee are, how wee are cleansed of our spirituall Leprosie, before we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume into the company of the Saints to communicate.

And when he is cleansed, let him shew himselfe to the Priest, his Pastor, and let him take knowledge by his outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, of his inward Contrition, not by particularising of his sinnes, but by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing his repentance; and then in all reuerence, let him come to this holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let him eate the Bread, and drinke the Bloud of that Lambe that taketh away his sinnes, and will present him pure vnto the Lord.</p>

               <hi>The Lords eye is pure, and can abide no wickednesse.</hi> The Sacrament is holy; touch it not rashly.

But hee had no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage against Christ, but fifteth and findeth man of another inclination, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and altogether corrupt, and so prone naturally to sinne, as there resteth in all men some peculiar humour, and a kinde of priuate and commanding sinne, which so farre commonly ouer-ruleth the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as whensoeuer it offereth it selfe, it easily draweth consent euen of the whole man, as <hi>Nabals</hi> couerousnes, whom the rich doe imitate, who although they might be free from all other sinnes (as they cannot be) it were sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them: some are wholly ouercome, and make drunkennesse their whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, some bribery and extorsion, some whoredome, some wantonnesse.

               <p>O Gracious God, and most louing Father, who in the beginning didst create man to thine owne image and likenesse, in all sinceritie, and didst place him (in the holy estate of his innocency) in the swéet garden of all heauenly and earthly delights, and in thy superabundant mercies didst ordaine all thy creatures in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and Earth to doe him seruice: O what was man, that thou hadst such respect vnto him? And yet how sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly (Lord God) did hée fall from that estate of originall grace? how grossely did hée disobey, and rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy will reuealed vnto him? By whose fall all corruption entred, where before was nothing but sanctity: by whose corruption the earth became corrupt, and all things in the earth began to disobey him for whom they were created, as he disobeyed thée by

whom he was created. And by his transgression, all that haue procéeded of him by a lineall originall pollution; haue all defiled their wayes, and all men by nature are likewise so farre tainted with that first offence, as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite offences are bred in euery man by that offence: as I, for my part (good Father, against whom that first sinne was done) do acknowledge, that I féele the force of that originall corruption, working so strongly in me, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but accuse my selfe to be the most vile, and vnworthiest of all <hi>Adams</hi> is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue: for I cannot otherwise iudge of my selfe, when I looke into, and sée, and consider what I am, and how I am inclined to sinne.

And this wretched and false censure of carnall men, driues many weake soules vpon the rocks of bitter ruine, euen when they dreame of a course of swéetest happinesse.

And this is that dangerous rocke, vpon which oftentimes euen the godly make shipwracke, when they consult with flesh and bloud, which argueth it the safest course, to become licentious, to imbrace vanity, and to studie the profitable and praised arts of flattery and dissimulation, to walke the broad way to preferment, to scale the wals of wealth and estimation by fraud and force, to leape ouer loue and lowlinesse (as dangerous blocks) and to sit in the seat of scorning the poore, with the proud and ambitious.

            <p>And contrariwise, our miseries are but for a moment, and our ioyes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, and the smallest things (if we feare God) are better to vs then the greatest riches to the wicked.

We may loose our goods, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, and become méerely vndone, as we thinke, and yet he will restore it, if we be patient and faithfull.</p>
            <p>God hath a time to correct, and a time to comfort, a time of triall, and a time of reward: he neuer faileth them that faint not, nor forsaketh them that forsake him not: hée may make vs mourne now, but he will make vs mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againe: though hée make vs wéepe now, he will take a time to wipe away our teares, and put them in a bottle, reseruing the remembrance of them till the end, when wée shall haue our porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him in ioyes endlesse and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable.</p>
            <p>And therefore wée that goe foorth with little séede, and sow it in sorrow, let vs wait, without wauering: for a plentifull increase will come, and a ioyfull haruest.

               <p>Therefore teach me, O Lord, teach me thy truth, shew me thy wayes, and leade mee in thy pathes continually: withhold my heart from euery euill thought, &amp; my hands that they commit no euill, kéepe mine eyes sincere, and my tongue that it speake no vnséemely thing, and my féet from falling.</p>

               <p>Thou art righteous and gracious, and reformest sinners, and forgiuest their sins. Be mercifull therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mine iniquities, for they are very great. Kéepe my soule and deliuer me, let mee not be confounded, nor perish vtterly, for I trust in thée.</p>

The man of God hauing that celestiall Jewel in what measure soeuer, willingly and fréely maketh all others that are desirous, partakers of it, that all may grow likewise rich in the same faith, knowledge, and vertue with him; the godly much reioyce in him that most excelleth in diuine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, notdisdaining any for his pouerty or basenes of his worldly estate, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the pouerty of the body, &amp; the estate of outward wants, in regard of the inward riches of the minde: for as hee that séemeth rich in outward things, may be indéede a banckerupt; so hee that is poore in carnall things, may be rich in heauenly: else were the miserable poore man more wretched then any creature, that walketh or

He forgetteth not that all things that hée hath, he hath from God, his creation, his life, the vse of all his limbes, his senses, his foode, his raiment, his health, his ablenesse to performe the least duty in his calling, and whatsoeuer else, inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, hée holdeth them at the will of the Almighty, to whom he prayeth for all graces and diuine vertues, that he may be furnished with that riches that none can possesse, but such as haue them from that great God, who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to them that aske, and vpbraideth no man, neither denyeth he any mans request, if it be according to his will reuealed in his word: and for all that

he giueth, requireth onely true thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse for requitall: not that thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, which some carnally minded rich men would séeme to afford him, a cap vailed with both the hands, with words onely, <hi>I thanke God:</hi> This may be counterfeit and lip-thankefulnesse, which God respecteth as the offring of hypocrites. The organs of the tongue &amp; lips are necessary instruments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the meaning of the heart, if they moue by the power of a féeling spirit: but if the mouth speake in these diuine offices what the heart inforceth not, it shall not onely not profit, but witnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the heart &amp; conscience that déepe dissimulation before men, &amp; hypocrisie before God, that shall worke their own iust condemnation. But wée must fall downe vpon the knées, not onely of the outward body, but of a liuely féeling heart, &amp; acknowledge that all we haue receiued, to be his blessing and especial gift: which if we can rightly performe, it will follow, that of the same faith wil procéede with words of thankfulnesse, workes of obedience, which God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth aboue all sacrifices whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. But who so still asketh and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth blessings, and onely saith, <hi>They
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:6307:138"/>
are the gifts of God,</hi> and disposeth of them contrary to the rule which God hath prescribed in his Word, that thankfulnes will returne into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some as sin, and he be imputed a plaine vsurper of his blessings. For, as when a man by faire and flattering meanes obtaineth any thing of his friends, and hauing obtained it, reiecteth the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the giuer, and becommeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull and vnkinde, what is it but méere extorting of the thing obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Although the all-séeing eye of God fore-séeth the heart, and knoweth how and to what end wée aske, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our owne gaine, or his glory: and hée often bestoweth great benefits vpon men, neuer desiring them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen spéech. The very groanes of the heart ascend vnto God, and God is moued euen with the méere desires, and that oftentimes when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede not of faith; yea, hée granteth the very things that the wicked long for, but not for their comfort, onely to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill their carnall appetites, to make them so much the more beholden to him, for their worldly and corporall prosperity, and makes their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation so much the more iust, by how
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:6307:138"/>
much they are inexcusable, for not ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God in true obedience, which is the summe of most acceptable thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse for all blessings. It is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of al men, to couet earthly things, which wée sée God giueth to the euill as well, and in greater measure then to the godly: yet are the godly farre more thankfull for their smallest, then the wicked for their greatest portions; which last doe hunger and thirst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to adde more and more corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meanes vnto what they haue: and no abundance can make a stay to their coueting, neither can there be satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the couetous. And howsoeuer it increase, all their thankfulnesse is swallowed vp in their Chests, or cast vpon their fields, giuen to their wits, to their Art, or drowned in their vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the backe and belly haue their condigne gratifications of the most, and they are most beholding to some, who rest as much indebted vnto these two, in answering their necessities, as vnto God, in a sort, to whom they owe many, and will neuer pay any thankes. And yet the prophanest of these will say, that all the things they inioy, are the gifts of God. But as for
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:6307:139"/>
the cordiall and true thankefulnesse, it is a language vnknowne vnto them. The blessings of God to many, may be compared to swéet showres, and our hearts to dry ground, receiuing them to refresh it when it is weary, but returning no drops backe againe: no more doe vnthankefull men returne condigne thankes for Gods greatest benefits, but as the Sun by his force and exhalations, draweth vp the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of the ingratefull earth by force, so when men can kéepe their vsurped and extorted earthly blessings no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then they bestow them, and yet oftentimes not at all consulting with the true owner, God the lender, but bestow them to some such ends as are displeasing vnto him, as was their former abusing them. They dispose of them by their wils, as it were against their wils: their Testaments are as testimonies of their vnwillingnesse to leaue what they so dearely loued, which proueth their grosse ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, euen in their last conflict with death, who commonly is not so cruell an Enemy, but he telleth a man by one token or another, that he must prepare himselfe to endure his encounter, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

many dayes, many moneths, and often many yéeres before hee shew his vttermost force: in all which time, the most forgetfull and most vnthankefull man might call himselfe to minde, and consult and consider wherefore, and by whom the things he enioyeth were bestowed vpon him: if by his owne deserts, or by his owne méere indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, let him then kisse his owne hand, as the author of his happinesse: but if it came of the frée gift and méere bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence of God, let him rather cut off his hands, then rest vnthankefull to God, who can turne (as we sée) wealth into wretchednesse, mirth into mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, health into sicknesse, strength into weakenesse, and all whatsoeuer a man in this world delighteth in, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bitternesse and wormwood: all which may be assured to turne to their good, whosoeuer rest patient and thankfull. Who then will not affoord so small a recompence for so great blessings?</p>
               <p>And all thankefulnesse is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended vnder this one word <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Sacrifices were acceptable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties done in their time vnto God, but obedience is more acceptable then all other kindes of sacrifices.

And yet God oftentimes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth new gifts, as health, wealth, honor, office, fauour of friends, a good wife, and dutifull children, and many such like earthly blessings, to the most vnthankefull, by which the mindes of carnall men are so much the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted, in obseruing that all things succéede so well, they thinke God is well pleased with them, flattering

themselues, that they stand much in Gods fauour, because their occasions succéede better then other mens, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading themselues that to kéepe a formall &amp; morall course of life among men, and to make a superficiall shew of thankfulnesse vnto God, and at their death to allot some matter of forced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolence to the World, as the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of an Almes-house, Hospitall, Colledge, or such like, is so high a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to God, for the loane of his benefits, as he resteth rather in such a benefactors debt for this good déede, then such a vaine-glorious giuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to God for his long vsing and abusing of his blessings.</p>
               <p>By which, I condemne not such workes, tending to charitable vses, as are done in due time, and by men, first, séeking to be themselues in the true fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God, before they so séeke the glory and commendation of the world: for I presume to say, that the bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mens goods, while they are their owne, by their owne hands, in secret to the needy members of Christ, is more acceptable to God, then the former (though commendable) intendments after their deaths: while we liue, wée

know what is for the time in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, but after death wée cannot take knowledge what course will be taken with that we intend to best acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: neither doth the giuing after death, testifie a mans assurance of Gods prouidence, as doth the liberall giuing in time of life: for who so kéepes his treasure till hée dye, hee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it perforce, and against his will, which no man can deny, and though he grieue to forgoe, he cannot feare to want them: but hee that giueth in his life time, giueth in assurance, that hée that gaue it him, and made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of rewarding the Giuers to the poore, dependeth so surely thereupon, as hée shall neuer want what may be sufficient, which indéede is a worthy testimony of truest thankefulnesse to God, for the things he enioyeth in this life.</p>

Robbers, and Théeues, but also from danger and hurts of my limbes, which are commonly incident, and dee befall euen thine owne Children: blessed be therefore thy holy Name for euer.

            <p>Let mée neuer forget the words of thy mouth, thy promises made vnto thy Children, that <hi>all things shall worke together for the best for them.</hi> And therefore I doe assure mée, that thou hast brought my iourney to prosper, to farre as may be to thy glory, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,

               <p>Let this God, I say, arise and chase his enemies, and cherish his little ones, and pull downe the proud, and set vp the simple, and scatter the wicked, that they dwel not beyond his time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to tyrannize ouer his chosen vpon the earth.</p>

No, no: for if my inner parts be not perfect, hée in his most absolute knowledge findeth me a deceiuer, and so will make mine euils at the last breake out as the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning light.</p>
               <p>O my soule therefore, as thou ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest thy saluation to come, and my comfort here in this life, leaue off to sinne in secret, and flie al shewes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and regard truth, and imbrace iustice, and follow good, euen with thy most inward affection: and let neither my hand, nor mine eye, nor mine eare, nor my tongue be instruments of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, but rather of sincere piety, and of a sanctified life.</p>
               <p>The cause of misery is sin, the way to obtaine mercy is repentance, and a reformed conuersation.</p>
               <p>How canst thou looke for loue, that louest not to liue well? and how canst thou liue, and not lacke many, yea, all

               <p>Thou sayest thou art Gods, and yet vngodly: thou sayest, thou fearest him: and yet thou still offendest him: thou thinkest thou shouldest receiue what good thou destrest, and yet thou destrest amisse, and deseruest euill.</p>
               <p>God knoweth who are his, and who are not his: and none know they are Gods, but who know God, and serue him rightly.

               </p>
               <p>O Lord, thou séest and beholdest, thou findest out and considerest all mens wayes: mischiefe and wrong, equity and iustice are before thée, and thou takest the causes of men into

               <p>The Lord looketh downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon all men, such is the force of his knowledge, that hée knoweth in man, more then the heart of man it selfe: for he fashioneth the heart, and vnderstandeth all my thoughts long before they be conceiued within me.</p>
               <p>And therefore, my soule, prepare thée to patience, addresse thée to praise God, and continue in prayer, be not idle to meditate good things, that the Lords goodnes may be thy goodnesse, that his loue may be thy life, and his prouidence thy protection: for as hée knoweth thy going, and marketh well thy wandring, when thy féele follow value things, and fatherly correcteth thée for them: so doth hée behold thy teares, and heareth thy groanes, which thou makest for sinne committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and healeth thée, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth thée. Yet all things are so hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

               <p>And hée séeing mée in my mothers wombe before I was any thing, or dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for me then, what I receiue now, &amp; therefore my hope must not faile, but take hold of his ancient loue, wherein hée first created me to liue in him, and by him: and therfore, Oh, that I might be able truely to serue him, that hée might louingly relieue me still, that I might faithfully obey him, that hee might fatherly helpe me still.</p>
               <p>He is the good shepheard: Oh that I were a good shéepe of his pasture: hee féedeth, and guideth, and holdeth vp and comforteth, and maintaineth all that are his: hée looseth none that are his, he confoundeth none that are his, neither doth he forsake any of his vnto the end.</p>
               <p>Within his fold is his fauour, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:6307:162"/>
in his fauour is life, and in that life is liberty, and in that liberty is reliefe, and in that reliefe true peace, and in that peace the assurance of saluation, and in that assurance, the ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Spirit, whereby euery out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnsauory thing is made inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly swéet: euery crosse hath his comfort, and euery tryall, and temptation, and sorrow, and griefe, is turned to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable good of the shéepe of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>

               <p>True it is, they were blessed of God in their riches, because they knew God, and beléeued his promises, They held not their wealth, but as meanes to relieue themselues and others: but thou holdest thy wealth to get vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory by them.

am weake, and am not able to beare thy heauy displeasure by mine owne power or merit. And therefore, good Father, lay not vpon mée the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I haue deserued: take away thy heauy hand of correction, and as thou art patient and long in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the sinnes of thy weake children, he yet patient with mée, and send thine holy Spirit to season me anew, that I may bring forth now the fruits of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life.

Raise vp some gracious meanes (Lord) for my succor: for thou knowest, though I be but one man, whose ruine can be but as the death of the least creature in the censure of such as feele not, nor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of my griefes: neither will my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow grieue such as haue no share of my, miseries. Some there be yet, deare Father, whom thou knowest, that shall taste of the bitternesse of my

fall: and therefore, Lord, consider in mercy: and although none of them (Lord) that shall féele the smart of my calamities, but haue also added sinne vnto my sinne, and so aggrauated thy displeasure against vs, yet in thy Christ forgiue vs all, and reclaime vs all by thy gentle corrections, not by thy fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious iudgements. And as a sparrow (Lord) lighteth not on the ground, nor one haire falleth from our heads, without thy prouidedre: so I know (Lord) that nothing shall befall mée, but what thou hast decréed, euen for my good, both in this life, and in the life to come. Thou hast neuer, Lord, dealt so sharpely with any, but vpon serious repentance they haue receiued comfort, they haue tasted of thy loue, and of inward peace. So worke, Lord, in these my tryals, and by these my crosses and dangers, that I be neither inwardly too much afflicted with feare and sorrow, nor outwardly too much cast downe with want, but as I taste of thy correcting rod, so I may also flude thy supporting staffe.

It is no true helpe, Lord, that commeth not of true compassion: and there is no true compassion, without true féeling of anothers miseries: but how far, Lord, that is from the hearts of many, thou knowest, and I féele it. And therefore euery heart truely moued to true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration, is first moued by thée. Oh moue them therefore, moue thou such as thou pleasest to vse as instruments of thy will for my good: so shall I vse it, and accept it as thy goodnesse, to thy glory. But, Lord, the course of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence teacheth vs, that thou wilt not haue thy dearest children to be lifted vp by the fulnesse of earthly things, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue that which becommeth the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to kéepe them still in awe of thy corrections. Forere while, O Lord, I thought of seife-peace, little fearing further perils, nor to be thus chased anew, as I am, by such as séeke to molest mée, and to exact that from me by rigour, which thou knowest I am not yet able to performe: though thou

            <p>And therefore (O louing Father) as thou well knowest what is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, supply it in thy mercies, in thy good time, before I be confounded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and before I goe hence, and be no more séene.
