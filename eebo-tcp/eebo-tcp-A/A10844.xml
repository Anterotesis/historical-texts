         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PRINTERS TO
the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>CHristian Reader. How euer the
verie naming of the Author
of this following Treatise,
vvere sufficient reason for vs to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
this same vnto the vvorld, in
regard of those large abilities aboue
many others, vvhich the Lord had
bestowed vpon him, and in regard he
being now at rest, with the Lord, and
so hauing finished long since his course
in this his pilgrimage, vve cannot
expect to haue any more vse of his
helpe this waye, and although it were
great pittie that such a vvorke as this
should be concealed for so long time,
considering the worke vvas perfected,
and vvritted by his owne hand, and
so found after his death (which is nine
yeares since) in his studie, yet haue we
thought it good all this while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
it, in respect of that desire vve
had to the peace of that church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:12562:3"/>
the Author of this Treatise vvas
for so many yeares a Pastor. In regard
vve did perceiue that some though not
manie vvere contrari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> minded to the
Authors judgement expressed in this
Trtatise: And this vve judge to be
a sufficient reason of our so long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
of publishing this Treatise to
the world: Yet to our griefe vve haue
now just cause to put this same on foote;
For as vvhen a citie is in danger of
enemies to be surprized, it is then
high time to take vp all those vvarr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Munitions vvhich happily before
that time vvere cast aside and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
that so they may the better
maintaine their citie, and the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of it against their enemies: so
vve judge it as necessarie if not more
vvhen vve see the enemies of Gods
church to incroach vpon the priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the same especiallie vvhen they
ayme at the vtter ruinating of it,
that then it is high time for vs to
<pb facs="tcp:12562:3"/>
defende the cause of Christ, and it
vvas the vvisdome of Iehojada the
High Priest perceiuing the malice of
Athalia, seeking to destroy the
vvhole seed of Iehosaphat, to hide
Ioash the right heyre of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and vvhen he sawe a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
then to reueale him, and
make him knowne, so vve vvho
haue obserued Athalias spirit in part
to be in some, vvho haue laboured
to assume the power to themselues,
vvhich is proper to the church, and
so Diotrephes like vvould cast out
vvhom they please, and retayne
vvhom they thought good, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then they vvill be hindred in
this their attempt, they vvill la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to rent that church in pieces in
vvhich they haue liued for manie
yeares together, and that vve may
not seeme to accuse them of any thing
vvithout just reason, vve desire the
Christian Reader, and themselues to
consider this that followes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12562:4"/>
First, their schisme or as they call it
their leauing of the church, doth arise
vpon this occasion, to wit, that 2. which
vvere members of the same church
with them hauing vpon some occasion
heard some of the Ministers in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
preach, and it coming to the
knowledge of some of these vvho haue
now made this rent the church, they
vvould presently haue these persons
dealt vvithall as for sinne, and if they
did not repent after dealing, they
vvould haue the church to proceed
to excomunicate them <hi>ipso facto,</hi>
vvhich the church not willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
vnto, these men could not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but they vvould haue their owne
vvilles done or els they vvould rent
from the church, vvhich proceeding of
theirs, if it vvere approued of and
followed no church could long continue
together in peace, for vvhat these
foure or fiue men haue done, that may
any other man doe, so that if any man
do conceiue any of his brethren to
<pb facs="tcp:12562:4"/>
vvalke in any such sinne, vvhich he
judges doth deserue excomunication,
if the church will not thereto consent,
he may rent himselfe from the same;
Although the Author of this Treatise
haue taught them otherwise, to vvit,
that if the church, see not that to be
sinne, vvhich I see to be a sinne, I
hauing informed the church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
according to my place, I haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scharged
my dutie, and the sinnes
lyes vpon the church (if it be a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
and not vpon me; but it seemes
these men do looke for that in the
church on earth vvhich is onely to be
found in heauen, for themselues haue
affirmed, and that before diuers wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
that there is no sinne small or
great that is to borne vvithall, and
that the verie speaking of a vvord
through fraylty about worldly busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
vpon the Sabbaoth day, should
haue as seuere a sentence, as he that
shall openly &amp; prophanely transgresse
against the 4. Commandement, the
<pb facs="tcp:12562:5"/>
verie naming of with their opinion, is
sufficient to discouer their weaknes, &amp;
that we may yet further discouer these
mens folly to the world more fully, we
will shew you how contrary they are to
themselues in this their iudgment, for
as they say, and do affirme that there
is no sinne vvhich is to be borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in the church, yet themselues, or at
least the chief of them do practise the
contrarie, as for example, one in
stead of manie may serue the turne:
The chiefe of Author of this trouble
doth hold, and so hath for manie
yeares together, to vvit, that it is
vnlawfull for the members of one
church to haue communion with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
church, and yet not vvithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this his judgement, he can beare
vvith one, vvho hath contrary to this
his judgement practised, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
still to do vpon occasion, and
yet not vvithstanding his so practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
and so professing, he is receiued
among them, and is their chiefe if not
<pb facs="tcp:12562:5"/>
their onely Teacher which they haue:
So that vve may here easily perceiue,
that though this man doth vse Iehu's
peace against the sinnes of others,
with whom he desires to be alienated,
yet he can beare vvith as great sinnes
in others, in his judgement vvith
vvhom he desires to vvalke, we could
shew manie more reasons to proue his
partialitie, but then vve should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the bonds of an Epistle onely vve
desire to giue the Reader to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of those two things: First, that
this practize of hearing the Ministers
of the church of England, is not against
any Article of faith, vvhich is by
this church professed, vvhereof the
Author of this Treatise vvas a Pastor,
it being no Act of Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
for if hearing simplie vvere
an Act of Communion, then euerie
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>tique, or Atheist, or whatsoeuer he
were that should come into the church
of God, should haue Communion
vvith them, vvhich if it vvere true,
<pb facs="tcp:12562:6"/>
as this following Treatise proues the
contrarie, then it vvere good for
euery church that will auoid commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with profane men, to meete in
priuate, and then to shut their dore
when their own compagnie is meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
else I cannot see how they can
auoid hauing communion with wicked
men: to wit if beare hearing be an
acte of communion: Secondly, as this
hearing is not against any Article of
their faith, so likewise it was not in
the iudgement of the church esteemed
as a thing that might not be borne
withall,<note place="margin">The letter you shall find after the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</note> &amp; this may appeare by a copy
of a letter which we haue heer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
published where the church in
the counsell which they giue to the
church of London do sufficiently make
it appeare, that their iudgement did
manifestlie differ from those which
now haue made this breach, and which
is well to be marked by the reader how
that the church when this letter was
write: enioyed the Pastor, and their
<pb facs="tcp:12562:6"/>
company was fiue tymes greater then
it was when this breach was made: &amp;
because these men in his their error
are vvilling to retraine it, and not
being able to make any sufficient reply
to the answere made in this Treatise to
their obiections, though the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
therof hath bene in their hands
for many yeares, yet because they will
find somthing to say, more then others
haue done heretofore, though of lesse
force, therefore they haue ioyned some
new obiections which both the seducer
and the seduced do thinke are vnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable,
therfore it will not be amisse
for vs to propound them, and to giue
some answere to them that so if their
stomachs serue they may reply to all at
once: First, they obiect and say that
we hold the church of England to be a
false church, and the Ministers thereof
to be Antichristian, and yet we go
thither to worship the true God.</p>
            <p>Before we answere directly to this
objection, we shall intreate the Reader
<pb facs="tcp:12562:7"/>
and themselues to consider of this that
followes.</p>
            <p>First, A church may be said to be
false in diuers respects, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to those respects, vve are to
haue diuers Considerations thereof,
as first, a church may be said to be
false in respect of outward order, to
vvit, vvhen a church is gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
not according to the rule of
Christ neither, in their outward go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
do they conforme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
now this church cannot be said
to be the church of Christ being thus
erected, and gouerned contrary to the
rule of Christ, but is false and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,
and yet notwithstanding
the faith professed by this church, and
the doctrines, taught in this church
may be sound, and according to God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a church may be false
not onely in respect of outward order,
but likewise in respect of faith and
doctrine.</p>
            <p>Now to this latter, vve counsell no
<pb facs="tcp:12562:7"/>
man to go, because from thence no
good can be expected, and that is the
esteeme vve haue of the church of
Rome.</p>
            <p>But now as in a true church in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of outward order, there may be
manie false doctrines taught, so in
a church, that is false in respect of
outward order, there may be manie
sound, and seasonable truths taught,
and this esteeme vve haue of the
preaching in England: Namelie,
that the doctrine there taught ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Articles of their faith
is sound, and the effects of it hath
appeared, in the vvorking of
faith in the hearts of manie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands.</p>
            <p>For the outward order, or mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
there as a church, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
themselues, and those that
are in vnion, vvith that church
estate, but not all that heare them.</p>
            <p>Now that worshipping of God which
consists in hearing his word is warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:12562:8"/>
for vs to doe in England, we proue
it by this argument.</p>
            <p>That preaching which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
begets men to the faith of
Christ may lawfully be heard.</p>
            <p>But the preaching of many
Ministers in the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
hath, and doth ordinarily
beget men to the faith of Christ.</p>
            <p>Therefore the preaching of
many Ministers in England may
lawfully be heard.</p>
            <p>The first part of this sillogisme is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
out of Rom 10. where the Apostle
telling what is the ordinary vvay God
vses to beget men to the faith of Christ
telles vs, it comes by hearing of the
vvord of God preached, if faith comes
by hearing the vvord of God preached
(to vvit, if that be the outward mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes)
then there is no question but that
a man may heare such preaching, and
any man may blush for shame, that
<pb facs="tcp:12562:8"/>
shall deny this: so that the major part
of the argument is cleare:</p>
            <p>And for the Minor parte they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny it, no more then a man at
noon day can deny the sunne to shine:
for if any man make question whether
faith comes ordinarily by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and hearing in England, it is a
great question vvether they euer had
faith or no: yet because some are so
grosse as to deny this, we will therefore:
proue the contrarie by this Argument.</p>
            <p>That preaching and hearing
which makes them which were
altogether carnall, and so not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of a church-estate, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
saints &amp; so fit for a church-estate:
That preaching must
needs beget men to the faith:</p>
            <p>But the preaching and hearing
in England, made them that were
vnfit &amp; carnall to become saints,
and so fit members to the true
church, which were not so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12562:9"/>
Therfore the preaching in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
and hearing the same doth
beget men to the faith: That the
preaching, and hearing in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
hath done this: Witnesse
the church of Leyden, and of
Amstelredam.</p>
            <p>Let them tell vs where they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
their faith: if they say they had it
not till they ioyned in these bodies,
how could they then be true to their
owne grounds, that none but visible
Christians are fit matter for the church
vvhereas none can be so esteemed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in the iudgement of charitie, we
iudge them to haue true faith.</p>
            <p>But some of these that haue made
this diuision haue not denyed, but
faith is wrought by the preaching and
hearing in England: and yet which is
wonderfull contradiction: they say it
is not the vvord of God as it is there
preached: so that it seemes there is
something besides the vvord of God
which is an ordinary meanes to beget
<pb facs="tcp:12562:9"/>
men to the faith, and there is another
vvord besides Gods vvord that vvill
do it; the like absurditie hath sildome
bene heard from any that professe them
selues to be Christians, and that they
may, not seeme to say this vvithout
some reason, marke the reason that
they bring to proue it, say they we do
deny that to be the vvord of God, as it
is there preached: by a false Ministry,
though the vvord it selfe be of God yet
as it is by them preached, it is none of
Gods vvord so Gods vvord here stands
at fast, and loose, it is Gods vvord, and
it is not Gods vvord, as if they should
say, it is Gods word if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Canne shall
preach it: but if another, that is a
Minister in England preach the same
it is none of Gods vvord: so that mens
outward callings true, or false, makes
the vvord to be the vvord of God,
or not to be the vvord of God, an asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
rather to be pitied then refuted,
being litle better then blasphemy, that
which they bring to make this assertion
<pb facs="tcp:12562:10"/>
good, to vvit, that any man hauing
an outward calling vvhich is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
makes the vvord of God, vvhich
he preacheth, not to be the vvord of
God, and this, say they to proue it,
it vvas true incense vvhich Nadab
and Abihu tooke,<note place="margin">Lev. 10. 1.</note> to offer vp to the
Lord, but because they tooke strang
fire, and not the fire, vvhich vvas
from the Altar as the Lord had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
therefore the Lord sent a
fire to destroy them: so say they, it is
the true vvord of God, which is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in England, but because they
preach the same by an vnlawfull office,
therefore the Lord abhorres it: A
stranger collection I thinke can hardly
by heard, for here strang fire is opposed
to an vnlawfull outward calling,
vvhich nothing can be more absurd,
for Nadab and Abihu had a true out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard
calling to offer, they vvere the
sonnes of Aaron (saith the text) ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if any thing hence might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
in iust proportion, it must be
<pb facs="tcp:12562:10"/>
to the doctrine taught, and not in
the least to the calling: so that vve
may from thence gather thus much,
that if a Minister in regard of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard
calling true: shall teach any
thing, that is not from the Lord, they
are to expect Gods iudgement for the
same, and more cannot hence be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
further, let it be shewed, that
euer any prophet in the old or new
Testament vvas euer termed a false
prophet in respect of his outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but allwaies in respect of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
vve can find that such as had
true outvvard calling in the true
church, yet vvere false prophets in
regard of their doctrine in many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulers
as Christ teaches concerning
the Scribes and Pharises for their false
expounding of the Law, let them shew
the like for outvvard callings: Thus
haue vve thought good, hauing bene
eare vvitnesses of these things here
propounded to set downe our censure
of them, desyring the Lord to make
<pb facs="tcp:12562:11"/>
this vvhole vvorke (for the generall
good now set forth) take effect in those
that loue the Trueth.</p>

Of vvhich latter number I professe
my selfe (by the grace of God) both
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12562:12"/>
a companion and guide: speciallie
in regard of my christian countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

from them; But a benefite, and
matter of reioiceng, vvhen I can, in

vnite vvith them, in matter: if not
in manner; or vvhere it may be,
in both. And this affection, the
Lord, and my conscience are my
vvitnesses, I haue alvvaies norished
in my breast, euen vvhen I seemed
furthest dravvne from them. And
so all that haue taken knovvledge
of my course can testifie vvith mee,

And in testimonie of mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
this vvay, &amp; for the freeing
of mine ovvne conscience, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of other mens: I haue
penned this discourse, tending to
proue <hi>the hearing of the vvord of
God preached by the Ministers of the
church of England: (able to open and
applie the doctrines of faith by that
church professed) both lawfull, and
in cases, necessarie for all, of all sects,
or sorts of christians, hauing oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
and occasion of so doing: though
sequestring themselues from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Hierachicall order
there established.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three sorts of opposites I make
account to meet vvithall. The first
of them, vvho truly desire, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
endevour to haue their whole
course both in religion, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise,
framed by the holy, and right
zeale of Gods Word, either for their
confirmation in the trueth; or refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
vvherein, through humane
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12562:13"/>
frailtie they) step aside. And vnto
them especiallie I direct this my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
begging at his hands vvho
is <hi>the Father of lights,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iem. 1. 17</note> 
               <hi>and from
vvhom commeth downe euerie good
and perfect gift,</hi> for them, as for my
selfe, that as he hath giuen vs to set
our faces tovvards heauen, and to
<hi>seek him vvith the vvhole heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 6.</note> 
               <hi>so
he would not suffer vs to vvander
from his commaundements,</hi> to the
right hand, or to the left.</p>
            <p>A second sort is of them, vvhose
tender and scrupulous conscience,
makes them fearefull, and jealous
of euerie thing, vvhich hath in it
the least appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or shevv of euil:
least comming too neare it, they be
defiled by it, one vvay or other.
This their godly zeale, and tender
nes of heart is to be loued of all
men, and cherished by all good
meanes. Onely such are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
for their ovvne good, to
take knowledge of a distinction
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12562:13"/>
most vsefull for their direction, in
things lawfull in their kinde, and
good in their right vse. Of vvhich
some are onely naturallie good in
their kinde, but not simply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
of God, as, to get, and
keep the riches, and credit of the
vvorld; to enjoy outvvard peace,
or other bodly comfort. Others are
morallie good in their kinde, and
commaunded of God, as to heare
the vvord of God, obey the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and the like, Novv in things
of the former sort, it is verie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
(considering both their nature
and ours) that vve keep a jealous
eye, and strait hand ouer our selues,
and our waies. For them, they are
not in their kinde enjoyned as the
other: neither do the scriptures any
vvhere require of men, to be rich, or
the like: as they doe to hear Gods
Word, obey authoritie, &amp;c. And for
our selues we are proue, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to ouerstraint for the getting,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12562:14"/>
and enjoying of them, as being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallie
pleasing good things. So as
if out of a godly jealousie ouer our
hearts tovvards them, vve keep not
our selues from going too neer the
side, for the getting, or keeping of
them: vve shall by one storme of
temptation or other, be blovvne in
to the ditch of sin and destruction.
But now, for the practise and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of duties simplie morall,
and commaunded in their kinde, as
is the hearing of Gods Word, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
by Gods people, vve ought
to strain to the vtmost, and to go as
neer the vvinde, as may be: seing
nothing but apparant sin in the
vvay can excuse the vvithdravving
from it, vvhen occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of enjoying
it is offred. Oh that there vvere not
to be found vvho being verie scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
of comming neer to any
thing amisse in outvvard ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
or to any person failing in
them: yet make no scruple of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12562:14"/>
complying, and conforming vvith
the vvorld so farre in the eagre pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of wordlie profits: immoderate
vse of vvorldlie delights and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the lusts of the vvorld and
flesh dvvelling in them, as that
there appears scarse an hayr-breath,
or difference betvveene them and
meer vvorldlings, vvhich know not
God. Which latter euils are both
vvorse in themselues, as being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preslie
condemned by the lavv of
God, and light of nature: and more
odious in the persons: as being
more personall, free and voluntarie,
then those in the other, to vvhich
they are carried by the violent cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of the times.</p>
            <p>A third sort of opposites I make
account to meet vvith, more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable
then the former: and more
vehementlie bent against the thing
propounded by me, out of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
and passion, then the other by
scruple of conscience, or shevv of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12562:15"/>
reason. To them I can hardlie say
any thing: (it not being their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to read, or vvillinglie to hear
that vvhich crosseth their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices)
yet something I must saic
touching them, out of the vvofull
experience of manie yeares taken of
them, though not much I thanke
the Lord, amongst them, vnto
vvhom I haue ministred.</p>
            <p>Some of these I haue found car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
vvith so excessiue admiration
of some former guides in their
course, as they think it halfe heresie
to call into question any of their
determinations, or practises. We
must not thinke, that onely the
Pharisees of old, and papists of later
times are superstitiously addicted to
<hi>the traditions of the elders,</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of the church.</hi> In all Sects
there are diuers (speciallie of the
vveaker sort, vvho being the lesse
reall in their conceptions, are the
more personall) that rather chuse
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12562:15"/>
to followe the trodde of blinde tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
if beaten by some such fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goers,
as they admire, then the
right vvaie of Gods Word by others
to be shewed them aftervvards.</p>
            <p>Some again are as much addicted
to themselues as the former to
others: conceauing in effect, though
they vvill not professe it, the same
of their owne heads, vvhich the
papists do of their head the Pope,
viz: that they cannot erre, or be
deceaued: and this speciallie in such
matters, as for vvhich they haue
suffred trouble, and affliction for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlie:
and so haueing bought
them deare, they valew them
highly. But it is to marchantlike,
to striue to ouer fell a thing, vvhich
vve haue formerlie ouer bought:
vve must <hi>buy the trueth,</hi> and <hi>not fell
it,</hi> at any rate: but must account
nothing either true or good, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the valuation vvhich vve
haue set vpon it, but God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:12562:16"/>
There is also a third sort highly
aduanceing a kinde of priuatiue
goodnes and religion: and vvho
bend their force rather to the vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of other men in their courses
then to the building vp of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in their owne: and in trueth
rather to seperation from men not
onely in euill, but euen in that
vvhich is good, for some other euill
conceaued in them, then to vnion
vvith God, and his people in his
holie ordinances: and halfe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that they draw neer enough
to God if they can vvithdraw far
enough from other men. Great
zeale they haue against the false
church, ministerie, and vvorship so
being, or by them conceaued so
to be; and against any appearing
euill in the true, but litle for that
vvhich is true and good, as their
practice manifests: but euill is as
contrarie to euill, as good is to euil;
and so is that zeale plainlie carnall,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12562:16"/>
vvhich carries a man further against
euill, then for good: seeing no euill
is fo euill as good is good.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there are some to be
found so sowred vvith moodines, &amp;
discontentement as they become
vnsociable, &amp; almost <hi>Lukanthropoi,</hi>
Werewolfs, as they speake, if they
se nothing lamentable, they are
readie to lament. If they take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in any: it is in them alone,
vvhom they finde discontented.
If they read any bookes, they are
onely invectiues, speciallie against
publique states, and their gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.
All things tending to accord
and vnion any manner of vvay are
vnwelcome vnto them. They haue
their portion in <hi>Ismaels</hi> blessing.<note place="margin">Genes. 16. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly there vvant not, vvho (as
<hi>Iehu</hi> in his fierce marching, couered
his ambition, crueltie, and zeale for
his owne house vnder the pretext
of <hi>zeale for Gods</hi>) thinke to couer,
and palliate their own both grosser
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12562:17"/>
and more proper, and personall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
vnder a furious march not
onely against the failings, but the
persons also failing of infirmitie, in
matters of church order, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
Who if they vvere vvell
acquainted, and duly affected with
their owne both more voluntarie,
and greater sins, vvould slack their
<hi>Iehus</hi> peace, yea turn their course,
though not to vvalke vvith others
in euill (vvhich God forbid) yet to
apply, &amp; accommodate themselues
vnto them, in that which is good, so
far as possiblie they could obserue
any vvay by the Lord opened vnto
them. I could instance in, and name
diuers perticuler persons monstrous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
growne out of kinde, this vvay.
But that course I leaue vnto them,
vvho rather desire the disgraceing,
then the bettering of them against
vvhom they deal: or perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
in their leauened hearts that
there is no other vvay of bettering,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12562:17"/>
speciallie persons of meant condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then by shameing, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing
them.<note place="margin">Genes. 49. 5. 6.</note> But <hi>let not my soule
come in their secrete, in vvhose ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
are</hi> such <hi>instruments of
cruellic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things thus promised, the
objections follovv, vvhich I haue
either heard from others, or can
conceaue of my selfe most coulle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
against the practize by me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
And they are of two sorts.
Some of them are framed vpon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that the ministres in that
church are in themselues lawfull, &amp;
of God: but not yet to be heard by
reason of the abuses, and euills to
be found in their ministrations.
Others vvithdraw hearin (&amp; those
the more) vpon the contrarie sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position:
to vvit, that the very order
and constitution of that church and
ministerie is papall, and vnlawfull.
Novv the examination of the
grounds of the one or other I vvill
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12562:18"/>
not in this place, medle vvith: but
(though both cannot be true) vvill
for the satisfieng of the vvithdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
on both parts, graunt for the
present, to either part their ground,
and so examine distinctlie vvhat
exceptions they can or doe build
herevpon.</p>
            <p>But first, for the former. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a church, and the ministerie,
thereof essentiallie lavvfull, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be lavvfull for the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of other churches in generall
vnion, and assosiation, vvith it to
communicate therevvith, in things
lavvfull, and lavvfullie done: seing
the end of vnion is communion.
God hath in vain vnited persons,
and states together, if they may in
nothing communicate together.
But he, who vvould haue vs <hi>receaue
the vveak in faith,</hi> vvhom <hi>God hath
receaued,</hi> vvould not haue vs refuse
the fellovvship of churches in that
vvhich is good, for any vveaknes,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12562:18"/>
in them, of one sort or other. And
this vve haue so plainlie, and plent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
commended vnto vs both by
the Prophets, yea by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the Iewish church; and
Apostles, and Apostolicall men in
the first christian churchs; in which
many errours, &amp; euils of all kindes
vvere more then manifest: and the
same oft times both so farre spread,
and deeply rooted, as the reforming
of them vvas rather to be vvished,
then hoped for: as that no place is
left for doubting in that case by
any, vvho desire to follovve their
holy steps in faith tovvards God,
and charitie tovvards men, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall

                  <p>I partake not in the sinnes of any:
how great or manifest soeuer the
sinnes bee: or hovv neer vnto me
soeuer the persons bee except the
same sinnes either be committed,
or remain vnreformed by my fault.
Othervvise, Christ our Lord had
been invvrapped in the guilt of a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12562:20"/>
vvorld of sinnes in the Ievvish
church, vvith vvhich church he
communicated in Gods ordinances,
liuing and dyeng a member therof.
If my brother sinne a scandelous
sinne, and I by just order, make
complaint thereof to the church, I
haue done my duty It appertaines to
the church to excommunicate him,
if he repent not; but not to me
except (Popelike) I vvould make
my selfe the church. I am guitty
of the euill in the common wealth,

vvhich if I do in the church as I
can, I am free from the sinnes done
and suffred there, vvhich sinnes and
euils I can no more be said to suffer
(vvanting povver to reforme them)
then to suffer it to blovv, or rain,
because I hinder it not.</p>
                  <p>But the proofe of the assertion
from <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. is of admirable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise.
Hovv doth the church sanctifie
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:12562:20"/>
the sinne of the sinner, as the Alter
doth the offering of the offerer?
The Alter makes that to become
actually an offering or holy gift,
vvhich before vvas not an offering
actually, but onely gold, silver, or
other materiall: So doth not the
church make any mans sinne to
become his sinne, vvhich it vvas
not before, but onely suffers the
sinne that vvas. But to strain the
strings of this imagined proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
to make them meet: and to suppose
the church in a sence to be as the
Alter; yet this only follovves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon:
that, as hee vvho partakes
vvith the Alter in the vpholding of
the offring, partakes vvith the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
so he that partakes vvith the
church in the vpholding of any

                  <p>And this I graunt vvillingly: but
deny, as a most vain imagination,
that euerie one, that partakes vvith

                  <p>For the better clearing of things,

of religious actions, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the seuerall ranks, in vvhich
they may rightly, &amp; orderly be sett.
Some such actions are religious
onely, as they are performed by
religious persons. And of this sort
is hearing (and so reading) of Gods
vvord. The scriptures teach, and
all confesse, that hearing of the
vvord of God goes before faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

all other acts of religion invvard,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10</note> or
outvvard:<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20</note> it must needs follovve,
that hearing is not simply or of it
selfe a vvork of religion: and so not
of religious communion. Hearing
is properly, and of it selfe, a naturall
action, though it be the hearing of
the very vvord of God. And I call
it a naturall action in it selfe, in a
double respect. First, for that the
light of nature teacheth euery man
to heare, and listen to another, that
can and vvill teach and inform him
in any thing for his good, diuine or
humane. Secondly, for that a meer
naturall man, levv, Turk, Infidell,
or Idolator, lavvfully may, yea ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
ought to hear Gods vvord:
that so of naturall he may become
spirituall.</p>

to be performed the one by a gift,<note place="margin">Ioh. 9 31.</note>
the other by a grace of Gods spirit.</p>
                  <p>Of a third sort is the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

it meanes, he is altogether ignorant.</p>
                  <p>If any reply: But vve know the
ministery of the church to be as it is.
I ansvvere, that the knowing of it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12562:26"/>
makes not our act the more, or lesse
an act of approbation. If I do an act
wherin I indeed approue of a thing,
if I know the thing, I really approue
of it vpon knowledge: if I know it

2. If I approue of the office,
simply, because I heare the officer
preach, then I much more approue
of all the doctrines vvhich hee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
because I heare him deliuer
them. If the latter seem vnreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,

                  <p>1. In the preaching of the truths
of the Gospell no Idolatrous act is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12562:27"/>
performed; as there vvas. 2. It must
be knowne, that approbation is
properly in the heart; and only the
manifestation of approbation in
outvvard gesture, speech or writing.
Both the one and other are euill if
the thing be euill. But heare it must
be considered, that I may in cases,
do the same outvvard act, vvhich
others do, and vvherein they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
their approbation of idolatrie
or other euill: and yet I be free, in
trueth and deed, from all such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
and stain thereof. The
levves after Christs death, and <hi>the
taking avvay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Col. 15.</note> and abolishing of the

of Gods vvorshippe, and still remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of deuine institution. <hi>Paul</hi> also
<hi>circumcised Timothy, entred the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>

approue, any manner of vvay of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12562:27"/>
errour and euill in the Ievvish wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers.
To come nearer home.
It is the custome in Popish coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
that all that passe by a crosse
must in honour of it leaue it on the
right hand, as they may, by reason
of the placeing of it, comming, or
going. Now if I ride vvith others
that vvay, I may do the thing, that
they doe, and keep companie vvith
them, &amp; yet not honour the crosse
as they do. It is besides the former,
the manner, that such, as so passe a
crosse, should in further honour
put of their hatt to the said crosse.
But if I do this also I plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
an approbation of the supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The reason of the difference
is, because I haue another iust cause
to do the former-thing, namely to
keep on vvith my company: but
haue no just cause of the latter. But
now suppose, that at the very place,
vvhere the crosse stands, I meet
vvith some friend, or other, to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12562:28"/>
vvhom I ovve that eiuill respect of
vncouering my head; I may then
do that lavvfully also vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ground. So if I had just and
reasonnable cause either of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
or standing by the Magistrate
(to vvhom I ovve this ciuill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)
vvhilst he is performing some
act of Idolatrie in the streetes, or els
vvhere; I might vpon the same
ground, go or stand vncouered by
him, vvithout just blame. To applie
these things to the objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moued,
seing no other cause could reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
be conceaued of the Kings
commaunding such a thing, or of
their doing the thing, at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
saue the vvorship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of the Idoll; they in so doing
could not haue escaped the just
blame of Idolatrie: But now I haue
just causes more then one of my
hearing, and amongst the rest, mine
edification; and therefore cannot
be chalenged therein to approue of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12562:28"/>
the ministers, flate, or standing.
Besides that, as I formerly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

vse became their sacraments: &amp; the
eating of the sacrifices of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,

and the eating of the Lords supper,

is most needfull (speciallie in things
of this kinde, for the preseruing of

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12562:39"/>
whilest men are not carefull to keep

Let me a litle turn my speach
to such, for the preuenting in some,
and remedying in others of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate

                  <p>And first I demaund of such, what
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12562:39"/>
is this course of hearing such mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
as vvhose stare of ministerie
they approue not? Is it any perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer
ordinance left by Christ, and
enjoyned all christians in all ages
and places? Verily no. It vvere to
be vvished that no church-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
vvere to be found, vvhich is
not approueable by the Word of
God, notwithstanding any good act
performed by them that posses it.
This hearing is onely a vvork of
naturall liberty in it selfe, as I haue
shewed, and sanctified to beleeuers
by their faith. It is lawfull to vse it
vpon occasion, as it is to borrow of
other men: but to make it our cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
is to liue by borrovving, vvhich
no honest man, that can do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise
possibly, vvould do. Yea what
differs it from a kinde of spirituall
vagabondry in him that can mend
it, though vvith som difficulty, to
liue in no certain church-state, and
vnder no church-order, and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:12562:40"/>
To print deep in our hearts the
conscience of our duties this vvay;
let vs briefly consider how many
bonds of necessity the Lord hath
layd vpon vs, to vvalk in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowshippe,
&amp; vnder the ordinances
of the ministeriall and instituted-church.</p>
                  <p>First, vve haue lying vpon vs the
necessite of obedience to Christ our
Lord in the commission Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
enjoyning, that after vve be
<hi>made disciples,</hi> as the vvord is,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19. 20.</note> and
<hi>baptised</hi> vve be vvithall <hi>taught to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
vvhatsoeuer he hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
It must not then suffice vs, that
vve are disciples, and christians, but
we must joyn hearewith the entire
obseruation of al the ordinances of
Christ (as vve can finde meanes)
from the greatest to the least. And
let vs beware that like the <hi>Scribes</hi> &amp;
<hi>Pharisees,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 19. 20.</note> vve call none of Gods
commaundements <hi>litle,</hi> because vve
vvould make our selues, and others
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12562:40"/>
beleeue, that litle, and light account
is to be made of obseruing them:
lest vve our selues bee <hi>called litle,</hi>
that is, be indeed none <hi>in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen.</hi> Our sinnes of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and humane frayly, alas, are
to many, let vs not adde therevnto
presumptuous sinnes either of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
or omission, to prouoke
God vvithall.</p>
                  <p>2. The church, and ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
therein are not needlesse, but
most needfull meanes sanctified of
God, and giuen of Christ for our
<hi>saluation</hi> and <hi>edification</hi> therevnto:<note place="margin">Act 2. 47.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>3. Our great infirmities vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
both the scriptures euery vvhere,
and our owne experience vvarn vs,
shew in vvhat great need vve stand
of all the Lords holy ordinances,
and institutions for the supplying
of vvhat is vvanting in vs; and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
of vvhat is a misse; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing,
and encreasing of vvhat is
good, vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Lord:
vvhere vve must also take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and remember, that it is on
note of difference, and the same
very cleare, betvveene the vvise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the fleshe, and the vvise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the spirit, that the former
vvilbe sure to prouide for the body,
and outvvard man, vvhat may bee:
though vvith danger, and prejudize
of the spirituall: the other vvill take
care and order, for the spirituall state
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12562:41"/>
though the outvvard pinch for it.
And if any out of the view, and
persuation of his ovvne strength of
grace come to conceaue, that he
stands in no such need of Christs
ordinances, or of any christian fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovvshippe
for the dispensing of
them: let such a man consider, that
the lesse need he hath of others by
reason of his greater plenty of grace
receaued, the more need others haue
of him for their supply. But vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
any imagine of himselfe, the
Apostle, vvho vvas not partiall, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
that the very head (the chiefe

                  </p>
                  <p>4. And lastly, it is necessarie for
our sound, and entire comfort vvith
the Lord our God, that our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be entire in respect of all his
holy commandements, vvhich vve
do, or can discern to be such, and to
concerne vs, according to that of the

man of God,<note place="margin">Psa. 119 6</note> 
                     <hi>Then shal I not be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

haue our part in the testimonie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by the holy Ghost of <hi>Zachary</hi>
and <hi>Elizabeth:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 5. 6.</note> vvhich vvas, that <hi>they
vvere righteous before God, walking
in all the commaundements, &amp; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of the Lord, blamelesse.</hi> That
is, both in the morall precepts, and
sacred ceremonies, and institutions
of the Lord, Whose examples vve
in our place, and times are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
not balking vvith the Lord
in any thing, great, or small: nor
seeking starting holes vvhereby to

is vvholy <hi>good</hi> and <hi>pure.</hi> Good, as

vvith vvhom God hath joyned vs
in the most and best things: taking

more by our course held against

vvhich God forbid.</p>
                  <p>To conclude. For my selfe, thus I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
with my heart before God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
with my tongue, and haue before the
world, that I haue one and the same faith,
hope, spirit, baptisin, and Lord which I had
in the church of England and none other:
that I esteem so many in that church, of
what state, or order soeuer, as are truly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of that faith (as I account many
thousand to be) for my christian brethren:
and my selfe a fellow-member with them
of that one misticall body of Christ scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
far and wide throughout the world:
that I haue alwaies in spirit, and affection al

the appartenances thereof: and vniting in

for my failings (which may easily be too

            <p>IT may seeme strange vnto you bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12562:45"/>
and as vnseasonable that after so long

Our defence in the former case
is, partly, the other churchs keeping
the same so long in their hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they sent it vnto vs; and partly
their contentions arising about it, of
vvhich vve both desired to see some
issue, and hoped vvithall, that by

communicate our counseills together;
as vve conceiue, by your joint letter,

in vain. For the letter then, (part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fearing, lest vve should seeme to

some vse might be made thereof for

it better late them neuer to addresse

Indeed he that is vnder the Law, &amp;

an Idolator, and against the 6. 4 mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,

God, and the rigour of justice: whom
yet for men so to call and prosecute,
vvere rashe and rude at the least:
But now if the person can in respect of
other good things, by the vvord of God
&amp; vtmost extent of charity be deemed
to haue any the least interest in the
grace of the gospell, to censure such a
one as an idolator, theefe, murderer,

teacheth vs to iudge, and speak other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
vvhere he calls such of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Corinthians, as by occasion of
friends &amp; corruptions of times were
drawne to partake in the Idoll feasts,

<hi>Iohn 1. Psal. 1. 5. Iohn</hi> 9. 3. 29. so all
that practise through ignorance, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie,
some acts (lesse discernable)
of Idolatrie, are not Idolators: but
such in vvhom it raigneth in action
or disposition.</p>
            <p>Lastlie, If all in the church of
England, and of Mr. Iakobs, church
be idolators as the Apostle there speaks:
then are they all excluded from the

makes any cease to be a member ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And if the greater number be
members still, though inerrour: the
smaller cannot be the body. Besides,
if some particuler sinne, or errour
make the greatest part, not to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
then much more two or three
perticulers. Which therevpon the
