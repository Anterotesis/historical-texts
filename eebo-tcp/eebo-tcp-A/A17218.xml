            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This doth God alway afore he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and plague the world. This (I ſay) hath ever beene the worke of God ſince the beginning, as the ſtories and propheſies of all the holy Bible doe teſtifie. And though we had no writing of Gods acts in times paſt, yet hath he practiſed this ſame his wonderfull worke of mercy upon us. So that like as we muſt needs confeſſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>God hath ſhewed no leſſe kindneſſe to us than he did to the old world.</hi>
               </note> that we are created of God, and redeemed by his only mercy in his deare Sonne Ieſus Chriſt: So can we not denie, but we have heard his holy meſſage, had no leſſe preachings and warnings of dangers to come, than other have had afore our daies. Yea even the ſame mercifull God that ſent <hi>Noe</hi> to preach righteouſneſſe unto the wicked world, and converted the Ninivites by his word in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> hath done even ſo with us in every condition. And ſome (thanks be unto him therefore) hath bee brought out of darkneſſe into his wonderfull light, and out of the devils ſervice, into the kingdome of his deare Sonne.</p>
            <p>But alas and woe to this unthankfull world. For like as a great number that be in priſon of Satan, will not come forth when they

And like as when a poore wretch commeth out of priſon, he ſhall have moe to ſtand gaſing and gaping upon him, than to doe him good, or to helpe him to his fees: Even ſo now that God of his mercy hath called us out of Satans priſon, and from the ſchoole of falſe doctrine, my Lords foole with his companions ſtandeth ſtaring upon us, and mocketh us, becauſe we ſit not ſtill with other priſoners.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The doctrine of Chriſt his faith is no new thing.</hi>
               </note>Wherefore, in conſideration hereof I have here ſet forth this booke: partly becauſe it ſheweth the antiquitie and ancient age of our holy Chriſtian faith, and partly to give occaſion unto all ſuch as have received it, not to be aſhamed of it, nor to ſhrinke from it, for any opprobrious mockage or ſcornfull deriſion in this world. The Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18.</note> that the preaching or word of Chriſts croſſe, is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe to them that periſh, and that the thing which appertaineth to the ſpirit of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.14.</note> is fooliſhneſſe to a carnall minded man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by like as we may learne that it is no new thing to be mocked and ſtared upon for holding with the doctrine that maketh ſo much of Chriſt his death, and the true worſhipping of God in the ſpirit: even ſo may we ſee (to the ſingular comfort of our conſcience) that no man mocketh us for it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>None but reprobates deride the truth of Gods Goſpell.</hi>
               </note> but ſuch as periſh and are carnally min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and that for all their deriſion and ſcorning, it is yet the power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. and belongeth to his holy ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. and is not our owne doctrine,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>To us which are ſaved, it is the power of God.</hi>
               </note> neither of any other mans making. This is now to us a comfort and conſolation.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the world is angry with us for our faith, and giveth us ſo euill report for teaching it, it ſhall be expedient for us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what faith is, and what faith we meane, when we make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. Firſt, becauſe we may not deſcribe it after our owne judgement, we will rehearſe the words of the Apoſtle, which writing to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>What faith is.</hi> Hebr. 11.1.</note> ſaith after this manner: Faith is a ſubſtance of things to be hoped for, an evidence or certaintie of things which doe not appeare. By the which definition, it is manifeſt, that when we ſet forth or teach this faith, we meane no vaine faith, no falſe opinion of faith, no fond imagination of faith, no dead faith, no
<pb facs="tcp:9365:4"/>
idle faith; but a ſubſtantiall thing, even a ſure beleefe of things that are to be hoped for, and a proofe, experience, or knowledge of things that are not ſeene. This faith then is the inſtrument, whereby we feele and are certaine of heavenly things, that our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eye cannot ſee. Now becauſe none other vertue can ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the mercy of God, nor certifie us ſo effectually of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as this living faith doth, therefore hath the Scripture impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our juſtification before God, only unto faith among all other vertues: not without other vertues following, but without any other worke or deed juſtifying. This is the faith of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.28. Gal. 2.16. Epheſ. 2.8. Phil. 3.9. Iaco. 2.14.</note> which all the Scripture ſpeaketh of. This is the faith that <hi>S. Paul</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to juſtifie in the ſight of God: as <hi>S. Iames</hi> teacheth, that works juſtifie in the ſight of men, and that it is but a dead faith which hath no works. This is the faith, without the which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and of the which whatſoever proceedeth not, is ſinne. This is the faith whereby God purifieth our hearts,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6. Rom. 14.23. Act. 15.9. 1 Pet. 1.9. Gala. 5.6. 1 Cor. 10.3. Heb. 11.4.</note> and whoſe end is ſalvation. This is the faith that worketh by charitie or godly love, &amp; is of value before God. This is the faith whereby the holy fathers which were afore Chriſts incarnation did in ſpirit eat and drinke &amp; enjoy the ſame mercy of God in Chriſt, that we are partakers of. To be ſhort, this is the ſame faith, whereby God ſaved thoſe his elect, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>S. Paul</hi> maketh mention in the foreſaid epiſtle to the Hebrewes, and rehearſeth many godly fruits of the ſame in their converſation.</p>
            <p>This then is no new-fangled faith, no ſtrange faith, no faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by mans braine, but even the ſame that Gods holy ſpirit teacheth in the infallible truth of his Scripture, and that <hi>Adam, Abel, Enoch,</hi> and all the other ſervants of God were ſaved in. Why doe men therefore either call it a new-fangled faith, or report evill of us, for ſetting it forth? Why? I feare me this is one cauſe: The old faith that all thoſe ſervants of God had, whom the Apoſtle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in the eleventh to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.4, 5.</note> had a life and converſation joyned unto it, which was rich and full of all good works. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing there be ſo many bablers and pratlers of faith, and ſo few that bring forth the worthy fruits of repentance, it giveth the world occaſion to report of us, that our faith is but new-fangled. They ſee us not fall to labour and taking of paines, as <hi>Adam</hi> did: They ſee not the righteouſneſſe and thankfulneſſe in us, that was in <hi>Abel:</hi> They ſee us not walke after the word and will of God, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did: They ſee us not take Gods warning ſo earneſtly as <hi>Noe</hi> did: They ſee us not ſo obedient to the voice of God, nor ſo well willing and content to leave our friends, to forſake our owne wils, our owne lands and goods at Gods calling, and dwell in a ſtrange country, to doe Gods pleaſure, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did: they ſee that wee chuſe not rather to ſuffer adverſitie with the people of God, than to enioy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon: They ſee us not eſteeme
<pb facs="tcp:9365:5"/>

            <p>In concluſion: Though there be never ſo many that recant and

               <note place="margin">Iames 3.17. <hi>We muſt put on the nature of Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>

Which thing if we doe, then ſhall we follow no filthy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine nor counterfeited wiſdome, then ſhall we be no breakers of peace, then ſhall we be as glad to forgive, as we would be forgiven, glad to be reformed, rich and plentifull in the workes of mercie and good fruits of the old faith: then ſhall we be no quarrell-pickers or diſſemblers with any man: Then ſhall wee not only be found the maintainers of peace and all good order, but peaceably alſo, and in all gentle manner ſhall we (both in word and deed) ſow, ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and ſhew the fruit of that righteouſneſſe, which commeth only of God through Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If any of them that are gone (of high or low eſtate, pretending to be maintainers, favourers, ſetters forth, or ſcholers of Chriſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) hath in any condition diſſembled therewith, fallen from God, misbehaved himſelfe in the affaires of his Prince, miſgoverned his houſhold, maintained riot, vice and ſinne, or brought the good word of God into any evill report by his ungodly converſation (as I feare me, it be too true) let us beware by ſuch mens fall. Let us not receive the grace of God in vaine. For like as they that harden their hearts at Gods word, and ſpurne wilfully againſt it, are ſure of their damnation,<note place="margin">

Wherefore let us that have received the old true faith of Chriſt, not only be content to abide any ſtorme or trouble for it (yea to be mocked, ſcorned, perſecuted, and put to death therefore, if it ſo pleaſe God) but alſo unfainedly every man to his power, in his heart by fervent prayer, in his mouth by good words, and in all his bodie by vertuous converſation and good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian workes, helpe and labour, that the bleſſed word of God may have the due honour belonging thereunto, and that the ſame which it hath loſt through ungodly behaviour of ſome, may through the grace and goodneſſe of God bee wonne againe in our good living: That God may have of us better ſervants, our Prince truer ſubjects, and our neighbours more unfained lovers, than many have been before us. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>Now it is true that all the Prophecies were then firſt fulfilled, and the true ſalvation performed; yea from that time forth were all the glorious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Chriſt ſo richly declared and powred out among all people, as they never were afore.

                     <hi>The firſt creation of heaven and earth.</hi>
                  </note> he provided firſt for him wonderfully, and furniſhed him with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable riches of his goodneſſe. For when he deviſed the creation of man, and the time was now come, which his godly wiſdome and providence had ordained, he firſt of all appointed a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lodging for man, and garniſhed the ſame yet much more wonderfully. At the beginning (when the goodly and cleere light was made) the Lord
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9365:8"/>
prepared the inſtruments, which he afterward ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred one from another, and ordained every one to ſome purpoſe. Over the deepe, that is, over the water and earth (which yet was in the water) made he a firmament, and ſpread out the heaven above as a pavilion. Afterward out of the water he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and brought forth the earth, (as much as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the habitation of men) and appointed the water his bounds and markes, which it may not overpaſſe. And theſe three things, the water, the earth, and the firmament, (that is to ſay, the aire and cleareneſſe above us unto the height of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) are the eſſentiall and ſubſtantiall parcels of the world, and ſerve as an houſe for the habitation of men: Nevertheleſſe as yet all this was but rough and unfiniſhed, and nothing garniſhed at all: Therefore did the wiſe and faithfull maſter put forth his hand wider,<note place="margin">

               <p>And firſt, in as much as man ſhould inhabit the earth, he garniſhed it aforehand, and cloathed it with a goodly greene garment, that is, with a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which hee deckt firſt with flowers and all manner of herbes, which not onely are pleaſant to looke upon, and wonderfully beautified, of a pleaſant taſte and goodly colour, but alſo profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for food and all manner of medicine.

and running waters. And the ground made he not like on every ſide, but in many places ſet it up pleaſantly: And hereof have wee the vallies, plaines, mountains and hills: which things all have their due operation, fruit, and pleaſantneſſe.</p>
               <p>After this alſo began he to garniſh the heaven and firmament, and ſet therein the Sunne and the Moone, the Planets and Starres: which things all are goodlier and more wonderfull than mans tongue can expreſſe. As for their office,<note place="margin">

               <p>When the Lord now had prepared this goodly and rich pleaſure, then firſt after theſe hee made man, that he might bee Lord of all theſe things.

                  </note> and created him after his owne image. He made him of body and ſoule, which ſhould have endured for ever, if he had not fallen into ſinne. Now hath he a fraile bodie, and an immortall everlaſting ſoule. But the firſt man made he altogether perfect and without blemiſh, ſo that verily he was called the image of God not without cauſe. The Lord alſo was not ſufficed in garniſhing the earth goodly, but firſt alſo builded upon the earth a ſpeciall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of pleaſure, even a Paradiſe: and therein ſet he man his deare beloved creature.<note place="margin">

the righteouſneſſe of God, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us out of the bonds of the Devill. For hee died for us all, in as much as God ſaid: <hi>In what day ſoever thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> Therefore died Chriſt for us all, that through his death we might live, and be taken out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darkneſſe, and be ſet in the kingdome of the deare beloved Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>This device of Gods wiſdome (which no doubt was determinate from everlaſting) was alſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened unto <hi>Adam,</hi> after the fall, in manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: When man had eaten of the fruit of the forbidden tree, immediatly his eyes were opened; in ſo much that he was aſhamed, when he ſaw that he was naked. Hitherto had hee lived in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, therefore began he now to cover himſelfe, but with ſimple clothing, which they truſted not much to (like as it is all unprofitable, that man of himſelfe will cover his ſinne withall) ſaving that they fled from the Lord, and hid themſelves from him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sinne.</hi>
                  </note> But the Lord followed upon the fugitive, put him in minde of his decay, miſerie, and the life that hee was fallen from, and ſaid; <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> Or knoweſt thou what miſerie thou art fallen into from great felicitie? Now ſhould man have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his fault, but hee ſhewed himſelfe ſtiffe-necked. And the Lord moveth him ſtill, to ſee if he will acknowledge his ſinne, and ſaid: <hi>Who told thee that thou art naked?</hi> Yea, to helpe him in the matter, and to make him confeſſe his ſinne, hee ſaith moreover; <hi>Haſt thou not eaten of the tree of the which I forbad thee that thou ſhouldeſt not eat?</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:9365:11"/>
But man was loth to knowledge his ſinne, and laid it firſt upon the woman his companion; and the ſame did he with ſo froward and unadviſed words,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The frowardneſſe of man.</hi>
                  </note> that a man may eaſily ſee, that ſecretly in his heart, he wickedly and unreaſonably laid the fault upon God.

                     <hi>Why God gave the woman unto man.</hi>
                  </note> And yet the righteous God gave him not the woman to deceive him, but to bee an helpe to him. Therefore appeareth it here againe, that the ſinne of man was the more wilfull &amp; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.<note place="margin">

                  </note> and they both had no power. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like as <hi>Adam</hi> put all the fault to the woman, even ſo laid the woman all the fault upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that is, upon the Devill.

Againe, who is ſo blinde, but he ſeeth, that all ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be aſcribed to the onely meere grace and mercie of God? For now followeth it firſt how God handled this matter.</p>

Therefore doth the Lord righteouſly curſe the Serpent the Devill. Unto the bodily ſerpent alſo (whom the Devill uſed as an inſtrument) he giveth a ſore curſe, and ſaith; <hi>Vpon thy belly ſhalt thou goe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Geneſ. 3.14.</note> 
                  <hi>and earth ſhalt thou eat all the dayes of thy life:</hi> When this was done, it was ordained now firſt for man, that (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the righteouſneſſe and truth of God) he ſhould bee puniſhed alſo with the curſe and with eternall death: but for the cauſes expreſſed in the beginning of this chapter, the curſe was directed unto Chriſt, who alſo with cleare words was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and ſo was life in him promiſed likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſaith not the Lord now; And curſed bee thou man, becauſe thou haſt done againſt my Commandement; but, <hi>And I will put enmitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thee and the woman,</hi>

And the ſame pure virgin and gracious mother hath borne unto us him that trod downe the Serpents head. The head of the Serpent is the power and kingdome of the Devill, even ſinne, the curſe and damnation. All this hath that bleſſed ſeed broken for his faithfull.

               <p>ANd hitherto I truſt we have had in the firſt promiſe of God the foundation, and the whole ſumme of our holy Chriſtian faith; namely, that the whole generation of man was but loſt through his owne fault and wickedneſſe, and fallen into death and damnation, ſo that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth nothing in man but it is diſpleaſant to God: Hereof commeth it that there is nothing to be aſcribed unto the power and deſerving of man, ſave ſinne and malediction. But God of his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mercy had compaſſion on us, and of very grace promiſed he life unto us againe in his Sonne our Lord Ieſus, whom he would to become man, and to ſuffer death in his fleſh, that thereby hee might tread downe the devill, death, ſinne and hell. Item, he would put enmitie betweene the womans ſeed and the ſerpent, that is, he would endue us (which are the ſeed, that is to ſay, the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> if wee beleeve) with another heart and power, that we might become enemies unto the devils workes, reſiſt his ſuggeſtion, and hold our ſelves faſt by the bleſſed ſeed, labouring and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whatſoever God enjoyneth us to worke and ſuffer. Who is it now, which ſeeth not herein, all that is written in the whole Scripture, of beleefe, of love and innocencie, that is to ſay, of a Chriſtian life and faith? Who ſo is diſpoſed, let him looke
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9365:15"/>
upon the 2.3. and 4. chapters of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, the firſt and ſecond to the Epheſians: let him compare thoſe chapters toward this ſumme, and he ſhall finde it none otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>For as much then as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had faith in God, and ſtood ſo toward God, that they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged themſelves to be ſinners, and truſted to be ſaved only through the bleſſed ſeed, giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over willingly into the diſcipline and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, travell and trouble of this time.

                  <hi>And Adam called his wife Heva, becauſe ſhee ſhould be the mother of all living.</hi> For as ſoone as he was now ſtrengthned through the promiſe of God, and beleeved that hee and his poſteritie (which elſe were children of wrath, of the devill, and of death) ſhould live through the bleſſed ſeed, he turned his wives name, and called her <hi>Heva,</hi> for the remembrance of the matter, and practiſing of his faith: for he beleeved, that ſhee now living in the power of the bleſſed ſeed, ſhould bring forth, not only quicke men temporally as pertaining to this naturall life; (like as we call other creatures living) but living, that is to ſay, children of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt eternall life from himſelfe, and from us his poſteritie: but the ſame is given unto us againe through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Adam</hi> for as much as he beleeved, changed his wives name, like as we finde that for great weighty cauſes the names of certaine places, cities and men
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9365:15"/>
were changed: Thus was <hi>Iacob</hi> called <hi>Iſrael; Simon, Peter; Luthz, Bethel. Eve</hi> had now a name of life, for <hi>Haiah</hi> in Hebrew is as much to ſay, as Life.

one of us, and he ſhall know good and evill.</hi> This doth God ſpeake which is one in ſubſtance, and three in perſons: he propheſieth here unto <hi>Adam,</hi> that he ſhall know or have experience of good and evill, that is to ſay, that upon earth he muſt feele proſperitie and adverſitie, miſerie and trouble, ſowre and ſweet, and muſt ſuffer neceſſitie, paine and affliction.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Through faith did Abel offer a greater ſacrifice than did Cain, and thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained he witneſſe that he was righteous.

                  </note> It followeth that he was made righteous through faith in Ieſus Chriſt. In that he did ſacrifice, it is a token and fruit of a heart that was thankfull, and feared God. It was no ſuch enterpriſe, that he would clenſe and make himſelfe acceptable unto God through that outward ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. For certaine it is, that no outward oblation purifieth man within: But the grace of God gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us through Jeſus Chriſt, purifieth us aright. And the outward ſacrifices of the old fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, beſide that they were tokens of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, praiſe, and magnifying of God, (as it is ſaid afore) were figures of the only perpetuall ſacrifice of our Saviour Chriſt.

Now when they perceive that their faith is not right, and that their hypocriſie is eſpied and miſliked, then fall they to murthering, to the which God is an enemie, and forbiddeth it with his word. For <hi>Cain</hi> alſo exhorted hee from his purpoſe, and ſaid, Thou needeſt not to arme thee becauſe of thy brother, for thou haſt none oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to be angrie with him.

               <p>Moreover, the enmitie betweene the children of God and of man (that is, the iſſue of the Serpent) grew ever more and more: ſo that on the one ſide the multitude of God increaſed, and on the other ſide the multitude of the devill:<note place="margin">

                  </note> It is much more reaſon that Gods Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or bequeſt remaine ſtill, and that nothing be added to it, or taken from it.

tranſgreſſed the way and truth of their Fathers, and knew no more what was ſinne, right or unright, wherein ſtood ſalvation or damnation: for they were corrupt through the long dwelling among the Idolaters of Aegypt. Therefore did God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine them the Law, out of the which they might learne the will of God, what ſinne, right or unright is, and to know themſelves, to goe into themſelves, and to conſider how that the holy workes which God requireth, are not in their owne power; for the which cauſe all the world have great need of a Mediator.<note place="margin">

                  </note> And thus the Law was given to further the promiſe, namely, that wee through the Law might be led only unto Chriſt. For thus followeth it in <hi>Pauls</hi> words:<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>And it was given of Angels by the hand of a Mediator. A Mediatour is not a Mediatour of one only: but God is one. Is the Law then againſt the promiſes of God? God forbid. Howbeit, if there had beene given a law, which could have given life, then no doubt righteouſneſſe ſhould come of the Law. But the Scripture hath ſhut up all under ſinne, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhould come by the faith on Ieſus Chriſt, given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that beleeve. Before faith came (that is to ſay, Ieſus Chriſt in whom we beleeve) we were kept and ſhut up under the Law, unto the faith which ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward be declared.

Chriſt. The Law therefore confirmeth the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe concerning the bleſſed ſeed, and teacheth that wee obtaine all ſalvation in him only.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Law is the rule to live by.</hi>
                  </note> Howbeit it is alſo a rule of our life, informing us what wee ought to doe, and what we ought to leave undone. Yet on our ſide is all unfruitfull, where faith is not.

               <p>God alſo among his people wrought many things, whereby hee ſet the cauſe of Ieſus Chriſt clearely afore the eies of the people, as it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed afore by the Lambe of the Paſſeover.

               <p>Beſides this, if we conſider the declaration of the lawes of the firſt Table (which teacheth how we ſhall behave our ſelves right toward God, to love, worſhip and honour him, to ſerve him and to cleave only unto him) we ſhall finde in the ſame firſt Table, the whole cauſe of Chriſt.

                  </note>Out of all this is it eaſie to underſtand, how that theſe rites and ceremonies of the fathers were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and given to the people of God. Not that they with the letter and outward viſible and corporal thing ſhould ſufficiently ſerve God which is a ſpirit, but that they ſhould lift up their mindes above the ſame to the ſpirituall things, pondering the mercy of God; out of the which hee being moved, is become gracious unto us. And when he might have damned us for our ſins and miſdeeds, he ſpared us for his Sons ſake, whom he gave unto death, and his innocent death hath he accepted for our ſinnes. Such a faithfull conſideration (which is the true beleefe) pleaſeth God, and with ſuch a faith is God ſerved, and ſuch a faith would the Lord have taught and planted in us, with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid rites and ceremonies. Therefore all they that pleaſed God among the old fathers, pleaſed him not for the letters ſake, but by reaſon of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>When the ſacrifice alſo and ceremonie was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted after the ordinance of God in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the beloved friends of God had not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the outward thing, but much rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held they Chriſt with the eyes of faith, and thought thus:<note place="margin">

Nevertheleſſe he hath taken
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9365:32"/>
us to his mercy, and promiſed us a ſeed, which ſhould thus die on the Croſſe, and cleanſe us with his bloud, and with his death reſtore us unto life: which thing no doubt ſhall as ſurely come to paſſe, as this beaſt is ſlaine and offered now afore our eyes. And like as the bloud is ſprinkled over the people, for the bodily cleanſing: ſo ſhall the bloud of Chriſt be ſprinkled upon our ſoules, &amp;c. And out of ſuch a thought and faithfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſacrifices, grew repentance and ſorrow for their ſinnes, a gladneſſe, praiſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and thanks-giving unto God the mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy foot-ſtoole.</hi> In the firſt verſe <hi>David</hi> knowledgeth the perſons in the holy Trinitie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The holy Trinitie.</hi>
                  </note> the God-head alſo and the eternall kingdome of Chriſt. Thus like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe did our Lord Jeſus Chriſt underſtand and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage this verſe in the Goſpell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging two of the Perſons in the one only God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.44.</note> for he ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord.</hi> Now is it certaine and undeniable, that hee which ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and he to whom ought is ſpoken, are not one, but two Perſons. Yet is there but one Lord and God, and they both (the Father that ſpeaketh, and the Sonne to whom is ſpoken) are the Lord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they one, of one ſubſtance and being, the very true God. Neither is the Sonne leſſe than the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9365:37"/>
Father. There can alſo none be a father, except he have a ſonne or a childe. Now is the everlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, therefore is the Sonne alſo everlaſting. There is alſo but one only everlaſting without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Both the Father and the Sonne are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall without beginning, therefore are they one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true God with the holy Ghoſt. Like as <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>In the beginning,</hi> (that is to ſay, <hi>from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting) was the Word, and the Word was with God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 1.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Word was God.</hi> And immediatly thereafter, ſaith he, that the Word is Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. For it followeth: <hi>The Word became fleſh.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 1.14.</note> Therefore doth <hi>David</hi> alſo call the Son of God ſpecially his Lord, ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 22.24. <hi>The faith of</hi> David <hi>in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </note> And therefore calleth he Chriſt his Lord, becauſe hee confeſſeth and beleeveth, that he is his very naturall Lord and God, as <hi>Thomas</hi> alſo did knowledge:<note place="margin">Iohn 20.20.</note> 
                  <hi>My Lord and my God, Ioh.</hi> 20. Afterward calleth he him his Lord, becauſe that after the nature of man, he ſhould be borne out of his loynes. For thorowout all the Scripture is our Lord Ieſus called the Sonne of <hi>David:</hi> And thus doth <hi>David</hi> knowledge two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt, the nature of God, and the nature of man.</p>
               <p>That the kingdome of Chriſt ſhall laſt for ever, and that the kinde and nature of man ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted aboue all heavens (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.) <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> teſtifieth with theſe words: <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy foot-ſtoole.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 110.1.</note> For <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith in the ſixteenth chapter:<note place="margin">Marke 16.19.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord was taken up into heaven, and ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi> Of this alſo finde we 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.15. Now muſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9365:38"/>
he needs be very God indeed, which reigneth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and to whom all enemies muſt be ſubdued, yea caſt utterly unto his feet. Now followeth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe:<note place="margin">Pſalm. 110.2.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend thy mightie ſtaffe out of Sion: thou ſhalt be Lord, even in the middeſt among thine enemies.</hi> Here ſpeaketh he of the preaching of the holy Goſpell, and how the world ſhould be converted unto Chriſt, and Chriſt to reigne in the middeſt of the world. In the firſt verſe is ſpoken of the eternall kingdome, that he is very God, living and reigning for ever,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The ſpirituall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </note> not only in this time, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo after this time eternally. But here ſpeaketh hee ſpecially of the kingdome, whereas hee reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth here beneath through the Goſpell. For the Staffe, the Scepter, the Rod of Chriſt is the holy Goſpell, even the power of God, which ſaveth all that beleeve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. Which maketh Chriſts enemies friends, and ſmiteth them downe that will not convert: ſo that Chriſt hath dominion and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie even in the middeſt among his enemies. It is he, that with the ſpirit of his mouth ſlayeth the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts. This his word alſo and preachings of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Acts 1.8.12.</note> came forth firſt from Sion or Hieruſalem, as <hi>Eſay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 110.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Micheas,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> doe teſtifie. Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the third verſe: <hi>In the day of thy battell (or armie) ſhall thy people be well willing: the dew of thy birth is unto thee in an holy maieſtie, out of the wombe of the cleare morning.</hi> Herewith doth <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the glorious and victorious faith of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A battell.</hi>
                  </note> For when the Goſpell is preached, there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a conflict betweene faith and infidelitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſeed of Chriſt and the Serpent, between
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9365:38"/>
idolatrie and true godlineſſe. And the unbeleevers perſecute the Lord Chriſt in his members, that is to ſay, the faithfull: but they are well content utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give over bodie, honour and goods, their bloud and life for Gods truths ſake. For the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and they in the Primitive Church, being gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together of the Apoſtles, and after the Apoſtles time, have thus kept truth and faith toward the Lord Chriſt, and were willing to die for knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him. Afterward deſcribeth he alſo in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid verſe, the pure and holy conception and birth of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And this doth he with a goodly ſimilitude, and ſaith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The birth of Chriſt.</hi> Pſalm. 110.3.</note> Thy birth ſhall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and very excellent, not uncleane as the birth of other men: For like as the dew out of the cleare heaven, and out of the faire morning, is borne as it were out of a mothers wombe: even ſo alſo ſhalt thou be borne holy and cleane, of an undefiled vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Whereof thou findeſt more inſtruction, Luk 1.31. <hi>The Lord hath ſworne, and it ſhall not repent him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 110.4.</note> 
                  <hi>thou-art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The office of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </note> In this fourth verſe deſcribeth he the office of Ieſus Chriſt, how that he is ordained of God to be one only Prieſt for ever, which ſhould offer up himſelfe for the ſinne of the world, and alway ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the ſight of God the Father, and to pray for us. All this doth holy <hi>Paul</hi> declare at large to the Hebrewes in the 5.7.8·9. and 10. chapters. And ſpecially in this verſe is grounded all that is read thorowout the Scripture, of the merits of Chriſt, of the forgiving of ſinnes, of righteous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, of being Mediatour, and that he alone is the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9365:39"/>
only Salvation, Advocate, Satisfaction and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the faithfull.<note place="margin">Pſalm. 110.5.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord is at thy right hand: he in the time of his wrath ſhall wound even Kings.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chriſts cauſe ſhall forth.</hi>
                  </note> This fifth verſe teacheth, how God will ever more and more ſtand on his Sonnes ſide, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his cauſe, and bring downe and deſtroy thoſe Kings, Princes, and Lords, that will not amend and beleeve in Chriſt, but will rather provoke his wrath, than deſire his grace. Which thing <hi>Herod, Nero, Domician, Maximine</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Yet followeth the ſixt verſe declaring the fifth: <hi>He ſhal iudge among the Heathen, and fill all full of dead bodies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 110.6.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſmite the head on the wide ground.</hi> Chriſt is alſo preached unto the Heathen, and reigneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: but many withſtand Chriſt, and them doth he judge. And like as a King overcommeth his enemies with a battell, and covereth the whole plaine with dead bodies, viſiteth alſo and ſmiteth the head of the warre, and the head citie of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chriſt ſhall deſtroy his enemies.</hi>
                  </note> Even ſo doth Chriſt to his enemies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth their power and kingdome. All which things wee have ſeene in the old unchriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Rome, and in many other potentates and powers. But ſpecially he breaketh the head of the old Serpent, according to the promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. And at the laſt ſhall he come to judge the quicke and dead,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 110.7.</note> and deſtroy his enemies for ever. <hi>Out of the brooke in the way ſhall he drinke, therefore ſhall hee alſo lift up the head.</hi> Finally and in the ſeventh verſe, he deſcribeth the paſſion of Chriſt and his glorie. <hi>In the way</hi> (ſaith he) that is, in his life while he is in this miſery, <hi>He ſhall drinke out of the brooke,</hi> that is,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9365:39"/>
he ſhall ſuffer and be overcome. For to drinke out of the cup, is as much as to ſuffer. But to drinke out of the brooke, is to be altogether full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to be vexed and tormented without victorie, and utterly to be overwhelmed with a brooke and ſtrong ſtreame of troubles. Thus was it his minde to declare the Paſſion of Chriſt. After the Paſſion, followeth the glory with the Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion. <hi>Paul,</hi> Philip. 2. ſpeaketh of both, and ſaith,<note place="margin">Philip. 2.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt humbled himſelfe, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe. Wherefore God hath exalted him, and given him a name, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all names, &amp;c.</hi> Thus much be ſpoken of this Pſalme, and of <hi>Davids</hi> underſtanding, which hee had of Chriſt Ieſus and of the Chriſtian faith.</p>
               <p>Upon this I marvell, if (after ſo evident teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies) there be yet any man, which perceiveth not, that <hi>Davids</hi> faith and underſtanding of Chriſt, was even one faith and underſtanding, with the faith that we knowledge and ſay: I beleeve in one God Father almightie, &amp;c. as it is in the twelve Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Chriſtian faith. For the holy Trinitie in one God-head doth he knowledge, not only here, but alſo in the 33. Pſalme, ſaying,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 133.6. <hi>The article of the holy Trinitie.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Through the word of God were the heavens made, and all their power through the ſpirit of his mouth.</hi> For certaine it is, that there is but one only God, maker of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of earth: but here is the Trinitie called Lord or God, Word and Spirit. Neither is there any thing in the Articles of the Beleefe concerning the God-head and Man-hood of Chriſt, of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, birth, paſſion, croſſe and death, of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9365:40"/>
aſcenſion and judgement, but it is cleerely comprehended here in this Pſalme. The articles of the holy Church, of forgiving of ſinnes, reſurrection of the fleſh, and an everlaſting life, are contained in this Pſalme, and are treated upon yet more clearely, and with many mo words very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially in other Pſalmes of <hi>David.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">David <hi>was called Chriſts father.</hi> Matth. 9.27.</note> Therefore had he our holy faith, and knowledged the ſame, was ſaved therein, and of all holy men was called the Father of Chriſt with high commendation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the promiſe that was made unto him. Moreover, all the holy Prophets following, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto <hi>David,</hi> as to another <hi>Moſes,</hi> and tooke many things out of his writings. For there is ſcarce any other, that ſo clearely wrote of the cauſe of Chriſt as this Prophet <hi>David,</hi> and therefore hath he honour and praiſe aboue other in Iſrael: Of whom thou readeſt alſo, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 47.2. Such faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God through Ieſus Chriſt, had <hi>David</hi> out of the holy Ghoſt, and out of the doctrine of his Prophets <hi>Samuel, Nathan</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> and of other his Prieſts, which alſo had the ſame of God, and of the holy Fathers, ſpecially of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And no doubt, hee deſired the honour of God and of his Sonne, not to keepe it only himſelfe, but alſo much rather to require it of all his people. Wherefore no doubt he ſet up and furthered this his faith and religion among all his men of warre, kinsfolke in all his court, dominion, before the whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and all his kingdome: ſo diligently, earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fervently, that afterward certaine hundred yeeres, they which beleeved right and lived well,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9365:40"/>
were praiſed for walking in the waies of <hi>David</hi> their Father. They alſo that did evill, &amp; ſet not forth the true faith, of them is it written:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The waies of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</note> they walked not in the waies of <hi>David</hi> their Father. Of this haſt thou many examples in the bookes of the Kings, and in the Chronicles. Many things alſo were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given the Kings and all the people of <hi>Iuda,</hi> for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> ſake, that is, for the promiſe ſake made unto <hi>David,</hi> even for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, whom <hi>Ezechiel</hi> calleth <hi>David.</hi> In the firſt booke of the Kings,<note place="margin">1 Kings 15.3, 4, 5. <hi>King</hi> Abia.</note> the fifteenth chapter, it is written thus: <hi>The heart of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia was not right toward his Lord God, as was the heart of David his father. And for Davids ſake did the Lord give him a light at Hieruſalem, ſo that at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem he ſet up his ſonne, and preſerved him. For David did that, that was right in the fight of the Lord, and all the daies of his life did not he ſhrinke from any thing that he commanded him, except in the matter of Vrias the Hethite.</hi> Thus readeſt thou alſo of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi> 2 Reg. 18. <hi>Afore Ioſias was there no King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 18.5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>that was like him, which turned himſelfe ſo unto the Lord with all his heart, with all his ſoule, and with all his power, according to all the law of Moſes. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward came there none like him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the ſecond booke of the Chronicles,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 34.1, 2, 3.</note> the 34. chapter, ſtandeth the declaration of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid place after this manner: <hi>Ioſias reigned at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem one and thirtie yeeres, and did that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord, and walked in the waies of his Father Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left. For in the eighth yeere of his reigne while he was yet but young (even ſixteene yeeres old) hee began to

ſeeke the God of his Father David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much be ſpoken concerning this, that Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael and all the vertuous Kings of Iuda truſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and not to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Who ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth the number of the yeeres,<note place="margin">1 Kings 6.1.</note> he findeth 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 6. even 480. yeeres, from the departing out of Aegypt untill the fourth yeere of the reigne of <hi>Salomon.</hi> And from that time untill the captivitie of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, are reckoned 419. yeeres, or thereabouts.

               <p>SOmewhat yet will we now declare further, concerning the times of the Kings of Iuda and Iſrael, which in a manner were even as the times of the Iudges of Iſrael. For like as in the firſt yeeres of <hi>Ioſue,</hi> God gave great victorie and honour, and afterward reſt and peace: Even ſo were the Iſraelites very victorious and triumphant under <hi>David,</hi> and had great reſt and peace under <hi>Salomon.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The departing of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael from Iuda.</hi>
                  </note> But like as after the death of <hi>Ioſue</hi> the honour of Iſrael decreaſed, and the departing away from God followed with one perſecution upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other (though in the meane time they had peace and deliverers, as <hi>Othoniel, Ehud, Barack, Gedeon, Iephtha, Sampſon,</hi> &amp;c.) Even ſo did the worſhip of Iſrael decreaſe after <hi>Salomons</hi> time. For the ten
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:9365:41"/>
Tribes of Iſrael fell away from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> only <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Bejamin</hi> held <hi>Salomons</hi> ſonne <hi>Roboam</hi> for their King: the other made <hi>Hieroboam</hi> King. And ſo of one kingdome were made two, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iſrael, and the kingdome of Iuda. The kingdome of Iſrael (through the perſwaſion of <hi>Hieroboam</hi>) choſe them another manner of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God. Not that they utterly denied and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the God of their Fathers, but they ſerved him after a ſtrange heatheniſh manner of their owne imagining. But afterward they fell the longer the more and further into groſſe idolatrie, ſo long, till the Lord ſuffered them to be rooted out, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the King of the Aſſyrians, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad among all the Heathen. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and the Kings of Iuda were ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, howbeit they had ſome alſo which excelled the Kings of Iſrael and of the Heathen in ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. For they likewiſe went forth ſo long in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, till <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> the King rooted them out, and caried them away unto Babylon. But afore, we ſee that there was a wonderfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in the civill policie, and in the religion. Sometime was all righteouſneſſe and true religion oppreſt, and violence and idolatrie uſed. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time gat righteouſneſſe up againe, and the right true faith had the victorie, all unright and idolatrie being put downe. This came to paſſe alſo in Iſrael under <hi>Helias</hi> and King <hi>Iehu.</hi>

                     <hi>King</hi> Iehu.</note> Yet was the idolatrie and wrong rather puniſhed, than any amendment following. Like as it came alſo to paſſe after the birth of Chriſt, that there were vertuous Kings and

               <p>HItherto have I ſet forth the time of the promiſes, in the which God (through the promiſed ſeed our Lord Ieſus Chriſt) comforted, cleanſed, and preſerved all his ſervants and deare friends.

This holy faith alſo had all righteous, and ſuch as were of godly underſtanding in all the congregations of Iſrael from the beginning:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>All Gods elect were ſaved by Chriſt.</hi>
                  </note> In this were ſaved all they that from the beginning were preſerved and ordained to ſalvation: wherefore, whatſoever they can alleage againſt this faith (whether it be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning holy men, old age, multitudes, learned men, generall Councels, Convocations of Parliaments, Fathers, Acts, Statutes, tokens and wonders:) it is all nothing worth, and is not to be reputed in compariſon of our holy faith, as every one that hath underſtanding may ſee in this Treatiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And though my purpoſe be now finiſhed, even declared out of the Scripture, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith hath endured ſince the beginning of the world, yet will I adde a ſhort inſtruction concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the time of grace, and performing of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and I will declare, that God now alſo through the appearing of his Sonne, would bring into the world and ſet forth none other religion, none other faith, neither any other ſalvation, than even the ſame which was ſhewed to the old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: ſaving that now all things are more evident, more clearely practiſed, accompliſhed, fulfilled and performed: for the which cauſe alſo all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,

And thus alſo at the beginning did the holy Apoſtles preach Chriſt unto the Iewes, out of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as it is oftentimes mentioned in the Acts of the Apoſtles. And our Lord himſelfe, when hee went with the two Diſciples toward Emaus,<note place="margin">Luke 24.13.</note> and preached ſo unto them, that their hearts burnt within them, he began at <hi>Moſes,</hi> and went thorow all the Prophets, and opened unto them the old Scriptures, and ſhewed them, that ſo it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to enter into his glory.

caſteth downe, powreth out every thing that is to bee ſold in the Temple: he driveth the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſellers out of the Temple with a whip.

For water cleanſeth, in the bloud is the life of man. And with the bloud of Chriſt is all bloud ſtanched, and now is Chriſts bloud only available, being ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led through faith in our hearts.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The time of Chriſts Paſſion.</hi>
                  </note> This oblation and paſſion of Chriſt (the ranſome for the ſinne of the whole world) was done in the 18. yeere of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> reckoning from the beginning of the world 4007. yeeres, the 25. day of March.</p>
               <p>So the whole bodie of Ieſus was taken downe from the croſſe, and honourably buried,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The buriall of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </note> and on the third day after hee roſe up againe: ſo that his ſoule came againe to the bodie, and his verie fleſh was raiſed up from death, howbeit now no more mortall and paſſible, but glorified. For hee is the firſt in the reſurrection of the dead. For like as by one man came death, ſo by one man muſt come the reſurrect on of the dead. And like as in <hi>Adam</hi> wee all died in bodie and ſoule, ſo ſhall wee be all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſtored againe to life in Chriſt Ieſus. This hope unto life, would the Lord print ſubſtantially in us with the reſurrection. And therefore after his reſurrection, hee continued fortie dayes with his Diſciples, that hee might well inſtruct them of his reſurrection, and that they ſhould haue no doubt therein. So when he had ſhewed and declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them his verie reſurrection divers wayes, and had performed al that the Father commanded him
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9365:53"/>
to finiſh, hee aſcended up unto heaven with bodie and ſoule from mount Olivet in the ſight of his Diſciples, and is ſet at the right hand of God, there to remaine corporally untill the laſt day, in the which hee ſhall come againe bodily, to judge the quicke and dead: And all ſuch as have walked in faith, ſhall he take to him with bodie and ſoule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, like as hee himſelfe is received into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And ſhall with bodie and ſoule condemne all them, that have walked in the way of the old ſerpent, and have no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them afore. For the Holy Ghoſt did not endue them with a new doctrine, but it that the Lord had taught them out of the Law and the Prophets, the ſame did hee bring to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and illucidate all things, and printed them more clearly in their hearts. For ſo ſaith the Lord in the Goſpell:<note place="margin">Iohn 14.26.</note> 
                  <hi>The Comforter, even the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that I have ſaid unto you.</hi> Therefore ſo long as the Lord was with them, and told them all the matter of his paſſion, they were ſorrie, and could not beare away all that he ſaid unto them. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he was taken up from the earth into heaven, he ſent the Holy Ghoſt, even him, whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets alſo had before, and that led them into all Chriſtian veritie.</p>
               <p>So when they were endued with the Holy Ghoſt, they began (according to the Lords commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to preach in all the world the foreſaid matter of ſalvation purchaſed and obtained onely by Chriſt, and gotten by true faith. For hee had ſaid; <hi>Goe your way into all the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marke 16.15.</note> 
                  <hi>and preach the Goſpell unto all creatures, Whoſo beleeveth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. And therewith comprehendeth he both the points, which the Apoſtles uſed and practiſed, even the preaching of the faith in Ieſus Chriſt, and of the miniſtration of the Sacraments. And how the Apoſtles doctrine was, it is manifeſt out of the Acts of the Apoſtles. But ſhortly and in a ſumme, they preached amendment of life, and remiſſion of ſinnes through Ieſus Chriſt: That is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:9365:54"/>
to ſay, how that the whole generation of man lay in the dominion of the Devill, and in the bonds of ſinne, curſed, and damned: but God had mercie on us all, and ſent his Sonne into this world to die, and with his death to reſtore us unto life, and to waſh us with his bloud, that whoſoever beleeveth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternall life. All this declared they out of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and proved, that Ieſus Chriſt whom they preached, is the bleſſed ſeed promiſed unto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Whoſo is deſirous to have a perfect exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this declaration, he findeth two Sermons of the famous Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> the one in the Acts of the Apoſtles, the ſecond chapter, verſ. 14. the other in the 13. chapter, verſ. 16. There doth the holy Apoſtle open the myſterie of our holy faith, verie excellently, declaring it from the time of <hi>Abraham</hi> unto <hi>David,</hi> and from him unto <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt. Thereupon ſheweth he, how Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, died, was buried, and roſe againe from death. All this confirmeth hee with the Scriptures of the Prophets. At the laſt he concludeth the Sermon after this manner; <hi>Be it knowne unto you therefore,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 13.38.</note> 
                  <hi>ye men and brethren, that through Ieſus is preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to you forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and that by him all they that beleeve, are juſtified from all things, from the which yee could not bee juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> To this agreeth now alſo the ſermon of <hi>Peter:</hi> Yea, all the Scriptures of the Apoſtles doe finally accord to the ſame effect: Hereout alſo bring they the doctrine of repentance and amendment of life, the rebuking of ſinne, conſolations, exhortations,
