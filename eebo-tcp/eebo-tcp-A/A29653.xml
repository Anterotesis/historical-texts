            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath pleaſed God in theſe latter dayes (whether in mercy, to Confirm the good; or judgement to harden the wicked) to draw us down ſo low and neer the very dregs and lees of impiety; that for ought I obſerve, thoſe men think themſelves, moſt merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and politick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who (far from the bluſhes of a modeſt brow) can with greateſt impudencie and daringneſſe defame, traduce and ſcandalize all ſuch, who either out of Conſcience towards God, as Chriſtians, or the ſcene of honour as Engliſhmen, cannot commit thoſe their iniquities with greedineſſe, or at laſt connive or joyn with them in thoſe villanies and falſe actions: which being but once ſhined on by a true light, would grow abominable not onely to Chriſtians, but meaner tempers: who acting but little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the beaſt, barely preſerve humane ſociety.</p>
            <p>Were not this an approved truth, men would take heed how they call'd good evil, and evil good, how they ſharpned their tongues like raſors, and with envenom'd quils, dart at thoſe, who dare queſtion or diſcover their wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102278:3"/>This as to mine own particular, appears largely by a late ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous libel, the conception and iſſue whereof beſpeaks the Fathers, both dictator and ſcribe to be men of a beggarly and needy inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of little breeding or judgement, language or honeſty, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would not, (under that common cheate and cover to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous perſons) like the Panther, cover their heads, and conceal their names while they ſeek to ſwallow up their neighbours quick, and eat and devour the reputes of thoſe who in the end wil be found to deſerve better then themſelves.</p>
            <p>When I firſt read my name therein, and obſerv'd it but the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and falſe product of ſome ſpurious fancie, I eſteem'd contempt thereof the moſt ſuitable revenge, but when the judgement of ſome friends above anſwer'd, that ſome thing in point of honour ought to bee oppoſed, I ſubmitted, and was willing to rip up that thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare-peece, which indeed is fitter for the kennell, then a modeſt pen conteining as many falſhoods as lines.</p>
            <p>And to begin with the firſt, it enters the ſtage with an apparant deceit, as if Collonel <hi>Maſſey</hi> were the firſt, who began theſe pranks in the Forreſt of <hi>Deane,</hi> and to that purpoſe inſinuates, that Coll. <hi>Kyrle</hi> and Captain <hi>Phillips,</hi> about a year ſince, bought that Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine which neither <hi>Maſſey</hi> nor his aſſignes, could or would make good, with the Committee of Revenue, and how Captaine <hi>Pury</hi> to hedge in a marriage portion, bought that again by retaile. But whether ſome perſons to fetch in deſperate portions, might drive on deſperate deſignes, ſure I am tis notoriouſly known, that ſix yeares ſince, long before Colonell <hi>Maſſey</hi> enter'd upon that buſines, both Collonel <hi>Kyrle</hi> and Captain <hi>Brayne,</hi> cut down great ſums of wood, engroſt great ſtore of iron, and for that end truckt with thoſe who had to doe with neither, (not the Committee of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue but) ſome Committee men of <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> And whereas tis ſaid Collonel <hi>Kyrle</hi> let out two iron works, I would likewiſe know, how he came by them? and if they put a <hi>queritur,</hi> what offence it was for Captain <hi>Pury</hi> to ſecure himſelf, by ſuch colluſive bargains there may be another <hi>queritur,</hi> by what power the one could let, or the other take, what was raviſh't &amp; ſtill kept by force and fraud from the right owners. Yet the libeller takes the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to ſay, that the iron workes were enjoyed quietly without the leaſt exception, three or four yeeres together if any thing of this be true what was the reaſon in the beginning they were ſo carefull, to nominate ſuch Commiſſioners, as knew nothing of their jugglings,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102278:3"/>
or ſcarce what belonged to the Forreſt, and was not Captain <hi>Pury,</hi> a very fit Commiſſioner, to ſit and ſell the wood, who muſt have a ſhare of the profit? They knew full well, if they had ſuffer'd ſome other men to be nominated, they did and would have oppoſed it from the beginning, as well as the whole Country Complained thereof.</p>
            <p>But it is ſtrictly objected, <hi>pag.</hi> 2 &amp; 3. That Maſter <hi>Pury</hi> could be none of thoſe deſtructive offenders, for wonderfull weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Becauſe the profit of good and bad timber, or wood, is alike to him, and it being referr'd to Captain <hi>Philips</hi> he could be but a paſſive offendor; that he gave order to the woodcutters, in publick, not to Cut downe the good trees; that he good man was at Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and therefore could know nothing, and very much ſtuffe to this tune. Whereas 'tis replyed, there is much difference betwixt ſound and ſmooth timber, and knotty and decayed wood, both in the Coarding wages, and the Coal that proceeds thereof; Beſides it being the cuſtome of the iron Maſters (to whom the former Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were not ſervants, but ſlaves) to have particular aſſignations for their ſeverall Felletts, can any man beleeve Maſter <hi>Pury</hi> ſhould ſend up and down the Forreſt for decayd trees, when once his allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made amongſt good Timber? will any man of reaſon be convinced, that his zeal of preſerving could be ſo ſerious being at his own liberty, when afterwards, notwithſtanding orders of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraynt, he Commanded 400. trees to be deſtroyed, not onely in a neglecting, but a Contemptuous manner? A very ill example to others who were not Parliament men aſwell as himſelfe. But for his referrence of the mannagery of the wood to Captain <hi>Philips,</hi> 'tis all one as if the Grand Signior did refer a buſines to one of his Mutes after his pleaſure were once known.</p>
            <p>Tis a cheap and eaſie way of requitall, when a man hath ſtoln a gooſe to ſtick down a feather, and when Maſter <hi>Pury</hi> hath been not only aſſenting to, but active in the ſpoile of ſo brave a Forreſt, to give afterward a chill and flegmatick charge, that no trees ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth be cut down, but what the preſervators allotted, is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſatisfaction to the ſtate, and if they pleaſe to be paid with ſuch Copper-Coyne, I will undertake they ſhall have chap-men by the dozens, the true Engliſh of that charge being no more but this, that he left command to (the Yeoman of his guard) the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Forreſt, they ſhould take eſpeciall heed, that onely the well grown and goodly Oaks and Beeches ſhould be hewn down
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102278:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the future preſervation thereof; It being now grown a ſtale pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, of five years ſtanding let us cut down the beſt firſt, and the reſt will follow, which is ſo well obſerved, that thoſe men who knew the goodly plot of timber in 88, and conſider it now, and doth but caſt up the ſpoiles done within theſe ſix years, will almoſt joyn with the uſuall and bold aſſertion made by the iron Maſters, when they Come for contracts, that the Committee need not now ſtand ſo nice upon termes of preſervation, for that there is ſcarce a tree left fit for ſhipping in the whole Forreſt.</p>
            <p>For his being above at Parliament, I do aver it, that its happy God hath ſent us other manner of members, who take Care of this Nation; For while a perſon of that ſociety ſhould indeed be above, and carefully aſſiſtant in the preſervation of his Countrey his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and their juſt intereſts, to be then terrifying and tampering, to be skaring and affrighting almoſt all ſorts and ſizes, who will not comply with the ſordid gaines and reaches of wicked men, is a thing which makes the poor people, even faint, and beleeve that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which they have choſen are but like the bramble in a ſtorm, to which while the poor ſheep flies for ſuccour, he doth but loſe his wooll. Though the more knowing ſort, are not yet grown ſuch wofull zanies, or of ſo implicite a faith, but they beleeve Maſter <hi>Pury</hi> might have ſhewn more of his duty at <hi>London,</hi> then in that Forreſt. And as I am perſwaded the Parliament never obliged the hearts of Engliſhmen more in theſe parts, then by thoſe excellent and ſeaſonable Votes of <hi>Januar.</hi> 1. Laſt paſt, and afterwards mannaged with ſo much prudence and Care by the Councell of State, ſo they never ſuffer'd a greater alienation and diſtaſte in the hearts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of well minded people, then by the Colluſive and mean juglings of ſome perſons in the bargains of the Forreſt. And much more is brought to light and diſcovered in this buſines then the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themſelves Concern'd do think or imagine.</p>
            <p>But to go along with this libell, we muſt for their methods fake, chop it into their own Sections. And in the firſt place it is by all meanes deſired to conſider the perſons proſecuted, that is to ſay like to be diſcovered, and there are 1. Collonel <hi>Kyrle,</hi> who ſayes the libeller was in arms for the Parliament, and I ſay he was in armes for the King, wherein we are neither of us lyars. But the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament owes him and his foure Brothers 3000. pound (I hope Col. <hi>Kyrle</hi> doth not cut down the Forreſt becauſe the Houſe owes other men mony) But pray lets ſee the Bill of Debt, and if it ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102278:4"/>
be made appear that this noble Collonell owes the State ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, I hope ſome eminency of merit, or great disburſments of mony muſt be produced, elſe how will he cut skoares for the other three? That his brother receiv'd a wound at a Battail with Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> in the North may be true, yet poſſibly it may be as true that himſelf might give it him, aſwell as lately he beſtowed the like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour upon Collonel <hi>Cromwells</hi> quarter-maſter, as a pledge of his good affection to the Parliament. That buſines with a few other pretty ſmall tranſgreſſions, deſerves the armies conſideration, that they may know what a truſty and divine champion they are like to have, if ever a juſt occaſion ſhould be given. But what conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he deſerves, for one of his Brothers vouchſafing to ride in the Life-Guard, or becauſe his Father died of a Feaver in <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> I leave to better judgements, as I doe the man and his merits to God, but am affraid to write thoſe abominations which he hath with confidence acted upon the houſe-top, and in the ſight of the people.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe for Captaine <hi>Griffantius Phillips</hi> (by the way that's a cruell hard name and ſcarce given by his Britiſh God-fathers) I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of his impriſonment in <hi>Oxford</hi> till now, but do know that that gentleman very well deſerves it in <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> If Col. <hi>Walton</hi> was in the firſt place a teſtimony of the one, the reſt of the members of the houſe may happily think it fit to adjudge him to the other: if this Welſh <hi>Don-Quixott</hi> were the pen-man of this libell (as by the excellency of the ſtyle and ſtrength of the Syllogiſmes is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined) he cryes out much of his body being once taken in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let him take heed; if he be once diſſected to the Parliament, in his true colours it may be deliver'd to execution once more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a reprival, I dare ſay did his honeſt Mother, the good Ale-wife, know how her Son (deſcended of ſo lofty and great a progeny) doth diſcommend drunkards ſhe would give him but ſlender en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, at her pallace at <hi>Mercatt O Waene.</hi> And however he be now pleaſed to throw ſuch indignities in my face, undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly; yet within theſe few yeares, I thought my ſelf in a condition, fit to have receiv'd better language from him. Neither would this nimble ſquire have offer'd it, when he was humbly pleas'd to foot it, in his Iriſh ſtockings and Battoone in <hi>Querpo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will, I take it, be eaſily admitted, that this man hath, like a Muſhrom, ſuddainly ſprunge up by his pretences of publique ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, yet if it ſhould be proved, that (had it not been for the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102278:5"/>
Generals army in his way) he would have run into <hi>Pembrok</hi> to his deare Countryman Monſieur <hi>Poyer,</hi> the Parliament cannot but thinke him trayterous and ingratefull. Though it be no news, when ſuch gallants, get on horſe-back, for an ordinary man (without witchcraft) to tell you whether they will ride; By that time he hath anſwer'd the State for his feates in the Forreſt, and ſome other very fine pranks, as ordinary a perſon may hold his ſtirrup.</p>
            <p>No deſire or deſert of mine could produce that ill opinion of Maſter <hi>Pury</hi> which his late actions hath wrought againſt him, my apprehenſions of his ingenuity exceeding my judgement of his ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice. Neither when I was uſually told of his abuſes behind my back, was I ſo much moved at him, as when I obſerved him deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd up to that fatall paſſion, I thought my ſelf concerned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him. What his ſervices have been, let thoſe who know them cry them up, I confeſſe I live ſo far off, being near a bow-Shot, that I have not heard of them. Sure I am; he hath been extraordinarily well paid for his long marches, and hard labours. But of his ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and dangerous adventures, his continuall hot and cloſe fights and skirmiſhes, I hope there are ſome who live in and about the Deanery can give a readier account. As for us, who are more remote, we dare confidently beleeve and ſay, there is not a perſon of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculine gender, will ever riſe up in judgement for the bloodſhed of that pretty manſlayer.</p>
            <p>T'was very ill done, I muſt acknowledge, of the Commander in cheife, to deſtine him to ſo many and deſperate on-flattes, yet, being at leaſt for two years together preſerv'd from harm, as the writer confeſſeth, by the Lord of Hoſtes, it argued a great want of faith and remembrance of former deliverances, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, at the ſight of the enemy, he made ſuch unreaſonable haſte, and in ſo much diſtemper. But what is this to the caſe of theſe 3. Gentlemen the libeller ſaith, the Iron-works were ſet up by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament; I ſay no, they were ſet up too long before, and repair'd by authority of their own, But muſt to the joy of all men, be pull'd down by authority of Parliament; and for ſelling of wood at reaſonable rates we know the meaning of that; the tricke is not forgotten, nor the meanes by whom t'was procured. That command hath been well obeyed, otherwiſe they could not brag they could, and had bought as much wood for a groate a cord, as they pleas'd, and others that they might ſell cheaper their iron then others, for that their wood coſt them little or nothing. Heere went the Hare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102278:5"/>
and from theſe perſons tis not hard to finde what is become of the Forreſt; yet for ſuch people to make it ſuch a haynous buſines for one of them to be impriſn'd, when he deſerv'd ſomething elſe, and the other for his lands to be queſtion'd, when it ought to be extended by the law, is ſo fooliſh an apology, that it deſerves, nothing but contempt from wiſe or honeſt men.</p>
            <p>Now to winde up the firſt part of the libell, into one Bottome, we muſt once more conſider, the good affection, ſervices, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of theſe 3. Gentlemen, (certainly Maſter <hi>Phllipps</hi> is one upon the welſh account) how they have adventur'd their lives (one or two of them may do it once more) their great eſtates, and which is more then all their families and fortunes too beſides, what the Parliament truly owes them.</p>
            <p>Me thinks tis a ſhame, to read this effrontery, look upon theſe men, but 5. yeares ſince, in their full equipage and furniture, take away theſe deſtructive gaines of the Forreſt from ſome, the large conceſſions, bleſſings, and donatives of the Parliament from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what the hazards of their families, fortunes, and eſtates were, may be caſt up without great inſight in Arithmetick. And for ſuch men to prate what the Parliament owes them, when they owe all they have and more to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is ſo bold an impudence, that it deſerves a ſharp inquiſition and a ſharper puniſhment, and what the demerits of ſome of them are, may ſhortly and ſooner be made known to the world, then they do imagine.</p>
            <p>But leaving a little, the tragicall part of their high atchievements and ſufferings for them, their great loſſes and croſſes, let us look to the Comicall progreſſe of the libell, and obſerve, with what kindneſſe it viſits the Commiſſioners of enquiry, who are ſaid by a Commiſſion <hi>ex parte,</hi> to be in the generall but meere proſecutors, of thoſe juſt, quiet, and harmleſſe people, in compariſon of whom, we are made in our perſons and conditions as the vileſt and moſt mean creatures, a pack of miſcheivous and partiall wicked people, that ſeek only our own ends, and what not? Yet a little before I go to the perſons. I would ask what they mean by a commiſſion <hi>ex parte</hi>? is it lawfull for a theif, when he is arraigned, to accuſe the juſtice of the judge and jury, becauſe he likewiſe hath not a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to examine negative witneſſes on his ſide? our Commiſſion was to inquire what ſpoiles were committed in the Forreſt, and not what was not committed, ſeverall witneſſes come and depoſe, that Maſter <hi>Kyrle</hi> and <hi>Philips</hi> cut down above ten thouſand timber
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102278:6"/>
trees; and were it uſuall or handſome for them, to have commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to examine that they cut down none? Did the kings former commiſſions run in this ſort, or what non-ſenſe is it this fooliſh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller drives at? If we enforced or skrew'd out what was not true, let ſeveral depoſitions be read to the ſame thing, or elſe at leaſt let the intereſts be diſcover'd we did drive at. But if for our acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to duty, to truſt, to our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience &amp; country, we ſhalbe ſtiled pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, if by lyes and reproaches we ſhall be ſcandaliz'd, and by underhand threats and combinations be overawed and menaced, to be no leſſe forſooth then totally ruin'd, if we muſt be told by ſome of our friends, we muſt give off in time, to ſearch the groſſe injuries done to the ſtate, though commanded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or leſſe we ſhall be undone; That tis not our integrity or innocency ſhall be our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, but the meere power of our opponents in this buſineſſe of the Forreſt, that ſhall deſtroy us if the Commiſſion under the great ſeal, and Commiſſioners ſhall be bafled and comemned, ſo far that they were like to have fallen into force, and that by a member of the houſe ſtyling it in the face of the Country a hedge Commiſſion. I would fayne know what perſon of honour or fortune will engage in the Commands of State? or will not their authority by degrees grow cold and neglected, and ſo their affairs grow waſte and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late? certainly theſe things being well conſider'd, the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeemes to be very ſmall.</p>
            <p>And now to the perſons of the Commiſſioners, to theſe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller ſayes, Maſter <hi>Bromwich</hi> and Maſter <hi>Borrow</hi> (nominall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels) with ſome Citizens of <hi>Briſtol</hi> (good men and true I hope) are the proſecutors, and procured (as may forſooth be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only) themſelves to be Commiſſioners (the airy figment of the libeller) to their own great coſts and charges and to be believed by none but ſuch a pragmatick fellow as the ſcribler, and ſo fully and ſubſtantially anſwered by that honeſt Gentleman Captain <hi>Biſhop,</hi> my fellow labourer and Commiſſioner, that I hate to trouble my pen with ſo improbable a vanity. Only let me ſay this for my own part (and I really beleeve the reſt may ſay as much)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that as I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw the faces of many of the Commiſſioners before they met, So I knew no more of my name being uſed, till caſually I heard thereof, then I did that the libeller was a very honeſt and a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Gentleman to the Common-wealth!</p>
            <p>But why nominall Collonels I pray? Neither of them but had their Commiſſions long before Maſter <hi>Kyrle</hi> turn'd to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102278:6"/>
and ſome of their friends ſtick not to ſay, they kept to their truſt, and ever hated diſhonorable plundring, robbing, ſtealing, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away other mens eſtates by horrid force and violence, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver murder'd any of the poor Parliament Souldiers in cold blood; are theſe Gentle-men, ſo quoted for preſidents, free from theſe, 'twere well for them if they were.</p>
            <p>For Collonel <hi>Berrow,</hi> 'tis well known he had a Command in his Country, and had for Officers and Souldiers, (one officer or two in Maſter <hi>Kyrles</hi> regiment excepted) another manner of regiment then he had. For my own part, after I had entertained Officers in <hi>London,</hi> I might eaſily have rayſed my regiment in the Country, and was deſired by Coll. <hi>Maſſey,</hi> but it pleaſed God the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome weather beginning to break, up I ſaw it needleſſe. And I can without vanity ſay, I was never fond (as ſome men are &amp; have bin) by my own advance to put my Countrey to an unneceſſary expece.</p>
            <p>Touching my debauch't behaviour toward the Lord Generall, I wiſh my heart towards that Lord, were written in my forehead, but leſt I ſhould be thought, to flatter a perſon, whoſe power and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſo far above me, (which I deteſt) I will take the liberty onely to ſay this; my education and birth I hope will render me ſo much a civiliz'd man, and above that we call ingratefull, as to give the Generall his due, whom upon ſeverall applications and addreſſes, I found regardfull to me and my buſineſſe beyond my deſert or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; and for the Election at <hi>Cyrenceſter,</hi> I appeale to my Lord Generall himſelf, what my humble intreaties and ſeverall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to him have been in that buſines; In ſhort I do heer openly defie that man, Souldier or elſe, who upon a good ground, ſhould dare act more for him, or in defence of his repute &amp; known worth then my ſelf; whom I profeſſe I have ever honoured:</p>
            <p>For my oppoſition of Coll. <hi>Rich,</hi> he being a meer ſtranger to the relations and ſeverall intereſts of this Country, I underſtand not what law, reaſon, or Parliamentary practice could or may condemn me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But tis very well known, the fanſie and knack of that Election, proceeded out of the ſame ſhop as the Election of <hi>Glouceſter</hi>; if Collonel <hi>Rich</hi> ſits in the houſe duly return'd and duly choſen, I am ſatisfied I wiſh in this buſines of the Forreſt he may ſhew himſelf as forward and faithfull as the other members, that the Country may take Some Comfort in his ſitting there. But for any proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me at the Committee of Elections, that ever I heard, or was guilty of, or call'd to anſwer, I ſay tis a notorious lye, aſwell as that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102278:7"/>
of Coll. <hi>Birch,</hi> and ſticks in the throat of him, that ſpake it, and him that writ it; and for the abuſe I ſuffer'd from <hi>Birch,</hi> I queſtion not but in due time, and in another opportunity to have reparation from him. What this libeller meanes by the Committee of <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> I know not, but this I muſt ſay of thoſe Gentle-men of that Committee, with whom I was an unworthy aſſociate, that, as I was a ſtranger to them, ſo I never receiv'd more regards from any, and in all their actings they were the only people ever I ſate with, that carried their buſineſs with authority, honour, and juſtice, and with whom as I have ſhared in ſome difficulties, So I never receiv'd any Command from them, which I did not undergo, I thank God, with readineſſe &amp; cheerfull ſubmiſſion, if any conteſt appear'd in a tranſitory point of judgement, it was meerely temporary and no way, as to me, diſobliging, and of ſo little conſequence, that I ſhall love and honour them while I am able to regard my ſelf.</p>
            <p>If he meanes the City of <hi>Coventry,</hi> truly for 3. years and above al my eſtate and meanes of ſubſiſtance, was ſeized on and kept from me by the Kings party, and for all that time, they let me want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And I do acknowledge I was conſtrain'd to borrow even my bread; drink, and cloathing from them, which they freely lent me in as free a meaſure, as if I had poſſeſſed ten times my eſtate neither did my ſelf or family want any thing in that City, and I hope I did honeſtly requite it, and as a token of gratitude, I ſhall be very forward, to do any reſpect or ſervice for thoſe people, and am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident ſhall be lovingly treated, where this ſcandalous libeller muſt not ſhew his face.</p>
            <p>That I protect Papiſts, delinquents, and ſcandalous Miniſters, (titles which they put upon moſt ſufficient men, who will not bring their tooles to the Philiſtines Grindſtone) is a deluſive falſhood; how can I protect where any three will condemne? Neither did I to my knowledge ever do that thing in a Committee for any by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects but for juſtice, and this I dare make good with my life or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and if ſome of thoſe will do ſo tis ſomething beyond expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But ſhall every member of the houſe that ſayes No be term'd a protector of delinquents. I have indeed many times put a check and ſtop to the impetuous and beaſtly rage of avaritious men, when by the plottings of Cabinet and diſhonorable jugglers I have obſerved, the ruin and deſolation of families intended, who never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd it, and this meerly to ſatisfie the rapinous and devouring eye of ſome men, who by the laws and acts of this very Parliament have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102278:7"/>
deſerv'd the juſtice, rather then the countenance or compliance of a Committee. And when I have ſatisfied my conſcience towards God, and my truſt to the ſtate (which hath commanded me to do no wrong) I valew not a ruſh what this ſcurrilous fellow, or the proudeſt of his abettors can ſay againſt me. Tis known what my ſufferings have been both in my purſe at <hi>Coventry</hi> (where Maſter <hi>Knightly,</hi> Maſter <hi>Pim</hi> and my ſelf loſt at and immediatly after the ſiege of <hi>Coventry</hi> above 7000. pounds) and my eſtate in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey for almoſt foure years which was wholly loſt to an inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſum: I will not ſpeak of arreares and moneys lent (when God knows then how ill I could ſpare them) though I might and muſt with far more juſtice, and truth, then the others named in the libel. Yet I never clamoured the Houſe as moſt men do, who lie curſing and banning, to puzzle the Houſe and buſineſſe of the Kingdome; I have waited with patience and will, till a conveniencie, and a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate opportunity ſhew themſelves. If my ſelf or ſufferings may be thought worthy of any regard, I ſhall be thankfull, and deſire to be uſefull, if not I will ſit down with a manly patience, and relie on that God which hitherto hath been mercyfull to me, and hath not utterly forſaken me, and hope to be preſerved from that rancor and diſcontent, which have thrown imprudent and hair-brain'd men upon contrary violencies. That this committee ever refuſed to act with me, is a falſhood of that nature, that I perceive the libeller cares not what he writes, how many times have I been ſent to both of late and heretofore, is well known, and the thing is ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that when the libeller ſhall come to <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and be known, the ſtones and timber of the houſes will declare what he is; &amp; for any drunken behaviour, I can ſay, as my conſtitution, ſo my judgment abominats that unmanly ſin, and there is much difference betwixt civil converſe &amp; ſociety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the meaneſs of that condition; I live here open to the cenſure and view of this city, both Souldiers and others, and I beleeve children will rectifie the libeller and his falſhoods. If ſome of thoſe the ſcribler voucheth as patterns of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be as free, let the example left in <hi>Glouceſter, Bathe, Briſtol, London, Hereford, Mounmouth, Roſſe</hi> be judges, and then 'twill be ſeen, who is, or hath been guilty of that fault they would ſo fain pin upon the ſhoulders of honeſter men.</p>
            <p>I do a little wonder at the libeller, when I obſerve whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, how he dares venture upon the irreligion, ſcandall, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection of Collonel <hi>Berrow,</hi> that gentleman is able to anſwer for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102278:8"/>
himſelf, and I queſtion not but he will and to the purpoſe, but this I will ſay, take only one out of the three forenamed perſons, and for the other two, there are thoſe beſides my ſelf, who will go neare to prove it, that if all the evil and wickednes in <hi>Europe</hi> were contracted into <hi>England,</hi> and all the impiety in <hi>England</hi> concenter'd into one place, it would be found ſeminally in intention, or fruitfully in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in thoſe two men; for he that ſhall read that bed role of their continued and multiplied exorbitances, and converſe with the ſtory of their lives, will find the vvickedneſſe of their heart and practice, and the principles by vvhich both are managed, to be as dangerous and inveſtigable as the head of <hi>Nilus,</hi> vvhich River by the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd conflux, and multitude of thirſty <hi>Animals</hi> ſhaped in ſuch a diverſity of formes and qualities, it is no mervell, if every year it becomes the fruitfull mother of ſtrange births and monſtrous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions. Tis nothing for thoſe men to ſtamp vices and make it currant by being theirs, to commit ſuch prodigious and exotick im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, that a man vvould hearken to them rather as paradoxes of iniquity, then the actions of men who bear Gods image about them; who carry with them, not only in their faces, but their day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practices ſuch terrour and ſlaviſh awe amongſt the poor people, as thinking them ſupported by ſome in Parliament (the laſt and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt refuge to timorous wretches) who ſeem'd to be ſold to a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlavery, that it is the uſuall word of Command, do this or that, let me have ſuch or ſuch a bargain at ſuch or ſuch rates, or take it perforce, and threaten the owners or refuſers with death, they ſay what need we care for the whyning of the women, ſo we may gain one hundred pound a week by the iron works.</p>
            <p>If theſe men were truly ſcann'd, and their high inſolencies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, <hi>Nero, Donitian, Caeſar Borgia,</hi> or <hi>Johannes Veſilowich</hi> will ſeem the Fathers of the Country. Theſe are they which make their miſerable neighbours like Spaniels lick their feet; and as Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and Camels kneele down to take up their burdens, at the beck of whoſe terrour they offer up their eſtates, as the poore Indians ſacrifice to the Devill not for love or Devotion, but for fear he ſhould hurt them. And yet theſe good ſouls with <hi>Solomons</hi> ſtrumpet, wipe their mouthes and ask what have they done? Whilſt like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull ſieves they let out and conceal the flower and goodneſſe of Gentlemen their neighbours, and retain nothing but the bran and skurffe to throw in their faces.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes his quarrell muſt end where he was affraid to begin,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102278:8"/>
with the Commiſſioners of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and is very angry that they wil not leave trading at Sea for iron, and run a more ſhort and leſſe hazardous voyage into the Forreſt or <hi>Can-Wood,</hi> (as I take it they might have made their Choyce) for their Merchandiſe. Maſter Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller, I muſt tell you, I have converſt with thoſe Gentlemen, and do finde that they do out-honeſt and out wit-you, Twas not the cleanly tempering of your Noune Relatives, could diſoblige them from their duty, or the ſearch of your knavery, They who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Princes of Chriſtendom, are not that ſort of Sea-fiſh to be Catch't in the net of ſuch a gull as you are; if it be an offence to you, to go to Sea for Iron, t'will appear a crime to others, to make it at home of Shipping Timber.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Gentlemen have done their duty upon my knowledge like diſcreet men, and impartiall, who by their ſedulity and faithfullnes have fixt ſuch a feather in your Cap, that where ever you come, you will carry it as a badge of a knave or a fool; One of them hath pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiz'd ſo far upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you with his pen, &amp; advanced ſo honeſtly &amp; ſtoutly upon your faults, that he will endanger to bring you and your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors to the ſtocks, and then we ſhall have ſome whipping chear. You belie them fearfully in their vaſt quantities of Iron, I have with ſome diligence inquir'd, and for ought I hear, all that any of the Commiſſioners have to ſpare you, is onely that they were by their ſides.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing all you have ſaid to be true, may you becauſe the Commiſſioners are faulty, cut down, deſtroy and ruine! O learned argument, certainly you have learnt the Mood and figures of your Logick no farther then <hi>Radner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the long tale of Sir <hi>John Winter,</hi> and thoſe who long ſince cut down trees in Avenhall, it was before the Parliament ſate, and they were fined 40. thouſand pound, and for what is cut down ſince, is chargeable onely upon thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this libell would defend, who have Committed ſuch notable ſpoil and devaſtation, as is not to be parralell'd in any age, let the offences and offenders be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd and brought to puniſhment, who by ſtudying their own grandure and profit, have diſhonour'd the Nation, cheated the State, and almoſt ruind the goodlieſt plot of ſhipping timber in the world, and what good or vertue can there be in riches or eſtate thus baſely gotten? for my own part, as I was courted, and indeed intended a ſhare till I diſcovered the falſhood and dammage, ſo I thank God, from the beginning I have ever oppoſed it, &amp; obſerved w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſome wiſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102278:9"/>
men, that thoſe who roaſted their meat by the Forreſt fire, were lightly choaked afterward with the bones.</p>
            <p>For it will be proved within the ſpace of 6. years they have cut that quantity of wood and timber, which Sir <hi>John Winter</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for at 120. thouſand pound, and pay'd 20. thouſand in earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and what account is given to the State muſt be ſought after in the vaine and laviſh expences of ſome immoderate iron Maſters. Commonly ill gotten greatnes, though men may roll it under their tounges as a ſweet morſell, yet it will turn to gall and bitterneſſe in the end, and while it pleaſeth the palat, it becommeth gravell and rotteneſſe in the belly.</p>
            <p>The Devils themſelves have Thrones, Principalities, and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as a gallant Patriot obſerved) but wanting true goodnes they muſt for ever want all true honour and happines. A falſe heart is abominable before God, and they who Crooke publike truſts to private and ſiniſter ends, are and ought to be abominable before juſt and good men. And ſeeing the Parliament hath ſo gratified the Country, in their juſt and ſenſible apprehenſions of their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I confeſſe I am hearty in the cauſe and juſtice of the Parliament (which my ſoul loves above all that is mortal:) And for advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof, I dare ſuffer as much as he deſerves who ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by force or fraud to oppoſe them in it.</p>
