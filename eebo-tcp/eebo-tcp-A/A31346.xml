            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <l>For Game at Nine-pins? No, it gain'd you time,</l>
                  <l>That ye might ſpring a ſecond Counter-mine.</l>
                  <l>Then down with Pins, and throw aſide the Bowl,</l>
                  <l>Let each Man fall to Plotting in his Soul</l>
                  <l>(If he have any) make it now appear</l>
                  <l>They are devoid of either Grace or Fear.</l>

                  <l>Three hundred thouſand murdered at leaſt</l>
                  <l>In <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh Feaſt.</hi>

                  <l>By Us their Church and State is ſo divided,</l>
                  <l>They quarrel yet: Nor can it be decided,</l>
                  <l>(Impatient we!) until <hi>Nolls Dunkirk</hi>'s ſold:</l>
                  <l>'Twas got by Rebels. But the <hi>Tangier</hi> Mould,</l>
                  <l>VVhen finiſhed, will all the Shipping hold.</l>
                  <l>Us'd all our Skill to break the <hi>Triple League,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Made <hi>James</hi> confeſs to <hi>Beddingfield</hi> and <hi>Teage.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>In that (by Hell) we ſhew'd our higheſt Art,</l>
                  <l>And ſtabb'd the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Int'reſt to the heart.</l>
                  <l>Imploy'd our Prieſts, who did the City burn,</l>

                  <l>Beat <hi>Butter Boxes</hi> when we could come at 'em,</l>
                  <l>Which led the way unto the Ships at <hi>Chattam,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Then all we did, was, bid <hi>the Devil rot 'em.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Conjoyn'd our <hi>Butchers</hi> with our Friend of <hi>France;</hi>

                  <l>What ere we do, as Beggar knows his Diſh.</l>
                  <l>Begun a War, then up a Peace did ſmother,</l>
                  <l>To break their Allies; then begin another.</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Frenchmen</hi> did the Shipping ſell,</l>
                  <l>As <hi>Heretick Marvel</hi> late the World did tell.</l>
                  <l>All this we did, and ten times ſo much more,</l>
                  <l>To ſerve our Ends, and Mother-Church [that Whore]</l>
                  <l>Before we to the preſent <hi>Trick</hi> did fall;</l>
                  <l>And had that took, w' had done the Devil and all:</l>
                  <l>And what that is, your Holineſs can gueſs,</l>
                  <l>For wee'l be damn'd ere any on 't confeſs.</l>
                  <l>Nor does it matter whether we do or not,</l>
                  <l>Since <hi>Heretick Commons</hi> have ſo much on't got,</l>
                  <l>By him whoſe Name, and <hi>Oaten Pipe,</hi> doth fret</l>
                  <l>Our very Guts, as on the Tenters ſet,</l>
                  <l>We curſe our Stars he is not ruin'd yet.</l>
                  <l>But there's ſome hopes, by what we hear of late,</l>
                  <l>Whoſe Lives he ſav'd, requite him with their hate.</l>
                  <l>A good Reward! But had he half on't done</l>
                  <l>For Mother-Church, he had the Popedom won.</l>
                  <l>And now, dear Friends, you <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> be Judg</l>
                  <l>If 'tis not hard his Holineſs ſhould grudg</l>
                  <l>A little Pleaſure, which affords us trotting,</l>
                  <l>After whole days [and nights] we have bin <hi>plotting;</hi>
                  </l>

                  </l>
                  <l>From whence ere long we hope to have ſuch Friends</l>
                  <l>Shall ſet us free, accompliſh all our Ends.</l>
                  <l>Tell us 'twas <hi>Hee kept Common-Foes from ſitting!</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>'Tis known he lies: for, did we think it fitting,</l>
                  <l>We other Reaſons for the ſame could ſhow,</l>
                  <l>Than He (perhaps Infallible) doth know.</l>
                  <l>But let that paſs: 'tis done, we thank our Stars,</l>
                  <l>Thoſe Fiery Jades that draw in <hi>Titan</hi>'s Cars.</l>
                  <l>Now after all, ſhould we be left i'th lurch,</l>
                  <l>Our Prayer ſhall be, <hi>The Devil take the Church.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>In troth, that's honeſt. To conclude, I ſhall</l>
                  <l>Give my Amen, <hi>The Devil take ye all,</hi>
