         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Preſent thee here with a full view of
Errour's vtmoſt, and of the Method
it muſt neceſſarily take in it's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſ.
Firſt, weakneſſes of reaſoning
&amp; inſincerity muſt endeavour to eſtablish the
groundles Fabrick; which once diſcoverd,
there is no way left but to fall into worſe Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſms
&amp; Contradictions, and more open &amp;
inexcuſable Falſifications. This is my charge
in generall againſt my two Adverſaries; The
Roll of their many faults in particular may bee
collected out of the <hi>Index.</hi> If I have wrong
fully impoſed any thing on them, let mee ſink
in thy eſteem; if iuſtly, let them. I court no
favour from thee but this that thou wouldeſt
not give credit to this Reioynder of mine,
read alone, but in company ſtill of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies:
ſometimes alſo upon occaſion reflecting

                  </gap>arm'd:</hi> Conſider, I put
thee upon neither an uniuſt, unprofitable,
<pb facs="tcp:115675:3"/>
uneceſſary not too troubleſome a Method.
Not uniuſt, ſince this gives thee a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to ballance equally in thy thoughts
what both alledge. Not unprofitable, ſince
theſe two firſt Books of theirs being cry'd up
for the beſt peeces which have come forth in
theſe late dayes upon ſo concerning a ſubject,
nothing can more largely contribute to thy
Soul's repoſe than to bee ſatisfactorily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinc't
whether they ſtand or fall. Not unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;
becauſe without Method no ſecure
ſatisfaction can bee had; there being ſo many
by-wayes incident to obſtinate and diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
maintainers of their tenet, as of omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Anſwer things important, wauing the
true point controverted, enlarging upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerning
paſſages, misrepreſenting the true
ſtate of the Queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Teſtimonies, and one
anothers words, &amp;c. That, without a ioynt-peruſall
of both party's writings, 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to receive any rationall ſatisfaction; nor,
indeed, any at all without a confident relian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
upon the private Writer's word or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
than which kind of partiality nothing hath
more endamag'd rationall Soul's. Nor yet is
this Method too troubleſome; ſince, by ſeeing
ſo numerous and ſuch groſſ faults truly made
good to bee in theſe their writings, thou mayſt
iuſtly hold thy ſelf excuſed from reading the
reſt of their paſt or future works till they clear
<pb facs="tcp:115675:3"/>
theſe their beſt to bee both convincing &amp; true
dealing; Which, unles they perform effecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely,
I muſt challenge thy judgment and thy
ſincerity neither to give them aſse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nor credit.</p>
            <p>I confeſſ, indeed, that, while I intreat thee
to make uſe of this Method, I have a private
end of mine own; knowing nothing could do
mee more particular Right than this. Many
ſober &amp; candid perſons reading <hi>Schiſm Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarm'd</hi>
(not conſidering that what is ſpoken in
oppoſition to truth muſt neceſſarily bee non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and eaſy to bee shown ſuch if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer
of it vnderſtands his own Grounds, bee
true to his cauſe, and will ſpeak out) appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
it impoſſible a Bishop and a Doctour,
perſons of ſo high repute for learning, should
bee obnoxious all over to ſuch innumerable
faults and ſuch incredible weakneſſes; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
look't upon it as a peece of Wit, framing
an Idea, as it were, of what humane frailty
could poſſibly bee ſubject to, than that it was
ſo indeed: Till, coming to compare it with it's
Adverſary-Books and ſcanning one in order
to the other, they remain'd, as on the one ſide
perfectly ſatisfy'd, ſo, on the other, extremely
aſtonish't at the weaknes of Errour. I know
good Natures are loath to think men to bee
Monſters, that is, ſenceleſly irrationall or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
inſincere: But, I hope I shall gain ſo
far upon their reaſons without wronging their
<pb facs="tcp:115675:4"/>
good Natures, (for I concieve reaſon to bee
their beſt and onely Nature) as to conſider
that in what wee <hi>oppoſe</hi> one another, wee <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict</hi>
one another, and the one part onely
of the Contradiction can bee <hi>Truth;</hi> wherefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the other part muſt neceſſarily bee <hi>Falshood,</hi>
that is, <hi>non-ſence.</hi> Hee then whoſe task it is to
oppoſe the true ſide, muſt unavoidably talk
<hi>non-ſence</hi> if hee oppoſe it directly; or elſe hee
muſt prevaricate from his Duty in oppoſing
ſomething elſe in ſtead of it, and ſo bee very
<hi>impertinent;</hi> or bring againſt it <hi>mediums</hi> or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which concern it not but look ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, and ſo become extremely <hi>weak:</hi> Or,
laſtly, if hee brings any neceſſary and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Argument, which admitted would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the <hi>true</hi> poſition, it muſt infallibly (ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
one Truth cannot quarrell with another)
bee a meer pretence or a <hi>Falſification,</hi> and ſo
render the alledger <hi>inſincere.</hi> Wherefore, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
they and I, in what wee oppoſe one another,
maintain contradictory poſition, whereof one
ſide and one onely, muſt neceſſarily bee Right,
'tis impoſſible but that one of us muſt either
miſtake in oppoſing the true point, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
our Diſcourſe <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>akly;</hi> or wilfully neglect
it and ſo play the Fool <hi>maliciously;</hi> or go about
to oppoſe it with a reall Truth, and ſo talk
<hi>non-ſence;</hi> or, laſtly, bring againſt it a ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
pretended Truth, and ſo prove a <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifier;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115675:4"/>
and this, in every ſtep of our Proceſſ.
To theſe faults then, I ſay, one of us muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
remain obnoxious, and that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually;
which of us 'tis, is left, Reader, to thy
judgment; onely bee ſo ſincere as to give it
due information in examining both together.
To this end I have for the moſt part quoted
the page and very line of <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hammond;</hi> the
other is ſo diuided into short Sections, to
which mine are correſpondent, that there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no ſuch exactnes.</p>
            <p>One requeſt more I have to offer thee that
thou wouldſt obſerve by the way as thou rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
the different <hi>Genius</hi> of my two Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
The former would make a show of ſaying
ſomething by labouring with a multitude of
little petty diviſions, frequent intermixtures
of Greek phraſes and citations, ſmooth and
plauſible language, &amp; the like quaint and pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
flourishes; whereas, indeed, hee never ſayes
any thing ſeverely to the purpoſe, nor ever
ſpeaks home; but his Diſcourſe is made up of
ſuch indifferent terms, ſo far from immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
his Teſtimonies for the moſt part ſo totally
unconcerning the Queſtion, or, at leaſt, ſo
eaſily appliable to another ſence, which yet
hee preſſes not cloſe to the point but leaves
them ſtill in their pure neutrality, that even
the quickeſt eye ſtands in need of a Tube Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
to ſee from the Premiſſes to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb facs="tcp:115675:5"/>
or from the Argument to the Queſtion.
Or rather, indeed, it would puzzle a good Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,
who underſtands how neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
there ought to bee between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
and Premiſſes, to pick an Argument
out of the whole Book; his notions are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hevell'd
and looſely ſcatter'd about after a
meer orationall and declamatory fashion.
The latter is more candid and ſpeaks plain,
and ſo falls into more direct Contradictions,
which hee bolts out confidently. The one is of
a wary nature and endeavours to cloak them
that they may not show their faces; the other
is more down Right, puts a good countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
on them and bids them out face the world.
The one makes his advantage from <hi>niaiſery</hi>
and shyneſſ, the other from boldnes. The ones
way of writing is properly characterd to bee
shuffling, and packing the cards beneath the
table; the other's playing foul above board.
Laſtly, the one raiſes miſts all over, and would
ſteal common ſence from a man, as it were, in
the dusky twilight; the other will needs rob
you of it at noon-day.</p>
            <p>Nor do I intend by this frank cenſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
from the iuſt opinion of learning due
to them; I doubt not but they are men of
much reading: Onely I contend that their
manner of Schollar-ship is an Hiſtoricall and
Verball kind of Learning, and improperly
<pb facs="tcp:115675:5"/>
call'd ſuch, ſince <hi>to bee learned</hi> is <hi>to know,</hi> which
none can do except thoſe who have undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Grounds and can proceed with evident
conſequence upon thoſe Grounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Either ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
may talk rhetorically, cite a Teſtimony, and
by quibbling in the words show it plauſibly
ſounding to his ſence, but to ſpeak <hi>conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>convincingly</hi> belongs onely to them who
have <hi>Grounds,</hi> that is <hi>Truth</hi> on their ſide, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
there can bee no true Grounds nor ſolid
reaſon for an <hi>Errour.</hi> Whence again ſince one
of us muſt have <hi>Truth,</hi> and but one of us can
have it, 'tis manifeſt one of us onely can have
Grounds, or Diſcourſe conſequently, the
other muſt shuffle, falſify or talk verbally. At
whoſe door the guilt lies is not my part to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,
but is wholly ſubmitted to the Tribunal
of the rightly inform'd Reader; whoſe pardon
I humbly beg for uſing the ſame words ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as <hi>non-ſence, shuffling, weaknes,</hi> &amp;c. The
frequent repetition of ſuch unſavory Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
ſounded no leſſ ingratefull to my ears,
being really much ashamed to <hi>name</hi> ſo often
what they ſo often <hi>did.</hi> But I de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ire it may bee
conſider'd I was here to ſpeak Truth not to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
phraſes; and, both for this, as alſo for the
ſeeming harshnes of my Expreſſions, I crave
leave to poſe the Diſliker with this <hi>Dilemma;</hi>
that, ſince it was my task to bee their accuſer
where I found them reproovable and Accuſers
<pb facs="tcp:115675:6"/>
are to call crimes by their own names, either
they misdeſeru'd or not; If not, I am willing
to bearthe cenſure of having added Paſſion to
Calumny; but if they were indeed thus blama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then 'twas a rationall carriage in order to
maintain Truth to call their faults by their
proper names how often ſoever they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them. Nor are my Reprehenſions (fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
indeed, but never without iuſt occaſion
nor over proportion'd to the degree of their
faultines) at all intended to vent my anger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the perſons, but onely to breed in the
Reader a due reflexion on their faults: And,
if this bee ill Nature, I muſt avow it, that I
hate a Contradiction with all my heart; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
it as a far greater iniury that any man
should go about to diſorder my Soul by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
upon it a Falshood or Contradiction
with ſtratagems and tricks (eſpecially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſo concerning) than if they should break
my head or even endanger my life by betraying
mee into an ambush; and, I conceive that
any one, who knows and prizes his Soul, will
bee of my temper. I cannot but impute it to
Art not to Vice that excellent Muſicians who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
ears are inur'd to the ſmootheſt and beſt-proportion'd
ſtroaks, should not endure to
hear harsh Diſcords without ſome impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce:
Neither in making my ſelf the parallell to
ſuch skilfull Artiſts do I arrogate more to my
<pb facs="tcp:115675:6"/>
ſelf than onely this that I have had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to light on an excellent Maſter of reaſon,
who is able to tune the thoughts of a rationall
Soul to the perfecteſt harmony; and that it
pleaſed God to give mee ſuch an unprejudic'd
ſincerity and ſuch a competent degree of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
as would permit and enable mee to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
Truths, in themſelves as evident as
that two and three make five, when the terms
were clearly propoſed in an orderly conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion,
and the meanings or notions made plain
by Definitions.</p>
            <p>May I intreat this fair opinion from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Reader that hee make not my ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
againſt mine Adverſaries an Argument
that I am a Lover of Diſſenſion or a Deſirer
to keep the Diſcord ſtill on foot between us.
I proteſt with all ſincerity there neither is nor
can bee any man living who more cordially
longs for or shall more induſtriouſly (to his
power) endeavour an Vnion between all tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
who lay claim to Chriſt's name than my ſelf,
as thoſe who know my heart beſt can teſtify;
and that I would willingly conſecrate all my
ſtudies, ſacrifice all my intereſt, nay even my
life it ſelf, to ſuch an happy end. But, on the
other ſide, ſince an Vncertainty in the Rule
and Root of faith is diametrically oppoſit to
an Vnion in Faith (for how shall rationall
Soul's center when they know not where to
<pb facs="tcp:115675:7"/>
meet, nor have Grounds to bind them to a
ioynt-aſſent, as without <hi>Evidence of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
there can bee none) hence I shall hope to
have deſerued well from all rationall Lovers
of Vnion in impugning vigorouſly and diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
this <hi>tenet</hi> of Vncertainty, the Seed of all
Hereſies, Schiſms &amp; Diſſenſion, and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of Vnion; which peſtilent doctrine hath
got ſuch root in our poor country by two or
three plauſible pens, that aſwell Religion as
Philoſophy amongſt many excellent Wits is
reduced to meer Scepticiſm. For this end I
have, upon all fitting occaſions throughout
this whole Treatiſe, inculcated a certainty in
the ſayd Rule of faith and an Evidence of that
certainty; to fix by thoſe many little dints a
ſtrong impreſſion in the Reader's mind that
ſuch a thing there is, to bee found by thoſe
who with a iuſt and impartiall diligence ſeek
it. And, if any in this ſo noble an enquiry will
venture to take my word (and I have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that I ſpeak by experience) I shall
ſend them no long iourney but onely addreſſ
their ſtudy to thoſe two little Treatiſes of <hi>Rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's
Dialogues</hi> and the <hi>Apology for Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
This Principle then being ſuch that, it
once eſtablish't all the reſt will infallibly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and without it no Ground of agreement
can poſſibly bee expected, I was obliged even
out of my love to Vnion to maintain it invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
<pb facs="tcp:115675:7"/>
by all means which Truth could iuſtify
to bee lawfull, and by conſequence what ever
is held upon that Rule, as is the ſubſtance of
the Authority I defend. In other points, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the certainty of the Rule and Root of faith
is not concern'd, the Proteſtants shall find
mee alwayes proceed with the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendence
and moderation that Prudence
and Charity can dictate to the moſt indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Mind.</p>
            <p>As for my ſmiling upon occaſion at my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary's
toyes and affected weakneſſes, let the
Reader fancy throughly my circumſtances
by peruſing both Books together, and hee
shall ſee clearly it had been moſt improper to
return thoſe paſſages any other Anſwer: Or,
if there bee any ſo wedded to a ſeverer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
that they will not allow circumſtances
their due, but think that ſuch kind of carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
is not to bee uſed at all in Controverſies
about Faith, I shall ſend them to <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
the rigideſt and ſevereſt in points of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
among all the Ancients, for better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
<hi>If you find</hi> (ſaith hee, writing againſt
the Adverſaries of faith) <hi>in my Book ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
which move one to Laughter, 'tis becauſe
the matter it ſelf occaſions it. There are many
things which deſerve to bee thus mock't at, leſt by
combating them ſeriously you should ſignify they
are of weight. Nothing is more due to Vanity
<pb facs="tcp:115675:8"/>
than Laughter; and this carriage is proper to
Truth, to whom it belongs to laugh, becauſe shee
is naturally pleaſant; and to exult over her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
becauſe shee is ſecure of the victory. Care,
indeed, is to bee taken leſt the mirth bee baſe and
unworthy of Truth; but, otherwiſe, when one can
fittingly make advantage by it, 'tis a Duty to
uſe it.</hi> Thus hee. To which I shall onely adde
theſe few words of <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> whoſe Spirit,
though all compoſed of charity and ſweetnes,
breaks out into this ſmart demand. <hi>Vvho is
ſo bold as to ſay that Truth should come forth
unarm'd when it combats falshood, and that it is
lawfull for the Enemies of Religion to fright the
faithfull with great words and inveigle their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
with witty conciets, but that Catholikes ought
to write in a dull and drowſy ſtile, fit for nothing
but to make the Readers fall asleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all I have to apologize for, except
onely for the long delay of this Rejoynder;
the reaſon whereof is too well known to have
been it's miſcarriage a twelve-moneth ago &amp;
the difficulties ſince in bringing it to light in
a forrain country. Vvhich alſo pleads for an
excuſe of it's many lapſes in ſpelling and other
frequent little miſtakes, occaſion'd by the
Compoſer's being a perfect ſtranger to our
language. The groſſer faults shall bee noted
in the <hi>Errata</hi> at the end, which I deſire the
Reader to correct ere hee addreſſ himſelf to
<pb facs="tcp:115675:8"/>
peruſe the Book, in regard one of mine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
did mee ſo little Iuſtice as to cavill
heretofore at a miſtake of the Printer's in
<hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd,</hi> though it were rectify'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
carefully in the <hi>Errata.</hi> This done, I leave
the indifferent Reader to the fruit of his own
Induſtry, and to that ſucceſſ which the force
of Truth is wont to effect in an impartiall and
ſincere Mind.</p>

underſtanding) were yet ſo unſeaſonably clamorous, as
then moſt to plead their innocence when their fault of

               <p>Rationall therefore and convenient was the <hi>Diſarmers</hi>

a defence deſerved And I wonder he had no more Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then not tho be afraid leſt he should drive S. W. into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair

which the obſtinate Iews uſed towards the true Prophets
of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But firſt he does me right in acknowledging that it was
not I who gave him his <hi>Bill of Fare,</hi> to which I may with
truth adde, that I not ſo much as knew of it: Yet he thinks
he has got a notable advantage againſt me, from my own
confeſſion, that my blows were rude, and mine Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
civil where as, I uſed both thoſe phraſes as an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Readers, as is moſt palpable; and had I uſed
them, the rudeneſſe of blows argues not that they were
not juſt, ſince none doubts, but Malefactours are very ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely,
yet moſt juſtly whipt; and the courteous epithet of
<hi>civil,</hi> deny'd not but the oyl in his tongue was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
with venome in his heart, and ſo made it more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to diſcover that, whoſe onely advantage it was, to
lurk undiſcoverable under the ſmooth outſde of a fair-languag'd
courteſie. The <hi>twitchings by the beard</hi> (which he
reiterates to make his Reader ſmile,) is indeed ſomething
too rude a carriage if underſtood in the downright ſence as
he ſeems to take it; but ſince I ſpoke-it onely in an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
and in order to his wearing a vizard which I pluck'd
off, let him but acknowledge that I found him attired in
ſuch a mask (to which the other words related) and I am
contented to be thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Next, with what Logick does he huddle together thoſe
teſtimonies out of Scripture for S. W's paſport to Hell,
unleſſe he could evidence that they were particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable
to him? Are words, which in their own nature
found even contumeliouſly, ſo perfectly damnable that
no circumſtance can render them inculpable; or at leaſt
venial, if not neceſſary, or convenient? for the Dr. main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the generall <hi>Theſis</hi> in ſuch à manner, as if one taken
in ſuch a flagrant fact, is long ago condemned to hell and
disinherited from his right to heaven. <hi>p.</hi> 2. and 3. What
becomes then of good S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> who called the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared
Iews <hi>a generation of vipers?</hi> what of <hi>S. Paul</hi> who
(<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 8.) called <hi>Elymas, ſon of the devil, full of
all treaechery and deceit, enemy of all juſtice,</hi> &amp;c. What
of our Saviour, who called Herod, <hi>Fox,</hi> the prophaners
of the Temple, <hi>Theeves,</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites?</hi>
And, to come nearer our preſent circumſtances,
what will become of Bleſſed S. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> (diſciple to S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangeliſt, the tendereſt recommender of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to his diſciples of all the Apoſtles) who yet meeting
with an heretick, who began complementally to inſinuate
into acquaintance with <hi>nonn agnoſcis nos? Do not you
know us?</hi> rejected his courteſy with this rude language,
<hi>Agnoſco primogenitum Di boli, yes, I know thee to be the
firſt begotten of the devil.</hi> What of S. <hi>Iude,</hi> who calls
hereticks <hi>clouds without water, autumnal trees, twice
dead, rooted out, waves of the raging ſea foaming out
their own confuſion.</hi> Laſtly, to come yet nearer home,
what ſhall we think of Gods Church, whoſe cuſtome it
ever was to <hi>anathematiſ and curſe</hi> all hereticks, and of
<hi>S. Paul</hi> who bids <hi>anathema even to an Angel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
if he ſhould preach <hi>falſe doctrine?</hi> I ask now, are
not all theſe expreſſions, revileing, contumelious, rude, and
(which the Doctour moſt reſents) <hi>beard-twitching</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
if taken in themſelves? Muſt then all this good
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115675:11"/>
company be deem'd deteſtable, unrighteous, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and blindly pack'd all away to hell together, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers,
contumelious, &amp;c. becauſe they gave ſuch hard
language? The texts alledged by Mr. H. are very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
laying about them blindly and indifferently at
Friends and Foes; and he allowes them here no exception
at all. Or, if he does, as I hope he wil rather then involve
ſuch perſons in his uniuerſall cenſure; then the reaſon why
he exempts theſe muſt be, becauſe the words, though ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken
in their own indifferency without any application,
are moſt highly contumelious, yet, ſpoken to ſuch perſons
as hereticks, men publickly noxious, the common good
concernd' made the private perſon's repute not conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
and ſo (the miſdeſert of the perſons juſtifying the
truth of the words) they ſounded now a <hi>laudable</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
zeal,</hi> which in other circumſtances had been <hi>contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely</hi>
and <hi>inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>perate paſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence followes, firſt, that I am not excommunicate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or in the ſtate of damnation, for having uſed contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
words, ſince the uſe of them, if taken ſimply in it ſelf,
is not impious, as has beenshown: but for having uſed
them againſt Dr. H. Vnhappy I who was not aware how
ſacred a perſon my adverſary was, ere I undertook to deal
with him! Next, it follows that, if Dr. H. evidence not
his cauſe to be no hereſy, and himſelf no maintainer of
it, all thoſe former harſh expreſſious uſed againſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
are his due, and without ſcruple of ſin, might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him by S. W. who had undertaken as a Catholick
writer to lay open his faultineſſe. Let any man but read
the Doctours firſt chapter <hi>of Schiſm,</hi> and take notice
what harſh-ſounding characters the Fathers give to that
vice; and then let him tell me what a publick propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
of Schim may deſerue. Wherefore, unleſſe he makes
his evidence good, S. W. may alſo juſtly retort upon him
the charge of contumeliouſneſſe; ſince he has no where
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115675:12"/>
in his whole Book uſed towards him ſuch rude expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as the Dr. hath in his firſt chapter by his cenſorious
ſelf-explication of Scripture loaded upon him, of <hi>deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
impious,</hi> &amp;c onely Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> calumniates in a
preaching manner, and out of Scripture, which makes the
well-couch'd contumely leſſe diſcernable. Thirdly, it
were very eaſie for S. W. uſing the Doctours method, to
gather out of Scripture all the vigorous words and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
execrations againſt the wicked; and then, by his own
voluntary explication and application, clap them all upon
the Dr.: as for example, that of <hi>Curſe ye Meroz,</hi> &amp;c.
and then ſay that by <hi>Meroz</hi> is meant ſuch as Mr. H.
who writes againſt God's Church. This, I ſay, were as
eaſie for the <hi>Diſarmer:</hi> But he cannot but hate that in
himſelf, which he nauſeates at in another: He knows ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wel, and hopes the world, now grown wiſer, plainly
diſcerns it almoſt as impoſſible certainly to demonſtrate
truth by clashing together meer wordish teſtimonies; as
to ſtrike fire by the weak colliſion of two pieces of Wax,
which eaſily yield at every ſtroke: and therefore makes
account it is his greateſt misfortune to tamper with an
Adverſary who trades in wares of no higher value, then
onely, <hi>Reuſner</hi> like, in fragments pick'd out of ſeverall
Authours, and then ſtitch'd together by voluntary tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
into a book.</p>
               <p>What is hitherto ſaid is onely to show, that every uſing
of language, even in its own nature contumelious, is fat
from being a ſin; and therefore that S. W. may yet (by
God's grace) hope to eſcape hell fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſſe the Dr. can
evidence that his cauſe is neither Hereſie nor Schiſme;
ſince, if it be, it remain'd very lawful for him to treat the
publike propagatour of it according to his deſert, as has
been shown. But S. W. diſclaims, in behalf of his book,
any ſuch language towards Dr. H. A contumely (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
notes ſome perſonall and morall fault in another:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115675:12"/>
did I note any in him? Indeed, as a writer; he was mine
and the Churches Adverſary; and as ſuch it is moſt irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
I should ſpare him, when I ſaw my advantage. Do
Duellers (if their quarrell be ſerious) uſe to ſpare their
enemy, and not hurt him in that place where they ſee
him unguarded? It were madneſſe then to expect, that,
where my adverſary writ inſincerely, I should not shew
him inſincere; where blaſphemouſly, blaſphemous; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
weakly, weak; where ridiculouſly, ridiculous, Vpon
ſuch advantage offer'd I ought to have had no courteſie
for him; unleſſe I would prevaricate from my task, and
betray the cauſe I had undertaken to defend, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental
connivence. If then I might upon his deſert gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
him thoſe characters, I hope it is neceſſarily conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
that words muſt be allowed me to expreſſe them;
nor ought the lawfull help of Rhetorick be interdicted
me, to expreſſe them home. Now, if all art of Rhetorick
gives it, that ridiculous things ought to be expreſt ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
let Dr. H. blame the art ſo unfriendly to him, and
his own weakneſſe which intituled him to ſuch expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
not S. W. who did but as art, nature, and reaſon
required. If any yet object that I was ſtill exceſſive in the
manner of thoſe expreſſions; I anſwer that I shall bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to confeſſe the fault, unleſſe I manifeſted him equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exceſſive in the manner of deſerving them: otherwiſe,
as long as the proportion holds, I shall in reaſon account
my ſelf blameleſſe.</p>
               <p>As a writer then againſt God's Church, D. H. ought
in reaſon to expect no mercy at S. W's hands, but rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
juſtice onely: nor is this by conſequence contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
but the proper treaty which reaſon grants, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
avoucheth, and the circumſtances make neceſſary.
Now that all the pretended revilings of S. W. are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Dr. shall. inform the Reader, complaining here
<hi>pag.</hi> 2. that the <hi>Publisher</hi> of the book <hi>hath ſolemny an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next

a liſt of the contumelies, three and thirty picz'd out
by ſpecialty,</hi> &amp;c. ſince then theſe, as he ſayes, are the <hi>ſpeci
all</hi> or chief contumelies, not to trouble the Reader with
the whole Roll, we will onely take notice of the firſt of
them, which is this; <hi>How the Dr. of. Divinity has forgot
his accidence.</hi> This is the firſt of thoſe <hi>ſpecial</hi> contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
which Dr. H. here compares to <hi>Goliah's curſing of
David;</hi> to <hi>Rabſhakeh's reproches;</hi> to <hi>the king of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab's
language againſt Iſrael.</hi> This is that in the <hi>flagiant
fact</hi> of which (as he expreſſes it) being taken, <hi>the Apoſtle
hath</hi> therefore <hi>long ago pronounced ſentence</hi> againſt me,
that <hi>no Chriſtian muſt eat with me,</hi> hence it is that I have
<hi>onely the name, not the reality of a Chriſtian,</hi> am <hi>a deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  </gap> (as he pedantizes it) ſo as <hi>unreformed</hi> (that

of heaven,</hi> and <hi>do but flatter and deceive my ſelf if I hope
I may;</hi> and laſtly, am <hi>none of thoſe Saints who (clave

poaſted to hell by couples (for I ſuppoſe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh

You wits of the Vniuerſities beware and take
example by the fatall Cataſtrophe of S. W. when you
write or diſpute do not accuſe your Adverſary of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence

or the like; you ſee upon how tickliſh a point your

long ago that no man may eat with you, hence you
are ſpecially contumelious, excommunicated, no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

out of Scripture.</p>
               <p>The reſt of thoſe <hi>ſpecial contumelies</hi> (as he calls them)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115675:13"/>
are deductions from his own erroneous reaſoning, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
Scripture, from his ſelf contradictions, his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore being onely aimed at his Book?
orat Himſelf as the Writer of it, were neceſſary to be
taken notice of by his <hi>Diſarmer;</hi> and conſequently not
falling under the notion of contumelies, nor deſerving ſo
many cenſures in Greek. If Mr. H. yet kindly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
that my words were too harsh; my anſwer is,
the very names we give to great faults are harſh words,
nor can they poſſibly be other wiſe; ſo as he muſt either
ſuppoſe me ſo ſupine as not to take notice of his faulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or elſe I muſt ſuppoſe him more innocent, (that is,
deny mine own eyes:) and then, winking at his groſſe
and pernicious errours, ſubſtitute courteſy to zeal, and
inſtead of confuting, fall to complement. Now how can
any man in reaſon imagine I ſhould not mention his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
faults, that is, not uſe harſh words? For either Dr.
H. knew of them, or not: if not, it was his intereſt and
my charity to let him know them; which, I think, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done without naming them: If he knew of them,
and yet writ them, it was a more neceſſary charity, and
more concerning the publick, and deareſt intereſt of mens
ſalvations (waving all private reſpect to the perſon) to
let all men know his falſe dealing, that they might bewa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of him, as of a wolf in ſheeps clothing. Let himſelf chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
which ſide he pleaſes, I ſhall hold my ſelf ſufficiently
cleared by either. Nay, rather I have reaſon to make a
counter-complaint of the Dr. for, I no where in my
whole Book, branded him with the appelation of a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
perſon,</hi> which this pattern of piety gives me:
though my pretence might avouch-it, being to defend the
rights of the Church I live in: whereas his intemperance
proceeds from a vindication of his private ſelfe from the
contumelies (forſooth) he hath received; and to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
his fault the more, he cannot be content to uſe his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115675:14"/>
own words to expreſſe his gravity affecting paſſion; but,
to make his railing more authoritative (as one ſaid of a
preciſe puritanical Dame, that shee never cudgeld her
Mayd but in Scripture-phraſe) ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt needs
prophecie long ago of my Excommunication, be revived
to pronounce it in Dr. H's name, and for ſolemnity ſake,
in Greek too: Yet after the Dr. hath been ſo hihg in the
Pulpit againſt contumelies, he is become himſelf ſo mean
an Auditor, as to accuſe me flatly of falſifications, (with
what reaſon shall be ſeen hereafter) calumnies certainly,
if not avouch'd; yet all ſounds zeal in him, which in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would be plain contumelie: Should we deſire St.
<hi>Paul</hi> now to Excommunicate Dr. H. hee would preſently
ſilence-us, by aſſuring'us, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> never meant harm
to him, but to <hi>S.</hi> W. onely, ſo ſecure a thing it is to be a

ſee this manner of Writing in confuting ſuch Authors, is

truth of the thing makes good what is ſaid. One rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
more I shall adde, which I recommend to the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
conſideration of the Reader, it being indeed the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
ground why ſuch a treaty should be neceſſary
in controverſies about Faith, againſt the deemed adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
thereof. And this is no other than the <hi>certainty of
Faith</hi> it ſelf. But leſt the Dr. should miſtake me (as his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115675:14"/>
cuſtome is) to beg the queſtion, by ſuppoſing our Faith
certain, I profeſſe my ſelfe onely to mean at preſent a
<hi>deemed,</hi> or <hi>beleeved certainty</hi> of Faith in him who is to
maintain it: Now whoever holds his Faith and its ground
certain (as Catholiks do) is obliged, <hi>eo ipſo,</hi> to hold for
certain likewiſe, that the Government recommended to
him by the ſame Rule of Faith is to be ſubmitted to, and
by conſequence, that the rejecting it is <hi>Schiſm;</hi> whence
follows, that he muſt hold alſo <hi>for certain,</hi> that the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatour
of that Tenet is a Ringleader of Schiſmaticks, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
pernicious, and one who by his poiſonous Writings
infects the ſouls of men with as hainous a vice as ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
any to damnation. Neither can he hold him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
unleſſe he will hold the ground of his own Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
and call into queſtion the ſubſtance of all his hope,
that he may inſtead thereof entertain charitable thoughts
of the impugner of it.</p>
               <p>Now then let us conſider what carriage is due towards a
private perſon, held for <hi>certain</hi> to be one who endeavours
to draw ſouls to hell by his Writings and Authority, from
him who holds him ſo, nor can hold him otherwiſe, unleſſe
he will hold the grounds of his own Faith doubtful; ought
not this Catholike Writer, if he has any zeal for his Faith,
or care of his Conſcience (which obliges him in charity to
prevent ſo great miſchief) to uſe the means and waies
which wit and art can invent, to confute and diſcredit that
mans harmful ſophiſtry, and diſparage his authority, as fat
as truth can juſtifie his words? ought hee not to trample
down all tenderneſſe which his good nature would ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
neglect all conſiderations of reſpect, all condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of civility, to lay him open plainly, and palpably
to be what hee is, that is, ridiculous, nonſenſical, weak,
blaſphemous, or whatever other Epithet the defence of ſo
bad a cauſe makes ſo bad a writer deſerve: why should
he make ſcruple (going upon thoſe grounds that his Faith
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115675:15"/>
is moſt certain, and the former ſequel no leſſe) to give him
the ſame language, if he be found to deſerve it, as St. <hi>Iude</hi>
gave the Adverſaries of Faith in his daies, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
gave <hi>Porphyrius</hi> afterwards; nay more, if he ſees
he can make him juſtly ridiculous, why ſhould he not
expreſſe himſelf ironically too in order to his nonſence, as
well as <hi>Elias</hi> might ſcoffe at the Prieſts of <hi>Baal?</hi> In a
word, whatever can conduce to the juſtly diſgracing him,
as the Defender of a certainly deemed-pernicious cauſe,
might lawfully, nay in Charity ought have been uſed to
undeceive his adherentes, and preſerve others from a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly-beleeved</hi>
danger, and that the greateſt of dangers,
eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>Hence ſollows, that though <hi>S,</hi> W. may perhaps be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for holding his Faith <hi>certain,</hi> yet he is inculpable for
proceeding conſequently to the former Tenet, that is in
treating Dr. H. as a pernicious deſtroyer of ſoules, ſince
(as hath been proved) he cannot think him otherwiſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
hee either doubt of his own Faith, or renounce the
light of his Reaſon, which taught him to deduce thence by
evident conſequence that ſuch he was, and as ſuch to be
treated. He who holds ill principles, is blameable indeed
in that regard, but yet he is worthy of praiſe and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
for proceding conſequently upon them, ſince to
deduce conſequences aright, is very laudable.</p>
               <p>As for the culpableneſſe which may accrue by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Faith <hi>certain,</hi> to clear himſeif to rational perſons
(for wordish and merely teſtimony-men are not capable
of reaſon) he feares not to profeſſe, that he makes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he hath as perfect evidence, or more than he hath for
any thing in nature, that Truths of no leſſe concernment
then Eternity, written in the hearts of ſo many as may in
a juſt eſtimate make up the account of mankind, in ſuch
a powerful manner, and with ſuch incompatable motives
as the Apoſtles writ them being ſo conformable to nature,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115675:15"/>
not meerly ſpeculative, but each of them viſibile, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practical, could never dye or decay out of the hearts of
Chriſtians, in any age. Nor hath he leſſe evidence, that
conſequently (Scripture &amp; its interpretation being ſubject
to miſpriſion, as far as they depend not upon this, and are
regula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed by it) <hi>Vniverſal Tradition</hi> is the onely certain
and abſolute rule of Faith; whence follows, that both
they who build upon any other ground, have onely opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to found their faith, for thoſe points which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
nor from tradition; as alſo, that that Church who
relies upon <hi>univerſal Tradition</hi> for each point of Faith,
erres in none, not can erre ſo long as the ſticks cloſe to ſo
ſafe a Principle. Now then, finding no Church doe this
but the Roman-Catholike (for neither Greeks, nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
nor any elſe pretended to have received ever from
their immediate Fore fathers thoſe points of Faith in which
they differ from her) doubt not to account Her that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Church which hath the true motive, ground, and rule
of Faith (ſince <hi>probability</hi> cannot be that Rule) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
which hath true Faith, and is a true Church:
Hence I am obliged to eſteem all other Congregations
which have broken from that onely-certain Rule, or her
Government recommended by the ſame Rule, Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
and Heretical; hence I conclude her Infallible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I make account I can demonſtrate, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
upon which onely ſhe relies is impoſſible to fail,
Hence, Iaſtly, that I may come home to my intent, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
my faith <hi>certain,</hi> and the propagator of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>certainly</hi> pernicious to mens ſouls; and therfore that
it was both his deſert and my obligation, not to let ſlip
any poſſible advantage, which might with Truth damnify
his cauſe, and him as-the maintainer of it.</p>
               <p>Now, that we may turn over the leaf, as <hi>certainty</hi> that
faith is true is a ſufficient ground to beget a juſt zeal in
its propugners againſt its adverſaries, ſo a profeſt fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115675:16"/>
and uncertainty is uterly inſufficient for that end,
and unable to intereſt conſcience in its defence. For
how should conſcience be inrereſſed to defend poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
held upon no better ground, with any eagerneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,
unleſſe reaſon be intereſſed firſt? and how can reaſon
be obliged to the ſerious, and vigorous patronage of
what it felf knows certainly that it knows not whether
it be true or no? See but how the working of Nature
in all men gives teſtimony to this Truth! If we hear
one obſtinately affirm and ſtand to a thing which we
know certainly is otherwiſe, though the matter it ſelf
be but of triviall concernment, even Nature ſeems to
ſtirre us up in behalf of Truth to a juſt reſentment,
and hardly can we refrain from giving a sharp repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
if the perſon be underus, or ſome expreſſion
of-diſlike, if this <hi>peremptory</hi> wronger of truth exceed
our juriſdiction. So on the other ſide if we be uncertain
whether the thing be ſo or no, we find, it quite abates
that keenneſſe of oppoſition, neither will any one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
very peevish and weak, engage paſſion to quarrel
about a conjecture, or if it ſo happen ſometimes, as
when probabliſts diſpute vehemently, yet their heat
ſprings not from the naturall love of truth inbred in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir
ſouls, but becauſe their honour, intereſt, or other
conveniency is concerned in the goodſucceſſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that as Catholikes go not conſequently
to their grounds, unleſſe they defend with an eagerneſſe
and zeal proportionable to the concernment of the thing,
their Faith, which they hold <hi>moſt certain</hi> and <hi>infallible;</hi>
ſo Proteſtants who confeſſe their Faith <hi>fallible,</hi> that is,
ſuch as may poſſibly by otherwiſe for any thing they
know, are obliged by their very grounds not to take it
much ill at any that impugne it, nor expreſſe any great
zeal in behalf of it; or if they do, then, their grounds not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115675:16"/>
requiring it, all their heat and earneſtneſſe muſt manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ariſe from ſome paſſion or intereſt. They ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to defend their problematicall Faith, as men defend
paradoxes, calmly, civilly, and moderately; and make
conſcience of being diſcourteous to their oppoſer, ſince for
any thing they kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he may poſſibly be in the right. In
a word, their whole way of controverſy, ought in reaſon
to be managed as an exerciſe of wit; ſince it conſiſts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this, who can moſt dexterouſly and artificially criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize
upon words, and be moſt quick and ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
out of his ſtorehouſe either topicall reaſons, or teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
(gleaned from all places and Authours) as shall
ſeem moſt pat for the preſent occaſion. And this is the
reaſon why they deſire no more, but that Catholike wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
should treat them with a luke-warm courteſy, and by
a reſpectfull behaviour towards them, as leanerd men, ſee,
mingly leave them ſome apparence that their Faith is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
and then they think themſelves ſafe, and are very
well appayed, whereas it belongs to a Catholike Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
who holds his Faith <hi>certain</hi> to manifeſt the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be perfectly abſurd, and nonſence; and ſince the
knowledge of this muſt, in his grounds, be held ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the ſalvation of mankind, he ought in plain terms
let men know it is ſuch, and give it home the Character
it deſerves; otherwiſe by his timorouſneſſe he prevaricates
from his grounds, &amp; by his fearfull mincing his expreſſions
when Truth will-bear him out in them, and the weight of
the cauſe exacts them, he breeds a juſt apprehenſion in his
readers that the contrary (elſe why should he proceed ſo
reſervedly) may have ſome degree of probability, which
perhaps is enough for his Adverſary, but aſſuredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes
his own cauſe.</p>
               <p>I know my adverſary will think he hath gained much
by my forwardneſſe in this laſt paragraph, and others
alſo may perhaps judge that I have put my ſelf upon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115675:17"/>
the geateſt diſadvantage imaginable by profeſſing vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
that it is my obligation to ſhow his writings <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi>
or <hi>impoſſible</hi> to be true; whereas a good <hi>prohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
that they are true wil ſerve his turn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, both the

to affirm this, and not to think that in ſo affirming I
have ſaid too much, or been too liberall to my Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Wherefore as if I were to diſpute upon the ground
of my Faith (which yet is not the proper task for our
party who ſtand upon poſſeſſion) I doubt not with
Gods help to leave no room for a probability to the
contrary, in the judgement of a prudent and disinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed
perſon; ſo I ſhall not fear to affirm that all the
teſtimonies in Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> book, though they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
twenty times more, and twenty times ſeemingly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
expreſſe, bear not the weight of a probability, if
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to that world of witneſſes in te Catholike Church
they left, all atteſting that the very points which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
relinquiſht had been delivered by their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as delivered to them by theirs &amp;c. And this ſo
expreſsly, amply, and clearly, as leaves no place for cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms,
ſeverall explications, with all the train of other
circumſtances, which mere words ſeldome or never
want, rendering them obnoxious to a thouſand ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guities:
joyn then, I ſay, that vaſt, and clear teſtimony
to this argument, drawn from reaſon, that, as it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibile
they who lived ten years before H. the eight ſhould
ſo conſpire to deceive thoſe who lived in his dayes, in
things viſibile and practicall (ſuch are the points of our
Faith) as to ſay they received them from their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
as received from theirs, and yet no moſt palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
evidence remain of this moſt palpable and evident<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,
prevayling even to gull the whole world to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115675:17"/>
in a buſineſſe importing their eternall bliſſe; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that the ſame impoſſibility holds in each ten years
aſcending upwards till the Apoſtles time, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that the Faith delivered of late was the Faith deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
then. Ioyn I ſay theſe two together, and I doubt
not to affirm that it is moſt perfect non-ſence, to think all
the teſtimonies in Dr. <hi>Hs.</hi> book (ſubject to a thouſand
Grammatical, Philological, Sophiſticall, Hiſtorical and
Logical difficulties) can bear ſo much as a show of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
if compared to that clear evidence of reaſon, and
that ample one of univerſall teſtification which shines in
the other. However it may happen, that ſome one or
more teſtimonies of his may make the contrary ſeem
probable to ſuch as either never heard of, or nor well pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated,
or do not conſider the grounds of Vniverſall
Tradition; as a ſtraw may incline a ballance, if nothing be
put in the counterpoiſe.</p>
               <p>Neither let my Adverſary object, I intend to evade
anſwering his Teſtimonies by this diſcourſe: they shall
have from me the return due from an Anſwerer; that is,
to show them unable to conclude againſt this vaſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Vniverſall Tradition; for he may know we hold
our Faith and Government upon no other tenour. So as
ſtill the mea ſure of their force muſt be according to the
degree in which they invalidate this tenour of ours built
upon both a long poſſeſſion, and ſuch an univerſall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
clear teſtification. Onely I deſire the Reader to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
hence, what a pittifull task it is to ſtand anſwering a
wordish book, which can bear no weight with any pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
man who conſiders the incomparable force of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Tradition, our onely tenour: but I am neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it by the weakneſſe of many, whoſe wit never
carryed them farther than to hear a ſermon, or to read a
teſtimony; and therefore they never reflected what ſmall
merit of aſſent can be pretended to by words of men dead
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115675:18"/>
long ago, left to be toſt by our various expoſitions and
criticiſms, and liable to a thouſand evaſions, againſt the
clear ſenſe written in the hearts of mankind with moſt
powerfull motives, and to be propagated truly to their
poſterity under penalty of eternall damnation to them
and theirs. Few there are I ſay who have refined their
underſtanding to this degree of diſcerningneſs though I
perceive, to my great comfort, that the beſt ſort of witts
begin to own their reaſon, and bring it home to it ſelf, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than ſuffer it to wander in a pathleſſe wilderneſſe of
words, and think it an endeavour more worthy a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſoul to weave well compacted Treatiſes by evident
connexion of terms, than fruitleſly to ſtand picking
thrums-ends out of overworn garments; &amp; when they
have done, ſcarce know what colour they are of, or how
to knit them handſomely together without the motley of
non-ſence.</p>
               <p>Thus much to give account of my obligation not to
favour Mr. H. while he impugnes that Faith which
I eſteem moſt certain, and moſt concerning. Now, for
his perſon, as it comes to me under any other notion,
than of a writer againſt God's Church, I profeſs with all
ſincerity to honour and love it in the meaſure which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
requires. As a member of the civil commonwealth I
live in, I bear him a civil reſpect; I hear he is much a
Gentleman and very courteous: in return to which, if it
be my good fortune to meet him, I shall be as ready to
ſerve him in what may not concern my cauſe, and do
him as much civility, as I would to moſt Gentlemen in
England. According to the degree of ſcholarship I find
in him, I shall candidly allow him a proportionable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and shall not envy it him, though mine Adverſary,
even in his abſence, amongſt mine own Friends. I value-him
for his skill in Greek, a language I much love my
ſelf, and think it a great ornament to a ſcholar, if he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115675:18"/>
know how to uſe it ſeaſonably, and not wantonly shew it
upon all, or rather no occaſion; in which Mr. H. hath
very mvch diminish't himſelf, giving his Readers a fair ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to ſuſpect him either of too much vanity in that, or
emptineſs in other knowledges. I applaud his unwearied
induſtry, half of which employed in a rationall way by
ſome ſtrong brain, might be the happy Mother of many
rare productions. His looking into ſuch variety of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
deſerves alſo it's commendation; ſince teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
have their degree of probation allowed them by their
Governeſſe Reaſon; that is, according to the degree of
knowledge (or Authority ſubſequent to it) found in the
Teſtifier, and the clearneſſe from ambiguity found in the
words alledged: nay rather I should eſteem him more for
this than all the reſt, were this way of teſtimonies in it
ſelf much eſtimable, ſince his chief and almoſt onely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
lies in this; which furnishes him with ſufficient ſtore
of ſuch declamatory proofs, and enables him to bring
ſome kind of teſtimony againſt any thing that can be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
as the nature of ſuch ſleight quotation-argumenrs
uſes to be; for indeed what ſo abſurd, but a teſtimony
may be produc't, even from the beſt Authours, ſeemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
favouring it, as we experience daily in Scripture? Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and more eſpecially, I acknowledge I am much his for
the ſakes of ſome Friends common to him and me; which
(as no man with more veneration honours that ſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of minds, than my ſelf) doth in a manner mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ally me to him, and makes me deſirous to flatter my
ſelf, that the agreeing in a third, should make us not diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
amongſt our ſelves. All theſe motives give him no
mean place in my thoughts, and eſteem: yet all theſe
temporall conſiderations vanish, and he ſtraight becomes
again indifferent to me, when a quarrell about Eternity
of mankind's bliſſe or miſery is to be controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen
us; and my deemed <hi>certainty</hi> of my Cauſe, which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115675:19"/>
concludes him by conſequence <hi>certainly</hi> pernicious, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
me in Conſcience to confute, nay even diſgrace him,
as far as he shall be found the promoter of a peſtilent and
ſoul-ruining Tenet. Although I muſt confeſſe withall,
I am ſorty, that by is own fault he occaſion'd this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
engagement in me; for had there been no infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſpread, there had needed no Antidote.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid here was to ſatisfy ſome whom I
found much miſtaken in the manner how Controverſies
ought to be treated by a Catholick; not conſidering that
Courteſy is a vertue onely in fit circumſtances, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
but an impertinent flattery or affectation, and in a
ſerious controverſy about faith, whoſe both Concernment
and Certainty juſtify zeal, and make it neceſſary, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,
as for ſouldiers who are to try the field about their
Kings and Countreys intereſts, to hold their ſword in
one-hand, and hat in the other; complement, and kiſſe
their hands to one another, inſtead of ſtriking, or by any
unnaturall mixture of both make a gallant show of a
mock fight, preferring the care of court eſy before the
loſſe of their Cauſe. For the ſatisfaction of theſe I have
Apologiz'd thus far, not in relation to Mr. H. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
way to anſwer his weak proofs out of Scripture here,
were to gather by the help of an honeſt <hi>Concordance</hi> all
the harsh words in the Scriptures ſpoken by our Saviour
or his Saints, and apply them voluntarily againſt him, as
he has done againſt me; at which if he repine, then to ask,
why my interpretation should not be as valid as his.
And with good-reaſon too, should I daing him onely a
reply in this method, for why should not an anſwer of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing ſerve to a quodlibeticall objection?</p>

although thou beeſt dull or blockish, yet thou

                     </hi> &amp;c.</q> Where
we ſee.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that if S. <hi>Hierome's</hi> verdict expreſt in his own
manifold example be allowable, whom Dr. H hath
choſen for Vmpire in his matter, tis very lawfull and
fitting to give the Adverſaries of Faith their full deſert in
controverſies concerning Faith, and not to ſpare them as
long as the truth of their faultineſſe can juſtify the rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
expreſſions. Neither let Dr. H. objet that I beg the
queſtion, in ſuppoſing him an Adverſary of the true faith:
for to put the matter indifferently, and ſo as may pleaſe
even the Proteſtants them ſelves, either Dr. H's cauſe is
falſe, and then 'tis laudable to uſe zeal againſt him, who
perniciouſly endeavours to mantain a falſehood; or elſe it
is true, &amp; then he deſerves as great a reprehenſion who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes
his cauſe by going about to defend it by ſuch wilfull
falſifications, and ſo many frauds and weakneſſes, as he
hath been diſcovered. Whence it appears that the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Reader is not to conſider at all, whether the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ſound harshly or no, but whether they be true or
no; for if they be, then that perſon will be found in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115675:21"/>
to deſerve reprehenſion, be the cauſe he defends true
or falſe, if he defend it either ſenſeleſly or inſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe harsh expreſſions of S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> being
due to Dr. H's forefather <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> for denying vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to holy Reliques, are due likewiſe upon that onely
ſcore to Dr. H. and the Proteſtant writers, who deny the
ſame Point: what then may we imagine the Proteſtants
deſerve for filling up the meaſure of their forefathers
ſinnes, by denying the onely certain Rule of Faith, Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Tradition, the former governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God's Church,
almoſt all the Sacraments, and many other moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
points beſides, and of much greater concernment
than is this of venerating holy Reliques?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Reader shall find no where in <hi>Schiſm
Diſarm'd</hi> ſuch harsh language given to Dr. H. or which
(if taken in it's own nature (ſounds ſo contumeliouſly as
this of S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> againſt <hi>Vigilantius</hi> is; <hi>frantick fellow,
monſter, prodigious monſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> poſſeſt with the Devill,
poſſeſt with an unclean Spirit, ſnake, famous for wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
blockhead,</hi> &amp;c. My harsheſt words in compariſon
of theſe are moderate and ciuil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mine are ſmiling Ironies,
his are ſtern and bitter Sarcaſmes, and if I whipt Dr. H.
gently with <hi>rods,</hi> S. <hi>Hierome</hi> wihpt his forefather <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius</hi>
with <hi>Scorpions.</hi> Whence followes that I am to
be thank't by Dr. H. for my moderation, not excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
for my exceſſe in reprehending him, ſince all thoſe
more ſevere expreſſions far out-vying mine, were his due
as he is in the ſame fault with <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> beſides what
accrues to him out of later titles; and this by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> the very Authour he quotes for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in this point.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what a miſerable weakneſſe is it to quote
this Father againſt me for uſing harsh language, who
himſelf uſes far harsher? which evidences that if this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115675:21"/>
authority and example be of weight in this point, as
Dr. H. grants by bringing him againſt me for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
then the roughneſſe of the language is not railing or
reprehenſible, if taken alone or abſtracted from the cauſe
(ſince Dr. H. will not ſay that this holy Father thought
that manner of language <hi>railing</hi> or reprehenſible in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf)
which showes that Dr. H's firſt Chapter, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt the words as abſtracted from the cauſe, as
much accuſes S. <hi>Hierome</hi> as me; nay much more, as his
words expreſt more fully his juſtly-cauſed zeal, than my
more moderate pen did.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, abſtracting from the cauſe, and impugning
the manner of expreſſion onely, as Dr. H. does, who ſees
not that the Heretick <hi>Vigilantius</hi> might with the ſame
reaſon as he, have entitled the firſt Chapter of his Reply
to S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in the like manner as he did, to wit thus,
Of <hi>Hieroms</hi> ſtyle and contumelies: <q>The Scriptures, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
on <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; the Character belonging thereto?</q>
Then in the Chapter it ſelf have call'd S <hi>Hierome's</hi> plain
diſcovery of his faults, <hi>ſcoffes</hi> and <hi>contumelies,</hi> have told
him that he had <hi>juſt title to the ſcorners chair,</hi> that his
writing againſt him, was like <q>Goliahs curſing of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Rabshakels</hi> reproaches againſt Iſrael, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
had long ago pronounced ſentence againſt him,
that none should eat with him, that he was in reality no
Chriſtian, a deteſtable perſon, faln under the cenſures of
the Church, <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate, in a ſpeciall ſort
one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, unrighteous, that he shall not inherit
the Kingdome of Heaven, that this was the very Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
which the Iewes uſed toward the true Prophets of
God, that it is againſt the practice of S. <hi>Michael</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſpirit of weekneſſe, peace and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp;c.</q> As if every heretick, nay every malefactour in
the world, could not ſay the ſame to their juſt reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and punishers: or as if peace and long-ſuffering were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115675:22"/>
to be uſed at all times, even when we ſee we ſuffer
divine Truth to be injurd, and ſouls run headlong and
blind to Hell after ſuch blind guides. Every one, Mr. H.
can preach patience, peace and long ſuffering, quote ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
intermix Greek words pedantically; but none can
ſpeak ſenſe but they who have truth on their ſide. It muſt
be judged then by the ſtrength of the reaſons you bring
to clear your ſelves from ſchiſm, whether you deſerved
thoſe reprehenſions from your Adverſary or no, and not
from what your quodlibeticall vein can preach to us.
And till you bring evident ones, I shall ever think that
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> (your own Authours here) preacht as good
doctrine as you in a place lately cited, when he told us
with many inſtances that <hi>non eſt crudelitas pro Deo pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, what is it to me that <hi>S. Hierome</hi> noted it as
an errour in <hi>Helvidius, that he took railing for eloquence,</hi>
unleſſe he can prove that I took it ſo too? He knowes
I pretend that juſtice, truth, and the neceſſity of my
cauſe, warranted, nay obliged me to be ſo plain with him.
I pretend no <hi>Eloquence</hi> in an ordinary controverſy; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did I think that confuting Dr. H. would be ſuch a
rare buſineſſe, that it would be worth the pains of a rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall
filing.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to shew more and more the weakneſſe of this
Dr. S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> words of <hi>Helvidius</hi> are theſe; <hi>loqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatem
facundiam exiſtimat,</hi> he thinks <hi>babling to be elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi>
But the good Dr. whom any ſemblance of a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
contents, conſtrues <hi>loquacitas</hi> (wordishneſs) to
be <hi>railing;</hi> as if empty pulpit-beatres, who talk two
hours without a word of ſolidneſſe, were therefore all
<hi>railers.</hi> I doubt that ere we come to an end of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
<hi>Loquacity,</hi> that is, voluntary talking wordishly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſyllable of ſenſe, will be ſo perfectly shown to be
D. H's proper and peculiar fault, that his own words
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115675:22"/>
will evince it without the help of Saint <hi>Hierome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus hath Dr. H. ſped in quoting this holy, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and truly zealous Father for the Patron of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
courte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I once hoped Mr. H. and I should have parted very
good Friends from this firſt <hi>Section,</hi> notwithſtanding
the contumelies which, contrary to his own grounds, he

I gave of the rudeneſſe of my blowes;</hi> which though
ſufficiently cleared already, yet I think my ſelf obliged
to my cauſe, to take notice of this <hi>methodicall charity</hi> &amp;
<hi>convincing reaſon</hi> that the Reader may ſee what weak

by his <hi>methodicall Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In my Epiſtle to the Reader, to render him account
why the civility of mine adverſary should not hinder me
from giving him his own, if the care of an eternall good
injured by him, intereſſed my zeal to lay him open, I
propoſed theſe two parallell queſtions. <hi>How would you
take it if one should ſpit in your face, and juſtify the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
becauſe his breath is ſweet? or what would you ſay
to him that ruines your eſtate by Periury, and defends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he held up his hands and eyes to heaven, and
ſwore demurely? Whatever anſwer you give, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it will perfectly clear my behaviour towards the</hi> Dr.
<hi>with whom I should have very little contention, were the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115675:24"/>
difference between us in any thing of leſſe concernment
than Eternity</hi> Where any man, that is not more then
half-aſſeep, may ſee the meaning is plainly this; that as
the alledging that the breath is ſweet juſtifies not the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
of ſpitting in ones face, nor the pretence of ſwearing
demurely, the wrong of ruining ones eſtate by perjury:
ſo neither does Dr. H's civility in his former Treatiſe of
Schiſm, juſtify or excuſe him for abuſively treating mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of ſuch concernments as Eternity, nor conſequently
could his courteous ſtile oblige S. W. to treat him tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and favourably, whom the weightieſt and worthieſt
Cauſe had more prowerfully pre-obliged to lay him open
plainly.</p>
               <p>This being then moſt evidently the ſenſe of that place,
let us ſee whether Dr. H's witts were well awake, or his
<hi>charity</hi> very <hi>methodicall,</hi> when he anſwered them. He
neither goes about to grant or deny the invalidity of thoſe
pretended excuſes: which onely was to be done: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
thereof makes a piece of a ſermon to you, very Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly
telling you how you ought to behave your ſelf, in
caſe you receive a private affront, and then being got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Common-place of ſuffering injuries patiently, he
runs diviſion upon that ground, with Greek and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
telling us that <hi>we muſt turn the other cheek to him that
ſtrikes us on the right,</hi> that we muſt <hi>pray forthem that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitefully
uſe us, fraternally admonish,</hi> &amp;c. and then layes
it to S. W's conſcience. In return I appeal to his Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
and reaſon both, whether all this be any thing to this
queſtion, whether the ſweetneſſe of the breath juſtify the
affront of ſpitting in ones face, or civil language ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excuſe pernicious doctrine.</p>
               <p>His anſwer to the ſecond is yet more pleaſant. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of telling us whether ſwearing demurely be any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for perjury, ſo as to ſecure it from the punishment or
treaty which otherwiſe might iuſtly be given it, he tells us
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115675:24"/>
in good ſober ſadneſſe, that a <hi>man may uſe all lawfull
means to defend his eſtate and diſcover perjury,</hi> and blames
me for accuſing him of <hi>perjurious tampering;</hi> and that I
<hi>might as truly have ſaid that he offered ſacrifice to Idols, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with Necromencers,</hi> &amp;c. which ſuperadds to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
errour, that he miſtakes the compariſon or ſimilitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
for the thing it is brought to parallel or reſemble; and
by his own litterall acception of it, will needs accuſe him
ſelf of perjury whether S. W. will or no. And are not the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
pretty miſtakes?</p>
               <p>Yet theſe are not all, there is yet another behind grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than all the reſt, if that may be call'd a miſtake which
ſprung from the Will, and can hardly be father'd upon
the weakeſt Vnderſtanding: I made it my onely plea to
the Reader for ſome blowes of mine, which he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
too rude, that our controverſy was about <hi>things
concerning mens eternall ſalvation;</hi> and therefore the
Reader knowing that I (as all Catholicks do) hold my
Faith certain, he had no reaſon to expect I should favour
an Opponent in an act of ſuch a nature, as is publickly
harmfull to men's ſoules; hence I ended my firſt para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,
that <hi>I would have very litle contention with him,
were the difference between us in any thing of leſſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than Eternity;</hi> and the whole ſecond paragraph
proceeds upon the ſame ground. Now the Dr. in his
Anſwer, where he pretends my <hi>conviction,</hi> takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of my plea, but leaves out the end of the firſt para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
now cited, to which the two parallel queſtions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and to which they ought to be applyed; transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the matter from the publick injury to men's ſoules,
to the caſe of a private injury of one ſingle Chriſtian to
another: whereas our queſtion is not whether if one ſtrike
one on the right cheek, according to Chriſt's law, he muſt
turn the other; but whether if a man be certainly held to
have ruin'd ſome ſoules eternally, Chriſt bids us let him
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115675:25"/>
mine more; or whether, if the wolf worry ſome sheep,
the shepheard ought to give him more? if not, then
whether courteſy ought to have place towards ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer
of ſoules in thoſe very writings with which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
it, or rather whether it be not an obligation
to shew it home what he is, as far as his faultineſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
good the truth of the words? This anſwer of his the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
is either totally impertinent to my queſtion; or el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
the application of it muſt force this inference; Chriſt
bid us turn the left cheek to him that ſtrikes us on the
right, therefore if a perverter of ſoules carry one to hell,
reſiſt him not, but let him carry more; or if a robber
climbe in to the fold, and kill one sheep, a good Chriſtian
ought in conſcience rather than be diſcourteous yield him
another. Is not this ſtrange Logick? but that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
will in part juſtify it.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible one should trip ſo often in running over
a litle leaf of paper almoſt as intelligible as legible? Yet
we have not done ſo: followes in the Dr's <hi>Aſwer</hi> p. 7.

                  </q> Where
you ſee Mr. H. makes account that the <hi>abuſive treating
matters of Religion,</hi> which is able to plunge millions of
ſoules into eternal damnation, is of leſſe moment then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
againſt one's <hi>temporall eſtate:</hi> though one who had
never read Dr. H. would ſurely think that the charge of
abuſive treating matters of religion, being a buſineſſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching
upon eternity, is much more <hi>robuſt,</hi> (as he calls
it) than that of ruining a temporall eſtate by perjury; ſince
I think there is no good Chriſtian but holds the eternall
loſſe of one ſoul redeemed with Chriſt's moſt precious
bloud, is of more worth than all the temporall riches this
world can boaſt of. Is this man fit to have the charge
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115675:25"/>
of ſouls, who profeſſes to ſet more by his temporal than
their eternal felicity? yet this is the <hi>method of Charity</hi> he
promiſed us in the beginning of this Section. It ſeems that

is in</hi> S. W. <hi>a tranſgreſſion of the rules of Art as well as Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
no other than the meaneſt begging the queſtion, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which he was to prove, to aſſume ſo early in the
Epiſtle to the Reader what he muſt (but hath not yet ſo much
as attempted to) demonſtrate.</hi> Where note firſt that Dr. H.
would have us believe, he made account that the Epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
to the Reader is to be writ by the Authour before he
writes the book; though other men uſe to make it their
laſt task: next, he pretends that S. W. who was to <hi>anſwer</hi>
his book, ought to <hi>prove</hi> and <hi>demonſtrate,</hi> that is, <hi>oppoſe</hi>
and <hi>object:</hi> which are two very good counterfeited and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
miſtakes; for I should be loath to wrong his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo much as to think he meant them ſeriouſly.
Theſe two artleſs ſuppoſitions without doubt proceeded
from the ſame <hi>method</hi> he promiſed us in the beginning of
the Section.</p>
               <p>The Reader may perceive by this what a pittifull ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
Dr. H. would be, if S. W. should take the paines
to diſſect his book, and show how all the Anatomy of
his reaſon is compoſed of ſuch weakneſſes; every Section
being very pregnant and full of them: but they are in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
books ſwell'd to ſuch a formidable number, that they
both deterre him from that leſſe neceſſary task, and he
feares alſo leſt they might cloy the Reader with their too-Comick
relation.</p>
               <p>His third Section maintains, his ſelf-bred perſuaſion
that (<hi>Anſw. p. 8.) the Authour of the Epiſtle from Brux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115675:26"/>
was the Penman of at leaſt the firſt part of Schiſm
Diſarm'd;</hi> and his firſt argument to prove it, is the
<hi>kindneſs Schiſm Diſarm'd shows to that Epiſtle,</hi> affording
it a very large Encomium, which he here puts down. So
that firſt <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd</hi> muſt be ſuppos'd to be writ
by the Authour of the <hi>Apology for Tradition</hi> becauſe he
finds there the ſaid Apology highly commended; and
then ſtraight he concludes from the ſame argument that
the Epiſtle from <hi>Bruxells</hi> is the ſame Authour's alſo, and
theſe poſitions muſt onely hang together by the neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty
of that worthy perſon's praiſing himſelf. If this be not
to profeſs courteſy openly, and yet ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ily to practice the
height of diſcourteſy, I profeſs myſelf much to ſeek in
underſtanding the notions of either. But why is he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
the Penman of but at leaſt the firſt part of <hi>Schiſm
Diſarm'd?</hi> Is not <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd</hi> all the ſame ſtyle, or
is it at all like the ſtyle of the Catholick Gentleman's
Letter? Sure, no man who ever underſtood what a ſtyle
mean't can conjecture either, unleſs he had wifully a
mind to calumniate without any ground of reaſon.</p>
               <p>His ſecond argument to prove the Authour of both
Treatiſes the ſame, is the <hi>affinity between them;</hi> ſo that
all Ariſtotelians and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> all Platoniſts and <hi>Plato</hi>
muſt be concluded to be one and the ſame Authour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the <hi>affinity</hi> between their writings, I conceived
the grounds of that Epiſtle ſo well layd, that I could
not in reaſon recede from them, and lay others of mine
own; nor did I diſown, but rather expreſs my behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingneſs
to it, and shall endeavour to requite the favour
by vindicating it from his <hi>Reply</hi> as far as it concernes us
joyntly: nor am I much afraid that Dr. H. tells us
here, <hi>it is certain that he hath made a reply to it all;</hi>
knowing well how many books are called <hi>Replyes</hi> and
<hi>Anſwers,</hi> which yet need never anſwer to thoſe names.
The deaf Country-maid who being ask't which was the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115675:26"/>
way to <hi>London,</hi> replyed, <hi>a poak full of plums,</hi> gave an
anſwer; but it is another queſtion whether that anſwer
were either pertinent or ſatisfactory. As for the Authour
of that Epiſtle, he needs trouble himſelf no further: it
was writ by one of M. H's old acquaintance, who was
willing to honour his book of Schiſm, by showing that
he thought it worth the leaſt ſtrictures of his learned
pen.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reply</hi> to the Catholick Gentleman conſiſted of
165. pages, this <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd</hi> of 303.
yet this latter (<hi>Anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p.</hi> 9.) he calls an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the
former, and <hi>gleaning after the rake:</hi> as if <hi>Appendixes</hi>
uſed to be twice as big as the principal; or that husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
uſed to rake armefulls, and leave cart-loads to be
gleaned. However he shall ſee, I hope, ere we come to
an end of this Treatiſe of mine, how ill he hath husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his reaſon, both in taking and gleaning. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
that I took no notice of his Reply in my book,
objecting that I <hi>had time to have done ſo, and that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
apprehend my retirement or imployment ſo ſtrict, as not
to hear of it,</hi> is onely his miſ-apprehenſion; ſince I aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
him <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd</hi> was out of my hands, long ere
his Reply to the <hi>Catholik Gentleman</hi> came abroad; nor
was I in ſuch circumſtances as to ſee his Reply, till my
own was already printed, as all who are acquainted with
me and my occaſions can teſtify: ſo thar Mr. H. should
not have concluded I had time to have taken notice of
it without certainty of the thing; and may learn hence
how many things may be true, which he cannot <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</hi>
He shall never find me unwilling to take notice of
any thing he writes in favour of his cauſe; if I conceive it
likely to endamage the dear ſouls of my Brethren and
Countrymen.</p>

               <p>BEfore we come to cloſe ſeriouſly with Mr. H. becauſe
the ſumme of his art conſiſts in blundering the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
truths with multitudes of wordish evaſions, I thought
fitting to lay down in moſt manifeſt and evident termes
ſome Grounds which were moſt pertinent to our future
diſcourſe, and ſome deductions emergent thence; by
the bare poſition and explication of which, I doubt not
to gain ſo far upon the rational Reader, that he shall
confeſs he ſees the queſtion truly ſtated, and according
to plain reaſon reſolved: and if he carries theſe notions
along with him with cautious and diligent reflection, he
shall find no difficulty in any main point which concerns
this preſent Controverſy.</p>
               <p>The firſt Ground then shall be this, that <hi>The firſt
pretenders to reform in the point of the Popes Authority
in England, found England actually ſubiect to that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in Eccleſiaſtical matters.</hi> This Ground carries
it's Evidence in it's own terms; ſince they could not
be truly called the firſt Reformers from it, unleſs befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
that Authority had been there acknowledged. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters it when and by whom this Reformation be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gun,
ſince ſtill the Ground now layd ſtands firm; for the
very word <hi>Reformation</hi> (which they pretend) argues
that <hi>tenet</hi> was held before Hence all the evaſions in
Dr. H. are concluded vain; who, when we plead that
the Pope was found in poſſeſſion of this Authority in
<hi>England,</hi> flies off preſently, and denies it, ſaying he had
no title to ſuch an Authority there: whereas when we
maintain his poſſeſſion, we pretend not yet a Right
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115675:27"/>
(which is our inference thence) but that actually <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was under ſuch an Authority, and acknowledg'd it;
whether it were rightly pretended or injuſtly remains to
be inferred: which the Dr. miſtaking, and not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
between <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> ſayes we beg the
queſtion; when we onely take what is evident, that he
was in poſſeſſion, and thence infer a right, until the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
be proved.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Ground is, that <hi>This Authority actually
over England, and acknowledged there, was acknowledged
likewiſe to be that of the Head of the Vniverſal Church, and
not of a Patriarchate onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> This Ground is no leſs evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
than the former, by our adverſaries confeſſion; ſince
this is the Authority they impugn as unlawfull, and from
which they reformed; which laſt word implies the actual
acknowledgment that Authority had before. Hence
Mr. H's digreſſion, to show that Kings could erect and
tranſlate Patriarchates, was perfectly frivolous, as far as
concerns this purpoſe: for whether they can change Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchates
or no is impertinent, when we are queſtioning
an Authority above Patriarchs and pretended to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>The third Ground is, that <hi>This Papal Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
over the Eccleſiaſtical affaires in England was held
then as of Chriſt's Inſtitution, and to have been derived to
the Pope, as he was Succeſſour to S. Peter.</hi> The truth of this
appears by the known confeſſion of the then <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, and the ſelf-ſame Controverſy perpetually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
till this day.</p>
               <p>The fourth Ground is that <hi>This actual power the Pope
then had in England, had been of long continuance, and
ſettled in an ancient Poſſeſſion.</hi> This is evinced both from
our Adverſaries grant, the evidence of the fact it ſelf, and
even by the carriage of S. <hi>Auſt in</hi> the Monk, and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of <hi>Bangor,</hi> expreſt in that counterfeited teſtimony al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115675:28"/>
by Dr. H. whence we ſee it was the doctrine S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
taught the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth Ground shall be, that <hi>No Poſſeſſion ought
to be diſturbed without ſufficient motives and reaſons: and
conſequently it ſelf is a title, till thoſe reaſons invalidate
it, and show it null.</hi> This is evident firſt by Nature's
Principles, which tell us there is no new cauſe requiſite
for things to remain as they are; wheras, on the other ſide,
nothing can be changed, without ſome cauſe actually wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and of force proportionable to the weight and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tledneſs
of the thing to be moved. Secondly by Morals,
which teach us that mans underſtanding cannot be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from any opinion or beleef, without motives; ought
not, without ſufficient ones; and conſequently needs no
new motive to continue it in any former aſſent, beſides
the foregoing Cauſes which put it there. Thirdly, we
find that Politicks give teſtimony to, or rather ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Ground; aſſuring us when any Government is
quietly ſettled, it ought ſo to ſtand till ſufficient motives,
and reaſons in Policy, that is a greater common good,
urge a change. And if Poſſeſſion were held no title, then
the Welshmen might ſtill pretend to command <hi>England,</hi>
and each line or race, which preceded and was outed,
quarrel with any ſubſequent one though never ſo long ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled,
and ſo no certain right at all would be found of any
poſſeſſion in the World, till we come to <hi>Adam</hi>'s time.
Fourthly, as for the particular Laws of our Countrey, they
clearly agree in the ſame favour for Poſſeſſion. I shall
onely inſtance in one common caſe. If I convey <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

to <hi>I. S.</hi> for the life of <hi>I. N.</hi> and after wards <hi>I. S.</hi>
dy, in this caſe, becauſe I cannot enter againſt mine own
Grant, and all the world elſe have equal title, whoever
firſt enters into the land is adjudged the true and rightfull
Owner of it during the life of <hi>I. N.</hi> and that by the ſole
title of Occupancy, as they call it, which they wholly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115675:28"/>
ground upon this known reaſon, that in equality of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
Poſſeſſion ſtill caſts the ballance. Nay ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
is given by our Law to Poſſeſſion, that were the
right of a former Title never ſo evident, yet a certain time
of peaceable Poſſeſſion undiſturb'd by the contrary claim,
would abſolutely bar it. And here I should take my ſelf
obliged to ask my Adverſary's pardon, for uſing ſuch
words as a Dr. of Divinity is not preſumed to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with, did not his own Example at leaſt excuſe, if not
provoke my imitation. Thus much of the force of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
in general, without deſcending to the nature of
ours in particular, that is, of ſuch a Poſſeſſion as is juſtly
preſumable to have come from <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence followes, that, ſince Poſſeſſion of Authority
muſt ſtand till ſufficient Reaſons be alledged that it was
unjuſt, thoſe Motives and Reaſons ought to be weighed,
whether they be ſufficient or no, ere the Authority can be
rejected: wherefore ſince the relinquishing any Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
actually in power before, makes a <hi>material</hi> breach
from that Government; the deciding the queſtion onely
ſtands in examining thoſe Reaſons which oppoſe its law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
ſince the ſufficiency of them cleares the breakers,
the inſufficiency condemns them, and in our caſe makes
the <hi>material</hi> Schiſm <hi>formal.</hi> Let the Reader then judge
how little adviſed Dr. H. was in ſtating the queſtion right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and clearly (<hi>of Schiſm pag</hi> 10.) where he tells us that
<hi>the motives are not worth he eding</hi> in this controverſy, but
onely <hi>the truth of the matter of fact.</hi> For the matter of fact,
to wit, that there was then an actual Government, and
that they broke from it, being evident to all the world,
and confeſt by themſelves; if there be no reaſons to be
examined, he is convinced by his own words to be a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,
ſo flatly and palpably, that it is left impoſſible
for him even to pretend a defence.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Ground shall be, that <hi>Such a Poſſeſſion as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115675:29"/>
that of the Pope's Authority in England was held, ought not
to be changed or rejected upon any leſſer motives or reaſons,
than rigorous and moſt manifeſt Evidence that it was uſurp't.</hi>
The reaſons for this are fetch't by parity from that which
went before &amp; onely the proportions added. For in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Body in nature, the force of the cauſe muſt be
proportion'd to the gravity, ſettledneſs, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal
impediments of the Body to be moved, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
nothing is done. In morals, the motives of diſſent
ought to be more powerfull than thoſe for the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in aſſent, otherwiſe a ſoul as a ſoul (thas is, as
rational) is not, or ought not to be moved: and ſo in the
reſt. Now that nothing leſs than Evidence, rigorouſly
and perfectly ſuch, can juſtify a rejecting of that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
is thus show'd. That Authority was held as of Faith,
and to have been conſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own mouth; it
had been acknowledgedly accounted for ſuch by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of pious &amp; learned men for many ages before, &amp; in
all Chriſtian Countries of the Communion of the Roman
Church, whereof <hi>England</hi> was one. It claimed Vniuerſal
Tradition for it's tenour, an Authority held of great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
by our very Adverſaries: the rejecting it, if ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
was known to be an hainous Schiſm, and to unknit
the whole frame of the Churche's preſent Government;
which by conſequence muſt render it in an high degree
damnable to thoſe who should go about to violate it.</p>
               <p>Now then let us conſider whether a Reaſon in it's own
nature <hi>probable</hi> (for except rigorous Evidence no reaſon
can be more) and no way in it's ſelf obliging the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to aſſent, be a ſufficient and ſecure motive to
reject an Authority of ſo long continuance, held ſacred,
and of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution, of ſuch importance to the
peace of the Church, in rejecting which if one happen
to miſtake, he is liable to the horrid vice of Schiſm, and
it's condign punishment, eternal damnation. It muſt then
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115675:29"/>
be moſt pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fect demonſtrative Evidence, ſuch as forces
the underſtanding to aſſent, which can in common pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
engage a man to hazard his ſalvation by renouncing
that Authority. Let Dr. H. then remember that they
muſt be ſuch kind of Evidences which can ſerve his turn;
not any ordinary, common ſleight teſtimony-proofs,
which for the moſt part arrive not to the pitch of a poor
probability in them ſelves, but compar'd to the tenour of
our Government, Vniverſal Tradition, vanish into aire;
or, which is leſs, into nothing.</p>
               <p>To make this yet clearer, let us ſuppoſe (as it happens
in our caſe) that they who began to reform in this point
firſt, and to deny the lawfulneſs of this Authority, were
bred up formerly in a contrary belief, ortherwiſe they muſt
have received it from their Fathers, which would quite
ſpoil the ſuppoſition of being the firſt Reformers: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it likely that multitudes began to think or ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it all in one inſtant, but either one or ſome few
chief, who propagated it by ſuggeſting it to the reſt. Now
then let us conſider what motives are ſufficient to oblige
theſe men to this new-begun disbelief and diſobedience,
ſo as to abſolve them even in common prudence from a
moſt ſelf-conceited pride, and deſperate precipitancy.</p>
               <p>In prejudice of them is objected, that heretofore they
held that forme of Government as of Faith, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to receive it upon the ſame ſole certain Rule of
Faith which aſſured them that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was God: the
whole Church they left had confeſſedly for ſome ages
held the ſame, ſo that it was now found in quiet Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
If they were learned, they could not but in ſome
meaſure penetrare the force of Vniverſal Tradition, which
ſtood againſt them in this point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince orall Tradition) of
which we ſpeak (was pleaded by Catholicks for this point,
but never ſo much as pretented by the ſeparaters againſt
it; becauſe Reformation in a point of Faith, and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115675:30"/>
of it deſtroy one the other. In a word, should all
theſe moſt ponderous Conſiderations be waved, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Authority of the Church they left conſider'd, t'is
impoſſible they should reform, unleſs they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
millions of Doctours which had been in the Church,
many of them reverenced even yet by the Proteſtants for
their admirable learning, to be ignorant in compariſon of
themſelves; or elſe all inſincere, and to have wronged
their Conſcience in holding and teaching againſt their
knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now let any ingenuous perſon conſider whether ſuch a
ſtrange ſelf-extolling judgment, and condemning others,
ought in reaſon be made by a few men againſt the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
moſt important motives, without a moſt undeniable
and open Evidence, able to demonſtrate palpably and
convincingly that this pretended Government was unjuſt
and uſurp't. And if the firſt Reformers could have no juſt
and lawfull, that is, evident Ground to begin their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to that Government, neither can their Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes
and Succeſſours the Proteſtanrs have any pretence
for continuing it; ſince in matters belonging to Eternity,
whoſe nature is unchangeable by the occurrence of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
circumſtances, none can lawfully adhere to that
which could never lawfully be begun: Neither are there
any proofs againſt that Authority producible now, which
were not producible then.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh ground is, that <hi>No Evidence can poſſibly
be given by the Proteſtants obliging the underſtanding to
beleeve that this Authority was uſurp't.</hi> This is proved
by the caſe of the firſt Reformers now explicated, whoſe
words could not in any reaſon be imagin'd <hi>evident</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch an univerſall Verdict of the whole Church they
left, and particularly of all the learned men in it, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
and confeſſedly more numerous, and as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as any have been ſince. Yet we shall further evince it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115675:30"/>
thus. They pretend not to any <hi>evidence</hi> from natural
Principles concluding demonſtratively that the former
Government was uſurp't<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor yet from oral Tradition,
ſince their immediate Forefathers deliver'd them other
doctrine, elſe the Reformation could never have begun,
againſt our common Suppoſition. Their Grounds then
muſt be teſtimonial proofs from Scriptures, Fathers, or
Councils. But ſince theſe are moſt manifeſtly liable to
be interpreted divers ways (as appears <hi>de facto</hi>) no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
aſſurance can be pretended hence, without eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
either more skill to fetch out their certain ſenſe, or
more ſincerity to acknowledge what they knew, than
was found in the Church they left: a task I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
few will undertake, I am confident none can perform;
ſince all the world knows, that the vaſt number of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and learned Doctors we have had in the proceſs of
ſo many ages, and extent of ſo many Countries, were
perſons not meanly vers't in Scriptures, Fathers &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills,
&amp; yet held all theſe moſt conſonant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to the Catholick
doctrine, though the polemical vein of the Schools, which
left nothing not throughly ventilated, gave them am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
occaſion to look into them. Adde to this, that our
late Doctors and Controvertiſts have not feared nor neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to anſwer all thoſe teſtimonies, and produce a far
greater number out of all the ſaid Authorities; nor have
they behaved themſelves ſo in thoſe conflicts, that the
indifferent part of the world have held them non-ſenſical,
which ſurely they would, had they deemed the other a
perfect and rigorous Evidence.</p>
               <p>From hence followes, that, though they may blunder
and make a show with teſtimonies, yet in reality they can
never produce ſufficient, that is <hi>evident</hi> reaſons thence, for
rejecting a Government qualify'd with ſo many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to confirm and eſtablish it. Though I muſt confeſs,
if they could demonſtrate by evident and unavoidable
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115675:31"/>
connexion of termes from ſome undeniable authority that
this Government was unjuſt, their Vnderſtandings would
in that caſe be obliged to aſſent to that inference: But
this is not to be hoped, as long as divers words have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ſignifications, as divers Sentences by reference to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others put on different faces, or by relation to ſeveral
circumſtances in hiſtory give us occaſion to raiſe ſeveral
conjectures. Again, if <hi>Evidence</hi> were eaſily producible
from ſuch kind of wordish teſtimonies, yet they would ſtill
be as far to ſeek for an Authority whence to alledge thoſe
teſtimonies, comparable to that of the Church they left;
ſince they can never even pretend to show any company
of men ſo incomparably numerous, ſo unqueſtionably
learned, holding certainly, as of Faith, and as received
from the Apoſtles, that Government which they impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned,
and this ſo conſtantly for ſo many hundred years, ſo
unanimouſly and univerſally in ſo many Countries where
knowledge moſt flourish't, teſtifying the ſame alſo in their
General Councels: all which by their own aknowleged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was found in the Church they left.</p>
               <p>The eihtgh Ground is, that <hi>The proofs alledged by
Proteſtants againſt us bear not even the weight of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
to any prudent man who penetrates and conſiders
the contrary motives.</hi> For the proofs they alledge are te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies,
that is words capable of divers ſenſes, as they
shall be diverſely play'd upon by wits, Scholars, and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
and it is by experience found that generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
their party and ours give ſeverall meanings to all the
Teſtimonies controverted between us. Now it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that computing the vaſtnefs of the times and places
in which our Profeſſion hath born ſway, we have had
near a thouſand Doctors for one of the Proteſtants; who,
though they ever highly venerated, and were well verſed
in all the Ancient Fathers and Councells, yet expreſt no
difficulty in thoſe proofs, but on the contrary made cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115675:31"/>
account that all Antiquity was for them. Thus much
for their knowledge.</p>
               <p>Neither ought their ſincerity run in a leſs proportion
than their number, unleſs, the contrary could be evidently
manifeſted, which I hear not to be pretended; ſince they
are held by our very Adverſaries, and their acts declare
them to have been pious in other reſpects, and, on the
other ſide, conſidering the corruptneſs of our nature, the
prejudice ought rather to ſtand on the part of the diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
than of the obeyers of any Government. Since then
no great difficulty can be made but that we have had a
thouſand knowing men for one, and no certainty manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
nor poſſible to be manifeſted, that they were uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious,
we have had in all morall eſtimation a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
to one in the meanes of underſtanding aright theſe
teſtimonial proofs; and then I take not that to have any
morall probability which hath a thouſand to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.</p>
               <p>But I ſtand not much upon this, having a far better
game to play; I mean the force of <hi>Tradition,</hi> which is
fortify'd which ſuch and ſo many invincible reaſons, that
to lay them out at large, and as they deſerve, were to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
the <hi>Dialogues of Ruſworth,</hi> the rich Storehouſe
of them: to them I refer the Reader for as ample as ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
as even Scepticiſm can deſire, and onely make uſe
at preſent of this Conſideration; that if it be impoſſible
that all the now-Fathers of Families in the Catholick
Church, diſperſt in ſo many nations, should conſpire to tell
this palpablely to their Children, that twenty yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
ſuch a thing (viſible and practical as all points of
Faith are) was held in that Church, if no ſuch thing had
been, and that conſequently the ſame impoſſibility holds
in each twenty yeares upwards till the Apoſtles, by the
ſame reaſon by which it holds in the laſt twenty; then it
followes evidently, that what was told us to have been
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115675:32"/>
held twenty yeares agoe, was held ever, in caſe the Church
held nothing but upon this Ground, that ſo she received
or had been taught by the immediately-foregoing Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
for as long as she pretends onely to this Ground,
the difficulty is equal in each twenty yeares, that is, there
is an equal impoſſibility they should conſpire to this pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
lie. Now that they ever held to this Ground, (that
is, to the having received it from their Anceſtours,) is
manifeſted by as great an Evidence. For ſince they now
hold this Ground, if at any time they had taken it up,
they muſt either have counterfeited that they had received
it from their Anceſtours, or no. The former relapſes into
the aboveſaid impoſſibility; or rather greater, that they
should conſpire to tell a lie in the onely Ground of their
Faith, and yet hold (as they did) their Faith built upon
that Ground to be truth: the latter poſition muſt diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
it ſelf in the very termes, which imply a perfect contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
for it is as much as to ſay, nothing is to be held as
certainty of Faith, but what hath deſcended to us from
our Forefathers; and yet the onely Rule which tells us
certainly there is any thing of Faith, is newly invented.
Wherefore, unleſs this chain of Tradition be shown to
have been weak in ſome link or other, the caſe between
us is this; whether twenty teſtimonies liable to many
exceptions, and teſtify'd by experience to be diſputable
between us, can bear the force even of a probability a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the univerſal acknowledgment and teſtification of
millions and millions in any one age, in a thing viſible
and practical: To omit that we are far from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of teſtimonies to counterpoiſe, nay incomparably
over poiſe theirs. By this Ground, and the reaſon for it,
the Reader may judge what weak and trivial proofs the
beſt of Proteſtant Authours are able to produce againſt
the clear Verdict of <hi>Tradition,</hi> aſſerted to be infallible
by the ſtrongeſt ſupports of Authority and reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:115675:32"/>
To ſtop the way againſt the voluntary miſtakes of
mine Adverſary, I declare my ſelf to ſpeak here not of
written Tradition to be ſought for in the Scriptures and
Fathers, which lies open to ſo many Cavils and excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
but of oral Tradition, which (ſuppoſing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
with which it was founded, and the charge with
which it was recommended by the Apoſtles) carries in
it's own force, as apply'd to the nature of mankind, an
infallible certainty of it's lineal and never-to-be-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted

               <p>THe ninth Ground is, that, <hi>The Catholick Church
and her Champions ought in reaſon to ſtand upon Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</hi>
This is already manifeſted from the fifth Ground,
ſince Poſſeſſion is of it's ſelf a title, till ſufficient motives
be produced to evidence it an uſurpation; as hath there
been shown. By this appears the injuſtice of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
who would have it thought reaſonable, that we
should ſeem to quit our beſt tenour, Poſſeſſion atteſted
by Tradition, and fall upon the troubleſome and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
method of citing Authours, in which they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of none but whom they liſt; and, after all our pains
and quotations, directly refuſe to ſtand to their judgment:
as may be ſeen in the <hi>Proteſtant's Apology;</hi> in which
by the Proteſtant's own confeſſions the Fathers held tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
opinions, which they object to us for errours.</p>
               <p>The tenth Ground is, that, <hi>In our Controverſies about
Religion, reaſon requires that we should ſuſtain the part
of the Defendant, they of the Opponent.</hi> This is already
ſufficiently proved, ſince we ought to ſtand upon the title
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115675:33"/>
of Poſſeſſion, as a Ground beyond all arguments, untill
it be convinced to be <hi>malae fidei,</hi> which is impoſſible;
they, to produce ſufficient arguments that it was unjuſt:
that is, they muſt oppoſe or object, we defend; they
ought to argue, we to anſwer. Hence appeares how
meanly skill'd Dr. H. is in the art of diſputing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
many times in his laſt Book that I bring no Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
out of Antiquity, and that I do not prove things
in my <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd;</hi> whereas that Treatiſe being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for an Anſwer to his Book of Schiſm, had no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to prove my tenet, but onely to show that his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
were unconcluſive. Hence alſo is diſcover'd how
manifeſtly weak and ridiculous Mr. H. was in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of the moſt ſubſtantial Chapter of his book of
<hi>Schiſm,</hi> where hemakes account he hath evidence S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
had not the Keyes given him particularly, by ſolving
our places of Scripture for that <hi>tenet:</hi> where (beſides other

for the contrary; whereas the force of ſuch a ſolution is

                  </gap>fferent whether the thing in it ſelf be ſo or no, or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
deducible from ſome other Argument. Thirdly,
he falſly ſuppoſes that we build our Faith upon thoſe
places of the written words, as explicable by wit, not by
Tradition, and the practiſe of our Church, whereas we
onely own the delivery from father to ſon as the Ground
of all our belif, and make this the onely Rule by which
to explicate Scripture. However ſome Doctors of ours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detrake

I know Mr. H. will object that all this time I have
pleaded for him, whiles I went about to ſtrengthen the
title of Poſſeſſion; ſince they are at preſent in actual Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of their Independency from the Pope: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that in all the conſequences following thence I have
but plow'd his ground with mine own heifer. But the
Reader may pleaſe to conſider, that, though I ſpoke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of Poſſeſſion in general and abſtractedly, yet, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
to particular ſorts of Poſſeſſions, we muſt take
along with us thoſe particular circumſtances which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
accompany them, and deſign them to be ſuch.
Since then it were unworthy the wiſdom of the Eternal
Father, that our Bleſſed Saviour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> coming to
plant à Church, should not provide for it's Being and
Peace, which confiſt in Order and Government; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that <hi>Chriſt</hi> inſtituted the Government of the
Church. In our caſe then the Poſſeſſion of Government
muſt be ſuch a Poſſeſſion, as may be preſumable to have
come from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s time; not of ſuch an one, as every one
knows when it began. Since then it is agreed upon by all
ſides, that this preſent poſſeſſion the Proteſtants now have
of their Independency was begun lately, it is impoſſible
to preſume it to be that which was inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
unleſs they evidence the long ſettled poſſeſſion of that
Authority they renounced to have been an uſurpation;
and, on the contrary, unleſs they evidence this, that
Poſſeſſion is juſtly preſumable to have come from
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s time, the maintainers and claimers of it making
this their main tenour, that truly it came from <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
Now then ſeeing we hear no news from any good hand,
nor manifeſt tokens of the beginning of this univerſal and
proud Vſurpation, which could not in reaſon but draw af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it a train of more viſible conſequences, and be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with a multitude of more palpable circumſtances
than the renouncing it in <hi>England,</hi> which yet is moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115675:34"/>
to the whole world; again, ſince the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their own Authours about the time of it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shows that the pretended invaſion of this Authority
is not evident; hence, both for theſe and other reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
ſuch a Poſſeſſion as this, is of it's ſelf, and in it's own
nature capable of pleading to have been derived from
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, to be that Poſſeſſion which we ſpeak of:
whereas the other is diſcountenanc'd by it's confeſt and
known original, which makes it not capable of it ſelf to
pretend that <hi>Chriſt</hi> inſtituted it, unleſs it be help't out
with the additional proof, that it had been expulſed from
an ancienter Poſſeſſion by this uſurpation of the Pope. So
that, to ſay the truth, this preſent Poſſeſſion of theirs
makes nothing at all for their purpoſe, ſince it is no ways
valid, but in vertute of their evidences that the ſame Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
had been ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſetled in a long peace before our
pretended invaſion: and if they can evidence this, and
that we uſurp't, then it is needleſs, and vain to plead pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Poſſeſſion at all; ſince that Poſſeſſion which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced
to have been before ours, is queſtionleſs that which
was ſettled by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> In a word, though in humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
where Preſcription has force, we uſe to call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
when one hath enjoyed any thing for ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
time; yet in things of divine Inſtitution, againſt which
no preſcription pleads, he onely can pretend poſſeſſion of
any thing who can ſtand upon it that he had it nearer
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s time: and by conſequence, he who shall be found
to have begun it later, unleſs he can evidence that he was
driven out from an ancienter Poſſeſſion, is not, for the
preſent <hi>having</hi> ſuch a thing or Power, to be ſtyled a <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour;</hi>
but an Vſurper, an intruder, an invader, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
rebellious, and (in our caſe) Schiſmatical.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that Dr. H. rawly affirmes that the
Pope's Authority began in <hi>Phocas</hi> his time, but I hope
no Reader that cares much for his ſalvation, wil take his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115675:34"/>
word for honeſt, till he show undeniable and evident
matters of fact, concerning the beginning, progreſs, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,
abetters, oppoſers, of that newly introduc't Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Head of the Church, the writers that time
for it, or againſt it, the changes it made in the face of the
Eccleſiaſtical State, and the temporal alſo, with whoſe
intereſt the other muſt needs be enlinsk't, and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
follow'd upon thoſe changes; together with
all the circumſtances which affect viſible and extern actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
Otherwiſe, againſt the ſenſe of ſo many Nations in the
Church they left, the force of Tradition and ſo many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelihoods
prejudicing it, to tell us onely a crude Story
that is was ſo, or putting us off with three or four quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in Greek to no purpoſe, or imagining ſome chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
poſſibilities how it might have been done, hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
with the nature of mankind, is an Anſwer unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a man, much more a Doctor; and to ſay that it crep't
in inviſibily and unobſerved, as dreams do into men's
heads when they are aſleep, is the part of ſome dreaming
dull head, who never lookt into the actions and nature
of man, or compared them with the motives which should
work upon them.</p>
               <p>The eleventh Ground is, that <hi>Hiſtorical proofs which
manifeſt onely Fact, do not neceſſarily conclude a Rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t.</hi>
This is evident; Firſt, becauſe teſtimonies conclude no
more than then expreſs: but they expreſs onely the <hi>Fact:</hi>
therefore they conclude onely that the <hi>Fact</hi> was ſuch a
perſon's, not that the <hi>Right</hi> was his. Secondly, becauſe no
matter of <hi>Fact</hi> which concerns the execution of any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is ſuch, but it may be performed by another who hath
no proper <hi>Rigth,</hi> but borrows it from the delegation of
ſome other, to whom it properly belongs; as we ſee in
Vice-Roys. Thirdly, becauſe in a proceſs of fifteen or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred years it cannot be imagin'd but there should
happen ſome matters of <hi>Fact</hi> either out of ambition, inter,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115675:35"/>
eſt, ignorance, or tyranny, againſt the moſt inviolable
<hi>Right</hi> in the world; nay even ſometimes out of too much
zeal and piety, great men, if they have not diſcretion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable,
will be medling with things which do not
concern them as we ſee by daily experience. Now a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of a matter of <hi>Fact</hi> can never conclude any thing,
unleſs it be firſt manifeſted that that Act our when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to action was baſſed with none of theſe, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
himſelf by pure Reaſon; that is, unleſs it be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
that he had <hi>Right:</hi> and if teſtimonies can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
expreſſing that he had <hi>Right,</hi> it was needleſs to
ſtand alledging thoſe which expreſs't onely <hi>Fact.</hi> Frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
therefore it is to bring hiſtorical proofs of <hi>Fact</hi> upon
the ſtage, in a diſpute about <hi>Right;</hi> ſince, taken alone,
they make onely a dumb show, and can act no part in
that Controverſy: for the very alledging that ſome of
theſe faults might intervene, diſables ſuch premiſes from
inferring a <hi>Right.</hi> Neither ought Mr. H. (which, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
for want of Logick, or forgetfulneſs how men uſe to
diſpute, he is ever apt to do) exact of the Defendant a
reaſon of his denial in particular: but it is his part to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
that none of theſe defects could happen, otherwiſe his
Premiſſes of <hi>Fact</hi> hang together with his Concluſion of
<hi>Right</hi> by no neceſſity of conſequence. Let the Reader
then take notice by this plain information of reaſon, how
ſenſeleſly Dr. H. behaved himſelf in the buſineſs of ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
and tranſlating Patriarchates, and in many other
places, where from ſome particular matters of <hi>Fact</hi> he
would needs conclude a <hi>Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The twelfth Ground is, that <hi>The acceptation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
powers, and their command to the people, are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to the due and fitting execution of the Churches
Lawes; whence follows not that the Princes made thoſe
Lawes by their own Authority, but that they obey'd and
executed what the Church had order'd:</hi> For unleſs the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115675:35"/>
Churche's Ordinances should be put into temporal
laws, which oblige to their obſervance by aw and fear
of punishment, they could hardly ever find an univerſal
reception; ſince otherwiſe refractory and turbulent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
who cared not much for their obligation in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fcience,
might at pleaſure reject, diſobey, and reclame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them: which would both injure the Authority of
the Church, and ſcandalize the community of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
This therefore being of ſuch an abſolute convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for the Church, we need not wonder that the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
power (of Chriſtians) should put the Churche's orders
into temporal Laws, and execute their performance; nor
conſequently can teſtimonies of ſuch <hi>execution</hi> and laws,
prejudice the Pope'<hi>s Right,</hi> ſince Catholick Governours
do the ſelf ſame at preſent, (as far as concerns this point)
which was done then.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth Ground is, that <hi>It is granted by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
that Kings may exerciſe ſome Eccleſiaſtical Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
by the conceſſion of the Church, and yet not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
thereby the Pope's Vniverſal Paſtourship.</hi> This is
moſt viſible from the unanimous acknowledgment of all
Catholick Authours, and verifyed by divers practical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
Hence it is evident that Dr. H. muſt either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
likewiſe, that the lawfulneſs of thoſe matters of Fact
related of Kings was not originiz'd from the Churche's
precedent orders, or elſe he concludes nothing at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us. Here I deſire the Reader &amp; Mr. H. may joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take notice, that the teſtimonies himſelf alledges from
the Church in her Councils, granting this to the Secular
power, is a ſtrong prejudice againſt their ſelf-and-proper
<hi>Right;</hi> as alſo, that he hath not ſo much as attempted
to produce one Teſtimony, of any Authority, expreſſing
it to be the Right of the ſecular Magiſtrate, independent
of the Church.</p>
               <p>The fourteenth and laſt Ground is, that <hi>In caſe Scbiſm
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115675:36"/>
should invade a whole Country, it could not be expected to
have happen'd otherwiſe than D H.</hi> (of Schiſm c.) <hi>hath
deſcribed.</hi> For it is to be expected that the ſecular power
should be for it, and ſo uſe meanes to make the Clergy &amp;
Vniverſities aſſent to his novelty: otherwiſe had either the
Temporal Government awed them, the Paſtours of ſouls
conſented to inform the people right, or the Vniverſities
(the Seminaries of learning) conſpired to write againſt
that innovation, in all likehood it would have given a ſtop
to it's proceding, at leaſt have hindred it's univerſal inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Hence follows that Dr. H's narrative diſcourſe of
his Schiſm hath nothing in it to bewonder us; but rather,
that it is as plain and particular a confeſſion of the Fact,
as any penitent malefactour could make when he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to ſuffer. For, that a Nation may fall into Schiſm,
none doubts; as little, that it should fall into it by thoſe
very means, and the ſame degrees which he there layes
down. Nay more, himſelf diſgraces his own Narration
by confeſſing (p. 136.) <hi>that the Clergy were inclined to
ſubſcribe by the feare of a premunire:</hi> and the queſtion
about the Pope's Right in <hi>England</hi> being debated in the
Vniverſities, he ſayes onely p. 135. that it was <hi>generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
in the negative;</hi> (that is when the King's party pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed)
yet he omits that the Kings luſt firſt moved him
to think of Schiſmatizing, and his final repentance of that
Act; which show that the firſt ſpring which mov'd the
whole Engine was not purity of conſcience, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pureſt
and baſeſt of paſſions.</p>
               <p>The poſitions, which I have layed dow for Grounds
to our future diſcourſe, will of themſelves lay open the
whole caſe clearly to the ordinary Readers; and inform
the more prudent ones, that nothing is or can be ſayd by
Dr H. of a force and clearneſs comparable to that of our
Poſſeſſion, and that of oral Tradition, which we ever
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>laim'd for our Tenour; from which alſo they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115675:36"/>
when they reform'd in this point of the Pope's
Supremacy. So that litle more remains to be perform'd,
but to manifeſt his shallow weakneſſes, and trivial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences;
which I should willingly omit, if the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part of Readers would be as willing to think a book
fully anſwer'd, when ſubſtantial points are shown to be
nothing, as they are to catch at the shadow of words as
matters of importance, and ſo imagine nothing done, till
they alſo be reply'd upon. Nor do I fear this task, though
ingratefull in it's ſelf and leſs neceſſary, will be voyd of
fruit, ſpecially to Mr. H's Friends, who may ſee by this
Anſwer of mine, how bad that cauſe muſt be, which can
caſt ſo underſtanding a man, as ſome of them imagine
him, upon ſuch non ſenſe, weakneſſes of reaſoning, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
miſtakes, falſifications, denying his own words,
and many other ridiculous shifts, as shall be ſeen moſt
amply in the proceſs of this Treatiſe.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s reaſon which was gravelled in underſtanding

for the cauſe of it (ſuch reflections ly much out
of the way of one who gleans teſtimonies (will not give

reaſon, at an occurrence evidently new, that is, <hi>their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

and diſorderly juſtly ſtirres up <hi>admiration,</hi> what
neceſſity is there that Dr. H. and his Friends should hap

allow'd to have <hi>ſome admiration at firſt,</hi> at their myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

               <p>But he will needs undertake to allay my <hi>admiration</hi>
(though I was much better ſatisfy'd with my own reaſon
there given) by telling me, it was ſeaſonable charity to

times that number, who have skirmish't againſt us
in particular Controverſies? I hope then this will ſerve
to juſtify thoſe moderate words of mine, that <hi>they ſeem'd
more willing</hi> to that task. Yet he triumphs over me, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>it is much juſter matter of wonder to him, that S.</hi>
W. <hi>should ſet out ſo unauſpiciouſly, as to begin with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation

               <p>Yet though (ſaith he) thoſe words <hi>had been true, that
formerly the Proteſtants were more willing to skirmish in
pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>icular Controverſies, yet</hi> (Dr. H. tells us) <hi>it were
obvious to every man what might now ſuggeſt the change
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115675:38"/>
of that courſe:</hi> and what obvious reaſon might this be but
that, <hi>after particular Controverſies were competently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
to ſet the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Axe to the root of the tree, and ſtock up
Rome's univerſal Paſtourship and infallibility?</hi> Where he
ſees not that the queſtion remains ſtill to be ask't, why

themſelves, as if <hi>Antaeus-like</hi> they were ſtronger by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>Again, had many been induced by reaſon to return to
the Catholick Church, yet I cannot underſtang why the
Proteſtants zeal should think it more ſeaſonable to write
Books by pairs againſt us, than againſt their other Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours;
ſince they who have gone from them into other

to denounce to thoſe Sects the unreaſonableneſs
of their Schiſm, than plead the reaſonableneſs of their
own;</q> he voluntarily miſtakes my words, as if I meant that
he had confeſs't it Schiſm, and then gone about to plead
the reaſonableneſs of it: whereas I onely intended (as is
evident) that he went about to plead the reaſonableneſs
of that which I (who am the Defendant) doe, and muſt
hold for Schiſm, and conſequently may nominate it ſo,
that is of his breaking from our Churche's Government.
Yet for this I have loſt my credit, this being <hi>another</hi>

               <p>At leaſt why should they not dare (had they Grounds
to bear them out) to do the ſame as the Catholicks did,
during the time of their greateſt perſecution under the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115675:39"/>
Proteſtant Government; that is, let them be known to be
Schiſmaticks, and make the people abſtain in divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from their contagious Communion. But the confeſt
uncertainty of their Faith makes them ſqueamish to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to themſelves any ſuch Authority, and therefore
they are forced by their very Grounds, when their Secular
Power is gone, to turn diſcipline into courteſy in matters
of Government, as they do in controverſy turn zeal into
civility and complement. When he talks here piouſly of
<hi>the Romaniſts ſanguin try method,</hi> ſure he hath forgotten
that ever Prieſts were hang'd, drawn, and quarter'd for
their Faith at <hi>Tiburn,</hi> and all over <hi>England,</hi> in the time
of their cruel Reign; or, if he remembers it, he thinks
to make us amends by preaching, like a Saint, of their
<hi>meekneſs,</hi> of <hi>edification,</hi> and the more tragically-pittifull
expreſſions of <hi>lamenting the ruptures of the Chriſtian world</hi>
(which themſelves have made) <hi>with rivers of teares of
bloud. Anſw. p.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>The next Section begins with the rehearſal of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why no colourable pretence can be alledged by the
Proteſtants why they left us, but the ſame will hold as
firm for the other Sects why they left them; which I
expreſt thus: <q>For that we preſt them to believe falſe
fundamentals Dr. H. and his Friends will not ſay, ſince
they acknowledge ours a true Church, which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with ſuch a lapſe. They were therefore in their
opinion things tolerable which were urged upon them;
and, if not in the ſame rank, yet more deſerving the
Church should command their obſervance, than Copes,
or Surplices, or the book of Common Prayer, the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
whereof they preſt upon their Quondam brethen.</q>
Which words though as moderately and modeſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the matter as could be invented, yet the Reader
shall ſee what a character the Doctors peevish zeal hath
ſet upon them; to wit, that (Anſw. p. 14.) <hi>there are in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115675:39"/>
them too many variations from the Rules of ſober diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,
ſo many indications of S.</hi> W. <hi>his temper, that it will
not be eaſy to enumerate them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It shall be ſeen preſently whether the Doctors Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
or mine went a rambling when we writ. The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of my Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> was this: The falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which you pretend we preſt upon you, were either
acknowledged by you to have been fundamental, or not-fundamental,
that is, tolerable: that you acknowledg'd
them fundamental you will not ſay, ſince falſity in a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
ruines the eſſence of a Church, which yet you
grant ours to have; therefore they were according to you
not-fundamental or tolerable; yet ſuch kind of not-fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
points as were more importing to be preſt upon
you by us, than Copes or Surplices, which you preſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them: therefore you can alledge no reaſon why you
left us, but they may alledge the ſame or a greater why
they left you. This evidently is the ſenſe of my words to
any man who can underſtand common reaſon; and the anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to them ought to be a manifeſting-ſome ſolid motive
why they left us, which the other Sects cannot with better
right defend themſelves with, why they left the Proteſtants.
Let us hear now whether the Doctors diſcourſive power
were <hi>ſober,</hi> when he <hi>reel</hi>'d into ſuch an anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he willfully puts a wrong meaning upon thoſe
words <hi>falſe Fundamentals,</hi> as if by them I meant things
which we onely, not they, hold for Fundamentals; and
then overthrows me moſt powerfully by showing (as he
eaſily might) that <hi>he and his Friends ſay not but that we
preſt them to believe falſe Fundamentals,</hi> in this ſenſe,
that is ſuch things as we held Fundamentals: whereas
'tis plain by my arguing <hi>ad hominem</hi> all the way, as alſo
by thoſe words (<hi>they will not ſay; they acknowledge ours
a true Church; in their opinion,</hi> &amp;c.) that I meant ſuch
points as they accounted Fundamentals. And when he hath
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115675:40"/>
thus voluntarily miſtaken me, he tailes againſt me that I
affirm things without the leaſt shadow and ground of
truth, and that I play foul play. The Reader will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcern how meanly Dr. H. is skill'd in the game of
reaſon; though in that of citations, where he can both
shuffle and cut, that is, both alledge and explicate them,
with <hi>Id ests,</hi> as he pleaſes, he can pack the cards hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly,
and show more crafty tricks than ever did <hi>Hocus
Pocus.</hi> And if any after all this can think I have wrong'd
Mr. H. in affirming he is a weak reaſoner, himſelf shall
ber ample teſtimony to this truth in the following Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</p>
               <p>He ſlily touches at my true meaning of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
there, and tells us that <hi>falſe Fundamentals is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in adjecto.</hi> Grant it, who ever affirmed that
Fundamentals could be falſe? my words were onely that
<hi>Dr. H. and his Friends would not ſay that our Church
preſt them to believe falſe Fundamentals.</hi> Is it any wrong
to them, or <hi>foule play</hi> in <hi>S.</hi> W. to affirm that Dr. H. and
his Friends will not ſpeak a contradiction? Himſelf (ſuch
is his humility) ſayes it is; affirming here, that when
<hi>S.</hi> W. <hi>undertakes for him and his Friends, that they will
not ſay that the Romaniſts have preſt them to believe falſe
Fundamentals, his words are not intelligible ſenſe</hi> (for the
following words, <hi>or elſe they have no degree of truth in them</hi>
relate to the other acception of <hi>Fundamental</hi> already
ſopoken of) ſo that according to Dr. H. <hi>it is not intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſenſe</hi> to undertake for him and his Friends, that they
should not ſpeak contradictions. Is this a ſober diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,
which falls reelingly to the Ground of it ſelf, when
none pushes it? or was it a friendly part to involve his
Friends in his own wiſe predicament?</p>
               <p>And now can any man imagine, that when I ſaid <hi>Dr. H.
and his Friends acknowledge ours a true Church,</hi> there
should be any difficulty in the ſenſe of thoſe words, or that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115675:40"/>
I should impoſe upon them that they held our Church
not to have erred? yet this Doctor, who alwayes ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
moſt in the plaineſt way, will needs quibble in the
word <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> W. muſt bear the blame for <hi>groſſely
equivocating:</hi> whereas the ſenſe was obvious enough to
every child, as the words before cited will inform the
Reader, that I meant them of the <hi>true nature</hi> of a Church;
which ſince they acknowledged ours to have, I argued
hence, that they muſt not ſay we held falſe Fundamentals,
that is, ſuch as they account Fundamentals: for ſince a
Church cannot be a Church, but by Fundamental points
of Faith, and Faith muſt not be falſe, it follows that a
falshood in Fundamental deſtroyes the very Being of a
Church. This being ſo, I shall beg Dr. H's pardon if I ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techize
him a litle in point of reaſon (in which his Cauſe
makes him a meer <hi>Cathecumenus</hi>) and ask him how
he can hold ours to have even the true nature of a Church,
ſince he hold that which she eſteems as her Fundamental
of Fundamentals, and that upon which as her ſole certain
Ground she builds all her Faith, to wit her infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
to be falſe &amp; erroneous? If the ſole Authority up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which immeditately she builds all Faith, be a ruinous
falshood, she can have no true Faith of any Article, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
can have no Faith at all, nor be a true Church,
ſince a Church cannot ſurvive the deſtruction of Faith. But
their ambition to honour their Nag's-head Bishops with
the shadow of a Miſſion from our Church, makes them
kindly ſpeak non ſenſe to do her a ſeeming courteſy for
their own intereſt. I know he tells us here in general
termes (Anſw. p. 15.) <hi>that she is not unchurch't, becauſe
she holds the true Foundation layd by Chriſt, but offends by
enlarging and ſuperadding;</hi> but he muſt show why the
Catholicks, who hold no point of Faith, but ſolely upon
their Churche's infallibility, if thar Ground be falſe (that
is be none) as he ſayes, can hold any thing at all as of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115675:41"/>
Faith, that is, have any Faith at all: at leaſt how they
can have Certainty of any point of Faith, or the written
word of God, if the ſole-certain Rule of Faith, by which
onely they are aſſured of all thoſe, were taken ſometimes
in a lie; to wit while it recommended to them thoſe <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradditions</hi>
they account falſe, received in the ſame te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
as the reſt from the hands of our immediate Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</p>
               <p>But let us follow Dr. H. who goes jogging forward,
but ſtill rides (as his ill fortune is) beſide the ſaddle To
points which they accounted <hi>fundamental,</hi> I counterpos'd
<hi>tolerable</hi> ones, that is ſuch as they eſteemed <hi>not-fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi>
which I therefore call'd <hi>tolerable,</hi> becauſe they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
theſe neither to touch the Foundation of Faith, as
building or deſtroying; ſuch as he acknowledged in the
fore-going Paragraph our pretended <hi>ſuper additions</hi> to
be, ſaying that <hi>the droſs doth not annibilate the Gold.</hi> It
being therefore plain that falshoods which are not in <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,</hi>
&amp; ſo unconſiſtent with the eſſence of a Church,
muſt be in things <hi>not-fundamental,</hi> and therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with the nature of a Church, that is <hi>tolerable,</hi> if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in themſelves; he neglects to take notice of them as
they are in themſelves, (that is ſuch, as their admiſſion
ruines not Faith, nor the eſſence of a Church) and ſayes
<hi>the preſſing</hi> them upon them is <hi>intolerable,</hi> and <hi>not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittable
without hypocriſy, or ſin againſt conſcience;</hi> and
why? becauſe they believe them not I ask, had they a
demonſtration they were falſe? if ſo, then let them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it, and if it bear teſt, I shall grant them innocent; if
not, then ſince nothing elſe can oblige the Vnd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſtanding
but the foreſaid <hi>Evidence,</hi> their pretended obligation in
Conſcience to diſaccept them is convinc't to ſpring from
weakneſs of paſſion, not from force of reaſon.</p>
               <p>I added, that <hi>thoſe points more deſerved the Church
should command their obſeruance, than Copes or Surpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:115675:41"/>
&amp;c. And though Mr. H. knowes very well, that one
of thoſe points was the fundamental Ground of all Faith
in the Church they left, and <hi>Copes</hi> &amp;c. but things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
yet by a cheap ſuppoſal that all is falſe which we
hold, he can deny that they are more deſerving our
Church should command their obſervance: and ſo carries
the cauſe clear. He addes Anſw. p. 16. that <hi>they weightier the
importance of the things commanded is, the more intolerahle
is the preſſure of impoſing them:</hi> and makes <hi>diſobedience</hi>
greater in things <hi>indifferent.</hi> Whereas ſurely the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
are more highly obliged to command the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of that on which they hold Faith to be built, than
all the reſt put together. Is it a greater obſtinacy to deny
a Governour taxes, than to rebell abſolutely againſt him?
the Doctor's Logick ſayes it is; ſince obſtinacy, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to him, is greater in reſiſting commands in things
ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fferent. Eſpecially if the Rebel pleaſe to pretend, that
the urging his ſubmiſſion to that Authority is <hi>an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
preſſure,</hi> Mr. H. here acquits him without more
adoe. But to return; ſince it was our Churche's greater
obligation to command their obſervance of thoſe points,
and the holding of ſuch points was not deemed then by
them deſtructive to Faith, but on the other ſide known
by reaſon of their pretended importance to be in an high
degree damnable to themſelves and others, if they hap't
to be miſtaken, no leſs than moſt palpable and noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
evidence can excuſe them in common prudence
from a moſt deſperate madneſs, and headlong diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
but the leaſt shadow of a teſtimony-proof is
a meridian Sun to Dr. H. and gives as clear an evidence
as his underſtanding, darkened by paſſion, is willing to
admit.</p>
               <p>Thus much to show the particular miſcarriarges of Dr.
H. in every Paragraph of his anſwer to my Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
there remaines ſtill the Fundamental one, that he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115675:42"/>
hath ſaid nothing at all to the point of reaſon in it, but
onely miſtaken each particular line of it. I alledged as my
reaſon why they dealt not ſeriouſly againſt their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertours,
<q>becauſe no colourable pretence could poſſibly
be alledged by the Proteſtants why they left us, but
the very ſame would hold as firm for the other Sects
why they left them.</q> This proved <hi>ad hominem</hi> thus;
becauſe the Proteſtants acknowledge the points deny'd
by both to be tolerable, that is ſuch as could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
with Faith and a Church; but, with this diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
on the Proteſtants ſide, that the points they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
being of more importance, more deſerved our
Church should command their obſervance. Now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one ſees that the proper Anſwer to his Diſcourſe
is to ſpecialize ſome plea for themſelves, which will
not as well excuſe their Deſertours: The Doctor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
none, nor goes about to alledge any; but as if
he were dividing his Text, playes upon my words
in particular, neglecting the import of them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>He ſayes indeed it is againſt their conſcience to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
thoſe other <hi>ſuper additionary</hi> points; the ſame ſay
the Puritans, of <hi>Copes, Surplices,</hi> and <hi>Organs.</hi> The
Doctor will object that they are <hi>indifferent, and ſtight
matters,</hi> and therefore it is a greater diſobedience not
to admit them; they will anſwer that Surplices are
ragges of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Organs are <hi>Babylonish</hi> Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes,
and all the reſt ſcandalous, and ſuperſtitious
inventions: Still they are equall in their pleas Nay,
if a <hi>Socinian</hi> deny <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be God, and pretend, as
doubtleſs he will, with as much ſeriouneſs as Mr. H.
that he cannot but ſin againſt Conſcience, if he think
otherwiſe, and therefore 'tis tyranny to <hi>preſs</hi> it upon
him, the Church may not oblige him to believe that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is God; Dr. H. hath pleaded his cauſe joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115675:42"/>
with his own, that is, hath ſaid no more in his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
than the <hi>Socinian</hi> may for his. Again, if Dr. H or
his Church preſs upon the <hi>Socinian</hi> the belief of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
Divinity upon this ground, that it is a point of <hi>moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
importance;</hi> he preſently anſwers the Doctor with
his own words, that <hi>the weightier the importance of the
things commanded are, the more intolerable is the preſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of impoſing them.</hi> And ſo in ſtead of impugning, Dr.
H. hath made good <hi>S.</hi> W's words, that they can alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
no colourable pretence which may not be alledged by
the other Sects.</p>
               <p>What if we should adde that the Church they left had
been in long poſſeſſion of the belief of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and ſo
proceeded upon theſe Grounds that her Faith was <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
when she preſt thoſe points upon them; but they
confeſs their unce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in, and could proceed upon no better
then probable Grounds when they preſt any thing upon
their Deſertours? is there not a palbable difference put
between the pretended Authorities of impoſing points to
be held, in us and them? and a greater danger of diſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
ours in them, than theirs in the Puritans? If they
erred, onely a confeſt probability ſtood againſt them,
which gave them juſt licence to diſſent, if they had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
reaſon that the admiſſion of thoſe points was bad;
ſince nothing but abſolute Evidence pretended could even
pretend to oblige their Vnderſtandings to aſſent to them:
if you erred, a pre acknowledg'd Infallibility ſtrengthen'd
by a long Poſſeſſion, aſſerted by the atteſtation of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and many other motives ſtood againſt you, ſo
that nothing but moſt palpable, undeniable, and rigorous
<hi>Evidence</hi> could poſſibly diſoblige your firſt Reformers
from their ancient belief, or oblige them to this new one.
If the <hi>Puritans</hi> erred, ſince they were onely ornaments
and Rituals they refuſed to admit, the utmoſt harm which
could accrue by their non-admiſſion of them was termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115675:43"/>
in the want of exren decency onely, and held by
the very Authority which impoſed them, to be but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and far from being eſſentially-deſtructive to a
Church. But if you or your firſt Reformes chanc't to erre,
(which the bare probability of your Faith confeſs't by
your ſelves, in this caſe makes more than likely (then your
contrary poſition ruin'd all Faith and Government, ſince
the Church you diſobey'd held no other Ground of Faith
or Church Government, ſave onely thoſe you re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and diſacknowledg'd, to wit, her own Infallibility, and
the Popes Authority. Again, if you happen'd to be in
the wrong, and that indeed there was no other, either
Church Government, or Ground of Faith, than theſe;
then how wickeldy deſperate to your own ſoules, and
univerſally deſtructive to all man-kind, and their means
of attaining eternal bliſs, muſt your diſclaiming and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
renouncing both theſe be? none of which can be
objected to the Puritanes by you. So evidently true were
my words, that <q>no colourable pretence can poſſibly be
alledged by the Proteſtants why they left us, but the
ſame will hold as firm, nay much firmer, for other
Sects why they left them.</q>Yet I doubt not but the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
will after all this (as he does here (Anſw. p. 16.) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
his own victory with a triumphant <hi>Epiphonema,</hi>
and ſay that S. W. <hi>his probations are beyond all meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

it's <hi>genus</hi> or material part <hi>a diviſion,</hi> or <hi>act of dividing;</hi>
the ſpecifical difference gives it a reference to the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Government inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now our great
Maſters of Moral Divinity aſſure us, that no <hi>action</hi> is in
it ſelf good or bad, but as it conduces to or averts from
the attaining one's laſt end; ſince all things elſe have the
nature of meanes onely in order to the attainment of that,
and conſequently the eſteem of their goodneſs or bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is built upon their alliance to that order. Whence
follows that there is no action in the world, not kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
one's own Son, nor dividing from any Government
whatſoever, in it ſelf ſo bad, but might be done, could
there be aſſigned motives and reaſons, truly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it better to attempt it. Now our all-wiſe God hath
ordered things ſo providently for the peace and good of
his Church, that it is impoſſible any cauſe or motive can
be truly imagin'd ſufficient to juſtify the rejecting it's
Government; ſince neither any private injury is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to ſuch an univerſal good, nor can it happen that
any miſcarriage can be ſo publick as to force it's renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing:
for ſeeing our B. Saviour made but one Church,
and that to continue for ever, if any cauſe were ſufficient
to break from that one Church, there would be a juſt and
ſufficient cauſe to be of no Church, which is againſt the
Proteſtants own tenet, and makes them ſo deſirous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a deſcent from ours. Wherefore it remains impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that thoſe who acknowledg the Churche's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to have bin inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> should pretend to
any juſt cauſe to ſeparate from it, but they ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115675:44"/>
themſelves paſſively, in caſe of an injury received,
not actively renouncing that Government, or erecting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
againſt it.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this yet it may happen ſometimes
that (as no Authority is or can be ſo ſacred &amp; inviolable,
but paſſion can make men diſlike it) ſome company of
men may diſacknowledge the Authority inſtituted by
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> to have come from him, alledging for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and motive of their renouncing it, that it is an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
which they alſo pretend to prove by arguments
drawn either from Reaſon or Teſtimonies. Now theſe
men's plea might take place, if it were poſſible they
should produce abſolute evidence, and ſuch as in it's own
force obliges the underſtanding to aſſent, notwithſtanding
the contrary motives which retard it: and without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
ſuch a rigorous Evidence, it were madneſs to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
an error in abuſineſs of ſuch main concernment both
to the Church, mankind, and their own Souls, as it would
neceſſarily be, if that fact of theirs happen'd to be Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical.</p>
               <p>Now then let us ſee, whether my Adverſaries inference
be good, that, becauſe Schiſm can have no juſt cauſes for
it's parents, therefore Dr. H. in treating a Controverſie
of Schiſm, ought not to heed or produce the cauſes or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of it. Indeed if he would grant himſelf and his
Friends to be Schiſmaticks; then it were to no purpoſe for
him to alledge cauſes and motives, ſince all men know
that no juſt cauſe can be poſſibly alledged for Schiſm: but
if he does an external act which hath the reſemblance or
show of Schiſm, and nevertheleſs will defend himſelf to be
no Schiſmatick, he muſt give account why he does that
action, and shew that that action is not truly Schiſm;
which cannot be done without diſcuſſing reaſons and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
if common practiſe teach us any thing. Will any
man endeavour to turn one out of poſſeſſion lawfully,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115675:45"/>
without a plea, or produce a plea without either any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or reaſon in it? Iuſtly therefore did the <hi>Catholick
Gentleman</hi> affirme it to be a pure contradiction: for that a
confeſt breach under debate should be concluded to have
no juſt cauſes, that is to be indeed Schiſmatical; or, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
juſt cauſes, that is to be a ſelf enfranchiſment, without
producing &amp; examining any cauſes, is a perfect implicancy.</p>
               <p>Nor will his inſtance (<hi>Reply</hi> p. 5. 6.) of a <hi>ſeditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or Rebell,</hi> ſecure him at all: for as it is true that if it be
known that he confeſſes himſelf a Rebel, there is no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of cauſes, (as Dr. H. well ſayes) to juſtify his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;
yet as long as he pretends to be no Rebel, ſo
long he is obliged to bring motives and reaſons why his
action of riſing againſt the Government is not Rebellion,
though it be accuſed and ſeem to be ſuch.</p>
               <p>Now if Dr. H. hath not forgot the title of his book,
tis <hi>a Defence of the Church of England againſt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of the Romaniſts,</hi> to wit, thoſe by which they
charge her of Schiſm, that is, their accuſing her that this
action of Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical;
ſo that the whole ſcope and work of his book
muſt be, to plead thoſe motives and reaſons which may
ſeem to traverſe that accuſation, and shew that this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> makes not her Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
nor her Sons Schiſmaticks. And how this can ſtand
without producing motives, or is not as plain a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as <hi>ens</hi> and <hi>non ens,</hi> I confeſs is beyond my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>In his eighteenth p. he cunningly forges a falſe ſtate of
the queſtion in theſe words, <hi>that it is a matter in queſtion
between the Romaniſts and us, whether the Bishop of Rome
had before and at the time of the Reformation any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
legal power here, I willingly acknowlege.</hi> By which
he would perſwade the Reader, that he had condeſcended
to a ſtate of the queſtion pretended by us: which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115675:45"/>
falſe; for we ſtate the queſtion thus; That, there
being at that time an external confeſſed Government de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
and in actual poſſeſſion time out of minde, (abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
from whether it be internally legal or no) whether
the pretended Reformers either did then or can now show
ſufficient reaſons of the ſubſtracting themſelves from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to it. This is our ſtate of the queſtion, which hath
it's whole force (as the Reader may ſee) in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
external poſſeſſion. Now Dr. H. would make his
Reader believe that the ſtate of the queſtion doth wholly
abſtract from the external poſſeſſion, and purely debate
the internal right, as if it hung hovering indifferently in
the aire to be now firſt determin'd, without taking notice
of the ſtability and force <hi>our tenet</hi> had from the long poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.
And this handſome trick he gentilely put's upon
his Readers by thoſe three ſly words, <hi>I willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus miſtaken voluntarily the ſtate of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
conſequently he impoſes upon me that I ſaid, <hi>none
doubts of the Bishop of Rome's ſupreme legal power over
the Church of England at the time of the Reformation;</hi>
and then confutes me moſt palpably with telling me <hi>that
they doubt it,</hi> or make a queſtion of it. Can any man in
reaſon imagin I was ignorant that ſuch was their tenet,
ſince I impugn it in this preſent controverſy, as Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical?
yet Dr. H's great reach of wit can <hi>by the way,</hi>
and within a Parentheſis, make ſuch a dolt of <hi>S.</hi> W. His
proof from my words is better then the ſuppoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion it
ſelf: <q>I ſaid, our Church could caſt them out, and deny
them communion, if they be found to deſerve it, being
then her Subjects and Children.</q> Actually they were
under her at that time: if then they could alledge juſt (that
is) <hi>evident</hi> reaſons why they thought her Government
an uſurpation, then they did not deſerve it, and ſo she
could not excommunicate them; if they did not, and yet
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115675:46"/>
would ſubtract themſelves from her obedience, then they
deſerv'd it, and were <hi>juſtly</hi> excommunicated. Can any
man doubt of this, or impoſe ſuch a piece of known non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe
(as his former deduction out of it is) upon another,
unleſs poſſeſs't with Dr. H's want of ingenuity? yet this
he repeats again, p. 21. and calls his own ſtraining at a
gnat, my <hi>ſwallowing down the queſtion at one hauſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us examin my words which breed his ſcruple:
they are theſe, as cited in the Marge by himſelf. <q>That
our Church could caſt you out, if you be found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it, being then her Subjects and Children none
doubts.</q> Here I ask, firſt, whether he can shew that I
ſpeak of any interiour or <hi>legal</hi> Authority; which if he
cannot, 'tis a plain impoſture to father upon me the word
<hi>legal,</hi> as he does in this place. Secondly, I demand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any Proteſtant or Dr. H. himſelf doubts whether the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
was an extern, apparent, and acknowledged Authority,
the which for being ſuch was to be obeyed until it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> over the pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers.
This being acknowledged, I ask what it is he
excepts againſt. That ſuch an Authority could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
againſt her eſteemed Subiects, <hi>if they deſerv'd it;</hi>
for this is all my words ſignify'd, and is ſo plain of it ſelf,
that no man that hath any common ſenſe can make diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of it.</p>
               <p>He tells us p. 19. that the queſtions is <hi>equally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
whether they or the Romaniſts be guilty of
Schiſm, including alſo the remorſeleſs Governours in the
Romish See.</hi> Where he quite miſtakes the buſineſs: his
meaning (as I perceive by his whole procedure, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
p. 22. where he ſayes, that <hi>the Pope ought to
clear his title to his pretended power</hi>) is, that we should
be mutually counter-opponent, and counter-defendants,
and each produce proofs, ere we can claim any thing. But
he is in a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eat errour: we need no new proofs to convince

the lawfulneſs of our Authority; our plea is provided to
our hand before they oppoſed us, and ſtarted the queſtion
Poſſeſſion is all the proofs we need bring, and ſuch a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
as had to ſtrengthen it an univerſal belief that it
came from <hi>Chriſt's</hi> time, grounded upon the certainty of
Oral Tradition; ſo that we made no queſtion of it (it
was a point of our Faith) and therefore need produce no
proofs for our affirmative: whereas they, who firſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent debate devolves to this;
whether the proofs Dr. H. produces be convincingly <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
againſt a poſſeſſion ſo qualify'd, as is before declared:
if they fall short of that force, <hi>eo ipſo</hi> he and his Friends are

motives an Authority, whoſe poſſeſſion is juſtly preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to have come from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> if they be perfect <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi>
then they are excuſable, and in their excuſableneſs
is terminated the controverſy in hand, if we may truſt the

us, that is, whether we were unjuſt, uſupers, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
&amp;c. is another queſtion; for which ſequel I would
not contend with them, if the premiſſes could be poſſibly
evinced. However, if we uſurp't, it was not lately, but a

caſe be <hi>ſchiſmatical,</hi> (as he here ſayes) that expreſſion
comes out from the mouths and pens of his Friends ſo

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115675:47"/>
that he muſt have recourſe to the univerſal obligation of
Charity to pretend us ſuch: for we can never be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

even in his ſuppoſed caſe Schiſmatical againſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

or ſelf-govern'd; ſince there can be no diviſion made,
where the things are already many.</p>
               <p>After his pretended indifferency of the queſtion, he
tells us, that it <hi>muſt not be begg'd on either ſide,</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
he complains of me grievouſly for the ſame fault I
am ſorry to ſee M. H. ſo ignorant in Logick, that he
miſtakes the moſt ordinary things in diſputing. Let him
know then that a Defendant, as a Defendant, cannot be
ſayd to beg the queſtion; ſince it is his office to hold his
tenet, which is the thing in controverſy, and ſtick cloſe by
it; whatever prejudices or impoſſibilities are objected, to
deny them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent from it, granting thoſe things which
he takes to be conſiſtent with it, denying thoſe which he
deems inconſiſtent, unleſs it be an open evidence; if an
ambiguity occur, to diſtinguish the double ſenſe, and show
again which part of the diſtinction is conſiſtent with it,
which otherwiſe: in all which it is manifeſt he ſuppoſes
the truth of the queſtion, and holds faſt to it, nor ought he
let go that hold til he be non-pluſt, and the diſpute at an
end. My part then being the Defendant's (as hath been
proved out of the tenth Ground) the Reader may ſee with
how much Logick D. H. complains of me all over, for on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
holding my <hi>tenet;</hi> which he calls begging the queſtion.
For, however he may pretend to the <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>Defender,</hi>
yet, ſince his party begun firſt to oppoſe, that is, to <hi>object</hi>
and argue againſt ours, who at that time <hi>quietly held</hi>
their <hi>tenet,</hi> 'tis clear he is in no other ſenſe a Defendant,
than as one who maintains his firſt objected Syllogiſm
with a ſecond, may be ſaid to <hi>defend</hi> it; which is very
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115675:47"/>
improper and abuſive of the right notion. Whereas we,
who ſtarted not the diſpute nor begun the oppoſition, but
ſate ſtill, have yet a juſt title to continue in that our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of defence, till the Evidence of their Arguments
drive us out of it.</p>
               <p>His next complaint is againſt the Governours in the
Romish See, <hi>who</hi> (if you will truſt him) <hi>without all cauſe
deny Communion without remorſe or relenting, not onely to
them, but to many other Churches eaſt and weſt, north and
ſouth, in all parts of the habitable word.</hi> And was not this
ever the conſtant practice of God's Church, to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
all thoſe who renounced either the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or any other point of Faith received from their
Forefathers; that is, all Schiſmaticks and Hereticks; and
never to readmit them till they repented their lapſe, and
did fruits worthy of penance? I grant therefore that the
<hi>Romish Governours</hi> inherit the <hi>remorſleſneſs</hi> of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Church, ſo that if any be found miſdeſerving in the
ſame manner, in what part ſoever of the habitable world
they live, whether Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South, all is one
to her; or how many ſoever they be, <hi>Arians, Socinians,

               <p>I took notice by the way, with a glance of a <hi>parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:115675:49"/>
that he mitigated S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his words, <hi>Nulla ab eis
tanta fieri potest correptio, quanta eſt ſchiſmatis perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
by rendring the abſolute tenour of them, <hi>Nulla po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,</hi>
&amp;c. by the ſofter language of, <hi>It is very hard if not
impoſſible, to receive ſuch an injury from the Governours,</hi>
&amp;c. To clear himſelf, he asks me firſt why I took no
notice of his ill rendring <hi>Schiſmatis pernicies.</hi> I anſwer,
that it is not neceſſary to ſcore up all his faults; it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to note what I conceived moſt needfull. Next, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
himſelf by telling us that he <hi>ſet down the Latin pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
and ſo left it not poſſible to impoſe on any that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
that.</hi> I anſwer, that my intent in noting it was,
that he should not even impoſe on thoſe who underſtand
English onely, and make up the greater part of Readers,
Thirdly, he ſayes <hi>he was carefull not to goe beyond the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of the teſtimonies.</hi> I grant it, and onely find fault
that he was over-carefull, ſo as to fall short of their juſt
ſenſe. Fourthly, he tells us that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, both in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
and other Authours, is render'd <hi>hard</hi> or <hi>difficult.</hi>
Which evaſion is nothing, unleſs he had this teſtimony
out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in Greek, as his words ſeem willing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
to make the Reader believe: which if he have, I am
ſure he hath ſeen more than other men, though very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
could ever hear of.</p>
               <p>Theſe are his evaſions: let us ſee what plain reaſon will
ſay againſt them: <hi>It is very hard, if not impoſſible, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſuch an iniury ſufficient to excuſe Schiſm,</hi> evidently
is conſiſtent with this ſenſe, that, it is doubtfull whether
ſome few injuries may not be ſufficient for that end; and
then if the ſome of theſe laſt words doe not mitigate the
abſolute, <hi>nulla poteſt, there can be none,</hi> I confeſs I have
loſt my reaſon. To omit that the ſenſe of his tranſlation
or paraphraſe <hi>few or none,</hi> &amp;c. leaves room for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
of Schiſm, ſince it admits a poſſibility for
Schiſm, in caſe of ſome injury received, to be excuſable.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115675:49"/>
In a word, I onely affirmed (<hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd,</hi> p. 3.) that
he <hi>ſeem'd ſomething chary</hi> in thoſe expreſſions, which I
am ſure the Reader will think I have made good; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
acknowledging here (p. 24. l. 11.) that his <hi>expreſſion
was cautious,</hi> and the fact of mincing the words being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident:
As for his intention, if the Reader wil believe
him, he aſſures him (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 18.) it was <hi>out of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to us;</hi> ſo that we muſt bear the blame of his feeble
paraphraſe, and be beholding to him to boot. <hi>Timeo Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naos,
&amp; dona ferentes.</hi> Howſoever, ſince it was our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to have the intention of a courteſy thruſt upon us, we
thank him for it, but requeſt him to do us no more ſuch
favours for the future, as to mince the Fathers words for
our ſakes; they will earn a return of greater gratitude
from his own cauſe, which ſtands in need of ſuch kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p>My third <hi>whiſper</hi> (as he calls it) which he will needs
have ſpeak aloud to his diſcredit, is that he render'd S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>'s
words <hi>à communione orbis terrarum, from the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
or truly Catholick Church of Chriſt;</hi> as if he we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
afraid leſt God's Church might perhaps be thought
<hi>untruly Catholick.</hi> Of which he ſayes <hi>the reaſons is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
becauſe the Church of Rome is by her Advocates ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Catholick Church.</hi> But do not others call her
ſo beſides her own Advocates? do not even our very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes
(forced thereunto by cuſtome, which makes
words proper) give us that appellation, unleſs deſign croſs
their free and natural expreſſion? Ask in <hi>London</hi> where
a Catholick lives, and ſee whether they will show you
the houſe of a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, or no. Should a <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuivant</hi>
meet Dr. H. and ask him if he were a Catholick,
I doubt not but his anſwer would be negative, unleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
againſt us made him deliver himſelf otherwiſe. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
then we onely have <hi>nomen Catholicum obtentum &amp; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſum,</hi>
which S. <hi>Auſtin (contra Epist. Fund.</hi> cap. 4.)
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115675:50"/>
holds to be a note of the Church, it is a wrong to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Doctor, to put upon him in your tranſlation the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
addition of <hi>truly,</hi> to <hi>Catholick;</hi> ſeing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to him, no Church can be univerſally called ſuch,
which is not truly ſuch. The ſumme then of Dr. H's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogating
<hi>truly,</hi> is; that though all the world in their
free expreſſions call us onely Catholicks, (that is, ſons
of the Catholick Church) yet all ſpeak <hi>untruly,</hi> but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and a few of his brethren; who alſo ſpeak <hi>truly</hi> onely
then, when it is their turn to diſpute againſt us. Yet he
tells us, if we will believe him, that certainly our Church
<hi>is not ſuch in the notion S. Austin ſpeaks:</hi> though if we
should ask him what ground he hath for his <hi>certainty,</hi> he
muſt anſwer that he hath none that is <hi>certain,</hi> but onely
a <hi>probability;</hi> for I conceive he hath no better ground for
that than he hath for his Faith.</p>
               <p>Thus Dr. H. ends his defence from my three <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers,</hi>
as he calls them, though I hope by this time they
ſpeak <hi>loud</hi> and plain enough to every Reader that he was
<hi>too chary in his expreſſions,</hi> which was all I objected. In
the cloſe he pleaſes to honour me, by making me <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
of his ſecreteſt and deepeſt reſervation:</hi> but truly
(though I pretend not to ſo high an office) unleſs he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
with hearty ſorrow for theſe faults without cloaking
them, and gives me good hopes of his future amendment,
he is never likely to obtain abſolution.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Catholick Gentleman</hi> noted by the way, that Dr. H.
ſlightly paſt over the diſtinction between Hereſy and
Schiſm, which was neceſſary to be expreſt in that place,
where the matter of the futurework was to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
that is, what Schiſm he was chiefly to treat of.
Now in this Book entitled <hi>their defence</hi> he ought to ſtate
the matter ſo, as to treat of that chiefly which is chiefly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected:
wherefore ſince he cannot but know that a Schiſm
coming from an Hereſy is that which is more charged
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115675:50"/>
upon them, both as greater crime, and as the cauſe and
origin of the other Schiſm of onely diſobedience, he ought
to have premiſed this, and let his Reader have known that
all Hereſy is Schiſm; at leaſt in a place where he purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treats of the notion of Schiſm, it was fitting to treat it
abſtractedly from the heretical one, and that of bare diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
(both which are objected, though the former
much more) and not ſpeak of it as diſtinguish't from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy,
as profeſſedly here he does, <hi>of Schiſm chap. 2. par.</hi> 1.
ſo laying wrong grounds to his future diſcourſe, by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and excluding from it the principal Schiſm objected,
and ſo treating Schiſm maimedly, or rather onely one
branch of it. Now his firſt excuſe why he paſt it over ſo

                  </gap>ghtly (onely naming the word <hi>diſtinguish't,</hi> yet trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
no diſtinction there,) is that <hi>he meddled not with it at

of it, Chap.</hi> 8. whereat 'ts evidently moſt impertinent and
unmethodical to treat of Schiſm againſt Faith under the
head of Schiſm againſt mutual Charity: and beſides, <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi>
gives, that we muſt put the definitions before we
treat of the particularities. I am ſorry to ſee that <hi>his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion

                  </gap> with ten ſeveral

               <p>HIs ſecond Section preſents us with the firſt <hi>Dish</hi> in
the <hi>Stationer's bill of fare,</hi> ſerved up to the table
cover'd; but with ſo many pittiful evaſions, and miſtakes,
as may ſerve perhaps to give the Reader a banquet of
mirth. But I shall treat it ſeriouſly.</p>
               <p>His firſt miſtake is general, and ſlips over the whole
queſtion. Our controverſy is whether either <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or

                  </gap> have a reciprocal ſignification upon a Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
account, <hi>from the notation of the form and termination
of the word,</hi> as he declares himſel (<hi>of Shiſm,</hi> p. 13.) to
mean of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> at leaſt: now he, to evade, quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes
his formely-declared intent, and recurres for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
to the ſenſe of the word taken from <hi>the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,</hi>
and affix't to it by Eccleſiaſtical uſe, or preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
not to what the word in it ſelf requires, nor
to what it is beholden to Grammar for.</p>
               <p>His ſecond miſtake (which I pardon'd him before) is
that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> comes from the active <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſince Grammarians
uſe to derive that verbal from the ſecond perſon of the
preterperfect tenſe paſſive.</p>
               <p>His third miſtake (or rather voluntary evaſion) is, that,
whereas he was accuſed for miſunderſtanding the nature
of a Conjugation, in ſaying that <hi>a Greek paſſive for want
of conjugations was deſign'd to ſupply another ſignification,</hi>
he flies off, and ſayes he mean't it of ſuch as the Hebrew
Grammars call thus: as if he should ſay that Greek verbs
want Hebrew Conjugations. To omit that the Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
in Hebrew are improperly call'd ſuch, shall be
shown preſently.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:115675:51"/>
His fourth miſtake is, that he makes account it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
to expreſs Conjugations to be <hi>flexions and varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
both of the ſignification and firſt ſyllable, as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
calls Conjugations:</hi> for to ſtate the matter indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
(though the contrary uſe of the word, in both La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
and Greek, out-ſound, and ſo make improper the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
uſe of it in Hebrew) let us abſtract from all the
three, nay from all languages, and upon Grammatical
principles put a difference between <hi>Voyces</hi> and <hi>Conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
no other can be imagin'd than this, that a <hi>Voyce</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to the ſignification, a <hi>Conjugation</hi> to a diverſity in
ſome letter or ſyllable. This being ſo, that expreſſion is
proper which ſignifyes each in it's own propriety and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
not both at once, blended in a confuſion. Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
therefore in Hebrew are they called Conjugations;
and more properly did <hi>S.</hi> W. affirm that in Hebrew, <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Coniugations were jumbled,</hi> as the Doctor's words
now cited juſtify.</p>
               <p>His fifth miſtake is, that the Printer's evident errour in
putting <hi>eight votes</hi> for <hi>eight voyces,</hi> is the <hi>unconceivable</hi> lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
(as hee alls it) of <hi>S.</hi> W. whereas no man that was no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than half blind, could poſſibly fall into ſuch a toyish
piece of overſight, ſince the wrong word <hi>votes</hi> is put once
onely, but the right word <hi>voyces</hi> twice, ſo immediately next
it, that it could not poſſibly leave it undiſcover'd; to wit,
three lines before it, and again three lines after it. Yet this
hard riddle hath coſt the good Doctor a great deal of
paines, for he tells us here (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 27.) <hi>he cannot by
any enquiry diſcover that any Grammariam hath ſtyled
them eight votes.</hi> What a wiſe task it was to conſult all the
multitude of Grammars extant for ſuch a trifle, which was
juſt at his noſe? and what a miſerable life does he lead in
turning over leaves daily to ſo litle purpoſe? But every thing
delights moſt in it's own Element.</p>
               <p>His ſixth miſtake is, his denial that there are more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugations
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115675:52"/>
in the Greek, than in the Hebrew. Now in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
none imagine more than eight, and this forgetfull
Adverſary of mine was fit to defend in the foregoing page
that there might be but <hi>foure;</hi> whereas honeſt <hi>Cambden</hi>
will inform him that in Greek, <hi>Conjugationes</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>ſunt tredecim, ſex barytonorum, tres contractorum, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor
Verborum in</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: now in our Country thirteen are
more than eight; but Dr. H. thinks otherwiſe. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why they are more properly ſuch in Hebrew, becauſe
there the variation is both in the ſignification and the
firſt ſyllable is already shown to be the reaſon why they
are improperly called Conjugations, and rather <hi>Voyces;</hi>
which is yet made plainer by that which follows in the
Doctor (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 27. 28.) that <hi>one and the ſame Verb
goes through all the Coniugations in Hebrew.</hi> For ſince it
was never pretended that the word <hi>Conjugation</hi> is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
termed ſuch in Latin and Greek, where it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish't
from a <hi>Voyce,</hi> and yet in both thoſe languages no
verb runs through all the Conjugations, but through Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
onely; it is manifeſt that, if theirs be proper, the notion
of Conjugation in Hebrew is improper.</p>
               <p>His ſeventh miſtake is (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 28.) that <hi>all neutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſives
are of the active voice;</hi> of which he is ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that he tells me <hi>every School-boy knows it:</hi> ſure
theſe School-boys muſt have Dr. H. for their School-maſter.
I am ſure <hi>Will. Lilly</hi> would have whipt his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
for being ignorant of their <hi>As in praeſenti,</hi> had they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
it; where they might have read, and Dr. H. too,
the Rule, <hi>Neutropaſſivum ſic praeteritum ſibi format,</hi> &amp;c.
inſtancing in <hi>Gaudeo, fido, audeo, fio, ſoleo, moereo,</hi> which
if he account actives from their manner of flection, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
his old errour in the nature of a voice) he may
take notice that their preterperfect, from which more
tenſes are formed than from the preſent, is altogether
paſſive; if from their ſenſe, let him tell me what <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deor,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115675:52"/>
fior,</hi> &amp;c. would ſignify if made <hi>paſſives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His eighth miſtake is that <hi>ſto</hi> partakes not of a paſſive
ſenſe: it muſt have then, according to him, a ſenſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
and totally active; (for no Latine Verbs can have
any ſenſe but what is either Active or Paſſive or compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of theſe, except ſome few which ſignify Being) if ſo,
then ſeeing it ends in <hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> why should it not be an active
forming a paſſive in <hi>or;</hi> for ſo Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> teaches his boyes,
that if it cannot take <hi>r</hi> 'tis no active. If he replies, that
it ſignifies in the manner of an action, yet not tranſitively
as actives, but immanently, or as received in the agent,
(as in reality it does) then he again makes it partake of
a paſſive ſenſe, ſince to ſignify an action as received in the
agent, is to ſignify an action mixt with a paſſion, for that
reception is ſuch. In a word, thoſe Verbs which ſignify
action (or in manner of an action) of one thing upon
another, are actives; thoſe that ſignify the reception of
it in the other, are paſſives, and formed of theſe actives;
thoſe that ſignify <hi>an action</hi> (or in manner of an action) of
the ſame thing upon it ſelf, partake of both, and are <hi>neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
and hence they may be render'd either actively, or
paſſively, <hi>I ſtand,</hi> or, <hi>I am ſtanding, I run,</hi> or, <hi>I am
running,</hi> &amp;c. though the difference and degrees of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
this reciprocalneſs be more viſible in ſome, than in
others, according as their <hi>ſignificatum</hi> is either a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-called
action including motion, or elſe the manner one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of ſignifying imitates the perfecter active.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, Reader, it is for Dr. H's ſake, not thine,
that I make this Grammatical lecture, who in his former
book-had onely forgot his Accidence, but in this ſeems
abſolutely to have renounced it. Yet theſe are the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which, in defiance of all Grammar, he takes againſt
me, and then triumphantly inſult's, and would make the
Reader believe that he omits <hi>to enumerate others the like</hi>
(weightier you may be ſure) partly to preſerve his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115675:53"/>
partly becauſe it were <hi>unreconcileable with common
Compaſſion.</hi> Well; <hi>S</hi> W. may have many Adverſaries,
but never shall he meet with ſo tender-hearted a man,
who is mightily afraid to hurt him, when he never co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
near touching him. If he drew any bloud, I am ſure
poor <hi>Priſcian, Lilly</hi> and <hi>Cambden</hi> felt the ſmart.</p>
               <p>His ninth miſtake (which he calls <hi>his anſwer to my
principal ſcruple,</hi> but indeed is his own principal errour)
is his inſtancing in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels
of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and to be of the nature of <hi>Hithpael.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
not onely theſe he alledges, but alſo that the ſecond
perſons of the imperative mood in all Verbs ſignifying an
action indifferently performable by himſelf or another,
may by the circumſtances come to ſignify an action upon
himſelf; yet this is not to be of the nature of <hi>Hith-pael,</hi>
which hath this always of its own Grammatical force,
without being beholding to circumſtances. Again, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Hith pael</hi> is to ſignify expreſſely as much as two
words in Latin or Greek, as I inſtanced in <hi>Schiſm Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd,</hi>
and ſo is perfectly and eſſentially reciprocal; theſe
pretended parallels come from perfect actives, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
no more reciprocalneſs than <hi>amo</hi> and <hi>cognoſco,</hi> if
taken in themſelves, and abſtracted from circumſtances.
But his main errour is, that he runs to the quality of the
thing ſignify'd, from the quality of the word upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Grammatical notation: which was the ſole
deſign of this Critical diſcourſe, and formerly his intent,
till he was frighted from it. I grant therefore that the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical

much leſs, I <hi>am divided by my ſelf from the Church;</hi> but
the circumſtances or uſe give all theſe, and make the
acception of the word ſuch: for a breach from the
Church being inexcuſable, that is ſinful, muſt be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary;
and becauſe in all diviſions when one part bears
a ſmall proportion to the other, that part is ſaid to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from it, therefore to <hi>ſchiſmatize</hi> is to divide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
voluntarily from the Church. All this the uſe of the
word yields; and had Dr. H. onely ſtood to this, he had
found no oppoſition from <hi>S.</hi> W. but ſaved his credit at leaſt
for Grammatical skill: but becauſe he would deduce it
by criticizing Grammatically, I would let him ſee what
conſequence follow'd of it; to wit, that ſince <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to make it ſignify <hi>a dividing from

Schiſmatick be cut in two: and I much fear that all the
Grammatical plaſter Dr., H's art can make, will not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
much leſs cure the wound himſelf would needs give
himſelf, by meddling too much with thoſe edg'd tools of
Criticiſms.</p>
               <p>Not to charge him with more miſtakes, (ten are enough
for him to fall into about one word) I would know why
he left my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the point. To which had he apply'd his miſtaking facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I doubt not but we might have had a douzen, if not

               <p>Thus much of Dr. H's <hi>Hith-pael like</hi> Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and his eagle-ey'd Criticiſm upon it, which wil make his
fame long-lived amongſt all future Grammarians. What
follow in the next Paragraph, granting his clients to be
Schiſmaticks, if <hi>I can prove their voluntary receſſion from
us,</hi> is already prov'd by his own clear confeſſion, <hi>Schiſm
Diſarm'd,</hi> p. 279. where the Reader may ſee it manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
plainly; my patience is not tranſcription-proof (like
Dr. H's) to ſtand repeating it here. But I know he will
deny his words in one place or the other, as he does more
than once in this Treatiſe of his ſecond thoughts.</p>
               <p>He told us, chap. 2. p. 3. that <hi>Governours, being men,
may poſſibly erre, and excommunicate the innocent;</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that <hi>unleſs he could evidence an immunity from
errour in the Governed, as well as pretend a liableneſs in
the Governours, the opinion of right ought to ſtand on the
Governours ſide, and that a probable motive could not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
warrant the Subiects to revolt;</hi> giving my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for it. Now the proper reply to the import of my
Anſwer had been to ſtand ſtoutly to it, that their motiues
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115675:54"/>
for renouncing that Authority were in their own nature
more than probable, and concluded demonſtratively that
it was an uſurpation. But he is horribly afraid of anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
poſitively to that point: when any Reaſon appeares,
he either leaps out of the liſts all afrighted, or elſe hides
himſelf in words. His Anſwer is, (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 30.) that
<hi>this cannot be appliable to the buſineſs without begging the
principal queſtion.</hi> So that I muſt be the opponent, that's
concluded, let reaſon and art ſay what they will. I ask,
was not my anſwer pertinent to his words, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
might erre, which was my onely buſineſs at that
time? If ſo, then it was moſt abſurd in him to ramble from
one end of the Controverſy to the other, with his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
and crude affirmations, that <hi>the Pope in King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's
time was not de jure, in Q. Elizabeth's neither de iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
nor de facto Governour.</hi> May not any Rebel ſay the
ſame, pretend no Right in the Governour, and ſay truly,
that he was not actually and <hi>de facto</hi> under him, when
he had renounced his Authority, and raiſed an Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him? He tells us moreover upon his honeſt word, if
we will believe him, that <hi>the King and Bishops here had
the ſupreme power under Chriſt, to reiect the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
that the Pope's power was uſurp't,</hi> &amp;c. and then
hiding his head under theſe thin leaves, he concludes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<hi>perfectly ſafe till we make it appear that we were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
and they faulty.</hi> So that by the Doctor's Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
a boy, though undoubtedly held the ſon of ſuch a
Father, may not be whip't by him for diſobedience, as
long as the boy can call his mother whore, and deny
himſelf to be his Son; unleſs the Father make it firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that he is his Child. Till you firſt renounced the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of our Supreme Governour (let it be when it will)
you were under him, and held his Children and Subjects;
your diſobedience is moſt notorious, and confeſt and that
not a meer diſacceptance of his commands, but diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115675:55"/>
of his Authority: yet as long as you can deny it, and
ſay the <hi>Roman</hi>-Church (your then-Mother) was a ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
and had erred in Faith, she may not punish nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
you, without firſt making it appear you are
her Children. A ſolid piece of reaſon!</p>
               <p>Obſerve, Reader, that Dr. H. in all theſe raw affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his, that not begg'd the queſtion a jot, although
he be the opponent; 'tis his privilege to ſay what he will,
every one knows 'tis his humour. In a word, let him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
show that his reaſons for renouncing that Authority
are above all degrees of probability, which was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
anſwer, or elſe let him confeſs (as he muſt) that he is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
a Schiſmatick in rejecting an Authority for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages acknowledg'd certain, upon ſlight and phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Grounds.</p>
               <p>One piece of wit I muſt not omit, becauſe I have heard
more than one of Dr. H's Friends miſled by it. The Doctor
affirms here (<hi>Anſw</hi> p. 30. l. 14.) that the Pope's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was <hi>firſt caſt off by Papiſts.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
men who nominate us Papiſts for onely acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Pop's Authority, should call them alſo Papiſts
who diſacknowledge it. But perhaps he means they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<hi>Roman</hi>-Catholicks; if ſo, then let me ask, does he
mean that they were of our Profeſſion ere they renounc't
it? ſo was every one that turned Knave or Rebel, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
man and true Subject formely, elſe he had never <hi>turn'd</hi>
ſo, but ever <hi>been</hi> ſo: muſt then Knaves and Rebels impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
knavery and rebellion to honeſt men and true Subjects,
and ſay, it was they who firſt began thoſe Vices? or does
he mean perhaps that they remain'd Catholicks after
the renouncing it? If his miſtake be there, he may right
it by taking notice, that ſuch a renouncing is an Act of
Schiſm involving hereſy, by corenouncing the Rule of
Faith. After this renouncing therefore, they were Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
and Hereticks, not Catholicks, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115675:55"/>
tenets they may be pretended ro retain ſtill, were not
now Faith but Opinion onely; the ſole certain Ground
of Faith, Oral Tradition, being abandon'd and rejected:
unleſs the Doctor will ſay that they had yet Catholick
Faith in them, who denyed all the ground of Catholick
Faith; and then indeed I shall not refuſe to give them lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
to hold them without Ground, and rank them in Dr.
H's Predicament of Probabliſts.</p>

               <head>Sect. 10.</head>
               <head type="sub">Dr. H's plea of a weak conſcience common to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
and any malefactour. Thirteen shamefull and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
weakneſſes in anſwering Mr. Knot's poſition that
we may lawful'y forſake the Churche's Communion, if
she be not infallible.</head>
               <p>Mr. H. begins his third Section very angrily, calling
mine (p. 31.) <hi>a perfect Romane-combate with a
Wind-mil of my own erecting, toward which he never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
the leaſt stone or timber.</hi> But what if I show the
Doctor, that he hath contributed great mill-ſtones and
huge logges towards the making this Wind-mill of his?</p>
               <p>My affirmation was that (<hi>Schiſm Diſarm</hi>'d, p. 14.) <q>he
had got a new cloak for his Schiſm, the pretence of a
weak conſcience,</q> citing for it his excuſing words,
that they <hi>could not ſubſeribe to things which their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
tells them is falſe,</hi> and <hi>that it is hard to ſay a man can
lawfully ſubſcribe in that caſe, though the truth be on the
Churche's ſide.</hi> Hence I deduced ſome conſequence, how
his doctrine excuſed thoſe malefactours and their three
pretended Schiſmaticks. In anſwer he calls this a <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
perverſion of his moſt innocent expreſſions,</hi> becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
he ſayes, that ſuch a <hi>weak-conſcienc't erroneous
man is in ſeveral reſpects crimtnous,</hi> &amp;c. I reply, I do
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115675:56"/>
not forbid him to ſpeak contradictions; for I perceive by
his litle amendement he is not likely to take my friendly
counſell: but let us ſee what thoſe places which I related
to there in the Doctor gave me occaſion to ſay, and what
they contributed towards this <hi>Wind-mill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His firſt contribution is, that there is nothing alledged
by him, where he pretends conſcience in not obeying us,
but the very ſame will much better ſerve any malefactour;
ſo that his words may become their plea, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
unleſs he gave us ſome diſtinctive ſign of the goodneſs
of his conſcience above theirs, his words are juſtly applia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to plead their cauſe.</p>
               <p>His ſecond is, that whereas onely rigorous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Evidence can excuſe ſuch a diſobedience, and he
pretends none, I ought to think his conſcience erroneous,
and that for pleading for it, he pleads for erroneous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;
and may by the ſame reſons plead for the other
malefactours.</p>
               <p>His third contribution is, that ſince on the one ſide he
tells us it is hard to affirm that a man in an errour may
lawfully ſubſcribe, and on the other, leaves no Grounds to
convince him rationally (for how can any man pretend to
convince him, or he rationally aſſent to be convinced by
an Authority which tells him it may be miſtaken?) this
weak-conſcienc'd man may conſequently have a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Ground to remain in his falſe opinion, at leaſt cannot
be obliged to contrary belief, but thanks Dr. H. hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for pleading for his lawfull continuance in his beloved
errour. Or if he be ſcrupulous of his errour, and Dr. H.
afford him no perfectly-certain grounds to right it, but
that (as he ſayes here, and his Grounds make good) <hi>he
is ſure to ſin which way ſoever he turns;</hi> 'tis likely Mr. H's
good doctrine may make the poor fellow come ſtraight
home from the Probability-lecture, &amp; take a rope &amp; hang
himſelf. This indeed were no great favour to a weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:115675:56"/>
His fourth contribution, (<hi>cap. 7. par.</hi> 9.) is his poſition
of the errour (in ſome caſe) on the Churche's ſide in ſome
places in this Chapter; which very thing favours the ſelf-conceit
of every proud fellow, and gives him a fine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to think his erroneouſneſs lawfull in diſobeying that
Authority, which could not oblige him in reaſon to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
what herſelf knew not, but might be miſtaken and erre
in. Nay more, he very putting the Errour on the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's
ſide takes away all obligation to <hi>believe</hi> her; and by
conſequence juſtifyes all erroneous conſciences. Thus is
the <hi>Wind-mill</hi> finish't at Dr. H's proper coſt and charges,
although he ſayes he contributed not the leaſt ſtone or
timber: ſo truly liberal &amp; noble he is, that after ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs,
he will not own nor acknowledge his bounty to
his very Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Next to theſe faults which Dr. H. hath committed in
pleading for a weak conſcience, follows his ſin of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
I mean his neglect to anſwer my ſeventeenth &amp; eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
pages, which obliged him to ſpeak out, and ſay ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I or no, to two points which are horrible Bull-beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to him, whereſoever he meets them. The firſt is,
<q>whether all aſſent of the Vnderſtanding which comes not
from perfect and demonſtrative <hi>Evidence,</hi> ſprings not
from paſſion and vice: The ſecond, whether he and his
Friends have ſuch <hi>Evidence,</hi> that our Church erred, in
delivering as of Faith, that the Pope, as Succeſſour of S.
<hi>Peter,</hi> was Head of the Church.</q> Theſe two points I
made account were the two main hinges, on which that
door turns which muſt shut them out of, or keep them in
the Church; and therefore expected (not that he should
produce his Evidence here, but) that he should have given
ſome anſwer either affirmative or negative to them. But
Grounds are very perillous edged tooles to meddle with,
and cut the throat of errour at one ſlash; which coſts
much hacking and hewing when a Controverſy is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115675:57"/>
by debating particularities. Again, the nature of
Grounds is to entrench ſo near upon the firſt principles,
and their termes are for the moſt part ſo unqueſtionably
evident, that they leave no elbow-room for a shuffler to
beſtir his mock-reaſon in; which in particulars (not ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ſcientifical proofs) eſpecially in teſtimony-skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe,
ſeldom or never want. And therefore Dr. H. who
is of that Generation of Controvertiſts, and very prudent
in it, dit wiſely omit to meddle with theſe points; though
in that place he had ample occaſion to treat of them.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> had affirm'd, that <hi>we may
forſake the Churche's Communion in caſe she be fallible
and ſubject to errour.</hi> Dr. H. inferred hence, (<hi>of Schiſm</hi>
p. 20.) that <hi>it was lawfull</hi> (if this were true) <hi>to forſake
Communion of all but Angels and Saints and God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
his reaſon was, <hi>becauſe onely they were infallible
and impeccable.</hi> To maintain the infallible certainty of
Faith againſt this man, who would bring all to probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I gave ſome inſtances, to let him underſtand, that
<hi>Infallibility</hi> in men on earth was not ſo impoſſible a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as he fancies: Glancing alſo at his addition of <hi>Impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,</hi>
ſince the controverſy there being about our <hi>tenet,</hi>
which is <hi>Infallibility,</hi> the mingling it with <hi>Impeccability</hi>
was a tacite calumny, intimating to the weaker Readers
that this was alſo out <hi>tenet,</hi> or part of it. To theſe Dr H.
pretends an anſwer, but ſo full of contradictions both to
himſelf and common ſenſe, that it would be tedious to
enumerate them.</p>
               <p>It were not amiſs firſt to put down our plain <hi>tenet,</hi>
which (as far as it concerns this preſent controverſy) is
this, That ſince it is unworthy the Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Almighty God, who ſent his Son to ſave mankind,
not to firſt lay, and then leave efficacious means for that
end; which means (conſidering the nature of mankind to
which they were to be apply'd) are no other than effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115675:57"/>
motives, &amp; efficacioully propoſed, to make him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
temporary and fleeting Goods, and embrace Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
&amp; Eternal ones, (his onely Felicity,) with which the
affections to the former are inconſiſtent: again, ſince theſe
motives cannot be efficaciouſly propoſed to the Vniverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of mankind, unleſs Faith, the doctrine of them, be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
hence to aſcertain Faith, <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave teſtimony to
his doctrine by doing ſuch prodigious miracles as no man
did before; and when he left us, unleſs he had left alſo
ſome means to propoſe certainly thoſe motives to future
mankind, his coming had been in a manner voyd, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as concern'd poſterity; and the rational and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
certainty of his doctrine (and by conſequence the
efficacy of it) had been terminated in thoſe few which
himſelf by his preaching and miracles converted. Hence it
was neceſſary the Apoſtles should alſo aſcertain his and
their doctrine by the extraordinary teſtification of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
The multitudes of believers encreaſing, the ordinary
and common working of miracles began to ceaſe; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
beginning to riſe between thoſe who pretended
to the Law of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the conſent of Chriſtians in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
was now ſufficient to convince that that was <hi>Chriſt's</hi>
doctrine and true, which the Apoſtles Succeſſours told
them they had received from the Apoſtles themſelves.
For it was not poſſible ſo many, diſpers't in ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
should conſpire to a palpablely, in a viſible, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and known thing, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning their eternal Intereſt. They
had nothing elſe now to doe, but to atteſt what they had
received: <hi>Chriſt</hi> being unanimouſly acknowledg'd a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Law giver, there needed no new revelations to patch
and mend his noway-defective doctrine. The Company of
Believers multiplying daily and ſpreading, this atteſtation
encreaſed ſtill, and grew incomparable ſtronger, and the
impoſſibility of either voluntarily lying, or involuntarily
miſtaking, became every day greater and greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:115675:58"/>
In this univerſal delivery from hand to hand, called
<hi>Tradition</hi> (or, to avoid equivocation, Oral Tradition)
we place the impoſſibility of the Churche's conſpiring to
erre in atteſting things moſt palpable and moſt important;
which we call her <hi>Infallibility</hi> Vpon this we receive
God's written word; hence we hold our Faith infallibly-certain;
that is, ſo true, as it cannot but be true, as far as
concerns that <hi>Chriſt</hi> &amp; his Apoſtles taught ſuch doctrine:
hence laſtly, to come nearer home, we hold for certain and
of Faith that S. <hi>Peter</hi> is Chief of the Apoſtles, and the
Pope his Succeſſour, and that the renouncers of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
are Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, ſince this ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Rule of all Faith, Oral Tradition, now shown to
be infallible, recommended it to us as delivered from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Fore-fathers, as from theirs, and ſo upwards time
out of mind: which Rule the firſt Reformers in this point
moſt manifeſtly renounced, when they renounced that
Authority. For they could not have been the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,
had they found it delivered by Oral Tradition.</p>
               <p>By this is shown firſt in what we place the <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the Church: not in the bare words of a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men, but in the manifeſt and ample atteſtation of
ſuch a multitude as cannot poſſibly conſpire to tell a lie,
to wit, in atteſting onely that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s doctrine, which is
of a moſt <hi>concerning</hi> nature and of a moſt <hi>viſible</hi> quality,
was taught to a world of Children by a world of Fore-fathers.
This clear and short explication of our tenet
premiſed, let us ſee how weakly Dr. H. hath proceeded
in this dangerous point.</p>
               <p>His firſt weakneſs is, that he thinks Mr. <hi>Knot</hi>'s ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>very ſtrange,</hi> that, <hi>we might forſake the Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'s
Communion in caſe she were fallible.</hi> Whereas nothing
can be more rational and ſolid than that poſition. For
why may not we forſake the Churche's Communion, if
she hath no power to bind to unity in Faith which makes
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115675:58"/>
us one of hers? and how can she have any power to bind
us to unity in Faith, unleſs she be altogether certain firſt
her ſelf of that to which she would oblige others, that is,
unleſs she be infallible in teaching atteſted truths? To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
(as hee does, <hi>Reply,</hi> p. 13.) she may oblige others to
believe, though fallible, as long as she is not <hi>actually in
errour,</hi> is the greateſt piece of folly imaginable, for ſtill the
queſtion recurres, Is she infallibly certain that she is not
actually in errour? if she be, she is again Infallible, if
not, she cannot impoſe any obligation of belief. Hence
Dr. H. may ſee, that unleſs there he ſome company of
men on earth infallible, it is impoſſible there should be an
obligation to Vnity in Faith: nay there can be no poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
obligation to hold any point of Faith at all, unleſs
they conſpire to do ſo and hang together by hap-hazzard;
that is, be no Body of <hi>men,</hi> but a company of good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
met together by chance; and conſequently there can
be no Church or Common-wealth of Believers, much leſs
a laſting one, without this <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note that the obligation here ſpoken of is not an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to <hi>act</hi> or comport ones ſelf exteriourly, as in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Common-wealths; but to <hi>hold</hi> and <hi>believe;</hi> and
conſequently man's nature being Reaſon, nothing but an
Authority built on evidence of inerrability can rationally
oblige men to aſſent upon that Authority. So that Mr.
<hi>Knot</hi> and I shall very readily grant all Mr. H's conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
(<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 32.) that if there be no infallible Church,
<hi>there would be no poſſibility for any on earth to be guilty of the
ſin of Schiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond weakneſs is, that in excuſing himſelf for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>impeccable,</hi> he thinks to evade, by telling us (p. 32)
that <hi>he conceived humane nature to be in it ſelf equally lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſin and errour, and ſo no more infallible than impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</hi>
Suppoſe it were, (which yet is not granted)
what follows for his advantage thence, unleſs he could
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115675:59"/>
manifeſt that all men might fall at once into any one ſelf-ſame
kind of ſin? Are there cauſes layd in the world, or
can there be, (conſidering the nature of a world) able to
make all men conſpire to cut their own throats to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row?
if not, then in caſe this should happen, there would
be an <hi>effect</hi> without a <hi>cauſe,</hi> that is there would follow a
Contradiction: which being impoſſible, it muſt follow
likewiſe, that it is impoſſible they should be all peccable
in that kind, and conſequently, the Doctor may learn that
a multitude of men may be alſo <hi>impeccable</hi> in ſome kind
of ſin. Now to parallel this with <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as held
by us: we doubt not but of this multitude called the
Church, ſome may be fallible in one thing, ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but that all should conſpire either to miſtake or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude,
ſo as to tell ſo damnable and palpable a ly, as that
they had been thus tauhgt by their Anceſtour, if they had
not, is the Impoſſible of Impoſſibles; nay equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
as for Nature to fail in the propagation of any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
ſpecies; as for all the houſes in the world to be ſet on
fire to morrow, or for all men to die in their ſleep this
night; none of which can be done without deſtroying na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whoſe cauſes are placed neceſſarily in ſeveral circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and ſo work with variety. Yet Dr. H. tells us,
(<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 33.) that <hi>his words are as evident a truth as
could have been mentioned by him:</hi> and truly I think the
Reader will believe him ere we come to the end of this
book. But I haſt.</p>
               <p>His third weakneſs is, that whereas we place this Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
in a Church, that is, in a multitude of Believers,
he tells us, (p. 33. and 35) <hi>the Pope, the Bishop of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
Loadicea,</hi> &amp;c. and many other Governours have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into errour: but can he show me that all the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the Church, or half of them have erred, or indeed
can poſſibly erre in <hi>atteſting</hi> as aforeſaid? If not, let him
acknowledge how weak a Scripturiſt he is, in giving it ſuch
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115675:59"/>
an Interpretation as impoſſible to be true, whiles (<hi>Anſw.</hi>
p. 35.) he makes the Text <hi>I am with you always, even
to the end of the world,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſecondarily</hi> ſpoken to
the ſucceding Governours, to ſtand with their erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs.</p>
               <p>Hi fourth weakneſs is, that like thoſe who are making
a pittifull excuſe for a bad cauſe, his unfledg'd diſcourſe
ſticks between the teeth of a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> and dates not
come out plain. His words are (after he had told us,
p. 33) <hi>the Pope and any other ſingle man in the world
might erre as well as ſin;</hi>) that <hi>in proportion any multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
or aſſembly might (the major, and ſo prevalent part
of them) conſent in an errour, as well as in a vice.</hi> I ask,
can that <hi>whole multitude</hi> conſent in a palpable errour in
things viſible, or no? If they can, what means that grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<hi>parentheſis</hi> of the <hi>maior part,</hi> and to what end or
purpoſe was it brought, ſince all might erre? If they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>all</hi> erre in ſuch a caſe, but the <hi>major part</hi> onely, then
there can be ſome company on earth <hi>Infallible,</hi> (to wit
that <hi>whole</hi> multitude) which is the thing in queſtion.
How much more credit were it to loſe a bad cauſe by
ſpeaking out candidly, than to ſtrive to maintain it by
ſuch pittiful shifts?</p>
               <p>His fifth weakneſs is, that whereas he affirmed <hi>onely
Saints and Angels in heaven, and God to be infallible,</hi> and
I inſtanced (<hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd,</hi> p. 19.) in ſome on earth,
to wit <hi>the Apoſtles;</hi> whom I alledged to have been
<q>infallible in penning the ſacred writ, and preaching the
Goſpel:</q> He anſwers, (<hi>Anſw. p.</hi> 33.) that <hi>ſure they are
comprehended in the number of Saints in beaven, for there
undoubtedly they are</hi> Tell me ſeriouſly, good Reader,
and without ſmiling, is not Dr. H. worthy to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
the eighth wiſe-man; who, when I ask him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
men doing offices in their life-time here on earth, tells
me that they are now, or were aftervards Saints in heaven?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:115675:60"/>
His ſixth weakneſs is, his ſecond anſwer to the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of mine, to wit, that <hi>it is moſt true that they were
aſſiſted by Chriſt, ſo as they did not, nor could erre in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ſacred writ, and preaching the Goſpel</hi> That is,
he grants my inſtance brought againſt him to be true, and
himſelf to be in an errour, when he ſaid that <hi>none but thoſe
in heaven were infallible:</hi> For ſure if thoſe could not erre
(as he grants) in doing theſe offices performed by them
while they were on earth, then ſome men on earth may be
Infallible in ſome thing, to wit in things neceſſary for the
Salvation of mankind; which is all we demand, and as
much as we profeſs.</p>
               <p>His ſeventh, eighth, and ninth weakneſſes are, that after
he had thus granted all that was pretended, to wit their
Infallibleneſs in thoſe two ſorts of actions; (becauſe he
would be ſure to ſay ſomething to every thing, though to
never ſo litle purpoſe, as his cuſtome is) he addes firſt,
that <hi>they were not infallible in all ſorts of things.</hi> What man
in his wits ever pretended it or imagin'd, but that the
Apoſtles might count mony wrong, or be miſtaken in
knowing what a clock it was? Was ever ſuch frivolous
ſtuff heard of? Next he tells us that <hi>as they were men on
earth, they were fallible.</hi> What a myſterious piece of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
is here? He hath already confuted himſelf by gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that when they were men on earth, they were Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which was ſolely pretended; &amp; now that he may ſeem
to impugn us, he tacitely counterfeits us to hold that their
Infallibility proceeds as from it's formal reaſon, not from
the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, but from their being men
on earth, and by conſequence that each man on earth is
infallible; ſince <hi>à quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia,</hi>
Thirdly, whereas my words which (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 34.) hee
makes head againſt, are onely of thoſe two ſaid acts, in
which hee at length grants they were infallibly aſſiſted by
the confirmation of the holy Ghoſt; he rakes up all the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115675:60"/>
Apoſtles faults and failings before the holy Ghoſts deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and thinks to elude my words and delude his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by theſe more than childish evaſions.</p>
               <p>His tenth weakneſs is, that he extends (p. 34.) by a
voluntary miſtake (becauſe he would ſtill have ſomething
to ſay) Mr. <hi>Knot's</hi> words, that <hi>the Church was infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and not ſubject to errour,</hi> to ſignify, that it shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<hi>be preſerved from falling into errour, and that
not onely from this or that ſort of errour, but indefinitely
from all:</hi> As if the controverſy between Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> and
him were not onely about Infallibility in delivering mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith. Is not this a ſincere man, who would make
perſons wiſer than himſelf, ſeem ſo imprudent as to think
the Church Infallible in judging whether the Circle can
be ſquared, whether Sprights walk in S. <hi>Faiths</hi> under
<hi>Paul's,</hi> or whether a gooſe-py or a shoulder of mutton be
the better dish? By Dr. <hi>H</hi>'s Logick it muſt be out <hi>tenet,</hi>
that the Holy Ghoſt whiſpers the Church in the ear, to
ſpeak truth in all theſe and millions of other ſuch unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
fooleries; and all this abſurdity muſt light upon us,
onely from this, becauſe Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> W. ſaid the
Church is <hi>infallible and not ſubject to errour,</hi> when the
diſcourſe was about matters of Faith neceſſary for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of mankind. The like non ſenſe shuts up his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Paragraph as the reſult of the diſcourſe before it; ſo
again in the twelfth and fourteenth the ſame miſtaking
weakneſs is that which gives all the ſtrength to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
and it is worth the Readers notice, that he never
impugnes our tenet of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but by ſuch kind of
forgery.</p>
               <p>His eleventh weakneſs is, his shuffling in his eleventh
Paragraph, where after he had told us very truly, that <hi>the
Apoſtles had agreed on all things needful for the Church, &amp;
depoſited them in each Church, as their Rule of Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h;</hi>
when he drew near the point in queſtion, to wit, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115675:61"/>
the depoſitary (or Church) was infallible and could not
erre in delivering the right <hi>depoſitum,</hi> or whether she might
perhaps deliver a wrong one; he flies off, and tells us (<hi>Anſ.</hi>
p. 35.) <hi>if they would adhere to that, there needed no ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded
Infallibility to things unneceſſary.</hi> Did ever Mr.
<hi>Knot</hi> or I talk of <hi>Infallibility in things unneceſſary?</hi> or is
this the point diſputed between Catholicks and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants?
Good Mr. H. ſpeak out, and tell us whether
the depoſitary can miſtake or no in delivering <hi>needfull</hi>
points: if she can, where is the certainty of our Faith? if
she cannot, then ſome company of men on earth are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>
in delivering things neceſſary for Salvation; which
is the point in Controverſy.</p>
               <p>His twelfth weakneſs is, that in going about to show
how he can be infallibly certain of the books of Scripture,
he unawares recurres to our Rule of Faith, though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intends to ſtand to it; affirming here (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 36.)
that <hi>the teſtimony of others founded in their ſeveral ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
being faithfully conveyed to us by undeniable Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
are as unqueſtionably certain as if we had ſeen them
ourſelves,</hi> that is, as he intimates before (l. 3.) <hi>infallible;</hi>
inſtancing, that <hi>of this ſort is the tradition of the univerſal
primitive Church,</hi> &amp;c. Where firſt, if this be true, I
have gained my intent; which was to show againſt him,
that ſome company of men might be infallible in atteſting
things of Faith, though not in all things, as he calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niates
us to hold. Next, if the Tradition of the Primitive
Church be infallible, for the reaſon given, I ask why the
ſucceeding Church should not enjoy the ſame priviledge;
ſince the doctrine of Fore fathers being viſible &amp; practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and ſo founded in the ſeveral ſenſations of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
they can by witneſſing tranſmit it to their poſterity,
asun queſtionably truly, as if the Grand-children had ſeen
what was held and practiſed in the Grand-fathers time.
Nay, unleſs he grant this, he hath done nothing, that is, he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115675:61"/>
hath not shown that he hath any certainty of the books
of Scripture: for if the Tradition in the primitive Church
onely be infallible, I may be miſtaken in believing the
ſucceeding Tradition in this point, ſince that may deceive
me, for any thing I know; if the after Tradition alſo was
Infallible, then we conquer without diſpute in this and
all other Controverſies about Faith, ſince we were found
adhering to this univerſal teſtification of all our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whereas they renounc't it when they renounced the
Authority it recommended, and ran to other Grounds,
private interpretations of Scripture, and odde ſcraps of
miſunderſtood teſtimonies, and ſtill are glad to ſow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
theſe thin figge-leaves to cover the nakedneſs of
their deformed Schiſm.</p>
               <p>His thirteenth weakneſs is, that in teſtifying, as above-ſaid,
he ſayes <hi>the Church is not conſidered as a ſociety of
believers indowed with any inerrable priviledge, but as a
number of witneſſes,</hi> &amp;c. As if they did not firſt believe
it themſelves, ere they could conſpire to deliver it to their
Children for true; or as if the ſame perſons may both
be <hi>Beleevers</hi> in reſpect of their Progenitours, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
in reſpect of their poſterity. No wiſer is his aſſertion
that nothing is here conteſted from the Authority of their
judgments. For if he means, the points which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
are not founded on their judgments, 'tis moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true; ſince (ſpeaking of points of Faith) they are
truths revealed by God, not productions of mens heads.
But if he means, their judgments went not along with
their conteſtations, but while they teſtified to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them from their Anceſtours, they ſpake contrary to
their judgment; then they all conſpired to tell a ly to
their poſterity in things of Faith, which is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>The fourteenth Paragraph runs partly upon the ſame
affected miſtake of Infallibility. I asked him (to put in
him ſome apprehenſion that a company of men on earth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115675:62"/>
                  <q>might be Infallible, which he deny'd) if all the Proteſtants
could be fallible in witneſſing whether twenty years agoe
there were Proteſtant Bishops or no.</q> Firſt he will neither
ſay, I, nor no to the point; onely he ſayes, (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 37.)
<hi>he beleeves not they can probably miſtake in that thing;</hi> Next
he tells us <hi>this is no proof that they are any way infallible in
all matters of fact, without all poſſible mixture of errour.</hi>
Is it poſſible Mr. H. should think his Reader ſo ſilly, as
to take ſuch ridiculous tergiverſations for a ſufficient Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer?
My queſtion was whether they could erre, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to tell an open ly in a thing viſible as the Sun at
noon-day? and Dr. H. firſt shuffles at that, and then
counterfeits that I pretend them Infallible in all matters
of Fact whatſoever; as in gheſſing what paſt in the late
Kings priuy Councel while he was living, or whether <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi>
of <hi>Hampton</hi> fought with a Dragon or no.</p>
               <p>Dear Reader, I muſt addreſs a line or two to thee, and
deſire thee if thou beeſt Dr. H's Friend, to ask him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the Catholicks <hi>tenet,</hi> that the Church is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in matters of Faith onely, or in all things indefinitely;
as in knowing the height &amp; number of the Starres, what
weather it shall be every day next yeare, &amp;c. if he cannot
show the latter to be the <hi>tenet</hi> of our Church, then a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k
him from <hi>S.</hi> W. whether he hath either shame or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
in him to evade anſwering the point by impoſing
upon our Church a counterfeit <hi>tenet,</hi> and which himſelf
knows to be ſuch, and then making it the but of his ayre-beating
impugnation, repeating it ſo often (though once
were enough to move a blush, had not cuſtome taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
ſenſe) that I am confident any candid Reader will
nauſeate and be offended at ſo odious a piece of funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
inſincerity. His other weakneſſes mingled with
this, eſpecially his skipping aſide from the queſtion to the
fallibility of private men, shuffling about for excuſes, in
ſtead of anſwering, I or no, with other ſleights already
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115675:62"/>
lay'd open, make up a meſs of moſt excellent non-ſenſe,
call'd, in another phraſe, Dr. <hi>H</hi>'s third Section.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="section">
               <head>Sect. 11.</head>
               <head type="sub">What miſerable work Dr. H. makes with that plain propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition:
A Church that is fallible, and knows not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it lies or no in any propoſition, cannot have Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to bind any to believe her.</head>
               <p>MY fourth Section touched at three points, (<hi>Schiſm
Diſarm'd</hi> p. 21.) the <hi>ground of Vnity in a Church,</hi>
the <hi>groundleſneſs of Schiſm,</hi> and <hi>of Mr.</hi> H's <hi>manner of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
to clear himſelf of the latter:</hi> inſerting alſo ſome
part of the Catholick Gentleman's letter, which tended
to thoſe purpoſes. The firſt I show'd to conſiſt in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of that Authority, which juſtly pretends to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the aſſent of others to her propoſals. Hence follows
the ſecond, that no Schiſmatical Congregation, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
it ſelf fallible, can with any face pretend to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
an obligation of belief; nor yet excuſe it ſelf for brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
from acknowledg'd Antiquity or poſſeſſion, upon
fallible, that is, probable Grounds. The third was, that
ſince the Schiſm we object to the Proteſtants is charged
by us to be ſuch as involves hereſy, and by conſequence
the renouncing our Rule of Faith, it was the weakeſt piece
of reaſon that ever was reaſon'd by a Doctor of Divinity,
to make the ſumme and ground of all his Anſwer, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the ſaid Rule of Faith, (our Churche's Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
which was in effect to confeſs the Fact, and to prove
he is no Schiſmatick, becauſe he is an Heretick and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
both.</p>
               <p>For anſwer to theſe three points he referres me to his
<hi>Reply cap. 2 Sect.</hi> 3. In return to which, as far as hath not
already been anſwered, I shall give theſe ſatisfactory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115675:63"/>
upon the main points; not attending him in each
Paragraph, in many of which the inſipid <hi>Crambe</hi> of his
own ſelf ſayings is boyl'd over and over. But firſt he ſends
three or four whifflers upon the ſtage to trifle it, ere the
tragedy of Faith and it's certainty begins.</p>
               <p>His firſt trifle is, that the Catholick Gentleman calls
that Mr. <hi>Knot's conceſſion,</hi> which is his <hi>Concluſion from
that Conceſſion.</hi> A ſore quarrel! as if he who granted the
premiſſes, and made the inference himſelf, muſt not alſo
grant the Concluſion; if ſo, then his <hi>Concluſion</hi> is his
<hi>Conceſſion</hi> as well as the premiſſes.</p>
               <p>His ſecond trifle is, that <hi>Reply</hi> p. 14. he pretends, <hi>all that
was by him taken notice of, was the conſequence between the
Premiſſes and that Concluſion, which naturally inferred a
third thing, that it was unlawful to forſake the Communion
of any fallible Church;</hi> and the Catholick Gentleman's
impugning his admiration at it, and confirming this main
point of the Controverſy, he calls <hi>a digreſſion;</hi> whereas
it is a pure shuffling in him to avoyd this Queſtion, which
is fundamental, and ſolely important to this preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
concerning the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
from the true Church, upon pretence of being
bound by her to equivocate or ly.</p>
               <p>His third trifle is, that he tells us (<hi>Repl.</hi> p. 14.) <hi>he
may certainly affirme</hi> how this <hi>Theſis</hi> of ours [<hi>A Church
that is fallible and knows not whether it lies or no in any
propoſition, cannot have power to bind any to beleeve what
she ſaith,] is no infallible truth nor deduced from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
principle;</hi> whereas it is as evident a principle as
any in nature, that no man can in reaſon oblige another
to hold what himſelf knows not: as alſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaid truly to know that, in which he knows and
confeſſes he may be miſtaken. To this the Shuffler ſayes
nothing.</p>
               <p>His fourth trifle is, when we ſpeak of <hi>obligation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef,</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:115675:63"/>
to ſlip the point, and talke of <hi>obligation to act or
obey;</hi> telling us wiſely here, that <hi>A Prince can command
obedience though he be not infallible.</hi> Is it poſſible Mr. H.
muſt be continually obliged by his cauſe to ſuch affected
inſincerity, as ſtill to counterfeit the miſtake of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion?
The ſame he repeats again <hi>p.</hi> 16. and ſayes the
Governours thus oblige inferiours to obedience by force
of the Apoſtles <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; whereas the queſtion is,
whether the Apoſtles, who held that <hi>without Faith</hi> (that
is, without truth) <hi>it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us to believe that Congregation, which (being
<hi>fallible</hi>) might for any thing it or we know lead us into
<hi>damnable errours.</hi> I know that a probability of the thing
in it ſelf can oblige a man to <hi>act;</hi> as a ſudden Alarum of
the enemies probable approach ought in prudence to
rouſe a General to provide for reſiſtance; but nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
evidence can move to <hi>aſſent,</hi> nor can any pretend law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and rationally to oblige to it, but they who have
<hi>Evidence</hi> that they cannot be miſtaken in what they would
bind others to believe. See the judicious and learned <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
to <hi>Rusworth's Dialogues,</hi> where this point is largely
handled and fully cleared.</p>
               <p>Theſe trifles having thus play'd their parts and whiffled
a while, out ſtep the main bangers, and lay about them at
Faith, it's certainty, Church, and all whatſoever can make
us rationally Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the former <hi>Theſis,</hi> that <hi>a Church which is falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and knows not whether it lies or no in any propoſition,
cannot have power to bind any to believe what it ſaith,</hi>
which ſtood firm enough in it's own plain terms, is by
Mr H's art made ſtraddle foure ſeveral ways, ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it to a downfal; and drawn and quarter'd with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of tortures, becauſe it will not confeſs a falshood,
of which it was not conſcious. The foure diſtracted limbs
of it, which are to be anatomiz'd particularly, are here
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115675:64"/>
put down by Mr. H. (p. 15.) 1. <hi>What is meant by [can
ly.</hi>] 2. <hi>By knowing or not knowing whether it lie or no. 3 By
Power to bind. 4. By Belief.</hi> An ordinary Reader that
mean't honeſtly would think theſe words very eaſy: but
that is their fault to be too eaſy; they muſt be blunder'd
and made harder, otherwiſe the Reader would find no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to aſſent to them.</p>
               <p>But is not this mercileſs rigour? The firſt and ſecond
ought not to have been torn from one another, being the
ſame; for if the Church can lie <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> in ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
atteſted by her, and hath no infallible certainty
she doth not, then it follows that she doth lie for any
thing she knows.</p>
               <p>The ſame cruelty is shown in diſmembring and taking
aſunder that one notion of [<hi>power of binding to belief</hi>]
which was the whole import of the controverſy and in
treating the notion of <hi>power to bind,</hi> apart from that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Belief:</hi> By this shamefull and unconſcionable
craft, avoiding the whole queſtion, and applying the
words, <hi>power to bind</hi> (which now had got looſe of <hi>belief</hi>)
to <hi>obligation to render exteriour obedience</hi> p. 16.</p>
               <p>In his paraphraſe upon the words [<hi>can lie</hi>] he hath one
paſſage worth all his Friends eſpecial attention; which
is, that after he had enumerated all the means he could
imagine to ſecure a Church from errour, he confeſſes,
(<hi>Rep.</hi> p. 15. &amp; 16.) that <hi>that Church is yet fallible, may
affirm and teach falſe, Id eſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is naturally
poſſible it may, but it is not strongly probable it will.</hi> Then
it ſeems after all this adoe (for any thing he hath ſaid) it
is ſtill <hi>indifferently</hi> and <hi>equally probable</hi> that it does erre,
though <hi>not ſtrongly</hi> probable it will; that is, the Faith of
that Church, and all that adhere to it, hang in equal ſcales
whether it be true or no: and this ſolid piece of ſenſe is
produced by Dr. H. in a diſcourſe about a Churche's <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to bind to belief.</hi> Take notice, Reader, how shuffling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115675:64"/>
the Doctor behaves himſelf in ſaying, <hi>it is naturally
poſſible that Church may erre,</hi> providing himſelf an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
beforehand in the word (<hi>naturally</hi>) againſt any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.
This man hath forſworn ever being poſitive
with his Reader: Ask him whether <hi>ſupernaturally</hi> (or
by means of ſupernatural aſſiſtance) it be or be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
she should erre; if not, what mean't the word
<hi>naturally,</hi> ſince he knows we hold, the Church is <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
infallible?</hi> if it be, to what end, after recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
up alſo there <hi>ſupernatural</hi> means of confirming her
againſt erring, did he tell us in the cloſe with an <hi>Id eſt,</hi>
that she is <hi>naturally fallible?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Churche's knowledge whether it erre or no,</hi>
he ſayes, (<hi>Rep.</hi> p. 16.) it may ſignify no more than <hi>a full
perſuaſion and belief, cui non ſubeſt dubium, where in they
neither doubt, nor apprehend reaſon of doubting, that what
they define is truth; though for knowledge properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
or aſſurance, cui non poteſt ſubeſſe falſum, it may not
have attained, or pretend to have attained to it.</hi> Where
firſt, to omit his declining a poſitive anſwer, whether the
Church be Infallible or no, with <hi>may not have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
&amp;c. 'tis the moſt perfect piece of perniciouſneſs that
ever was crouded into ſo narrow a room, deſtroying at
once all Faith, and Ground of Faith, and making the
Church no certainer of her Faith than Iews, Turks, and
Heathens of theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if the Churche's <hi>knowledge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she erreor no</hi> means that she hath onely <hi>a full perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
cui non ſubeſt dubium;</hi> Turks, Heathens and Iews
have that, are <hi>fully perſuaded</hi> and have <hi>no doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but their
Faith is true, and ſo Mr. H. hath brought Chriſtianity
to a fair paſs, by his Rule of Faith. Again, <hi>paſſion</hi> and
<hi>vice</hi> can breed in men <hi>a full perſuaſion</hi> that an errour is
true, &amp; ſuch a perſuaſion as shall take away actual doubt;
nay the more paſſion a man is in, the leſs ſtill he doubts. Is
this a congruous explication of a Church's knowledge,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115675:65"/>
which leaves it indifferent whether she be <hi>rationally</hi> and
virtuouſly, or <hi>paſſionately</hi> and viciouſly thus fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if the Churche's <hi>knowledge whether she erre or
no,</hi> be onely <hi>an aſſurance cui poteſt ſubeſſe falſum,</hi> why
may not there <hi>ſubeſſe dubium;</hi> that is, if it may be falſe,
why may not she doubt of it, or indeed why should not
she be bound to doubt of it? Falshood in things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Eternity is a dangerous rock, and ought to breed
caution, (which goes ever accompany'd with doubt)
where the ſecurity is not perfect: now how can the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that it may be otherwiſe found a ſecutity that the
thing is ſo; that is, is not otherwiſe? or what hinders her
from doubting, if she ſees she may be wrong? If Mr. H.
reply that the Church was ſurpriſed, or had not ſo much
wit as to raiſe the difficulty, then indeed she may thank
her circumſtances, or her doltishneſs, not her Grounds, for
that her groundleſs aſſurance. For otherwiſe, should she
call her thoughs to account, and ask herſelf this queſtion,
Why do I aſſent with a full perſuaſion to ſuch a thing
which I ſee may be otherwiſe? she muſt, if she underſtand
the nature of a ſoul &amp; morality, acknowledge it was paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; vice, not evidence of reaſon which made her aſſent;
and conſequently hold her ſelf obliged to retract that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and leave off to hold any point of Chriſtian doctrine,
nay even that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is God, without a perpetual doubt
and fear that the contrary may be true. So perfectly
weak and fundamentally peſtilent is this explication of
<hi>a Churches knowledge</hi> by <hi>a perſuaſion, cui non ſubeſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium,
yet cui poteſt ſubeſſe falſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m;</hi> that is, of which the
perſon doubts not, although the thing in it ſelf may be
falſe. But this keeps perfect <hi>decorum</hi> with his former aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
that <hi>it is not ſtrongly</hi> (that is, it may be equally)
<hi>probable that a Church will erre,</hi> though she have uſed
all means imaginable to ſecure her ſelf from errour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:115675:65"/>
After his falſe explication of <hi>Power to bind</hi> already
ſpoken of, which he turns to <hi>an obligation to act and obey
exteriourly;</hi> he addes, as if <hi>the obligation to Belief</hi> were
collateral onely to our purpoſe, that <hi>there may farther
be meant by thoſe words,</hi>) he ought to have ſaid, there <hi>muſt
be onely</hi> meant by them) <hi>à general obligation to believe
what is with due grounds of conviction propoſed.</hi> But how
a Church uncertain of what herſelf holds can <hi>duly propoſe</hi>
Grounds able to <hi>convince</hi> rationally or that a confeſt and
known fallibility in the propoſer is ſufficient in it ſelf to
make ſuch a ground, he shall never show, unleſs he can
show reaſon to be non-ſenſe, and non-ſenſe Reaſon;
though he can talk finely, and shuffle about in general
terms.</p>
               <p>I am confident the Reader will think, that the former
words in that propoſition are very ill handled by Dr. H.
but the laſt word [<hi>Believing</hi>] comes not off ſo well:
Death is too good for it, nothing but annihilation and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
deſtroying it's eſſence muſt be it's mercileſs doom. His
explication of it comes to this, (<hi>Reply</hi> p. 16.) that they
who are ſo wiſe as to ſearch, muſt <hi>conſent according to the
Grounds propoſed as moſt palpable;</hi> that is, they muſt
believe themſelves. I ask are they bound or no to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Church, when they have but <hi>probability</hi> to the
contrary? if not, where is their ſubmiſſion of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where is their <hi>believing the Church?</hi> unleſs they
be willing to ſubmit their private opinions to her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
how can they be ſaid to believe her at all? Is there
any eaſier deference than to for goe a <hi>probability</hi> upon
her contrary affirmation? Or, if he ſay they may have
rigorous and convincing Evidence againſt her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if
he grant Infallible Certainty in Faith can be had, then
why should Dr. H. take this from the Church, and give
it to a private fellow? As yet therefore we have found
<hi>Belief,</hi> by his explication, to ſignify in reality no
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115675:66"/>
belief of the Church at all: let us proceed.</p>
               <p>He tells us next, that <hi>when the perſon is not competent
to ſearch</hi> Grounds, then (<hi>Repl.</hi> p. 17.) <hi>Belief may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy,
a believing ſo far, as not to disbelieve.</hi> Was ever ſuch
an explication heard of? Good Reader, if thou beeſt Dr.
<hi>H</hi>'s Friend, truſt nothing but thine own eyes in ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
piece of fledge hereſy and Atheiſm in the shell;
let nothing but thine own eyes ſatisfy there, that it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for one who hath the title of <hi>Doctor of Divinity</hi> to
print and ſet forth a poſition ſo full fraught with abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of the ſeventeens.</p>
               <p>Let us count them by the poll. Firſt, if the meaſure
of that belief to which the Church can oblige the ruder
ſort, be onely <hi>to believe ſo far as not to disbelieve,</hi> then in
reality she can oblige them to <hi>believe nothing at all,</hi> but
onely to remain in an indifferency of Scepticiſm: for he
who doubts of all things, or halts between two opinions,
<hi>believes ſo far as not to disbelieve;</hi> ſince not holding the
contrary to any thing, he poſitively disbelieves nothing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, an Heathen who never heard of <hi>Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
ſo far as not to disbelieve;</hi> for how can he be ſaid to
<hi>disbelieve</hi> a thing of which he never heard? So that Dr.
<hi>H</hi>'s Church can onely oblige her Subjects to be as good
<hi>believers</hi> or Chriſtians, as Heathens are; but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>to believe ſo far as not to disbelive,</hi> ſignifies
in plain terms <hi>to belive nothing at all;</hi> for he puts it not
to ſignify <hi>a believing ſo far as to believe,</hi> but <hi>a believing
ſo far as not disbelieve;</hi> that is, he exacts no <hi>belief</hi> for
the point, provided there be no <hi>disbelief</hi> againſt it. So
that as before, p. 16. he made the <hi>knowledge</hi> of a Church
that she defin'd truly, to be no more than a <hi>not doubting</hi>
of it, which can proceed from <hi>ignorance</hi> as well as <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi>
ſo here <hi>Belief</hi> muſt pretended capable to bear
the ſenſe of <hi>not-believing;</hi> provided that the <hi>not-belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:115675:66"/>
be not a poſitive <hi>disbelief</hi> of this, or belief of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I would gladly know of Mr. H. why the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Authority which has power to bind one <hi>not to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
may not alſo oblige <hi>to believe:</hi> if she can propoſe
evident and convincing reaſons to her Children that she
cannot erre, then she may without diſpute oblige me to
the latter; for ſuch motives are in their own nature able
to convince the underſtanding, and unleſs she can propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
ſuch, by what ground can she withhold me from <hi>disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,</hi>
or holding the contrary? Vnleſs perhaps the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
pretend to show, that the probable reaſons for her
<hi>fallibility</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> be ſo juſtly and equally poiz'd
in the Sceptick ballance, that none can ſay whether the
pound of rushes in the one end, or the pound of ſtrawes in
the other be the weightier ware, or better worth three-halfepence.</p>
               <p>Theſe explications with their wiſe appurtenances thus
premiſed, Dr. H. knits them up in theſe two propoſitions,
p. 17.</p>
               <p>1. A Congregation that is fallible and hath no knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
or aſſurance (cui non poteſt ſubeſſe falſum) that it is not
deceived in any particular propoſition, may yet have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to make deciſions, and require inferiours ſo far to acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to their determinations, as not to diſquiet the peace of the
Church with their contrary opinions. (<hi>that is, no to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
at all, but onely to behave themſelves quietly.</hi>) 2. But
for any abſolute Infallible belief or conſent, That, no Church
which is not it ſelf abſolutely infallible, and which doth
not infallibly know that it is infallible, hath power to require
of any.</p>
               <p>Where the firſt propoſition is certainly falſe, if the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
be certain, that that is falſe which his fallible Church
propoſes to him, and that it is a point which concerns
ſalvation not to erre in: and ſenſeleſs, if (as Dr. H. ſeems
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115675:67"/>
to ſuppoſe it may be (the inferiours aſſent is no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
for, how can a <hi>ſpeculative</hi> point be decided au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively,
if the inferiour be no way bound to <hi>aſſent,</hi>
but to <hi>acquieſce</hi> onely?</p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition is the granting that very point,
againſt which he pretended to make head, to the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alſo of which his former diſcourſe hath not in the
leaſt ſort contributed. So perfectly needleſs and to no
imaginable purpoſe, but onely to shuffle words together
on any fashion, is his elaborate non-ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Note Reader, that in his firſt propoſition he puts not
<hi>Belief</hi> at all, (which yet is the onely matter in queſtion)
but in the latter onely; nor dares he truſt it abroad there,
but well guarded with <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>Infallible:</hi> But I
fear not his big words. Let him know, our <hi>tenet</hi> is, that
our Church hath power to oblige, not to an hovering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
belief, but to an abſolute and infallible one: nor
do we fear to affirm, that the Faithful in the Catholick
Church have <hi>infallible certainty</hi> of their Faith, though
they cannot explicate it, or give a Logical account of their
own thoughts.</p>
               <p>It were not amiſs here to let the Reader ſee upon this
occaſion, what Dr. <hi>H</hi>'s manner of anſwering is: of which
his whole book is ful; but one example once put, will
make the Reader eaſily find it's fellows. The queſtion is,
<hi>whether obligation to belief can be without Infallibility:</hi>
He quibbles upon each word, as if he would do ſtrange
things againſt it, and makes up, by his explications, this
worthy propoſition; that <hi>a Church, which it is</hi> (p. 16.
l. 1.) <hi>not ſtrongly probable that it will erre, and</hi> (p. 16.
l. 8) <hi>properly ſpeaking knows not whether it erre or no,
may</hi> (p. 16. l. 16.) <hi>yet oblige men to obedience, and</hi> (them
that cannot ſearch) <hi>to believe</hi> (not poſitively and indeed,
as the Reader muſt conceive) but onely <hi>ſo far as not to
disbelieve;</hi> that is, that her ſelf knowing nothing properly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115675:67"/>
or poſitively, can by conſequence oblige none to believe
any thing properly and poſitively, but to obey onely. Is
not this a fine upshot of ſuch an elaborate anſwer? And
when he hath done this, then he addes another propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Parag</hi> 22. which confeſſes all that he ſtumbled at
before, and which onely was in queſtion. Let us put a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to his manner of diſcourſe. Suppoſe one should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that <hi>a whole Apple is bigger than a half;</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, becauſe <hi>Totum eſt majus parte, A whole is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then a part;</hi> Dr. <hi>H</hi>'s manner of anſwering would
work upon it in this ſort. Firſt, the word [<hi>whole</hi>] may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
a whole Mole hill, or a whole Mountain, a whole
web of cloath, or a whole thred. Next, the word <hi>majus,</hi>
or <hi>greater,</hi> may ſignify greater in longitude, in latitudine,
or in profundity. Laſtly, the word <hi>pars,</hi> may ſignify part
of a Mole hill part of a Mountain, part of a web, &amp;c.
This done, he would joyn theſe together, which are not
the things in queſtion, (as he did in the former of his two
propoſition) and tell us, that ſpeaking of a Mole-hill and
a Mountain, 'tis certain, that part of a Mountain may not
be greater than a whole Mole-hill, and ſo likewiſe part of
the web of cloth to wit, a whole thred, may not be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in longitude than the whole web. Then coming to
the queſtion, adde a parallel to his ſecond propoſition, and
conclude in theſe words; But as for an Apple and it's
part, ſpeaking of the quantity belonging to a body, that is
profundity or bulk, 'tis granted that the whole Apple
is greater than the half one: which might as well have
been granted at firſt, and have excuſed all this trifling.</p>

               <head type="sub">What the Power of binding to Beleef conſiſts in, and how
rationally our Church, how irrationally the Proteſtants
pretend to ſuch a Power: together with a Godly and
edifying Sermon of Mr. H's according to his Doctrine
when he diſputes againſt us.</head>
               <p>IT were not amiſs here, to clear this important point the
better, to lay open in brief what is this Power in the
Church <hi>to bind her Sons to beleef,</hi> and in what it conſiſts.
For I doubt not but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> wonders, and many judicious
Proteſtant Readers may perhaps remain ſollicitous to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
how and in what manner there can be any power to
force &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the Soul to an interiour beleef or aſſent.
But I hope this short hint will make them ſee that this
power is founded upon free &amp; rationall Grounds, not a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
bare command of any authority whatſoever. It is
confeſt then, that as a body cannot be moved locally, but
after a corporeal &amp; quantitative manner, as is it's nature;
ſo neither can a ſoul, which is of it's nature rational, be
moved to aſſent, but by reſons and motives, (whether
true or falſe) and were it moved otherwiſe, it were not
moved as a thing of ſuch a nature, that is, it would not be
a rational ſoul. Now ſince pure Reaſon conſiſts in infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a connexion of two things or notions, becauſe of their
joynt connexion with a third in the premiſſes, and this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
an immediate one (for a connexion which is not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
is in reality none at all, at leaſt to the Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
ſince in that caſe it ſees it not) it follows, that the
Soul is never moved out of pure Reaſon to any aſſent, but
by ſuch an immediate connexion ſeen, that is, by Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and conſequently all aſſents which have not this
originall, ſpring from impurity of paſſion, that is, from vice
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115675:68"/>
Wherefore ſince it is impoſſible, God, who is Eſſential
Sanctity, should command a vice, it follows, that as on the
one ſide either he has left no power to oblige to aſſent, or
if he have, it muſt be founded in <hi>Evidence,</hi> ſo on the other,
if there be any authority on earth which can <hi>evidence</hi> her
Certainty of what she ſayes, that Authority hath <hi>power
to oblige</hi> others in vertue of the ſaid <hi>Evidence</hi> to aſſent to
what she shall affirm, that is, to oblige them to beleef:
for this is no harder a treaty, than to bind them to that
to which their own nature had bound them before-hand,
that is, to aſſent upon Evidence.</p>
               <p>To apply this then to the point in hand. The Church
obliges her Children to reſt and continue in her beleef, by
the ſame motive by which she could oblige them when
they were out of her, to aſſent to her doctrine, ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
it's having been taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles.
This motive is the propoſal of her own Authority, or of
millions and millions of Fathers in the Catholick Church,
all conſpiring to witneſs that thoſe points of doctrine
(things viſible and moſt concerning) were received from
their Anceſtours, as from their, and ſo aſcending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The vertue by which this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or incomparable multitude of witneſſes claims to be
a motive, and to have power to convince the Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and ſo oblige to aſſent to their word, that is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
is the <hi>Evidence</hi> of the treble-twiſted Impoſſibility,
that this Authority either <hi>would</hi> conſpire in any age to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
ſo notorious an untruth, and ſo pernicious to their
own, and their Children's eternal bliſs; or, that they <hi>could</hi>
either erre, or miſtake in things ſo viſible, or even contrive
a conſpiracy to embrace any one errour, conſidering the
ſeveral Countreys in which they liv'd diſpers't, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
their ſeveral natures, obligations, inclinations,
intereſt, and other manifoldly-varying circumſtances; or,
laſtly, if they <hi>would</hi> and <hi>could,</hi> (that is, <hi>did</hi>) atteſt, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115675:69"/>
ſo introduce an errour, that it should not be moſt <hi>viſible</hi>
and palpable in moſt undeniable and manifeſt circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to the whole world, being a change of things openly-evident
in manifeſt and univerſal practice before, and in a
matter of higheſt concernment. Theſe impoſſibilities of
erring in delivering any point of Faith, render that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<hi>evidently infallible</hi> which ſticks cloſe to this
Rule, of delivering onely what she received as thus atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted:
The <hi>Evidence of her Infallibility</hi> obliges a rational
nature to <hi>aſſent</hi> upon ſuch an <hi>Authority,</hi> that is, <hi>to beleeve;</hi>
and conſequently her <hi>Power to oblige Beleef</hi> is as firm as
this Truth, that <hi>Evidence obliges the Vnderſtanding to
aſſent,</hi> which is reduced into this firſt principle, that <hi>Idem
eſt idem ſibi ipſi,</hi> or that <hi>Reaſon is Reaſon;</hi> ſince the act
of Reaſon adhering to truth, is nothing elſe but an aſſent
ſprung from <hi>Evidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this short diſcourſe follows firſt, that our
Churches <hi>Binding her children to beleef</hi> is evidently na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
juſt, charitable, rational and neceſſary; ſince she
obliges them upon no other Ground than that which in
it's own force had pre-obliged their nature to aſſent, to
wit, <hi>Evidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that no man can revolt from the Faith of
ſuch an Authority to any other, but through the higheſt
degree of vice and paſſion; ſince they would be found in
this caſe to aſſent to another, not onely <hi>without Evidence,</hi>
but againſt it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that therefore the Governours of the Church
who proceed according to this <hi>power,</hi> may juſtly punish
and excommunicate thoſe who recede from her <hi>Beleef</hi>
founded in her Authority thus <hi>evidenced;</hi> ſince this receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
muſt ſpring from vice, or a diſorder'd affection in the
will; and vice all the world allows may be punished.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that no tyranny can poſſibly be imputed to
our Church, as long as she proceeds upon ſuch Grounds;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115675:69"/>
ſince she onely governs men according to their nature or
Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that they who adhere to any other fallible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
upon <hi>onely probable,</hi> that is, <hi>inevident</hi> Grounds,
againſt her Authority thus <hi>evidenced,</hi> being therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
(as hath been shown) in the higheſt degree vicious
and paſſionate, if they prove obſtinate in it, ought upon
neceſſity to be Excommunicated, caſt out of the Church,
and ſeparated from the Congregation of the Faithfull.
Reaſon showing plainly, if no good can be done for their
obſtinate Souls, order is to be taken that they do no hurt
to the Souls of others.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, that all who forſake this <hi>infallible</hi> atteſtation
of the Church they were in, called <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> (as
did the Proteſtants in all points wherein they differ from
us) deſerve this Excommunication; ſince they left a <hi>pre-acknowledged
Evidence,</hi> and began to dogmatize upon
<hi>acknowledg'd probabilities</hi> onely; that is, left proceeding
to aſſent in that manner which was acknowledgedly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
connatural and virtuous, and beginning to proceed
in ſuch a manner as is neceſſarily irrational unnatural, and
vicious.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, it follows, that a Congregation which is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
cannot, without the greateſt impudence in the world,
pretend to oblige rational Souls to aſſent upon her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
ſince, if she ſees she may be in the wrong <hi>hic &amp;
nunc</hi> in ſuch a point, she can have no <hi>Evidence</hi> that she is
not actually deceived in it, and ſo wanting <hi>Evidence</hi> to
make good her Authority, she wants whatſoever can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
a rational Soul to <hi>aſſent</hi> upon her Authority.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, it follows hence, that not onely the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
Presbyterians,</hi> &amp;c. may juſtly refuſe to hear the
Proteſtant Church, which acknowledges her ſelf falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but that they ſin if they should hear her; ſince
in that caſe they would be found to <hi>aſſent</hi> to an <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:115675:70"/>
without <hi>evidence</hi> of the <hi>veracity</hi> of that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, it follows, that the Proteſtant Church acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
her ſelf <hi>fallible</hi> (and the like may be ſaid of all
fallible Congregations) cannot even oblige the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
Presbyterians,</hi> &amp;c to behave themſelves quietly
within their Church, and ſubmit to their Government.
For in caſe that <hi>fallible</hi> Congregation oblige her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to a ſubſcription or declaration of their aſſent to her
doctrine, it were a vice either to aſſent without <hi>Evidence
of authority,</hi> which is wanting to a <hi>fallible</hi> Church; or,
ſubſcribe without a real inward aſſent, as the Doctor
himſelf confeſſes: they may then reſiſt ſuch a command
of that Church, and expreſs themſelves contrary and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient.</p>
               <p>Nay more, if that Congregation be fallible, it may
poſſibly be in a damnable errour, and ſome one or more,
may happen to ſee <hi>evidently</hi> that it is in ſuch an errour;
and many of ordinary capacity rationally doubt what the
others ſee: now in that caſe, why may not the former
make account it is their obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to oppoſe that Church,
and let men ſee their ſoul-endangering errour, may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a party againſt her, and defy her as one who would
bring Souls to Hell by her doctrine? As alſo, why may
not the latter (rather than hazard the accepting a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
errour) adhere to this company of Revolters, at
leaſt ſtand neutral between the Church and them?</p>
               <p>Again, ſince it hath been shown they may renounce
the Faith of a fallible Church, why may they not renounce
her Government? ſince her Faith muſt needs be as ſacred
as her Government which depends on Faith, and is ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to it; Government being chiefly to maintain Faith,
and ſuch actions as proceed from Faith. Neither is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
yet to revolt againſt temporal Magiſtrates upon the
ſcore of their fallibility, in caſe they oblige their Subjects
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115675:70"/>
onely to <hi>act</hi> or <hi>obey</hi> according to the civil State, becauſe
that is a Government grounded onely upon natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
inſtituted for natural ends, and plainly evident it
muſt be obey'd; unavoydable inconveniences following
upon diſobedience, which force us to confeſs, there's no
ſafety for our lives or eſtates, without this Obedience.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, it follows, that Dr. <hi>H</hi>'s denying <hi>any company
of men on earth to be Infallible,</hi> and by conſequence, <hi>to
have power to bind to beleef,</hi> is moſt exquiſitely perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
deſtroying at once all beleef, and leaving no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
in the world, nay making it a ſin to beleeve any
Article of the Chriſtian Faith. For ſince neither Scripture
nor the doctrine of the Primitive Church (acknowledged
by Dr. <hi>H.</hi> to have been built upon an Infallible Tradition)
can be evidenced to us, but by ſome Authority faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conveying it down ever ſince that time; if this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
cannot be evidenced to be <hi>infallible,</hi> no man is bound
in reaſon to aſſent or <hi>believe</hi> either Scripture to be God's
word, or the Doctrine to be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, upon her Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
ſince there wants Evidence of that Authority's vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
which can onely oblige to aſſent: nay more, he muſt
needs ſin in precipitating his aſſent without <hi>Evidence</hi> to
ground it on.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, Dr. H. (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 36.) in another place
grants that this univerſal atteſtation (in which we found
the Churche's <hi>Infallibility</hi> and all theſe deductions)
makes one as <hi>certain of a thing, as if he had ſeen it with
his own eyes;</hi> and again confeſſes himſelf <hi>Infallibly certain
of what he hath ſeen with his own eyes:</hi> which is as much as
we either ſay or deſire. Wherefore, the good Doctor doth
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> once both confirm us, and contradict himſelf.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it follows, that it is the height of frivolouſneſs,
for D. <hi>H.</hi> even to pretend excuſe from obligation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
our Church, and aſſent to the doctrine of his own,
without moſt undeniable and rigorous <hi>Evidence</hi> both for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115675:71"/>
the errableneſs of ours, and the inerrableneſs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
Church.</p>
               <p>By theſe brief deductions from that one evident Ground
of the infallibility of Vniverſal Atteſtation, the prudent
Reader will plainly ſee, how conſequently the Catholick
Church proceeds to the grounds of Nature and Reaſon,
&amp; how inconſequently to both the Proteſtant Churches
muſt neceſſarily goe, when they would oblige either to
Government, or Faith: Since <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi>
once renounced, there remains nothing to move the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
to aſſent rationally; nor any thing to move
it at all but paſſion, diſorder'd affections, fear, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many paradoxes ſeem very plauſible and prety, while
they are dreſt up in involving terms, which hide their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity;
yet brought to Grounds and to Practice, show
manifeſtly their shame. The former (to wit</hi> Grounds)
<hi>confute them by showing them</hi> contradictory; <hi>the latter
(that is, Practice) confounds them by showing them</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.
<hi>How</hi> implicatory <hi>Mr. H's doctrine of no power to
bind to beleef is, and how inconſiſtent with Chriſtian Faith,
hath already been manifeſted by bringing it to</hi> Grounds;
<hi>how</hi> abſurd <hi>it is, will quickly be diſcerned by reducing it
into</hi> practice. <hi>Let us imagin then that the Bells chime merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to morning prayer, and that the whole town rings with
the fame and noiſe that Dr. H. reputed the moſt learned
of all the Proteſtant party (who quite confuted the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,
and cut off the neck of</hi> Rome <hi>at one blow, in a book
of</hi> Schiſm, <hi>and has lately, with a great deal of Greek, lopt
off and ſeared the</hi> Hydra-head <hi>from ever growing more,
in his Anſwer to</hi> Schiſm Diſarm'd) <hi>would give them a

coming together to receive edification, after a</hi> dirge

Book of Common-prayer, up ſteps Dr. H. repeats
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115675:71"/>
his Text, and fals to his</hi> Harangue: <hi>In which let us ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
that he exhorts them to renounce all the affections
they have to all that is dear to them in this world, and
place them upon a future ſtate of eternal bliſs, promiſed
by</hi> Chriſt <hi>to all that ſerve him; in particular, let us ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
he earneſtly exhorts them with the Apoſtle,</hi> to ſtand
faſt in the Faith, <hi>and to hold even</hi> an Angel from Heaven
accurſed, <hi>if he taught the contrary; nay telling them
they ought to loſe theirs and their Childrens whole eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
and lay down a thouſand lives, rather than for-goe
their Faith. This done, let us ſuppoſe him to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a period, and conclude (according to his doctrine,
when he diſputes againſt us) in this manner:</hi> To all, this,
dearly beloved, I exhort you earneſtly in the Lord; yet not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withſtanding,
that I may ſpeak candidly and ingenuouſly,
and tell you the plain literall truth of our tenet, neither I,
nor the Church of England, whoſe judgment I follow, are
infallibly certain of this doctrine which I bid you thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
and adhere to. Our (<hi>p. 15. l.</hi> 37. 38.) Church, I

               <p>THe <hi>Cath. Gentl.</hi> mentioned, on the by, four advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
our Church had over any other, <hi>viz. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
Poſſeſſion, Perſuaſion of Infallibility,</hi> and <hi>Pledges
which Chriſt left to his Church for motives of Vnion</hi>
Speaking of the laſt of theſe, Dr. H. tells us here, (<hi>Repl.</hi>
p. 19.) <hi>it is in vain to ſpeak of motives to return to our.
Communion, to them who have not voluntarily ſeparated,
and cannot be admitted to union but upon conditions,
which, without diſſembling and lying, they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe.</hi>
As for the latter part of this excuſe, truly, if <hi>motives
of union</hi> be vain things to be propoſed to them, to bring
them to Vnion, I muſt confeſs I know not what will be
likely to doe it. They pretend to think our doctrine erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
our Church fallible, to which therefore they deem
it diſſimulation and lying to ſubſcribe: what remains then
to inform them right, but to propoſe reaſons and motives
that that doctrine was true, that Church infallible; &amp; that
therefore they might lawfully ſubſcribe with a ſecure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?
But Dr. H. will not heare of motives or reaſons for
Vnion, but ſayes, <hi>'tis in vain to ſpeak of them:</hi> that is, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
to renounce his Reaſon, rather than forgoethe obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
of his Schiſmatical humour: yet he ſayes here, that
this evaſion is <hi>neceſſarily the concluding</hi> this Controverſy:
But why a probability to the contrary should be ſufficient
to oblige his reaſon to that his perſuaſion or aſſurance,
ſo as there may not <hi>ſubeſſe dubium</hi> againſt our rule of
Faith, acknowledg'd infallible (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 36.) at unawares by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115675:73"/>
himſelf, that he will never be either able or willing to
show. And ſo for the former pretence, to wit that they
ſeparated not voluntarily, it hath already been shown
(<hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd,</hi> p. 279.) to be a moſt shameleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth;
that, by their own occaſion, they had voluntarily
renounced our Government, Rule of Faith and doctrines;
and that there wanted onely the punishment for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
voluntary faults, to wit, the Churche's Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
warning the faithful to avoid their company. So
that Dr. <hi>H</hi>'s plea is no other, than as if a Rebel should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
both the Government and Laws of the Land and,
being out-law'd and cut off from the Communion of the
good Subjects for theſe faults, should lay all the blame
on the Governours and Iudges, ſaying, no ſedition nor
diviſion was made in the Common-wealth, till they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law'd
him and his adherents, and warned the good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to live apart from them.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe pledges left by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his Church for
motives of union, which the <hi>Cath. Gent.</hi> made one of our
advantages, they are theſe: The ſubmitting to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of one Head and Paſtour; the agreeing in one
Rule of Faith, to which all our private opinions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
give place as to an infallible Law, to decide al quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
about Faith; the multitudes of viſible exteriour prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
both in ſeveral Sacraments, and alſo divine Service
performed with ſuch magnificence of Ceremonies, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and moſt eſpecially, the coadunation of all the members
of the Church in eating that heavenly food, beleeved by
us to be the true and real Body of our Bleſſed Lord and
Saviour. All theſe and ſome others are ſo many ties and
tokens, which make the Sons of the Catholick Church
take one another for Fellows and Brothers, that is, they
are unto them ſo many <hi>motives of Vnion:</hi> In all which he
is blind, who ſees not that our Church hath a moſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
advantage over all other. Yet Dr. H. aſſures us
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115675:73"/>
that 'tis in vain to ſpeak of thoſe to him; and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his paſſion and diſorder'd affections or Intereſt have
ſo throughly perſuaded him, both <hi>without</hi> and <hi>againſt
Evidence,</hi> and two or three odde teſtimonies, with an <hi>Id

that Vniverſal Atteſtation should erre, have
bred a kind of <hi>aſſurance</hi> in him, <hi>cui non ſubeſt dubium</hi>
(which is all hee requires for his own or his Churche's <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
of Faith, <hi>Rep.</hi> p. 16.) that he profeſſes himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
to heare motives and reaſons, and that <hi>'tis in vain</hi>
to ſpeak of them to him.</p>
               <p>What was meant by the two Advantages, of <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> was ſufficiently explicated by the Cath.
Gentl. in theſe words; <hi>ſuch Antiquity or Poſſeſſion,

than that we enjoy this acknowledgment of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
to have that this Antiquitie and Poſſeſſion for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ages; and that this acknowledgment is a particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to us, ſince the Proteſtants have none ſuch from

us? This being plainly there expreſt by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Gentleman to be his meaning, Dr. H. firſt (<hi>p.</hi> 20.)
shuffles off to <hi>Fraternal Communion:</hi> next, of a Divine
turn'd Lawyer, he cites as an affirmation of the Doctors,

which apply'd means thus much, that, they being more
anciently in poſſeſſion, 'tis to be preſumed that we uſurp't:
So that, till he evidence that they were more anciently in
poſſeſſion, his law availes him nothing. In the mean ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
let him conſider our two advantage; to wit, that we
had a <hi>Poſſeſſion acknowledg'd</hi> before this preſent <hi>poſſeſſion</hi>
of theirs; whereas their pretended <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> before ours is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115675:74"/>
in queſtion and controvertible: for, Mr. H. will not ſay,
that he knows the contrary better than his Church does
her Faith, which, at beſt, he confeſs'd before had but
probability of her not erring: now then, that which is a
probability onely, is in it's own nature liable to diſpute,
and controvertible; ſince it may perhaps be shown falſe
to morrow. Their <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> then, pretended to have been
before ours, is not onely <hi>diſacknowledg'd</hi> by us, but alſo
in it's own nature ſubject to diſpute: ours before theirs,
<hi>acknowledg'd,</hi> and not capable of diſpute. The other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
we have is, that the pretended uſurpation of the
Pope, being of a Supremacy over the whole Church and
all the Bishops in it, muſt needs in all reaſon be moſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the eyes of the whole world: now, ſince it is certain,
they could never evidence it thus viſible, (as appears by
their diverſities of opinions about it's introduction, to be
ſeen in the <hi>Catalogue of Proteſtancy</hi>) that is, they know
not when it came in; conſequently, this conſideration af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
a certain prejudice againſt their former poſſeſſion,
and the pretence of the Pope's Vſurpation. For certainly,
that Authority which could not be uſurp't but moſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and yet the uſurpation is not moſt viſible, was not
uſurp't at all, but was ever. Wherefore our poſſeſſion and
Authority is iuſtly preſumable to have been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued ever
ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s time; ſince the beginning of our Faith could
never be clearly manifeſted, as many Proteſtant Authours
beyond exception confeſs, and onely ſome of them, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to that deſperate task by our arguments, blindly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the contrary: whereas their bearing ſway in this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the world is of confeſt and known original, which
differences us from them by a moſt manifeſt advantage.</p>
               <p>The <hi>perſuaſion of Infallibility</hi> (our fourth advantage
(<hi>p.</hi> 21.) there mention'd) muſt neceſſarily be miſtaken
and wrong apprehended as well as it's fellows: that is now
grown ordinary with Mr. H. and ſo we muſt not wonder
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115675:74"/>
at it I have already shown, that this <hi>perſuaſion</hi> is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
means to oblige the Subjects of any Church to Vnity
of Belief; nay, that there can be no rational<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
at all, where this perſuaſion of the Churche's Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
is not found: which being found in no Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but that of the Catholick Church, she hath conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
an infinite <hi>advantage</hi> above all others in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ad nature of a Church, which is to be a conſerver of
Faith; or rather indeed, it follows hence moſt evidently,
that none other can have the true nature of a Church but
her ſelf. Now Dr. H. in ſtead of telling us I, or no, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Perſuaſion be of ſuch a force as is pretended, in
order to the Vnity of the Faithfull, flies off and ſayes, <hi>this
can have no influence upon them;</hi> though it be the onely
thing which gives fundamentally Being to a Church, as
hath been shown: telling us moreover, for our further
certainty, that <hi>he is ſure the Proteſtants are not ſo perſuaded,
nor ever had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vincing Grounds repreſented to perſuade them
of it;</hi> referring me to a book of his own, called <hi>The View
of Infallibility.</hi> In anſwer, I refer him to <hi>Rushworth's Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,</hi>
and aſſure him that, if he be not blinded with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
or intereſt, he may ſee it there shown as perfectly
as that two and three are five: And as for his Book, I find
no ſuch worthy ſtuffe in theſe, as can invite me to think
an hour well ſpent in peruſing that Brother of theirs.</p>
               <p>After this, going about to vindicate the uncertainty on
the Proteſtant's ſide, he runs (<hi>p.</hi> 21. 22.) again to their
<hi>full</hi> or <hi>verily-perſuaſion;</hi> but never tells us whether this
<hi>full perſuaſion</hi> of theirs ſprung from the light of pure Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that is, Evidence; or from paſſion, intereſt and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
adding a parallel, of <hi>beleeving that King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the eighth was King of this Nation:</hi> the <hi>reaſons</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
notwithſtanding he accounts <hi>fallible,</hi> becauſe <hi>the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of meer men.</hi> Whereas I account it moſt <hi>evident</hi>
and <hi>demonſtrable;</hi> and promiſe him to have acquitted
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115675:75"/>
himſelf better than ever Proteſtant did yet, if he can show
me the thouſandth part of this Certainty, (which he puts
here for a parallel of the Proteſtant's Vncertainty,) for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
point in which they differ from us, that is, for any point
which they have not received as handed down by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Atteſtation of Fore fathers. For, never let him
expect to make a rational man beleeve, that ſcruing or
miſunderſtanding an odde line or two, glean'd for the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
out of Scripture or and old Authour, can by any mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
arrive to the clearneſs of the former ample,
undeniable, uncontroulable Verdict of witneſſes, that King
H. the eighth vas King of this Nation: much leſſe to that
of our Rule of Faith, being an atteſtion of things infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more importing, which a multitude incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
more numerous had ſeen viſible in practice; beſides
other aſſiſtant motives implanted by the Apoſtles (the
Holy Ghoſt eſpecially cooperating) in the hearts of the
firſt faithful, and ſtill continued to this day; which ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
man's nature to the impoſſibility of erring in ſuch an
Atteſtation. This vaſt advantage hath our Rule of Faith
over this inſtance of K. <hi>H</hi>'s reign here: yet I doubt not to
affirm, that the teſtification of the latter renders it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable;
which I thus show.</p>
               <p>This undoubted and never yet-denyed <hi>perſuaſion,</hi> that
K. <hi>H.</hi> the eighth reigned here, imprinted in the hearts of
all in <hi>England,</hi> not onely atteſted by all Fathers in that
Nation, but even by innumerable multitudes in other
Countries, (his foul acts making him famous,) this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion,
I ſay, is an <hi>Effect,</hi> and conſequently ſprung from
ſome <hi>Cauſe:</hi> but no <hi>Cauſe</hi> can be imaginable in reaſon
able either to breed this ſtrong perſuaſion in ſuch a world
of knowing perſons, nor bribe ſo many atteſters to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
of witneſſing ſuch a viſible thing, except the <hi>Being</hi>
of King <hi>H.</hi> and of his Reign: therefore he <hi>was,</hi> or did
reign here; otherwiſe, this <hi>perſuaſion</hi> and atteſtation had
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115675:75"/>
been <hi>effects</hi> without <hi>cauſes,</hi> or (which is all one) without
proportionable cauſes; which being <hi>evidently impoſſible,</hi>
it is alſo <hi>evident</hi> and <hi>demonſtrable</hi> that he <hi>did</hi> rule in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Now, whoever should goe about to anſwer the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi>
by putting ſome <hi>Cauſe</hi> as poſſible to be in it ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable,
and ſo able to produce this ſtrange <hi>Effect,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of K. <hi>H.</hi> the eighth; the very poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would diſgrace it ſelf and the Authour, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of it's efficacity came to be ſcann'd and apply'd to
the Vniverſal and ſtrange <hi>Effect</hi> ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>Again, should a man conſider this ample and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled
atteſtation of it, and all the other motives which
infer it; as King <hi>H</hi>'s Wives, Alliances abroad, Warres,
Acts of Parliaments, Embaſſadours in all parts, Deſcent,
Apoſtatizing, together with the infinite multitude of
Conveyances, Bonds, Iudgments, Foundations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
ſuch other things relating to ſuch and ſuch a
year of his Reign; and, after all theſe fully conſidered,
should notwithſtanding ſeriouſly expreſs his doubt, that
he could not beleeve there was ever any ſuch man: would
not all that heard him, juſtly think him a mad man? If
ſo, then ſurely he muſt have renounc't no leſs than rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Evidence</hi> and Demonſtration, (the onely perfect light
of Reaſon) who can deſerve juſtly ſuch a cenſure. It was
therefore rigorouſly <hi>evident</hi> and demonſtrable, that King
<hi>H.</hi> the eighth <hi>was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, if it be not <hi>evident</hi> and demonſtrable, the
contrary may poſſibly be ſuch, (for one ſide muſt needs
be true &amp; ſo, all truths being connected, in it'ts own nature
demonſtrable:) but it is evidently impoſſible the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
should be demonſtrable, or the motives for it show'd
not-concluding; therefore they concluded demonſtrably.
The <hi>minor</hi> is prov'd clearly: for, firſt, it is not againſt
any natural Science, and conſequently not poſſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable
by natural reaſon; nor yet by any Authority;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115675:76"/>
for, in our caſe, there is an Atteſtation for it, uncontrolled
by any, either orally or by writing: Wherefore there is
left no means poſſible to goe about to confute it, or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
the contrary; it ſelf therefore is moſt perfectly and
moſt ſtrongly evident and demonſtrable, nay impoſſible
to be deemed or pretended to be shown otherwiſe. Bring
not then, Mr. H. this infallibly-and demonſtrably-grounded
inſtance, for a parallel of your vertible and
Wind-mill uncertainty; till you can show you can produce
the million'th part of that Evidence and certainty: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be asham'd to pretend to make head againſt our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
of Faith, (which is of an atteſting Authority incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
more numerous, more clear, and more ſtrongly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by all kind of imaginable aſſiſting circumſtances,
than was that now explicated) with obſcure or misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
ſcraps of dead Authours caſt into what mold you
pleaſe by <hi>Id eſt's,</hi> ſelf-explications, and voluntary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
according to the eaſily-bending nature of words.
That is, blush to have renounc't your Reaſon, in renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Evidence of Authority; to follow unreaſonableneſs,
in aſſenting upon ambiguous probabilities.</p>
               <p>After this, to clear himſelf from denying <hi>Infallibility,</hi>
which denial was charged, and hath been shown <hi>to take
away all beleef and ground of Beleef;</hi> he tells us, (pag.
23.) <hi>It is evident, that beleef is no more than conſent to
the truth of any thing, and the grounds of beleef, ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
as are ſufficient to exclude doubting, to induce
conviction and perſuaſion.</hi> But ſure Mr. H. forgets what
he is about: for to <hi>divine beleef,</hi> which is commanded by
God himſelf, and ſo cannot be ſinfull, not every conſent
ought to ſerve, but a <hi>rational</hi> one, nor any <hi>conviction,</hi> but
ſuch an one as is <hi>rational,</hi> that is, grounded upon <hi>Evidence</hi>
of that Authorities veracity, in that which she propoſes to
be beleeved: which how it can ſtand with her fallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the ſame point, is paſt Dr. H's skil to make good,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115675:76"/>
ſince if it be once known that she can erre in it, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be shown thats he does not, there being no certainer
Authority than her ſelf to teſtify certainly when she hits,
and when she failes: for I hope Dr. H. will not ſay it muſt
be Scripture, without an Interpreter of Scripture, and, if
ſo, who a more certain Interpreter than her ſelf? If he ſay,
she muſt compare her ſelf with other Churche's, he not
onely grants each may erre, but even, (<hi>Repl. p. 15. l.</hi> 32.)
after recourſe had to the ſaid means, he onely puts here,
pag. 16. l. 1. that <hi>it is not ſtrongly probable that ſuch a Church
will erre:</hi> ſo that if she can erre, she does erre, for any
thing any body knows.</p>
               <p>What follows is onely a trifling defence of himſelf for
his bad diſputing. He was accuſed by us of a Schiſm twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
with Hereſy: he defended himſelf, by alledging that
he held not our Church Infallible, which he knows we
charge upon the deniers as the hereſy of hereſies. Now his
excuſe for this Logick is, that he put (<hi>Repl.</hi> p. 24.) <hi>onely
a fiction of caſe:</hi> but 'tis plain he relies upon that <hi>fiction</hi>
as on a real Ground, ſaying there expreſſely (<hi>of Schiſm,</hi>
p 28. 29.) that <hi>he needs give no more diſtinct anſwer than
this, firſt, that they not holding the Church of Rome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
may be allow'd to make ſome ſuppoſitions,</hi> &amp;c.
Again, he ſayes he makes but one, but yet he there puts
down four: ſo that the difficulty is onely this, to determine
in whether place he deſerves moſt to be truſted, or which
of them is the child of his ſecond thoughts. Laſtly, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
falſly upon the Cath. Gentl. (<hi>Repl.</hi> p. 26.) that <hi>he
requires him at the begenning of the diſpute to grant the
(Chvrch of Rome infallible.</hi> Whereas we onely mind him,
that ſince he is accuſed of a Schiſm link't with Hereſy,
he ought to show that his motives bear the weight of a
perfect <hi>Evidence,</hi> notwithſtanding the counterpoiſe of
our Rule of Faith, the Churche's Infallibility, and
not ſuppoſe this firſt, and then run a Voluntary upon
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115675:77"/>
what he had granted himſelf <hi>gratis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have given an anſwer to Dr. H's third Section
of his ſecond Chapter, to which he referred me: In which
I confeſs to have been larger than the rigour of anſwering
required: but the point of <hi>Power to oblige Beleef</hi> was, as
I conceived, very important, and well worth clearing; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I remember to have read it in any other place
fetcht from it's firſt Grounds, that ſo I might refer the
Reader thither. I have alſo vindicated the Cath Gentl.
ſomething more particularly than I propoſed to my
ſelf at firſt, or than was my obligation; which was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this, to clear thoſe paſſages in him which vere coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
with mine. Hereafter I fear the apprehenſion of my
future prolixity will not let me exceed my firſt-intended
limits.</p>

to want the three moſt principal ſorts of Schiſm,

               <p>THe third Chapter in his <hi>Reply</hi> begins with curing his
Diviſion of Schiſm, which was shown by the Cath.
Gentl. to want two of it's beſt limbs, and thoſe too moſt
uſeful in this preſent controverſy (that, to wit, of <hi>Schiſm
from the whole Church,</hi> and from <hi>Authority of Councils</hi>)
&amp; alſo by <hi>S.</hi> W. to be pittifully maimed of the third,
which was againſt ſubjection to ſome one <hi>Superiour.</hi> His
skill employ'd in plaſtering it comes to this, that <hi>all Schiſm
is either in inferiours againſt Superiours, or in equals againſt
equals (Rep.</hi> p. 28.) He should have ſaid <hi>againſt ſome one
Superiour,</hi> in the ſingular; for his Diſcourſe in his book
of Schiſm never look't further; which occaſion'd the
Cath. Gentleman's calling it <hi>Monarchical.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:115675:77"/>
His firſt excuſe for his firſt fault is, that <hi>it is ſtrange to
think, that that man who breaks from the whole Church
was not compriſed in either member of his diviſion, when
certainly he is guilty of both.</hi> This it is to forget one's Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick:
for, let the <hi>man</hi> be where he will, our queſtion is
of the <hi>ſin,</hi> Schiſm againſt the whole Church; which is
therefore not compriſed in any one head, becauſe it is in
an higher nature ſinfull, and ſo exceeds it. Sacriledge
and Patricide, according to the common notions, are
found indeed in every ſimple theft and murther: but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their ſpecifical differences, by which they are
diſtinguish't from them, they exceed them, and ſo are not
compris'd in them. This Particularity then, and Special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>ſchiſmatical guilt,</hi> in breaking from the whole
Church, makes a man in a higher and more <hi>ſpecial</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
faulty. And this is the reaſon why we require, that
the <hi>Specialty</hi> of this Schiſm should (as it ought (be taken
notice of, by ranking it in a <hi>Special</hi> head; which was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by Mr. H. who talk't onely of the petty Schiſms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſome one particular Superiour, not againſt all in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
nor againſt the whole Church. And here when he
is challenged of it, in ſtead of showing us that this greater
<hi>ſin</hi> is compris'd in one of thoſe leſſer heads, he privaricates
from the queſtion which is about the <hi>ſin,</hi> and talks of the
<hi>man;</hi> who is compris'd in his Diviſion, for having done
another ſin, leſs than this, and not for having done this.</p>
               <p>His ſecond excuſe, or rather his continuation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
is the ſaddeſt piece of Logick that ever was read, and
begins at the wrong end. He is accuſed of omitting <hi>Schiſm</hi>
againſt the whole Church, and pretends he treated it as
involved in another, to wit in Schiſm againſt ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Governour, and Schiſm againſt Charity to our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals;
which he proves in theſe words, (<hi>Repl.</hi> p. 28.)
<hi>For how can one ſeparate from the whole Church, unleſs he
ſeparate both from his Superiours and equals too?</hi> which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115675:78"/>
indeed had been to ſome purpoſe, in caſe he had treated of
<hi>Schiſm againſt the whole Church,</hi> and omitted <hi>Schiſm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſome particular Superiour,</hi> or <hi>againſt Equals,</hi>
Otherwiſe, for this purpoſe in hand, he muſt argue in a
quite contrary manner, and put it thus; How can one ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from a particular Superiour, or from his Equals,
but he muſt in ſo doing ſeparate from the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church? and then the wiſe argument had evidently
bewray'd it's weakneſs. In a word, either he means by
<hi>Superiours,</hi> ſome of them onely, and then he runs over
boots into a Contradiction, to get out of a leſs fault, in
which he ſtood wet-shod; for <hi>ſome</hi> of them, cannot be <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
or the <hi>whole</hi> Church: or if, by Superiours, he means <hi>all;</hi>
then let him show me, that, in his Book of Schiſm, he
hath treated of that which is againſt all the Superiours of
the Church, in any <hi>collective</hi> ſenſe; if not, then let him
confeſs, without more shuffling, that he treated not of
<hi>Schiſm againſt the whole Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for his omitting <hi>Schiſm againſt the Authority of
Councils,</hi> he endeavours to clear it, firſt, by ſeeming to
doubt whether Councils have any Authority. <hi>Durum te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
neceſſitas:</hi> in another occaſion I doubt not but he
would extoll to the skies thoſe Councils which depoſed a
Pope; though now, becauſe he had granted them no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
in omitting <hi>Schiſm</hi> againſt them, he can shuffle up
and down at a cheap rate (<hi>Repl.</hi> p. 29. l. 27.) with, <hi>If
Councils have any Authority;</hi> for he is ſure, no man can
poſſibly oppoſe him as long as he ſayes nothing poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but keeps himſelf within the powerfull ſpell of an <hi>If.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us ſee what follows, <hi>if</hi> Mr. H. pleaſes to grant
Councils any Authority: then he tells us, that <hi>this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
will certainly be reducible to paternal power;</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
of a Prieſt, Bishop, Metropolitan, &amp;c. and this both
in Provincial, National, and General Councils. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he aſſignes for his evaſion comes to this, that the of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115675:78"/>
fence againſt the <hi>whole</hi> was conſequently an offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any one there reſiding. True; but muſt the offence
againſt <hi>ſome one</hi> Governour (of which onely he treated)
be neceſſarily an offence againſt them <hi>all,</hi> or againſt the
<hi>whole</hi> Council? otherwiſe what will it avail him; who is
not charged with omitting Schiſm againſt <hi>any particular</hi>
Governour, after having put that which is againſt the
<hi>whole</hi> Church, or the collection of many; but, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
which putting down onely the Schiſms againſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Governours, and omitting that which was againſt
them as collected in a Council? Did ever man's Reaſon
run counter in this manner, or his inſincerity ſo reſolutely
perſiſt never to acknowledge any lapſe? that, whereas it
is as evident as noon-day, that one may diſſent from any
one Bishop, in his grounds, and yet conſent to the reſt;
ſtill he will needs prove the contrary, and that the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to ſome one ſort of paternal Governour, is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to all.</p>
               <p>Again, though a Bishop have a kind of <hi>paternal</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over a Prieſt, a Metropolitan over a Bishop, &amp;c.
and ſo the diſobedience of theſe Inferiours would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Paternal</hi> power (as Dr. H. calls his firſt Head:)
yet what <hi>Paternal</hi> power hath a Company of Bishops
over a ſingle Bishop; or a Council, conſiſting of three
Patriarchs and five hundred Bishops, over one ſingle Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch?
It is evident then, that should this Patriarch
rebel againſt the common decrees of all the reſt, he could
not be called a Schiſmatick againſt <hi>Paternal</hi> power; and
ſo, according to Dr. H's diviſion, would be no Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
at all: ſince there is no Authority there which could
be ſaid to be <hi>Paternal</hi> in reſpect of him, himſelf being
coequally high, that is, placed in the top of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Hierarchy with the reſt of the other Patriarchs, and
a Father in an Eccleſiaſtical ſenſe over all the reſt. Their
power therefore over him conſiſts in the <hi>collective</hi> force of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115675:79"/>
ſo many united; which makes them conſiderable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of him, as a whole compared to a part. Now then,
ſince Dr. H cannot even pretend to have treated of a
Schiſm againſt any <hi>collective</hi> power, but againſt an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
conſiſting in higher rank or degree onely; 'tis
moſt evident to the moſt ordinary Vnderſtanding, that
he omitted Schiſm againſt Authority of Councils.</p>
               <p>After all this adoe he confeſſes here, (<hi>Rep.</hi> p. 30.)
that he treated not <hi>ſpecially</hi> of Schiſm againſt General
Councils; that is, he confeſſes his <hi>Diviſion</hi> of Schiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient;
which was onely objected. No, I had forgot;
he onely goes about to give reaſons, why he did not treat
it <hi>more ſpecially:</hi> by which pretty expreſſion the good
Reader is to be made beleeve, that he had treated of it <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,</hi>
and onely omitted to handle it <hi>more ſpecially;</hi>
whereas, he purpoſely and profeſſedly waved the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it at all in this Controverſy; as is to be ſeen, <hi>Of
Schiſm,</hi> p. 60. Ad now, (ſo exquiſite is his shuffling
art) after he had labour'd to produce proofs, that he did
treat of Schiſm againſt Councils, he brings his excuſes
why he did not doe it, <hi>ibid. Firſt becauſe Councils were
remedies of Schiſm.</hi> But ſince they remedied them autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively,
and with ſuch an Authority as, in compariſon
of any one degree of power by him treated, was as it were
of an Vniverſal in reſpect of a particular: the Schiſm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them was by conſequence proportionably (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
improportionably) greater; and ſo deſerved in all
right an eminent place of it's own in his <hi>diviſion.</hi> Next, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are <hi>extraordinary and not ſtanding Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
I anſwer, they are likewiſe of an extraordinary
Authority, as hath been shown; and therefore could not
merit to be ſlighted by him. His third is, becauſe this
was not <hi>a conſtant ſort of Schiſm, but upon accidental
emergencies.</hi> That is, his treatiſe of Schiſm doth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
forbid a man to be a Schiſmatick in an higher ſort
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115675:79"/>
of Schiſm, ſo it happen upon occaſion; but takes care firſt
and <hi>more ſpecially</hi> that he be not a Schiſmatick in one of
thoſe <hi>conſtant ſorts of Schiſm,</hi> though it be of far leſs guilt.
His fourth excuſe (as I reckon them) is, becauſe <hi>they are
now morally impoſſible to be had.</hi> Very good: his Church
is accuſed by us of Shiſm againſt General Councils alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
paſt; and Dr. H. in this book entitled their <hi>Defence,</hi>
therefore treats not particularly of Schiſm againſt them,
becauſe they are morally impoſſible to be had at preſent,
and for the future: though, <hi>towards the end</hi> of the world
he thinks it <hi>probable</hi> there may be one: Of which divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his I can give no better reaſon than this, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi>
who is to be then the Vniverſal ſecular Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and by conſequence, according to Mr. H's, grounds,
the Head of God's Church, or Supreme in Eccleſiaſtical
affaires, will doe Chriſtianity that favour as to gather a
General Council. This, I ſay, if any, muſt be his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
for the reaſon given by him here, why they are <hi>now
morally impoſſible to be had,</hi> is, <hi>becauſe the Chriſtian
world is under ſo many Empires;</hi> and when they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be united into one towards <hi>the end of the world,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be under <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> I confeſs my ſelf unable to
prognoſticate.</p>
               <p>His laſt excuſe is, (<hi>Repl.</hi> p. 31. l. 2.) <hi>becauſe the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
ſort of Schiſm, charged by the Romaniſts, is the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
out the Bishop of Rome.</hi> I anſwer, that we charge not
the Proteſtant with a ſimple Schiſm, but a decompound
one, involving alſo hereſy in each of it's parts. Firſt, with
a Schiſm from the whole Church, in renouncing the Rule
and Root of all our Faith, Vniverſal Oral Tradition of
immediate Fore-fathers, and by conſequence, ſeparating
themſelves from the whole Body of the Faithful, as Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
next, with renouncing the Authority of Councils,
proceeding upon <hi>this Ground</hi> in declaring things of Faith:
and laſtly, with not onely diſobeying, but diſacknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115675:80"/>
the Authority of the Pope, recommended to us by
both the former. And it ſeems ſtrange that Mr. H. should
goe about to clear the ſufficiency of his <hi>diviſion,</hi> by recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to our <hi>charging</hi> or not charging of Schiſm: whereas
he has not taken notice of any of theſe three Schiſms
charged againſt him; but onely of petty ones againſt the
<hi>Paternal</hi> power of a Bishop, Patriarch, &amp;c. which may
be conſiſtent with a guiltleſneſs from the other three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
ones. He promiſed us in his <hi>Anſwer,</hi> p. 8. 9. that he
<hi>had reſcued the Catholick Gentleman's letter from the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
in the birth by the Printer's miſcarriages;</hi> yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
it here a privy courteous-diſcourteous pinch, by
putting the Printer's miſtake of <hi>conciliatory</hi> for <hi>concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
to be <hi>the Cath. Gentl. pleaſure to call it ſo,</hi> pag 31.
l. 10. 11. This done, he objects, that this <hi>conciliary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
cannot with any propriety be ſaid to be in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion
of the Churches.</hi> Nor did the <hi>Cath. Gentl.</hi> ſay it
was properly ſo called: it ſufficeth us if it be equivalent,
as doubtleſs it is. For a private Bishop or Patriarch is no
otherwiſe a Schiſmatick againſt them gathered together,
than in diſſenting from the joynt-expreſſion of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:
if then their votes be ſufficiently expreſt and teſtify'd,
either by communicatory letters, or ſome other equally-certain
way; while they live diſperſed; why should not
the oppoſing his conſent of theirs be equally a Schiſm,
as when they are united?</p>
               <p>But Schiſm againſt this Authority of theirs Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
ſayes, (<hi>parag. ult.) is moſt properly compriſed under the
Head of Communion Fraternal,</hi> treated by him <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.
9. 10. and there called <hi>Schiſm againſt mutual Charity.</hi> Not
conſidering that in the Church there muſt be unity in
the <hi>Vnderſtandings</hi> of the Faithful in a general rule of
Faith, as well as of their <hi>Wills</hi> in mutual Charity; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
alſo of which belongs to them more particularly as
they are Sons of the Church, that is, Faithfull: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115675:80"/>
there may be ſeveral breaches of thoſe two Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
ſo that certainly he muſt be a very proper man in
the art of method, who can think that a Schiſm or breach
of the former, is moſt properly compriſed (as he ſayes here)
under that latter: yet this method Dr. H. will vindicate,
as indeed he may doe any thing after his manner. See his
<hi>confuſion for method ſake, Schiſm Diſarm'd,</hi> p. 230.</p>
               <p>To theſe former objections now rehearſed, he at leaſt
pretends an Anſwer, ſuch as it is; but to other exceptions
ſufficiently layd home to him, <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd, p.</hi> 32.
33. he thought it ſafeſt to give none at all. He was asked
there, (and I ask him here again) why he omitted <hi>Schiſm
againſt the Head of God's Church?</hi> He cannot avoid by
ſaying, that this is <hi>not charg'd upon them,</hi> it being, as he
here confeſſes, <hi>the principal Schiſm objected, p.</hi> 31. l. 2. 3.
Will he ſay it is an uſurpation? Let him hold a while, till
he hath proved it, and in the mean time let him tell us how
hainous a Schiſm it is, to renounce it without legitimate
proof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he was ask't, why, to ſtate things indifferently,
he treated not of Schiſm againſt the Head of the Church,
as abſtracted from an Eccleſiaſtical Governour, (the
Pope) and a Secular Magiſtrate, (the King, Emperour,
&amp;c.) for ſure the diſobeying or renouncing this Head,
muſt needs be a greater Schiſm than that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe reckon'd up by him, who are all under this
Head.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he was ask't, why he treated not at leaſt of
Schiſm againſt the Secular-Eccleſiaſtical Head, King,
Emperour, &amp;c. and let us know what kind of Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
we are, for renouncing his Authority in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
matters? His juriſdiction, according to Mr. H. is <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
in ſuch affaires:</hi> ſince then, the diſobeying or reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
any Authority takes it's meaſure of faultineſs from
the excellency of the Authority it oppoſes, he ought to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115675:81"/>
have let us know that we were <hi>ſupremely</hi> &amp; in the higheſt
manner Schiſmaticks, for denying the King's Eccleſiaſtical
Iuriſdiction. But alas! this aiery Supremacy of Kings in
ſacred matters is ſuch an addle piece of Eccleſiaſticall
Authority, that though they pretend it, to avoid the
Pope's Iuriſdiction, yet (as it appeares) they decline to
own it themſelves as much as they can, upon occaſions;
leſt, coming to a controverſial diſcuſſion, it bewray it's
weakneſs by the abſurdity of ſome neceſſary conſequence
or other iſſuing from it. Iuſtly therefore did <hi>Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

caſting up the account of Mr. H's <hi>Diviſion of
Schiſm,</hi> (p. 34.) charge him <q>to have omitted the three
principal Schiſms againſt Government, and thoſe not
onely principal in themſelves, but alſo ſolely importing
the preſent controverſy: and onely mentioning thoſe
which were not objected, and ſo nothing at all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

exquiſite alwayes, but in handling this queſtion hath
excell'd himſelf: we will clear the way towards the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it, by premiſing theſe few notes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is agreed upon between us, that the <hi>Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical</hi>
power is diſtinct from the <hi>Patriarchal,</hi> and (<hi>of
Schiſm p. 54. l.</hi> 19. 20. and <hi>p. 56. l.</hi> 5. 6. 7.) of a leſs Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and extent.</p>
               <p>Next, it is affirmed by Dr. H. <hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 55. that <hi>the
Authority of the Bishop was correspondent to the Defenſor
Civitatis; that of the Arch-Bishop or Metropolitan, to
the Preſident of every Province;</hi> that of a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> to
the <hi>Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>utenant or Vicarius;</hi> and in general, that <hi>the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Order follow'd the Political.</hi> This I onely take
notice of as an affirmation of his, not granting it to be
univerſally true; nor doth he prove it was ſo, otherwiſe
than by <hi>Origen's</hi> ſaying, <hi>It is fit it should be ſo.</hi> For, the
Councils of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where this
was determin'd, were held long after this Order in the
Eccleſiaſtical Iuriſdictions in <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> time, of which
he ſpeaks here; and ſo their teſtimonies rather prejudice
it, than prove it: for had it been ſo univerſally practiced
before, what need was there of ordering it by following
Councils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things being ſo (as is moſt evident and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable)
let us ſee how incomparably Dr. H. blunders in
this queſtion.</p>
               <p>His firſt and fundamental blundering is, that he would
conclude againſt the extent of the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> power, by
impugning the farther extent of he <hi>Metropolitical:</hi> whoſe
Authority notwithſtanding he acknowledged higher, his
Iuriſdiction larger; as the ſecond note shows. Now,
that he indeed impugned a Metropolitical power onely
in ſtead of a Patriarchal, is manifeſted; both becauſe he
impugnes this latter in the 17. <hi>parag.</hi> ordained to treat of
Metropolitical power onely, (his treating of Primates
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115675:82"/>
and Patriarchs not beginning till <hi>parag.</hi> 21.) as is moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to the Reader's eyes, which Dr. <hi>H.</hi> would yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude;
as alſo becauſe himſelf confeſſes it, <hi>of Schiſm,</hi> p. 50.
l. 18 19. So that he would conclude againſt the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
power, which himſelf granted to extend to many
Provinces, (<hi>of Schiſm,</hi> p. 56. l. 6.) by arguing againſt
Metropolitical, which himſelf granted to extend but to
one (<hi>of Schiſm,</hi> p. 55. l. 22. 23. and 26.); and ſo infer
the no-farther extent of the former, out of the no-farther
extent of the latter, after he had acknowledg'd the former
of much farther extent than the latter was Is not this a
moſt shameful and unconſcionable ſleight, to mingle and
jumble two Authorities together for his own ends, in
that very Chapter where he pretended to treat of them
diſtinctly?</p>
               <p>His next manifold blundering is, to bring teſtimonies,
which he tells the Reader here, (<hi>Rep.</hi> p. 32. 33.) <hi>manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſtinguish't the Province of the Bishop of Rome, from the
Province of Italy; which</hi> (he aſſures us) <hi>could not have had
truth in them, if the Province of the Patriarch of Rome
extended to all Italy:</hi> and yet not one word is found in
any of the teſtimonies making mention of the Patriarchy,
nor yet of the Province of the Bishop of Rome at all:
nay the three firſt onely mention <hi>the City of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is this, as cited by himſelf; (<hi>Rep</hi> p. 33.) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
&amp;c. <hi>Let the houſe be delivered to thoſe to whom the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop
through Italy, and the City of Rome should decree it.</hi>
The ſecond, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>The holy Synod aſſembled from
Rome, and Spain, France and Italy</hi> The third, <hi>foure
hundred Bishops, both from great Rome, and from all Italy
and Calabria.</hi> Now ſuppoſe, inſiſting on the Grounds of
mine own cauſe, I should onely reply that they mention'd
<hi>Rome</hi> in particular for eminency of Authority, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction
of it; were it not a thouſand times more
likely on my ſide, there being no City particulariz'd but
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115675:82"/>
this in the teſtimonies? for all the reſt are Regions or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
Again, were the teſtimonies moſt expreſs for the
Roman Province; yet if Mr. H. mean't honeſtly, that is,
to ſpeak of the Metropolitical Iuriſdiction onely (as he
pretended, and as the place properly required,) then
what had he concluded? ſince the proving the <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Iuriſdiction leſs than all <hi>Italy,</hi> proves not that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal</hi>
reach't not much farther. But, to come home to
the teſtimonies, that the Reader may ſee what a ſtrong
diſputant Dr. H. is in his own way: I would gladly ask,
who told him that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>The City,</hi> &amp;, <hi>Great Rome,</hi> as it is in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies)
muſt needs ſignify ſo manifeſtly <hi>the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of Rome?</hi> So that, if he infer a Contradiſtinction,
and ſo a limitation of Iuriſdiction from theſe words; he
muſt conclude that neither the <hi>Metropolitical</hi> nor <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal</hi>
Iuriſdiction of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> reach't beyond
it's own walls: which being acknowledg'dly impoſſible,
it is impoſſible theſe teſtimonies should mean a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Authority from <hi>Italy,</hi> but an
Eminency of his Dignity, which occaſion'd his particular
mentioning. Thus, the very teſtimonies which he produced
againſt us, will needs ſpeak for us, notwithſtanding his
prompting them to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The fourth Teſtimony (<hi>ex provinciâ Italiae, Civitate
Mediolanenſi, ex Vrbe Roma, quod Sylveſter Epiſcopus
miſit ex Provinciâ Romanâ, Civitate Portuenſi,</hi> &amp;c. is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a fit teſtimony for Dr. H. to blunder in, being not
intelligible in the Latin, and (as he cannot but know) very
corrupt: eſpecially being held for ſuch in naming the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
which met there. And were it beyond exception,
yet is it very explicable to mean the Pop'es Metropoliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Iuriſdiction, never ſo much as naming his Patriarchal.</p>
               <p>His third blundering is his ſelf-contradiction; a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
evil accompanying always the defence of a bad cauſe.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115675:83"/>
All his endeavours hitherto had been bent to limit the
Pope's <hi>Patriarchy</hi> to a particular Province of <hi>Italy;</hi> buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſtill all the way upon the neceſſity that <hi>the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Order should follow the Political:</hi> yet, treating
of <hi>Primates</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs, (of Schiſm,</hi> p. 54.) he gives
ſuch doctrine as, upon the ſame grounds, muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the ſaid Patriarchy did extend to all <hi>Italy.</hi> He
tells us there, that <hi>Conſtantine the great inſtituted four
Praefecti Praetorio; two in the Eaſt, as many in the Weſt:
of the Western, one at Rome, another at Triers.</hi> Now then,
let the Eccleſiaſtical Order (as Mr. H. will have it) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Political; and we muſt have ſome Eccleſiaſtical
Governour at <hi>Rome</hi> of equally-extended and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Authority to the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> that
is, to all <hi>Italy</hi> at leaſt: This could not be (as he confeſſes)
<hi>Metropolitical</hi> Authority in the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore
a <hi>Patriarchal</hi> one. The Pope's <hi>Patriarchy</hi> then even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own Grounds, included all <hi>Italy;</hi> nay all the
Weſt, except that part which the pretended Patriarch of
<hi>France</hi> muſt be imagin'd upon the ſame Grounds to have
had. And ſince the <hi>Praefect</hi> at <hi>Triers</hi> was called (<hi>of Schiſm,</hi>
p. 54.) <hi>Praefectus Praetorio Galliarum,</hi> (as Dr. H. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes;)
conſequently to his Grounds, it muſt follow,
that the Eccleſiaſtical power correſponding to this Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
muſt have onely <hi>France</hi> under him; the other at
<hi>Rome,</hi> all the Weſt beſides. So that at unawares, though
he will not grant his <hi>Patriarchy</hi> to extend to the whole
Weſt, which is his due; yet Mr. H's own grounds grant
the Pope all but <hi>France,</hi> which is ten times more than the
Suburbicarian Province, his former too niggardly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
If he reply that the Patriarchal power correſponds
to the <hi>Vicarij</hi> onely, and not to that of the <hi>Praefecti Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio:</hi>
then, beſides that all his Grounds of the neceſſary
proportion of the Eccleſiaſtical to the Secular power tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which hold not in the main ſubordinate Magiſtrate,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115675:83"/>
to wit the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio,</hi> to whom he will have no
Eccleſiaſtical dignity correſpond; beſides this, I ſay, his
foreſaid teſtimony of <hi>Origen</hi> cited for him, <hi>Reply</hi> 14. is
abſolutely againſt him. So ſad a piece of Scholarship it
is to cite Teſtimonies without firſt laying Grounds, which
onely can make teſtimonies hang together. Out of which
it is evident, that all the ſtrength of his pretended limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Pope's Patriarchy, is finally reduced to that
Authority from <hi>Ruffinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then as for <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his teſtimony, ſaying that
<hi>the Bishop of Rome was by the Nicene Canon authoriz'd,
Suburbicariarum Eccleſiarum ſollicitudinem gerere,</hi> this
being the main buſineſs which occaſion'd this debate, and
gave birth to this imagin'd limitation of the Pope's <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchate,</hi>
we shall take a litle pains to fetch it from it's
firſt Grounds, by showing the ſenſe of that Canon: by
which will be ſeen how great a knave this Paraphraſt
was whom Dr. H. pretends to vindicate. The words of
the Council, upon which this Interpreter works are theſe:
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
To which I cannot imagin a ſenſe more proper
than this, that <hi>the Bishops of Egypt, Lybia and Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis

the Pope had uſed to hold them for ſo.</hi> The reaſon
of my conjecture is, becauſe the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>quando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidem,</hi>
manifeſts that the words following are the reaſon
of the Decree precedent. This being ſo, who ſees not how
pittifully this diſcourſe hangs together, that thoſe Bishops
shall be under the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſeeing the
Pope hath under him I cannot tell what or whom?
whereas (however our Adverſaries may pretend the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
ſenſe of one of the parts falſe, yet) themſelves muſt
confeſs, that there is no difficulty in the formal coherence
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115675:84"/>
of the whole, if it be ſuppoſed to ſignify thus, That he
shall have thoſe for his Subjects, becauſe the Pope is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to hold them for ſuch or to judge it ſo.</p>
               <p>This is yet more confirm'd, becauſe in both Languages
it is evident that the Latine <hi>Hoc</hi> and the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly refer any thing, but the thing decreed; to
wit, that the Bishops named should be ſubject to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> This explication holding, (and
hold it muſt till Mr. H. can show me a better, that, is, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
which shall agree better with the words, and make
better ſenſe; which will be never) two things follow for
us: Firſt, that it was the Pope's cuſtome to handle and
judge matters belonging to the <hi>Patriarchy</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria:</hi>
Next, that the Council govern'd it ſelf in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
matter by the cuſtome of the Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi>
Both which infer, in all probability, his higher Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and make for us, though intended otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Some Interpreters indeed are of opinion that this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
was intended to order the Iuriſdiction of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs:</hi>
but this is a perfect Chimerical imagination,
originiz'd from the inve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of thoſe whoſe hatred againſt
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> occaſion'd by their own guilt, made
them willing to ſay any thing in prejudice of Her, though
without all Ground either in the letter of the Canon (as
hath been shown) or in the hiſtory of the Councils: for,
nothing is more evident in this latter, than that there was
treated in the cauſe of <hi>Meletius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Licopolis</hi>

thus, no man, unleſs driven by the deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

ſuch ſenſe out of the words of the Canon.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, 'tis granted that Schiſmaticks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
make this Interpretation of it: whoſe opinions
were they any thing prejudicial to our Cauſe, (as they are
not, but moſt weak, being of Adverſaries;) yet they are
made incomparably weaker by having <hi>Ruffinus</hi> for their
Patron and firſt Founder of this Interpretation: Who
alſo (to come nearer our queſtion) proceeding upon this
former conceit, added the word <hi>Suburbicarias,</hi> without
all Ground or show of Ground; whether out of ſillineſs
and ignorance of propriety of Speech, meaning to ſignify
by that word all the Weſtern Churches under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> (whoſe ſubjection to the Pope
his eyes teſtify'd and other Schiſmaticks confeſs;) or out
of knavery and malice, it is uncertain: This, by the way,
is certain, that an irregular proceeding and miſcarriage,
ſprung from both, may juſtly be expected from <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, becauſe this language of mine againſt this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt
may be imagin'd to have ſprung from paſſion, by
Dr. H. and ſome of his particular Friends; who, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
upon their Ground of uncertainty and indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Religion, have got a conceit that the preſerving of
courteſy is more worth than the preſerving of ſouls from
eternal damnation; and that, though one who does ſuch
a miſchief be a knave and a fool both, yet he cannot
without incivility and ſcurrility be shown plainly to be
either: again, becauſe Mr. H. is ſuch a veneratour of
Antiquity, that he deemes any teſtimony, nay any one
obſcure word of any either old-knave or old-fool (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he lived but in the ancient times) very competent to
found his Religion on, and worthy his vindication, ſo it
ſeem for his purpoſe: we will ſee whether the character

given <hi>Ruffinus</hi> by other Authours beyond all exception
be more moderate than <hi>S.</hi> W's, &amp; what unanſwerable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices

which Dr. H. here undertakes to vindicate.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>S. Hierom</hi> tells us, (<hi>contra Ruff. Apol.</hi> 2.) that
<hi>Ruffinus was excommunicated and cauteriz'd for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi>

<hi>than the ſentence of a peaceable Town.</hi> And again,
in the ſame book, ſpeaking of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his Confeſſion of
his Faith, which he feigned to have been approved by the
Bishop of <hi>Italy,</hi> he asks him <hi>how Italy should approve
that which Rome had rejected, and how the Bishops should
receive that which the Apoſtolick See had condemned?</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
to theſe (which makes his prejudice moſt notorious,
and ſo his teſtimony moſt invalid) that he writ his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
after the entrance of <hi>Alaricus</hi> into <hi>Italy:</hi> that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Popedome of <hi>Innocentius,</hi> Succeſſour of <hi>Anaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius:</hi>
and ſo had as much reaſon to write in prejudice of
that See, as an incorrigible and obſtinate Heretick could
have: having been excommunicated by the ſame See be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he writ. Hence it is that he never meets with any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to ſpeak of the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but he
ſpits his venome, as may appear <hi>Euſeb. hiſt. Eccleſ. l. 5.
cap</hi> 24. where, ſpeaking of Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> he adds of his
own, in one place, one whole line, in another two in his
prejudice. Is not this then a fit Authou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to be firſt alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
afterwards vindicated by his fellow-brother and

                  <hi>prejudice,</hi> which make his <hi>knavery</hi> very credible: now.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as for his doltish <hi>ignorance,</hi> he was the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of that and all future ages for eminency in that talent.
Some inſtances of it may be; that he (<hi>in hiſt. Eccleſ.

Iames Bishop of the Apoſtles;</hi> of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

of <hi>Chorepiſcopus</hi> (ſpoken of by the eighth Canon of the

him to be ſo unskilfull in either language, that he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for a Greek by the Latines, and for a Latin by the
Grecians. Muſt not he be a very wiſe man, who ſticks
not, firſt to build upon, next to vindicate ſo wiſe an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>knavery</hi> and <hi>folly</hi> are leſs intolerable, if practiſed
modeſtly and warily: but <hi>temerity</hi> and <hi>audacity</hi> are the
gallantry of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his former faults; he practiſes them
when and where he pleaſes; and ſo his teſtimony becomes
more perfectly fit for Dr. H's cauſe. S. <hi>Hierom (ibid.</hi>)
challenges him, that he knew in his conſcience, how he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
detracted, and changed things as he liſted. <hi>Eraſmus,</hi>
in his Preface upon S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> ſayes that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> took
to himſelf, not the liberty of an Interpreter, but the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of a Contaminatour of other men's writings. And
(<hi>Annot. in Chron. Euſeb. anno</hi> MMLXV.) <hi>Scaliger</hi> notes
it to be his cuſtom to omit, pervert and change the texts,
as he pleaſed. Laſtly, if Dr. H. yet makes account he
can vindicate the ſufficiency of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his Authority
againſt ſo many oppoſers; I will adde for an upshot the

that cauſe muſt be, which drives it's Patrons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon ſuch a barbarous, heretical, malicious, and ſilly
fellow's Authority; who wanted both ordinary learning,
and common honeſty, the onely things which can give
him any Authority at all; and this in the judgment of
perſons beyond all exception either of ignorance or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
               <p>This miſerable and ruinous teſtimony, upon which yet
our Adverſaries build ſo much, being reſolv'd into the
rubbish of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his defects; it would not be much
amiſs to try whether our teſtimonies for the Pope's <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchy</hi>
over all the Weſt be eſtablish't upon better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
than this which gave the ground of retrenching it
to <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his followers. St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> ſpeaking (<hi>Baſil. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</hi>
10.) of him as <hi>Patriarch,</hi> calls him <hi>The Coryphaeus</hi>
(or <hi>Head) of the Weſtern Churches. S. Hierom</hi> makes
account that, (<hi>Hier. ad Marc. Presb. Celed. Epiſt.</hi> 77.)
to be condemned with Pope <hi>Damaſus</hi> &amp; with the Weſt,
is the ſelf-ſame thing. But, becauſe the teſtimony of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
is freeſt from favour and partiality; the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
given by ſuch is much more ample and valid. To
theſe therefore let us have recourſe; I mean the Greek
Schiſmaticks: who, though the competition between the
Eaſtern and Weſtern Church provoked them to retrench
the Pope's Patriarchat as much as they could poſſibly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify;

thou ſeeſt, Reader, three teſtimonies, in themſelves moſt
ample and expreſs, of Authours beyond all pretence of
partiality towards us; whoſe intereſt and paſſion ought
rather have obliged them to detract than ſuperadde to
the Pope's Iuriſdiction. Not were they leſs ſecure from
opinion of ignorance; the quality of Archbishop in one
of them, and of profeſt Writers for the Greeks in both,
rendering them not liable either to exception of ſupine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or want of knowledge. Iudge then again, how bad
that cauſe muſt be, which can oblige men, rational enough
in other buſineſſes, to refuſe aſſent to a Verdict thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd,
and adhere to a bare word, capable of a different
(and ſo unprejudicial) ſignification, as coming from an

yet claim no credit; as being onely his word who hath

proved, it was not neceſſarily conſequent, that the Pope
had therefore no Authority over the Church, ſince there
might be other Acts of Vniverſal Authority beſides ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of Councils.</p>
               <p>For anſwer, Dr. H. refers me to his <hi>Reply, p.</hi> 38. where
nothing at all is found to ſtrengthen the two former weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of his conſequences: nor yet indeed the latter, ſince
he does not undertake to show that there can be no other
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115675:88"/>
Acts of ſupreme Authority beſides gathering of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils;
which if there can, then thoſe Acts can denominate
the Pope Head of the Church, notwithſtanding the defect
in the nor performance of the other; and, by conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
his argument of not being Head of the Church, from
not gathering Councils, is at an end.</p>
               <p>Yet ſomething he pretends here, to make good this
latter defect; to wit, that this Authority <hi>of Convoking
Councils is inſeparable from the ſupreme power, is moſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtical
of it,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas indeed this Convoking
of Councils is no ordinary Act of any ſtanding Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or Government, but an extraordinary affair, ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
from ſome neceſſity or extremity; and ſo, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
preſſing, may be performed by him or them who
can beſt provide for that extremity: Which, if other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
agree, is moſt fitting to be ordered by the
Pope, whoſe univerſal ſuperintendency qualifies him for
both care and knowledge of the Churche's wants. But if
Mr. H. means it is <hi>inſeparable,</hi> ſo that it cannot be done
without the Pope's expreſs and actual orders, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by any but the Pope himſelf; he is in a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take:
For, it is very well known that in divers caſes it is
otherwiſe. As, ſuppoſe the See be vacant, or the Pope
himſelf be unſound in Faith, be diſtracted, or kept in cloſe
priſon; or in caſe there be an Anti-pope which makes the
title dubious, &amp;c. In which caſes the Cardinals have
power to call a Council, or the Bishops to aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
And, in general, whenſoever there is an extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
damageable to the publick, nor poſſible to be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
by him to whom that duty moſt fittingly (and ſo,
rightfully) belongs; any one that hath ſufficient power
and skill, let him be Patriarch, Bishop, Prince, or private
man, not onely may, but ought apply both, as much as in
him lies, to prevent the harme of the publick. 'Tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
then that the notion of the actual power to gather
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115675:88"/>
General Councils, is not the very notion of the Pope's
Authority, nor (as Mr. H. expreſſes it) <hi>Characteriſtical</hi> of
it, or <hi>inſeparable</hi> from it; ſince it has been shown, that
the one can be without the other.</p>
               <p>To this proof from gathering Councils, he proceeds to
alledge ſome Teſtimonies, (<hi>Reply p.</hi> 39) that there was
not <hi>anciently, (beſides the Prince or Emperour) any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,</hi>
or (as the Doctor ſtrangely expreſſes it) <hi>any ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
genus,</hi> and <hi>that the Bishop of Rome was not this ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
genus.</hi> It is a pleaſant thing when thoſe men will
be nibbling at wit, who never knew how to manage the
knack. Would not <hi>Supreme Bishop or Governour</hi> have
ſerved, without being thus unfortunately witty in calling
it a <hi>Summum genus?</hi> and then to tell us, that a particular
man is not a <hi>Summum genus.</hi> When we learn'd Logick,
we were told that a <hi>Summum genus</hi> was perfectly and
actually included in every Individual conteined under it:
I hope the Pope's power is not found, on this fashion, in
every Prieſt. But let us take a view of his teſtimonies;
which are reduced to two heads: to wit, thoſe which
would prove the Pope no <hi>Summum genus,</hi> from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of Appeals to him; and thoſe which would conclude
him no <hi>Summum genus,</hi> from titles and names deny'd
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe concerning Appeales which muſt manifeſt the</hi>
individual <hi>perſon of the Pope to be no</hi> Summum genus,
<hi>are, Firſt, from the</hi> Milevitan <hi>Council,</hi> (Repl. p. 39. <hi>&amp;</hi>
40.) forbidding that Prieſts should appeale to any forrein
power, but onely to the African Councils or their own
Primates: <hi>Secondly, from the</hi> Nicen, Can. 5. <hi>ordaining,
that</hi> they who were excommunicated by ſome should not be
received by others: <hi>The third, from the</hi> Synodical Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>of the</hi> African <hi>Council to Pope</hi> Caeleſtine, <hi>in theſe
words,</hi> We intreat you that, for the future, you will not
eaſily admit thoſe who are Excommunicated by us, <hi>&amp;c.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115675:89"/>
To theſe he addes a fourth, from the 34. Apoſtolick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
that</hi> the Bishops of every Nation muſt know him that
is firſt among them, and account him their Head.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that, as for the three firſt in general, they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forbid the Appeals of Prieſts from their Bishops, &amp;c.
but leave it indifferent whether the Bishops, Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
nay Primates themſelves may appeale to the Pope:
which we make account is a far greater honour to the
Pope, than the deciding the inferiour Controverſies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Prieſts. So that theſe teſtimonies argues no more
againſt the Pope's Authority, than it would againſt the
Supreme power of any Prince or ſecular Magiſtrate, if the
Laws of the Land should forbid Theeves, Robbers, and
ſuch inferiours Delinquents, after their condemnation by
the Iudges and other inferiour Officers, to appeal to him.
Who ſees not that there could never be any Government,
or Iuſtice done, if every Prieſt, though found never ſo
guilty at home by his own immediate Governours, should
have liberty granted him to appeal to the <hi>Supreme:</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
perhaps, in another Country far diſtant, not skilled
in the immediate circumſtances, which give the beſt light
to judge of a cauſe: but receiving his information from
letters, perhaps partial, or from heare-ſay ever uncertain?
Again, who ſees not that ſuch an eaſy admittance of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ordinary Delinquent's Appeal is both moſt cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
nay impoſſible, to be perform'd by the <hi>Supreme,</hi>
and very derogatory to the eſteem and Authority of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Officers, without the Conſervation of which all
Government and Common-good goes to wrack? Iuſtly
then did the Church, in the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council and elſewhere,
for theſe and many other reaſons, ordain, that <hi>Prieſts
should make no farther Appeal than to domeſtick Iudges,</hi>
the Pope himſelf being preſent and conſenting to it, yet
without detriment to his Authority: ſince this eaſes him
of cumber, not diſcredits his power; for it denies not the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115675:89"/>
Appeals even of Arch-Bishops and Patriarchs to him:
unleſs Mr. H. will ſay, that every conſenting upon ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Grounds not to execute Authory, is to diſannul and
abolish quite that whole Authority; for he ayms at no
leſs in this worthy Diſcourſe of his upon the ſaid Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>And this may ſuffize in anſwer to his three firſt Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
as alſo to the firſt of theſe three in particular; to
wit, that they forbid him not to execute an higher ſtrain
of power in receiving Appeals of Bishops: and as for the
making it unlawful for inferiour Delinquents to appeal
to him, it can onely infer neceſſarily the unfitneſs that the
Pope should <hi>execute</hi> that Authority, not the <hi>want</hi> of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Teſtimony, that <hi>they which are excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
by ſome, shall not be received by others,</hi> is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
place in this Section moſt likely to infer the Doctor's
Concluſion, that the Popes is not <hi>Supreme:</hi> which indeed
it does moſt amply, if taken in it's whole latitude and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
but withall the Doctor muſt confeſs that, if it be
taken ſo, it utterly deſtroys all Government, and his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
teſtimony from the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Council to boot. For,
if thoſe words be univerſally true, then it is unlawful for a
Prieſt to appeal from his Bishop to an Arch-Bishop, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
or Provincial Council (granted in the ſaid teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;)
which takes away all Authority in a Superiour
over the Acts and Decrees of an Inferiour, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
all Government. Now then, ſince the ſaid te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
(which indeed was mean't of the Appeals of
Prieſts, and ſo is already anſwerd'd) cannot ſerve him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
taken in it's full extent; nor can it be taken ſo whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſubverting all Ground of Government: it follows,
that it cannot ſerve him at all, nor prejudice us. Again,
ſince it cannot be taken as denying Appeals from Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to Superiour Governours univerſally: Mr. H's
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115675:90"/>
grounds muſt make it conclude againſt us, by making it
ſignify a denial of Appeals to Coequals in Authority one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Wherefore, all it's force is built on this ſuppoſition,
that the Pope is not Superiour, but coequal onely to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch:
ſo that his Argument is epitomiz'd into this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
piece of ſenſe, as true as the firſt Principles (which he
muſt ſuppoſe to make this proof valid;) that <hi>the Pope
not being Head of the Church, is not Head of the Church;</hi>
and then all is clearly evidenced.</p>
               <p>The third teſtimony, <hi>We entreat you that you would
not eaſily admit thoſe to your Communion who are excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
by us,</hi> is ſo far from gain-ſaying the Pope's
power, that the very expreſſions of which it is fram'd are
rather ſo many acknowlegdments of it: being onely a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,</hi>
not that he <hi>would not</hi> receive their Appeals or admit
them at all, much leſs that he <hi>could not,</hi> but onely that he
<hi>would not admit them eaſily,</hi> that is, without due and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
examination of the cauſe. Now who ſees not that an
humble deſire, that he would not doe it <hi>eaſily,</hi> intimates
or ſuppoſes he had a power to doe it <hi>abſolutely?</hi> This is
confirm'd by their ſubjoyning, as the reaſon of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
not becauſe the Pope had no power to admit others,
but becauſe the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had ſo decreed: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it was a ſtrong motive for them, and an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Supreme Governour to conſerve the Laws of
the Church inviolate; unleſs Evidence, that in theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
it croſt the common good, licenc't him to uſe
his extraordinary Authority in that Extremity, and to
proceed now, not upon Laws, but upon the dictates of
Nature, the Ground and Rule of all Laws. So perfectly
innocent to our cauſe are all the teſtimonies of weight al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by Mr. H. againſt it; if they be left to themſelves,
and not inſpired with malice by the bad meaning he
will needs inſtill into them, againſt their own good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:115675:90"/>
The fourth teſtimony is ſtil like Dr. H. as he maintains
a bad cauſe; that is, incomparably weak and short of
concluding any thing. 'Tis this, that <hi>the Bishops of every
Nation muſt account the Primate their Head.</hi> What
then? is not a Parish-Prieſt Head of a Parish, a Bishop
Head of his Dioceſe, an Arch-Bishop Head of his Arch-Bishoprick;
as well as a Primate Head of his Primacy?
Does it then follow, from a Bishops being Head of the
Prieſts in his Dioceſe, that there is no degree of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Superiour to his? yet this, apply'd to a Primate, is all
Dr. H's argument to prove none higher than he. But, it
is pretty to obſerve in what ſtrange words he couches his
inference from hence; which (ſaith he, <hi>Repl. p.</hi> 40.) <hi>ſure
infers, that the Bishop of Rome is not the one onely Head
of all Bishops.</hi> Obſerve that canting phraſe, <hi>one onely
Head,</hi> &amp;c His intent here manifeſtly was to show no
degree of Authority Superiour to Patriarchs: to prove
this he alledges this teſtimony now agitated; and then,
becauſe he ſaw it would not carry home to the mark be
aymed it at, he infers warily, that the Pope is not <hi>the one
onely Head of all Bishops.</hi> By which expreſſion he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
an evaſion beforehand, when the inconſequence of
his diſcourſe from the ſaid teſtimony shall be ob<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ected;
or elſe would perſuade the unwary Reader, that we hold
the Pope ſo Head of the the Church, as that we admit not
<hi>Primates</hi> to be Head of the Bishops under them: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
our <hi>tenet</hi> is, that as <hi>Primates</hi> are immediate Heads of
the <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> ſo the <hi>Pope</hi> is Head or Superiour over
<hi>Primates;</hi> and by conſequence <hi>Supreme</hi> over the whole
Church: yet ſo <hi>Supreme,</hi> as he leaves to Subordinate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
their Headship inviolate over their proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours.</p>
               <p>Thus much to his Teſtimonies concerning <hi>Appeals,</hi>
His other manner of arguing againſt the Pop'es Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
or his being a <hi>ſummum genus</hi> is, from <hi>names</hi> and

<hi>The fourth is, their thred-bare and often anſwered teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Saint</hi> Gregory, <hi>refuſing the title of</hi> Vniverſal
Bishop.</p>
               <p>But, firſt, theſe teſtimonies come short of what they are
intended for, in this, that none ſpeaks of the <hi>right of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,</hi>
but onely of <hi>names</hi> and <hi>titles;</hi> as appears by
the words, <hi>appelletur, appellandus, Vniverſalitatis vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabulo,
ſuperbae appellationis verbum,</hi> in the teſtimonies:
which denote no exception againſt any <hi>Authority,</hi> but
againſt the <hi>titular expreſſion</hi> of it onely, which ſounded
proudly, and ſeem'd inconvenient and new at that time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is a great weakneſs in underſtanding the
nature of words, not to advert that the vogue of the world
altering from plaineſs to complementalneſs, as it does
ſtil daily, the ſame word may be uſed without fear of
pride at one time, which could not at another; nay the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
thing may be fitly ſignify'd by ſome word, at ſome ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
which cannot be ſignify'd by the ſame at another: as
for example, <hi>Tyrannus</hi> once was proper for a King, ruling
according to law and right; which now is not competent
but to him who rules arbitrarily againſt both; or rather
indeed, once it ſignify'd a <hi>power,</hi> now it ſignifies a <hi>vice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:115675:91"/>
Thirdly, this ſeems to have been the caſe of our word
<hi>Vniverſalis Papa,</hi> at leaſt in <hi>S. Gregory</hi>'s time; when that
expreſſion, if taken in a due ſenſe, ſem'd tolerable, both
by the example given in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and alſo by <hi>Eulogius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xundria</hi>'s
letter, giving it to Pope <hi>Gregory:</hi> but 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
by that prudent and humble Pope, becauſe the
proud Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> uſurp't it in an illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and intolerable ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the ſenſe of that title in the teſtimonies obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
being evidently this, that <hi>none could be Patriarchs
but himſelf;</hi> as appears by Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Epiſtle cited
here by <hi>Gratian, quia ſi unus Patriarcharum Vniverſalis
dicatur, Patriarcharum nomen caeteris derogatur;</hi> and the
like in S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s expreſſion to <hi>Eulogius,</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
it: this, I ſay, being evident; and it being on the
other ſide no leſs evident that our <hi>tenet</hi> concerning the
Pope's Authority is not, that it is of ſuch a nature as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars
others ſubordinate degrees, and, in particular, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
and Bishops, to be truly what they are called; it
is likewiſe evident, that our meaning, when we apply it
to the Pope, is different quite from the ſignification the
objectors take it in. Now that the Pope's Authority,
as held by Catholicks, hinders not others to remain ſtill
Patriarchs, is moſt plain: For, we grant him onely ſuch
an higher degree of power over Patriarchs, as an Arch-Bishop
hath over a Bishop; from which ſuperiory over
them it follows that he is <hi>Supreme</hi> in God's Church. As
then, the placing an Arch-Bishop over Bishops doth not
un-bishop them; ſo neither doth the exalting the Pope's
Anthority above Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>iarchal deſtroy the notion of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch:</hi>
but each of them retains their compleat limits
of Power in the Church, notwithſtanding their ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their Superiour: and conſequently, the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
are not a jot to the Doctor's purpoſe; ſince they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115675:92"/>
themſelves to mean one thing, and he brings them
to denote a quite different matter.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, had not the Teſtimonies declared themſelves
to mean otherwiſe than we do, yet (to show more the
miſerable weakneſs of this teſtimony-gleaner) it were no
ſuch great wonder that S. <hi>Gregory</hi> (ſuch was his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
should deny to accept what was due to him. A plain
inſtance of this may be found. 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 31. where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
himſelf even to be a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, whoever reads his Epiſtles ſent throughout
the whole Church, it is impoſſible but he should ſee that,
however he deny'd the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Vniverſal Bishop,</hi> which
ſounded then proudly, yet he both practiſed and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf, that is, the Papal Iuriſdiction,
which we now mean by that word; notwithſtanding his
profound humility, which made him never deſire to ſtand
upon his power, but when it was neceſſary. A perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of this is found, 7 <hi>Epiſt. 65. Ind.</hi> 2. where he ſayes,
<hi>Si qua culpa,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If there be any fault or crime found in
Bishops, that every Bishop is ſubject to the Apoſtolical See;
but when their fault doth not exact it,</hi> (that is, make it
neceſſary for him to uſe his Authority). <hi>that then, upon
the account of humility, all were his Equals.</hi> See alſo <hi>l. 7.
Epiſt.</hi> 64. where he puts it as <hi>undoubted,</hi> that <hi>the Church
of Conſtantinople is ſubject to the Apoſtolical See;</hi> and this
to be acknowledg'd by the Emperour and by the Bishop

dependent on theſe general ones; no effect of it at all
being notorius, but onely a teſtimony, (or perhaps two)

perſuade us, that the Supreme Iuriſdiction of <hi>Rome</hi> was

it ſelf in multitudes of circumſtances proportionable to
its viſibleneſs and weightineſs: that is, let him not hope
to gul men of reaſon with words, to deny the light of their
reaſon, <hi>demonstrative Evidence. Demonſtrative,</hi> I ſay;
for I account it as great and firm a Demonſtration as any
in nature, that it is impoſſible it should come in unatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by univerſal and viſible changes over the face of the
whole Chriſtian world: which I thus show in brief.</p>
               <p>The <hi>cauſe</hi> was put; to wit, a novelty in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of <hi>Government,</hi> and in higheſt matters. The <hi>matter</hi>
to work on was put; to wit, rational Soules or men's
minds, becauſe of their diverſe diſpoſitions apt to be
wrought upon diverſly; that is, to be ſtir'd up to diverſe
Thoughts, to diverſe Paſſions the reſult of thoſe thoughts,
and diverſe outward Expreſſions the effects of thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
and all this according to the weight and moment of
the <hi>cauſe,</hi> which was of the higheſt nature imaginable.
Laſtly, the <hi>cauſe</hi> was <hi>apply'd</hi> to the <hi>matter:</hi> for it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impoſſible, that an univerſal Government should be
brough in, and all not know of it, as that is should at
once <hi>be</hi> and <hi>not-be;</hi> ſince it cannot be introduc't univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally,
without ſignifying at leaſt to the Subjects either by
writing or other carriage, that their obedience is expected.
This being ſo, it is as <hi>evident</hi> and <hi>demonſtrable</hi> that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,
moſt viſible, and mighty commotions and changes
muſt accompagny ſuch a novelty of <hi>Rome</hi>'s uſurpation, as
that the <hi>effect</hi> muſt neceſſarily be, when the <hi>cauſe</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
cauſing: which none ever deny'd, or can, without
denying the firſt principles. Now, add to this, that the
Proteſtant Authours themſelves are in twenty minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the times that this change came in, and that their
beſt Authours beyond exception (of which I remember
<hi>Doctor Whittaker</hi> is one) confeſs in expreſs terms, that

in the <hi>Catalogue of Proteſtancy,</hi> where they are cited:)
adde this I ſay, and it follows, that no ſuch viſible effects
of it's introducing can be shown at all; and conſequently,
that it was never introduc't. Which as it immoveably

                  </gap>ns our title of <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> rendring it ſuch as is not
onely juſtly preſumable, but neceſſarily demonſtrable, to
have come from <hi>Chriſt:</hi> ſo it will alſo let the rational
Proteſtant Readers ſee plainly what it is to which their
wiſeſt Doctors would perſuade them; to wit, to renounce
the clear, ſolid, and certain light of reaſon, <hi>demonſtrative
Evidence,</hi> to follow the obſcure, uncertain, and wordish
dictionary ſtuffe of every trifling, controvertible, or (at
beſt) waxen-natur'd Teſtimony. Yet the Doctor's own
words are but theſe; that <hi>Boniface the third, with much
adoe, obtained of Phocas the Emperour an Edict for the
Primacy and Vniverſal Iuriſdiction of the Church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me:
See Paulus Diac. de geſtis</hi> Rom. l. 18 <hi>which ſtill is
an argument that till then it had no foundation.</hi> Where
firſt is to be noted that, of his own good will, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
puts in thoſe words, <hi>with much adoe;</hi> whereas the
Authour onely ſayes, <hi>rogante Papâ, the Pope intreating
it.</hi> Secondly, that whereas the Authour ſayes, <hi>Caput eſſe
omnium Eccleſiarum,</hi> in his book <hi>de geſtis Longobardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
l. 4. c. 37. (which Book without controverſy is his
and plainly ſayes, that <hi>the Emperour defined that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church was the Head of all Churches;</hi>) our Doctor
diſſembles this, and follows a text out of <hi>de geſtis Roman.</hi>
which book is doubted of by learned men to be none of
his, and by the very phraſe ſeems to be a corruption of
the other, and that <hi>ut eſſet,</hi> is put for <hi>eſſe;</hi> it being an odd
piece of Latin to ſay, <hi>Statuit ſedem Romanam ut eſſet ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put,</hi>
whereas a Latiniſt would have ſaid <hi>ſtatuit, ſedes ut
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115675:94"/>
eſſet.</hi> Wherefore, 'tis evident that the Doctor's great brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
that <hi>the Story is known to all,</hi> is reſolv'd into the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of an unauthentick text. Which is moſt evident
by the words following in both places of the ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
<hi>Quia Eccleſia Conſtantinopolitana primam ſe om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
Eccleſiarum ſcribebat:</hi> which bears no ſenſe, if the
Decree gave the Iuriſdiction; but an excellent one, if
the decree onely defined it againſt the wrongful challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Church. Wherefore you ſee
that the Doctors Inference, <hi>which yet is an argument that
til then it had no foundation,</hi> is ſo wretched, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ought to be deduced, tha it is an argument, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which <hi>Phocas</hi> defined <hi>to be his,</hi> had been his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

where, after he had ſpoken of and acknowledg'd King

that thus it was in England: 2. the conſequence of that

we muſt be put firſt to prove a thing which himſelf and

God bid us doe is to be done, and that the Authority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted

there is the leaſt cauſe or ground for it in his Tract,

and laſtly, extraordinarily reſerv'd, in giving no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
than this bare denial of his own expreſs words. But,
being taken tardy in his Diviſionary art, in which it is
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115675:96"/>
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon cuſtome to talke quodlibetically; he thought
it the wiſer way to put up what's paſt with patience, than
by defending it give occaſion for more mirth.</p>
               <p>But, to come to the point: That which was objected
to him by me and the <hi>Cath. Gent.</hi> was this, That he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Catholicks should produce Evidences and proofs
for the Pope's Authority in <hi>England;</hi> which task we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
to belong to us, who ſtood upon <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> (and
ſuch a poſſeſſion as no King can show for his Crown) any
more, than it does to an Emperour or any long and-quietly-poſſeſt
Governour, to evidence to a known Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
and actual Renouncer of his Authority, that his title
to the Kingdome is juſt, ere he can either account him or
punish him as rebellious.</p>
               <p>In anſwer, Dr. H. <hi>Repl.</hi> p. 44. firſt denies <hi>that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the Place there agitated</hi> (that is, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his fourth Chapter of Schiſm) <hi>any ſuch thing of
the Catholicks, as to prove their pretenſions:</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut his own
expreſs words, <hi>of Schiſm,</hi> p. 66. 67. check his bad memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
which are theſe, <hi>Our method now leads us to enquire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
what evidences are producible againſt the Church
of England, whereby it may be thought liable to this guilt
of Schiſm.</hi> Whence he proceeds to examine our Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and to ſolve them: which is manifeſtly to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon the part of the Reſpondent, the Catholick on
the part of the Opponent; that is, to make us bring proofs,
and ſeem to renounce the claim of our ſo-qualify'd a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
by condeſcending to diſpute it. Whereas we are in
all reaſon to ſtick to it till it be ſufficiently diſprov'd, which
cannot be done otherwiſe than by rigorous <hi>Evidence,</hi> as
hath been shown; not to diſpute it as a thing dubious:
ſince 'tis evident we had the <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> and ſuch a poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
as could give us a <hi>title.</hi> This therefore we ought to
plead, not to relinquish this firm ground, and to fall to
quibble with him in wordish teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:115675:96"/>
To omit, that the evidences he produces in our name
are none of ours. For, the onely <hi>evidence</hi> we produce, when
we pleaſe to oppoſe, is the <hi>evidence of the Infallibility of
Vniverſal Tradition or Atteſtation of Fore-fathers,</hi> which
we build upon both for that and other points of Faith:
nor do we build upon Scripture at all, but as interpreted
by the practice of the Church and the Tradition now ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of. Wherefore, ſince Dr. H. neither mentions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,
nor ſolves thoſe, that is, neither the certainty of
Vniverſal Atteſtation, nor the teſtimonies of Scripture as
explicable by the received doctrine of Anceſtours (which
latter muſt be done by showing that the doctrine of the
Church, thus atteſted and received, gives them not this
explication;) 'tis evident that he hath not ſo much as
mention'd, much leſs produced, or ſolved our Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>
               <p>Our Doctors indeed, as private Writers, undertake
ſometimes, <hi>ex ſuperabundanti,</hi> to diſcourſe from Scripture
upon other Grounds, as Grammar, Hiſtory, propriety of
language, &amp;c. to show, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> our advantage over
the Proteſtants even in their own (and to them the onely)
way: but, Interpretations of Scripture thus grounded are
not thoſe upon which we rely for this, or any other point
of our Faith. So that Dr. H. by putting upon us wrong-pretended
<hi>Evidences,</hi> brings all the queſtion, as is cuſtome
is, to a word-skirmish; where he is ſure men may fight
like <hi>Andabatae</hi> in the dark, and ſo he may hap to eſcape
knocks: whereas, in the other way of <hi>Evident reaſon,</hi> he
is ſure to meet with enough. At leaſt, in that caſe, the
controverſy being onely manag'd by wit, and carried on
his ſide who can be readieſt in explicating and referring
one place to another, with other like inventions; it may
be his good fortune to light on ſuch a doltish Adverſary,
that the Doctor may make his ayre-connected diſcourſe
more plauſible than the others, which is all he cares for:
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115675:97"/>
This being a defence and ground enough for his <hi>fallible,</hi>
that is <hi>probable,</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>Dr. H. defends himſelf, by ſaying (<hi>p.</hi> 44. (he mean't
onely that Catholicks bring <hi>Chriſt's donation to S. Peter
for an Argument of the Pope's Supremacy;</hi> inſtancing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Cath. Gent.</hi> in his own confeſſion, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks

of the whole build<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng.</hi> By which one may ſee that the
Doctor knows not or will not know the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a <hi>Title</hi> and an <hi>Argument. Chriſt</hi>'s donation to
S. <hi>Peter</hi> is our <hi>title,</hi> our manner of <hi>trnour,</hi> by which we
hold the Pope his Succeſſour, Head paſtour; not our <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi>
to infer that he is ſo. 'Tis part of our <hi>Tenet,</hi> and
the thing which we hold upon poſſeſſion, to be diſprov'd
by them or (if we ſee it fitting) to bee prov'd by us: not
our <hi>argument</hi> or <hi>proof</hi> againſt them, to maintain it or
conclude it ſo, As a <hi>title</hi> then we rely and build upon it,
not produce it as a <hi>proof</hi> to conclude any thing from it.
And indeed I wonder any man of reaſon should imagin
we did ſo: ſince (if he be a Scholar) he cannot but know
that we ſee how, to the Proteſtants, the ſuppoſed proof
would be as deniable and in it's ſelf as obſcure, as the thing
he imagins we would prove by it or infer from it: which
he knows every child can tell is againſt the nature of a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
or <hi>argument.</hi> Yet poor Catholick Writers, from
whom Dr. H. has got all the learning, muſt be imagin'd
unacquainted with that trivial toy belonging to the A, B
C, of Logick.</p>
               <p>Next he goes about to prove our tenour of poſſeſſion
null: which he does moſt exquiſitely, by telling us (<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
p.</hi> 45.) that now they are in poſſeſſion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<hi>by the force of the Catholicks argument, all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
deducible from thence are loſt to him, the preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
being now on the Proteſtant's ſide as before on the
Catholicks.</hi> Where, firſt he manifeſtly calumniates the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115675:97"/>
Catholick <hi>tenet,</hi> calling it <hi>preſcription:</hi> whereas <hi>preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi>
is a title to get a right in that which was known to
be none of his before; which is contrary to the profeſſion
of Catholicks, who maintain their poſſeſſion to have been
ever from the beginning; and never to have belong'd to
any before: ſo that this is a trick of a cunning shuffling
gameſter, by changing the name to alter the ſtate of the
whole queſtion. But, to proceed with his argument againſt
our poſſeſſion, which he purſues in theſe words, <hi>And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is nothing left the Romaniſts to plead, but the original
right on this ſide againſt the violence of the ſucceding poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
Well done Doctor, ſtill; 'tis the luck of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt us, that they are moſt proper and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
pleas for all malefactours. Pray lend me your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
a while, and you shall ſee what work they will make
in the world in a short time. Put caſe then, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Theeves enter into another man's houſe, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, his Wife and Family out of doors, reſolve to ſettle
and neſt themſelves there: and, knowing the Law will
call them to account for turning an inhabitant out of his
poſſeſſion, they hire Dr. H. (of Divine, turn'd Lawyer)
to plead for them. The honeſt Inhabitant pleads <hi>poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
Dr. H. replyes, that <hi>at this time he hath no poſſeſſion,
but hath loſt it and all arguments deducible from thence; and
that he hath nothing now left him to plead, but the original
right againſt the violence of a ſucceeding poſſeſſion:</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if the intruding crew have been in it any long time,
(though the manner of their violent uſurpation were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo viſible and notorious) then Dr. H. pleads <hi>preſcription</hi>
in his Clients behalf, and exacts of the honeſt man to <hi>show

they are at preſent, (as Dr. H. tells us) in poſſeſſion, and
the right owner muſt loſe Cloak and Purſe both, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to theſe new Laws, unleſs they can prove their <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
right,</hi> and <hi>show</hi> how they came by them: That is,
they who are <hi>innocent</hi> muſt be treated as if they were <hi>guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and forced to give account how they came by what
they formerly-quietly enjoy'd; and the <hi>guilty</hi> muſt be
treated like <hi>innocent</hi> perſons, and ſtand ſecure upon their
poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>To this miſerable paſs would the world be brought, if
men should treat one another as the Proteſtants treat us
in this point; and if they were no more ſincere and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to look well to their <hi>eſtates,</hi> than they are to look to
the <hi>Grounds of their Faith</hi> &amp; their eternal Salvation. The
eager adheſion to the former makes them account this
treaty foul play, if their temporal livelihoods be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd;
which their negligence of eternal happineſs, more
obſcurely &amp; far-off propoſed, makes them willing to
think very fair in their debates about <hi>Eternity</hi> with us.</p>
               <p>To make this clearer, and withall to show how paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
Dr. H's <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> is to the former unjuſt ones, and
how unapt to parallel, much leſs to out-vy and diſannul
ours, as he would have it, we will put them in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of reaſon, and let ſincerity hold the ſcales: premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
firſt, that we both hold, at leaſt Dr. H. grants
(<hi>Repl. p. 46. l.</hi> 13.) in one place (and that the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
of the two contradictory ones,) that <hi>preſcription, in
divine and Eccleſiaſtical things, is of no force:</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
his pretended hundred years in it ſelf uſeleſs for any
thing in this controverſy; it being a Government inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as inviolable by our Saviour, not alterable or alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by humane circumſtances: which appears to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by us both, becauſe they pretend to prove the King's,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115675:99"/>
ſupremacy and the equality of the Apoſtles from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
we (when we ſee it fitting) the contrary. This
preſuppoſed, let us compare our <hi>Poſſeſsion</hi> to their preſent
pretended one. Ours is acknowledgedly ancient; theirs
late and upſtart. Ours is ſuch as no viſible Effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to it's weight can be shown, that is, ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
changes in the world as may juſtly make it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
an <hi>Vſurpation;</hi> theirs, manifeſt in ſuch viſible and
violent immediate effects, and ſuch conſequences of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of changes, as render it a palpable Vſurpation. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
ours is obſcure in it's original, and at moſt but contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible
that it ever begun: theirs, beyond all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
new, and of a late original. Practical effects clad in all
their circumſtances yet remain in the world, to atteſt their
thruſting us out of <hi>poſſeſsion:</hi> no ſuch effects alledged of
our thruſting them or any elſe out, except two or three
impertinent conjectures, the like whereof may be drawn
for any abſurdity: and conſequently, it is much more
impoſſible we should ever have uſurp't, than that <hi>William</hi>
the Conquerour should have impower'd himſelf over
<hi>England,</hi> without other manifeſt immediate effects or
ſigns of his newly-introduc't ſupreme Government there,
than that there are two or three dark ſentences in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyps,</hi>
which abſtracting from antecedents and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
may be apply'd to it. The whole world agrees of
the time and circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of their poſſeſſion's beginning:
of ours our very Adverſaries doubt, and are in ſeveral
minds. Hence ours can juſtly claim to have come from
<hi>Chriſt;</hi> that is, to be indeed a <hi>Poſſeſsion,</hi> and the <hi>ſole poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion</hi>
in the matter we ſpeak of: their preſent pretended
poſſeſſion is impoſſible to be preſum'd for ſuch, ſince eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one knows when it began. Wherefore our Poſſeſſion
is ſo qualify'd, that, of it ſelf, it can ground a claim, that
it came from the Fountain head of all Eccleſiaſtical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> not needing the aſſiſtance of another
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115675:100"/>
                  <hi>former poſſeſſion</hi> to patch it up: ſince, no interruption of
it being known, it is juſtly preſumed to have deſcended
from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> without interruption, the ſame it is now. Their
preſent <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> cannot of it ſelf even pretend to have
come from <hi>Chriſt</hi> at all; ſince it begun lately and, if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
alone, reaches not nor can pretend to reach to the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> liv'd, but needs to be piec'd with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
imaginary poſſeſſion antecedent to our pretented u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation:
Wherefore, this preſent <hi>ſtate</hi> of theirs is not
capable of any plea of <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> at all; not conſequently
is it at all a truly-nam'd <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> in any other ſenſe than
as the <hi>having</hi> any thing, however it is come by, is call'd a
<hi>poſſeſſion.</hi> Again, the Pope's poſſeſſion in <hi>England</hi> was
a <hi>quiet</hi> one, without any elſe pretending it but himſelf, in
oppoſition to him: Theirs was never <hi>quietly</hi> enjoy'd at
all; Catholick Writers in their learned Controtroverſies
ever pleading the Pope's lawful title, and showing theirs
an unlawful and rebellious uſurpation: Even this preſent
book I now write atteſts that the debate is yet on foot, and
the pleas ſo ſtrong on our ſide, as I dare promiſe my ſelf
ſo much fruit of my endeavours, that no man living will
ſay they have carried the cauſe and enjoy it <hi>quietly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, (not to mention the clear advantages it hath
from the teſtimony of all Antiquity) our Poſſeſſion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,
by the force of <hi>Vniverſal Atteſtation,</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by our preſent Adverſary, at unawares, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>)
to have come from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> at leaſt they muſt
confeſs that men not meanly learned pretend this, have
attempted it, and anſwered the objections produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it by beſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi> wits and ſtrongeſt Champions.
Our Poſſeſſion then hath for it's coming from <hi>Chriſt</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
<hi>Evidence,</hi> ſo held by us; at leaſt, (as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
themſelves muſt grant) <hi>pretence of Evidence</hi> as yet
uncontrolled by their party: Whereas the pretended poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
they enjoy at preſent is evidently the contrary; to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115675:100"/>
wit, not come from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but begun either in King
<hi>Henry</hi>'s or Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s dayes; nor is it capable at all
of <hi>pretending Evidence</hi> for it's coming from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it hath <hi>Evidence againſt</hi> it's coming from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now
then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Preſcription</hi> here being of no force, their preſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
poſſeſſion is no better than it was after their firſt
three dayes; and our <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> ſo well qualify'd, theirs
ſo ill, in order to the preſent matter in hand, as appers by
theſe Parallels: it follows plainly, that they can have no
better a plea from their preſent poſſeſſion, than the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebreaker,
rober, or cut-purſe, from the preſent <hi>poſſeſſion</hi>
(that is, <hi>having</hi>) of the things which they lately purloin'd
or unjuſtly took away. It is Dr. H. then, who (<hi>Repl,
p. 45.) would give leave to every man to catch and hold
what he can;</hi> not we, who would onely have every man
hold (till rigorous <hi>Evidence</hi> be brought againſt his right)
thoſe things of which he was found in immemorial, quiet
and, in many other reſpects, ſo well qualify'd a <hi>Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this the Candid Reader, who pleaſes to ſcan over
the former parallels, will diſcover how weak that cauſe
muſt be, which drives it's Defender to ſuch incomparable
abſurdities, as to tell us that <hi>our poſſeſſion and all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
deducible thence are now loſt to us, becauſe of
their ſucceding poſſeſſion:</hi> ſo making their counterfeit poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
(which indeed ſignifyes the bare <hi>having</hi> a thing)
preponderate ours, which hath been shown to excel it in
ſuch manifold advantages. The charitable non ſenſe that
follows I shall not think worth confuting; after I have
lay'd open our force of <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> which frees us in reaſon
from the task of arguing, pleading, or oppoſing; and
their no-<hi>poſſeſsion,</hi> which obliges them to produce <hi>Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of our pretended uſurpation, and not to expect them
from us: This being all that was common to me and the
<hi>Cath. Gentl.</hi> and ſo all that belong'd to me to vindicate.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115675:101"/>
Nor indeed was it needful for any to add any thing more
in anſwer to this <hi>Section.</hi> What follows is ſuch pittiful
ſtuff, as would under-value the worth of a piece of paper
to vouchſafe it a confute: yet it deſerves mentioning as a
pattern of Dr. H's wit, and ſolid manner of argu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng againſt
the Romaniſts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, although he knows, and all the world acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
they caſt a <hi>Papal Authority</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> and
not <hi>Patriarchal</hi> onely: yet his dinſtinguishing art muſt
needs be brought in to blunder, as his cuſtome is, with an
<hi>If;</hi> (p. 46. 47.) <hi>If the Pope pretend onely to be a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
or Patriarch,</hi> &amp;c. What <hi>If</hi> he be? why then he
quotes himſelf to have done ſtrange things againſt him in
his book <hi>of Schiſm;</hi> where he tells us he hath <hi>evidenced,</hi>
&amp;c. and <hi>ſufficiently juſtify'd</hi> their carriage againſt him:
So ſtrongly he diſputes againſt us, and we muſt beleeve
him; and there ends the left leg of his trifling diſtinction.
Next follows the right, and ſteps in halting with another
<hi>If: But</hi> If <hi>the Pope's pretenſions be higher, even for the
Supremacy it ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. as every one knows it was, and
conſequently his former words were moſt frivolous. Now
let us ſee what ground this foot of the diſtinction ſtands
on. <hi>It follows</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that, firſt, I may ſurely ſay they
were neverbonae fidei poſſeſſores of that; &amp; ſecondly, that the
King, by being ſo is ſupreme,</hi> &amp;c. So that firſt he overthrew
us onely with his own ſuppoſition, that the Popes neither
exerciſed nor claimed any power here more than <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal:</hi>
next, by his own ſelf-conceit that he had tickled
him in that point in his <hi>evidencing</hi> book of Schiſm: &amp;
thirdly, if the Pope pretends to any Supremacy, he confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
him moſt powerfully by onely telling him, that <hi>he may
ſurely ſay he hath none.</hi> And indeed 'tis moſt true; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
is more <hi>ſure,</hi> than that Dr. H. may <hi>ſurely ſay</hi> vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
what he liſts, without either ſenſe or reaſon: his
common cuſtome hath now made it his proper priviledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:115675:101"/>
But now comes the laſt onſet, which maſſacres all out
arguments and Grounds at once, threatning <hi>to remove all
appearance of reaſon from this whole exception:</hi> which he
does 1. by telling us, <hi>'tis manifeſt that when they caſt the
Pope out, they had reaſons for it. 2. that he muſt have leave
to ſuppoſe thoſe reaſons were convincing.</hi> Truly, ſo he shall
have leave to ſuppoſe what he pleaſes; ſo he will give
his Readers likewiſe leave to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> him moſt weak, and
his cauſe moſt pittiful, which muſt be maintain'd by ſuch
weak shifts as the begging leave to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> that all is <hi>true</hi>
which the Patron of it shall pleaſe to ſay. This done, he
quotes a book of the ring-leaders of his own Schiſm, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
(as he brags) by one <hi>Goldaſtus</hi> (a French Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not)
<hi>under the title of Opus Eximium:</hi> then he modeſtly
commends to us again his own Book <hi>of Schiſm;</hi> and ſo
concludes, <hi>that he hopes it will ſuffice.</hi> Thus hath Dr. H.
<hi>remov'd all appearance of our reaſons,</hi> by the neceſſity of
his <hi>having leave to ſuppoſe</hi> that theirs were <hi>convincing,</hi>
and the quoting a book of his own Folks, which another
of the ſame leaven calls <hi>an excellent work.</hi> Weighty proofs
againſt us without doubt!</p>
               <p>But, becauſe we have open'd theſe Evidences of his too
much; we will fold them up into Logical forme, and
there leave them. The Doctor diſputes thus, <hi>The Pope
being onely a Patriarch, I have ſufficiently juſtify'd what
was done here in my evidencing book of Schiſm; therefore
he hath no ſuch Authority here:</hi> The antecedent is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
as a firſt Principle known by the light of nature.
Next, he argues thus: <hi>I may ſurely ſay he hath no Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy;
therefore he hath none.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>I muſt have
leave to ſuppoſe we had convincing reaſons for caſting
him out, and my Companions think the ſame; Ergo
I have removed all appearance of r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, asham'd to father his own Grounds or his own

praiſed, his own book <hi>of Schiſm</hi> is extant, which (<hi>pag.</hi>

after which begins the fifth <hi>parag,</hi> thus, <hi>And
firſt it is evident by Scripture that S. Peter was the Apoſtle
of the Circumciſion or Iews, excluſively to the Vncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>

               <p>Next, he tells us in the ſame place, that <hi>it needed no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videncing;
the thing being evident by it's own light, that
the Apoſtles went not all to one, but dispoſed themſelves

vainly hugging ſelf-fancied Grounds of their own, as is the

H. is of; who thinks it a diſgrace to write what one deems
truth, if it hap to be the doctrine or ſence of another: and

               <p>Fifthly, (to come to his <hi>Reply,</hi> the pretended place for
anſwer) he is accuſed for being a <hi>bad Interpreter;</hi> and he
ſpends the greateſt part of his pains in showing himſelf <hi>a
good Grammarian,</hi> and manifeſting the notion of the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Which is a quite different thing. The ſame
word may have twenty ſeveral notions in it ſelf, but hath
ordinarily but one of thoſe as it is found in the Context
and Syntax with other words. The ſignifications of words
are to be found in Dictionaries; the Interpretation of
them, as they ſtand in propoſitions, depends upon the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents,
conſequents, with all the other train of conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant
Circumſtances: eſpecially upon the import of the
whole, and tranſaction of the buſineſs or thing there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of. Hence, the ſignification of the words interpreted
to be ſometimes down-right and proper, ſometimes bow'd
to a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> ſometimes ſtrain'd to a <hi>Catachreſis,</hi> nay
even ſometimes taken abſurdly and barbarouſly: ſo that,
though the phraſe or word ſeems oftentimes very odd in
it ſelf, if taken alone; yet the circumſtances and total im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the ſenſe make that acception (though never ſo
improper) altogether neceſſary. It being poſſible, even
for the beſt Authour, to miſtake, or be careleſs in the right
uſe of a word; but abſolutely impoſſible and a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
he should not vnderſtand his own meaning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
when he goes about to ſpeak or write.</p>
               <p>Hence is evident how litle is likely to be ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't,
by Grammatical and Critical quibbling upon the
dictionary ſignification of a word: and how litle it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
to the interpretation of any place, more than barely
to show the poſſibility that the word may have, in ſome
caſes, ſuch a ſignification; both the poſſibility, probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115675:104"/>
and certainty that it muſt have it there; being leſt to
the preſent circumſtances, and the import of the whole <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
of the ſenſe. It being therefore out of queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and granted, nay aſſerted and held by us, that
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, if taken in it ſelf, can ſignify either <hi>a lot,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is obtain'd by lot, whether it be Office, Province, an
horſe, a bag of money, or whatever elſe; or whether it
be by way of diviſion or without: it is plain that Dr. H.
in showing the grammatical ſignification of the word in
it ſelf, hath beat the aire frivolouſly to no purpoſe. Nor
is his showing it to ſignify ſuch a kind of lot in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture to any better end: Both becauſe, if the
books be writ by ſeveral Authours, it may probably have
one acception in one, another in another; and perhaps
a diverſe one in the ſame: as alſo, becauſe, however
the word can poſſibly ſignify a <hi>Province</hi> obtained by
lot, if put in due circumſtances; yet, that it can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
have that ſignification here or in this place, muſt
depend upon the preſent circumſtances and import of that
Chapter, or all that belongs to that buſineſs: which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
not being found in any other place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
the showing the ſignification of it in other places
is litle or nothing to the ſignification it ought to have
in this.</p>
               <p>It were good ſport fort one, who is at leaſure and hath
nothing elſe to doe, to obſerve what havock this plain

onely apply it to this preſent place, and deſire the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Reader to peruſe this <hi>Chapter</hi> from <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. to

and ſee whether he can find any ground, or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Ground, either precedent in the Apoſtles inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
concomitant in the tranſaction of the buſineſs it ſelf,
or laſtly ſubſequent in the effect of caſting lots, why the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115675:104"/>
thing receiv'd by that means should be <hi>a leſſer province,</hi>
or that the words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> should ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
ſo. Of their <hi>antecedent</hi> intent we have no other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
than this (even according to the Proteſtants own
tranſtation,) that they mean't to <hi>make up the number of
the Apoſtles</hi> by ſubſtituting another in the place of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>)
not to go to a leſſer Province, but) <hi>Act.</hi> 1. v. 22.
<hi>to witneſs with them the reſurrection:</hi> which, though all
grant it was perform'd by going ſeveral ways, yet there is
no ſuch thing there expreſt, to ground or infer Dr. H's
following interpretation, which is all concerns us at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. v. 17. the words, <hi>For he was numbred
with us,</hi> ſignifie that they had reflections on the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſs
of their number, and the following words, <hi>and
had obtained part of this miniſtery,</hi> make it impoſſible
that <hi>a leſſer province</hi> should be there ſignify'd: for, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
had not obtain'd <hi>a leſſer province</hi> in his life-time, as
Dr. H. grants in many places: which is confirm'd by
<hi>verſ.</hi> 25. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Iudas, by trangreſsion, fell
from his part of this miniſtery and Apoſtleship.</hi> Now, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
properly, 'tis equally impoſſible one should <hi>fall
from</hi> a condition or ſtate he <hi>had not before,</hi> as <hi>fall</hi> local<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>from</hi> a place in which he actually <hi>was not before.</hi> He had
therefore (if we ſpeak properly and according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
words of the 25. <hi>verſe</hi>) that thing before, from which
he fell; that is, he had actually in his life time that part
of miniſtery and Apoſtleship into which <hi>S. Mathias</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded:
but Dr. H. grants, he had not actually before his
death <hi>a leſſer province,</hi> but the <hi>Office</hi> of Apoſtle onely:
therefore thoſe words can with no propriety ſignifie a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
Province, but the Apoſtolical dignity onely; and ſo
it was the Apoſtles intention to ſurrogate S. <hi>Mathias</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into this <hi>dignity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, as for the <hi>tranſaction</hi> of the buſineſs it ſelf, it was
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115675:105"/>
onely performed by caſting lots and prayer; no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
imaginable, nor the leaſt word being there favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to this explication, or that can be pretended to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it: if we omit, as we ought in all reaſon, the phraſes
in controverſy; for we muſt not prove the ſame thing by
it's ſelf. To come then to the <hi>effect ſubſequent</hi> to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
of lots; nothing can be invented either plainer in it's
ſelf, or more explicative of the former intention. The
words are theſe, <hi>the lot fell upon Mathias; and</hi> the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
was, that <hi>he was numbred with the eleven Apoſtles.</hi>
Relate theſe words to the 17. <hi>verſe, For he</hi> (Iudas) <hi>was
numbred with us;</hi> and to the following verſes, import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus much, that <hi>Iudas fell,</hi> and, by his fall, <hi>there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one of the former Apoſtolical number:</hi> upon this they
caſt lots, and the reſult of that action is expreſt to be this,
that <hi>he was numbred with the eleven Apoſtles.</hi> Ioyn the
well ordered <hi>ſeries</hi> of theſe circumſtances together, which
the very place it ſelf affords and offers; and tell me good
Reader, if it be likely any thing can be mean't by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which they choſe <hi>Mathias,</hi> but the <hi>dignity</hi> or <hi>office</hi> of
an Apoſtle: tell me whether it be not a wretched inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
(as the <hi>Cath. Gent.</hi> call'd dit,) onely upon a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
that the word, taken in it's ſelf and grammatically,
or as found in other circumſtances, may have ſuch a ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
to infer, againſt the whole ſtream of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
circumſtances, and without the leaſt Ground or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of Ground from the place in which 'tis found, that it
ſignifies <hi>a leſſer Province.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for that place, as explicable by the right
Rules of interpreting Scripture. Now then, should we

in it ſel; <gap reason="foreign">

the <hi>thing obtained by lot;</hi> and in that place it is evident

                  </gap>, <hi>this?</hi>

or <hi>his own place,</hi> to show there were ſuch things
as excluſive provinces, Dr. H. (<hi>of Schiſm,</hi> p. 71.) para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes
to ſignify, <hi>his own or proper place or aſſignation for
the witneſſing the Reſurrection, and proclaiming the Faith
or doctrine of Chriſt to the world:</hi> Others, and among them
the <hi>Cath. Gent.</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> W. nay even all the Proteſtants
(as far as I can hear) except Dr. H. make account it ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies
<hi>Iudas his own place in Hell;</hi> and that 'tis abſolutely
impoſſible it should ſignify in that place <hi>a leaſſer province,</hi>
as Dr. H. would have it.</p>
               <p>His firſt Argument, that it cannot ſignify a place in
Hell, is drawn from the charitable opinion we ought to
have of <hi>Iudas;</hi> accuſing the <hi>Cath. Gent.</hi> of uncharitableneſs
for interpreting it ſo, in theſe words, (<hi>Repl. p. 53.) It was
ſufficient to ſay of Iudas that which had been ſaid,</hi> v. 16.
17. 18. 19. <hi>to ſet out the horrour of his Fact, and his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
death;</hi> and that <hi>he needed not proceed to the revealing
of ſecrets,</hi> &amp;c. But I wonder what <hi>ſecret</hi> it is to ſay that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115675:106"/>
                  <hi>Iudas</hi> is in Hell, after it had been <hi>revealed</hi> and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by our Saviour himſelf (<hi>Io. c. 17. v.</hi> 12.) that he was
<hi>the Son of Perdition,</hi> and he had died in deſpair by his own
hands. But let us obſerve the order of Dr. H's charity:
(<hi>Anſw. p. 22 l.</hi> 16. 17. 18. 19. &amp;c.) he could not retain a
favorable opinion of ſalvation attainable by the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the breach between us (meaning the Pope and
Cardinalls, who had pronounced the Sentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
againſt his Schiſmatical party,) nor by the
Catholick Converts in <hi>England;</hi> nay, he had decreed and
denounced Hell and damnation to <hi>S.</hi> W. and the <hi>Romish
Factor,</hi> for showing <hi>he had forgotten his Accidence</hi> and
his other toyish weakneſſes; yet he would not have us
cenſure <hi>Iudas</hi> too rashly, or judge him in Hell for betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Saviour: The likelihood of the others damnation
is of no difficulty with him; this he calls <hi>a ſecret;</hi> and
blames the <hi>Cath. Gent.</hi> for <hi>revealing it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond argument is drawn from S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s
words upon that place, ſaying that S. <hi>Peter inſults not
over Iudas, calling him villain or deteſtable villain, but
ſets down the fact ſimply and his preſent vengeance.</hi> To which
laſt words Dr. H. annexes his Corollary; and to make
<hi>ſure</hi> work, as before he hath oft confuted us with his
own <hi>ſurely,</hi> ſo now he aſcertains it with his own <hi>ſure:</hi> His
preſent vengeance, <hi>that ſure is it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which befel
him in this world.</hi> A weighty argument! as if any ſpace of
time interven'd between wicked men's death and their
being in Hell; and, as if their vengeance of damnation
were not ful as preſent as their temporal vengeance of an
ill death here. I am ſure the Pſalmiſt <hi>Pſal. 55. v.</hi> 16. in
that very place which uſes to be apply'd to mean myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
our Saviours words of <hi>Iudas,</hi> wishes <hi>They may go
quick into Hell:</hi> which expreſſes a vengeance <hi>preſent</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and earlier than their vengeance in this world, to
wish them in Hell before they are dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:115675:107"/>
In ſtead of a third Argument, he would perſuade us in
courteſy to admit a <hi>parentheſis</hi> here: his plea for this <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis</hi>
is this, becauſe <hi>the uſe of parentheſes in Scripture
is very obvious:</hi> If then the words (<hi>from which Iudas
by tranſgreſſion fell</hi>) be pounded up in a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> ſo
as they may not at all help the ſignification of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
(which is ſomething too hard dealing,) <hi>then</hi> he
tells us <hi>his interpretation is clear and unavoydable.</hi> But,
what means he when he tells us, that the <hi>parentheſis needs
no more formall expreſſion than onely by putting a comma
after</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? would he have it a <hi>parentheſis</hi> or no? A <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis</hi>
relates not to the ſenſe of the fore-going nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words; but leaves the ſenſe entire though it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
what is within <hi>commas</hi> onely cannot always thus
be omitted, without oftentimes maiming the ſenſe.
Again, how muſt a <hi>comma</hi> put after <hi>Iudas</hi> needs make
his interpretation ſo <hi>clear and unavoydable;</hi> ſince he knows
well that many, both Proteſtant and Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters
put the <hi>comma</hi> there, and yet <hi>avoyd</hi> ſo eaſily his
interpretation, that they never ſo much as dream'd of it?
Laſtly, let us remember that a <hi>parentheſis</hi> leaves the words
on either ſide as perfectly coherent in ſenſe, as if it had
never interven'd; and then, let us ſee how Dr. H. puts
his doctrine in practice: <hi>To receive</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the lot of
his miniſtery and Apoſtleship (from which Iudas by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
fell) to go, or that he may go to his proper place.</hi>
Thus he. Where, to omit that he takes now the liberty of
a formally expreſt <hi>parentheſis,</hi> though, while he was
begging it of us, he ſeem'd willing to be contented with
a <hi>comma</hi> onely; to omit this, I ſay, I would ask this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
man, who (<hi>Anſw. p.</hi> 18.) ſo like a Saint profeſſes his
<hi>entire deſire to speak the full truth of God,</hi> why he changes
the words <hi>this miniſtery,</hi> &amp;c. into <hi>his miniſtery and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleship?</hi>
and, if he be loath to anſwer, I shall do it for
him, and tell the Reader he had good reaſons to falſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y it.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115675:107"/>
Firſt, becauſe the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>This</hi>] denotes ſome <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>
thing; and, no <hi>leſſer Province</hi> being (according to his
Grounds) at that time determin'd or <hi>preſent,</hi> but the
<hi>office</hi> of an Apoſtle onely (which he is reſolved it shal not
ſignify,) it was therefore good reaſon he should change
<hi>This</hi> into <hi>His.</hi> Next, the word <hi>This</hi> relates to all the words
within the <hi>parentheſis,</hi> &amp; depends upon them for it's ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification
(as is evident;) and ſo deſtroys all his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to have a <hi>parentheſis</hi> there; ſuch a kind of reference
being againſt it's nature. Thirdly, the following words do
not hang handſomly together with the precedent, unleſs
<hi>This</hi> be chang'd into <hi>His;</hi> therefore 'twas fitting to do it.
Add that, to gain ſome ſorry advantage, he changes the
words of their own tranſlation, <hi>that he might go,</hi> into, <hi>that
he may go;</hi> becauſe the thing, according to Dr. H's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
being to be perform'd for the future, <hi>may go</hi>
can ſignify futurely, which <hi>might go</hi> does not, as his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt
<hi>Will. Lilly</hi> hath told him in his <hi>Potential mood.</hi>
Such another trifling advantage he gaines; by ſaying that
a <hi>comma</hi> after <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is already in the printed Copies: had
he ſaid, <hi>in ſome printed Copies,</hi> he had been more candid;
for the words, <hi>the printed Copies,</hi> import it is ſo in <hi>all</hi> that
are printed; which is falſe, it being neither ſo (to omit
others) in the printed Copies of <hi>Stephanus</hi> nor <hi>Arias
Montanus,</hi> held by themſelves to be the beſt.</p>
               <p>His fourth argument is that <hi>Hell being the common
place of all wicked men, it cannot fitly be expreſt with
ſuch a double emphaſis, as is</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. I anſwer
firſt, that there is no <hi>double emphaſis</hi> there; the firſt
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> being nothing but a plain propoſitive article. Next, to
come to the point; as <hi>Son of Perdition</hi> is a name for all
wicked men, yet apply'd particularly to <hi>Iudas</hi> by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
he being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and in a peculiar and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
degree ſuch: ſo, though Hell be <hi>the common place of
all wicked men,</hi> yet it is tmore properly and peculiarly his;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115675:108"/>
his particular wickedneſs giving him a ſpecial title to it.
And laſtly, who doubts but that <hi>Iudas</hi> in Hell hath a
<hi>proper</hi> place of his own which no other damned ſoul hath?
So that, as Dr. H. ſays here, that <hi>thoſe words may very
fitly be affirm'd of Mathias his province; ſo his, as it is not
any mans elſe:</hi> ſo I ſay, with the ſame reaſon, that thoſe
words may very fitly be affirm'd of <hi>Iudas his place in Hell;</hi>
it being <hi>ſo his, as it is not any mans elſe.</hi> Is not this an und<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunted
Adverſary, who dares aduenture to come into
the liſts of diſputation, armed onely with ſuch Bull-rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes
as theſe?</p>
               <p>His laſt argument, which you muſt imagin his ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
(for art and prudence both require this order) is this,
(<hi>Repl.</hi> 53) that <hi>It is not neer ſo proper to ſay, he ſin'd to
go to Hell; as that the other was choſen and ſurrogated into
Iudas his place, to go to preach to ſuch a quarter of the
world.</hi> True indeed; for, if it be taken thus maimed and
corruptedly as he hath rendered it, it is ſo far from
<hi>proper,</hi> that it is <hi>abſurd</hi> and non-ſenſe. But, I would know
of Mr. H. where he ever found it render'd <hi>he ſinned to go
to Hell,</hi> except onely in this preſent partial tranſlation of
his own. Obſerve, good Reader, the ſincerity of this
man: the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> can ſignify, if taken in
due circumſtances, <hi>to ſin;</hi> but, as taken here joyned in
conſtruction with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>from which,</hi> it is impoſſible to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
ſo, as every man ſees; for who ever heard ſuch a
phraſe as <hi>to ſin from a thing?</hi> Now, what does Mr. H?
he leaves out the words, <hi>from which,</hi> which were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
conjoyn'd with the reſt in conſtruction; and then, (to
make the phraſe ſound abſurdly and diſgracefully) firſt,
gives the word ſuch and English as was impoſſible it
should bear in that place, (For, what ſenſe make theſe
words, <hi>from which Iudas ſinned?</hi> next, begins the
phraſe at <hi>ſinned,</hi> (which word he joyns with <hi>going to Hell,</hi>
though in the <hi>parag.</hi> before he would have had them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated)
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115675:108"/>
and ſays, <hi>it is not proper to ſay, he ſinned to goe to
Hell;</hi> whereas 'twas onely his own ſly craft, which had
made it improper. So ſincere was his profeſſion of his
<hi>earneſt deſire to ſpeak the full truth of God,</hi> that he here
purpoſely annihilates God's word, which is his Truth,
and will not let it ſpeak out fully; but firſt gagges it with
a <hi>parentheſis;</hi> next, cuts out it's tongrue by maiming the
Context: whereas, he might have ſeen it render'd in their
own tranſlation, <hi>from which Iudas by tranſgreſſion fell,</hi>
nay he render'd it ſo himſelf before, which will not let ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
excuſe him; and he knew well enough that the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> joyned with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies plainly <hi>departed
aſide, prevaricated, went aſide,</hi> &amp;c. and then the ſenſe is
no harsher than this, that he went aſtray from one ſtate to
go to another; from the Apoſtolical <hi>office</hi> to go to <hi>Hell,</hi>
or from being an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as our Saviour reprehended
him, to become a Devil.</p>
               <p>After this rare defence of his blaſphemous, crooked, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
interpretation of thoſe words, (<hi>Repl, p.</hi> 54.) he ends
his Section, praiſing the ſaid interpretation for <hi>innocent,
obvious,</hi> and <hi>far from wreſted:</hi> and <hi>hopes that all this amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
together will vindicate it.</hi> That is, he dares not even
hope that he hath produced any one thing to ſtand to and
build upon: yet (as the wordish ſide of the Schools hold
that Quantity or <hi>Diviſibility</hi> may be made up of <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibles;</hi>)
ſo he thinks an <hi>accumulation</hi> of <hi>weakneſſes</hi> will
make his defence <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and a great deal of <hi>non-ſenſe,</hi> if
it be <hi>amaſſed</hi> together, will compound good <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far his <hi>Reply</hi> proceeds to make good his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
by reaſon. Next, in his <hi>Anſwer</hi> he endeavours
to authorize it by Teſtimonies; which he braggs of there
(<hi>p</hi> 39.) to be <hi>juſt the ſame with the Doctor</hi>'s, meaning
himſelf.</p>
               <p>Not to wrong Dr. H. otherwiſe than by showing

               <p>The firſt teſtimony, which he ſayes (with what truth

when we ſay the place of a Bishop, or of an Elder.</hi> Where (to

poſſibility of it's ſignifying ſo in it's ſelf, nay from it's ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving
<hi>many</hi> ſignifications) Mr. H. makes <hi>the order of dignitie</hi>
to have <hi>juſt the ſame</hi> notion with a local diſtribution of
<hi>place,</hi> or <hi>a leſſer Province:</hi> which are ſo not ajot-the-ſame,
that it is as eaſy to maintain there can be an <hi>Hirco-cervus,</hi>
as that theſe two notions of different <hi>species</hi> can be one.</p>
               <p>The fourth troops after it's fellows in this form. <hi>So the
ordinary gloſs; ut abiret in locum ſuum, Id eſt, ſortem Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicam;
That he might go to his own place, Id eſt, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
lot.</hi> But, whether this <hi>Apoſtolical lot</hi> were the
<hi>office</hi> of Apoſtles, as we hold and have proved at large;
or <hi>a leſſer Province,</hi> as he holds, and pretends to find it
here <hi>identically</hi> expreſt, nothing at all is found in this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
which the Doctor notwithſtanding aſſures us is <hi>juſt-the-ſame</hi>
with the latter.</p>
               <p>This done, he triumphs over <hi>S.</hi> W. moſt unmercifully,
animated by theſe his <hi>juſt-the-ſame</hi> interpretations. In a
word, if he will contend that theſe Authours give a third
explication of the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which neither of
us had; I grant it: but, to ſay it is <hi>juſt the ſame</hi> with his
(as Dr. H. does here) is ſo perfect a piece of abuſiveneſs
to his Readers, as will be able ever hereafter to dishear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
even his beſt Friends from crediting his bare ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
though never ſo confident and triumphant, who
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115675:110"/>
would not have them credit their own eyes.</p>
               <p>Were all that hath been ſaid concerning theſe two
miſ-explications of Dr. H's duly conſider'd, litle would
remain to let any man, who hath any tender reſpect to
Truth and God's word, plainly ſee, they are juſtly to be
ſtyled <hi>blaſphemous.</hi> But, becauſe he will acknowledge
no <hi>blaſphemy</hi> at all in them, wee'l show him two. The
firſt is a <hi>blasphemy</hi> againſt the <hi>honour</hi> due to God's word:
for ſure it can be no leſs, thus to make a noſe of wax of
thoſe ſacred Oracles; and, that he may maintain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly
a ſelf-imagin'd conceit of his own, to detort it thus
shamefully and pervert it, both without and againſt all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
found in the Context, and all ground any
where elſe, ſave onely in the brain which bred the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera.</hi>
A Reverence, I ſay, and a tender reſpect is to be
had to God's word; not wreſting it to bear teſtimony to
every falshood imaginable, (as it eaſily may, if treated
on this manner,) nor handle it in ſuch a ſort as the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of paradoxes do the teſtimonies they cite from
Authours; which they on ſet purpoſe ſiniſterly (but far
more ingeniouſly and handſomly) miſtake, by a pretty
fetch to make show of a proof of their merry <hi>Theſes.</hi>
The ſecond is <hi>a blaſphemy</hi> againſt the <hi>honour</hi> due to Faith;
which, being in it's ſelf certain, ſuffers in it's fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
if occaſion be given to think it ſuch a weak thing,
as either to be built upon or overthrown by ſuch more
than frivolous, leſs than probable, grounds, as are thoſe
diſtorſions of Scripture now ſpoken of. Will not Atheiſts
and Heathens laugh, to ſee thoſe that profeſs Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
object, againſt a point held ſo univerſally of Faith, as
this of the Pope's Headship was, ſuch <hi>quod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ibetical</hi> trash?
And, is not Faith it ſelf by ſuch a non-ſenſical debating
it, (should no Profeſſion of Chriſtianity bring better
arguments than this Doctor) liable to be imagin'd, by
prudent men not yet acquainted with it, an idler and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115675:110"/>
more groundleſs Story than the very tales of King <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
and <hi>Robin Good-fellow?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two blaſphemies then, Mr. H. attend your miſ-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
I mean, ſuch as Catholicks hold for <hi>blaſphemies:</hi>
who defend Faith to be a thing certain, and to have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
grounds; as alſo that God's word is never to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,
but with gravity and ſeriouneſs, and, as neer as
is in a man's power, to the ſenſe the Context moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carries; at leaſt, not abus'd and vilify'd by fathering
upon it ſuch groundleſs interpretations; nay treating it
in ſuch an irreverent fashion, that there is no poſition in
the world ſo unwarrantable, abſurd, falſe, and impious, but
may, by the ſame method of groundleſs criticizing, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
thence: which devolves into this, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the Authour of Truth and the expreſſer of it in the
holy Scripture, shall, by this means, become the Father
of all falshoods and the Authour of every groundleſs and
non-ſenſical abſurdity. This manner of treating Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
then, we Catholicks account in an high degree <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous;</hi>
nay, to open the way to all blaſphemouſneſs:
and this, becauſe we do not dogmatize upon it or affix to
it any interpretation that we build faith upon, which is
not warranted by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal practice of the Church,
and our Rule of Faith, <hi>Vniverſal Tradition:</hi> though we
know 'tis the Proteſtant's gallantry to make it dance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the jigging humour of their own fancies; calling all,
<hi>God's word,</hi> though never ſo abſurd, which their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
heads, without ground or shadow of ground, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
deducible thence; nay more, to call it an <hi>Evidence,</hi>
that is, a ground ſufficient to found and eſtablish Faith
upon. And thus much for Dr. H's <hi>blaſphemous</hi> and <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent</hi>
treating both Faith and Scripture.</p>

offer'd him, <hi>p.</hi> 52. that <hi>if, among thoſe many teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
he produces to prove it, there be but found any one
ſentence, line, word, ſyllable, or letter, which excludes
S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Authority from the Gentiles, more than what
himſelf puts in of his own head, he would be content to
yeeld him the whole Controverſy;</hi> which he vindicated,
to the very eyes of the Reader, from every teſtimony, one
by one, alledged by Dr. H. In this manner ſtood the caſe
then between <hi>S.</hi> W. and his Adverſary: it remains now
to be ſeen what reply he tenders to ſo grievous, heavy, and
unheard-of a charge; and how he can colour a fault ſo
groſs, palpable, and viſible to the eye of every Reader.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, good Reader, I beſeech thee, (whether thou be
Catholick, Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or of whatever other profeſſion) that
now the very point of the Controverſy is in agitation:
For we pretend no <hi>tenour</hi> for the Pop'es Supremacy, ſave
onely that he ſucceeds <hi>S. Peter,</hi> whom we hold to have
had it: if then it be <hi>evidenced,</hi> (as is pretended) that <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
had none; the Doctor hath inevitably concluded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us. Reflect alſo, I intreat thee, on the grievouſneſs
of the charge layd by <hi>S.</hi> W. againſt Dr. H. and make full
account, (as reaſon obliges thee, and I, for my part, give
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115675:112"/>
thee my good leave) that there muſt be moſt open knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and perfect voluntary inſincerity on one ſide or other:
and, when thou haſt examin'd it well, (I am a party, and
ſo muſt not be a Iudge) lay thou the blame where thou
shalt find the fault. Neither deſpair that thou haſt abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
enough to be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent Iudge in this preſent conteſt:
here is no nice ſubtlety to be ſpeculated, but plain words
to be read: for, what plainer, than to ſee whether in the
teſtimonies there be any words limiting the Iuriſdiction of
<hi>S. Peter,</hi> or whether they were onely the additions of
Dr. H. antecedently or ſubſequently to the teſtimonies?</p>
               <p>But what needs any Iudge to determine or decide that
which Dr. H. himſelf hath confeſt here in his <hi>Reply</hi> and
<hi>Anſwer?</hi> where ſeeing it impoſſible to show any one
word, in all that army of Teſtimonies which he muſter'd
up there, <hi>limiting S. Peters</hi> Iuriſdiction to the <hi>Iews,</hi> or
<hi>excluding</hi> it from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which yet was there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
he hath recourſe for his juſtification to the moſt
unpardonable shift that ever was ſuggeſted by a deſperate
cauſe: <hi>viz.</hi> to deny that he mean't <hi>excluſiveneſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction;</hi>
that is, to deny his <hi>own</hi> expreſs words, the
whole <hi>tenour</hi> of his diſcourſe there, the main ſcope and
<hi>intention</hi> of that Chapter' and laſtly to change and alter
the <hi>ſtate</hi> and face of the whole Queſtion. This is my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
charge againſt him, conſiſting of theſe foure bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?
which if they be proved from his own words, he is
judged by his own mouth, and can hope for no pardon,
but the heavieſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation imaginable from all ſincere
Readers; ſince it is impoſſible to imagin a fifth point from
which he could prevaricate, omitted by him, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
his preſent prevarication is in the higheſt degree
culpable and unpardonable.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, his own expreſs <hi>words</hi> manifeſt he mean't
<hi>Excluſiveneſs of Iuriſdiction.</hi> For, <hi>of Schiſm p.</hi> 70. he
uſes the very word <hi>excluſively,</hi> ſaying that S. <hi>Peter was
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115675:112"/>
Apoſtle of the Iews excluſively to the Gentiles:</hi> and,
that this <hi>excluſiveneſs</hi> was meant to be of <hi>Iuriſdiction,</hi> is
no leſs expreſſely manifeſted from the following page;
where it is ſaid, that <hi>but one portion of the diſperſed Iews
can reaſonably be placed under S. Peter's Iuriſdiction,</hi>
which is ſeconded by his expreſs words here alſo, <hi>Reply</hi>
p. 56 <hi>the portion of one Apoſtle is ſo his, that he hath no
right to any other part,—Excludes him from any farther
right,</hi> &amp;c. and ſure if he have no right to preach to any
other Provinces, he hath no Iuriſdiction at all over
them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the whole <hi>tenour</hi> of the diſcourſe there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts
that he meant <hi>excluſiveneſs of Iuriſdiction.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs
of Juriſdiction</hi> is mentioned by him as the Ground
of all his enſuing diſpute; as was shown in the foregoing
<hi>parag.</hi> to which we will add his other parallel expreſſions:
<hi>The Iuriſdiction of that Metropolis belonged to Iames the
Iuſt, and not to Peter: of Sſchiſm,</hi> p. 73. <hi>S. Paul's inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on S. Peter:</hi> pag. 74. to wit, in Iuriſdiction or
power. <hi>No power can deſcend from S. Peter to any other, for
another great part of the Chriſtian world:</hi> p. 80. <hi>Had he</hi>
(meaning <hi>S. Peter) any Iuriſdiction over the Churches of
Aſia?</hi> p. 83. <hi>No other Apoſtle could countermand S. Paul's
inſtructions, no appeal left,</hi> &amp;c. p. 83. <hi>S. Peter's bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
in Brittany muſt in all reaſon be extended no farther
than this his line,</hi> Id eſt, <hi>to the Iews which might at that
time be diſperſt there,</hi> &amp;c. p. 84. All which render it moſt
manifeſt, that he meant <hi>Excluſiueneſs of Iuriſdiction</hi> and
power to preach to another line or Province; if there
were any tenour or connexion at all in his diſcourſe, and
that it rambled not forwards blindly, himſelf knew not
how nor whither.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, not onely the whole Controverſy of
Schiſm is about the limitation or illimitation, <hi>excluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
or <hi>not excluſiveneſs,</hi> of the Pope's Iuriſdiction, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115675:113"/>
the Doctor's <hi>tenet,</hi> that this Iuriſdiction is limited to ſuch
an extent, &amp; excluded from the reſt of the Chriſtian world,
ſo as he hath no power or command at all over them: but
alſo his preſent Chapter (4. <hi>of Schiſm</hi>) pretends to <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
this limitation of his, from the limitation of <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s;
as is moſt viſible <hi>parag.</hi> 6. of the ſaid Chapter,
and indeed in each <hi>parag.</hi> there, to the twentieth. So that,
the import of his argument ſtands thus; S. <hi>Peter</hi> had no
Vniverſal Iuriſdiction, thefore his Succeſſour the Pope
can have none. This being ſo, who ſees not that, ſince
the thing to be infer'd is the Pope's limitation of Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as held by the Proteſtants, that is ſuch a limitation
as debats and excludes him from any lawfull power or
right at all to intermeddle with more than is his imagin'd
Province; and that this inference is built upon his ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a limited Predeceſſour <hi>S. Peter:</hi> who ſees not, I ſay,
that the Antecedent muſt mean <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Iuriſdiction
was ſo limited to his ſuppoſed Province, that he had no
Iuriſdiction or power at all to meddle with a Gentile;
but that it was againſt right and vnlawful for him to do
ſo? This therefore is an evidence beyond all shuffling to
avoid it, that Dr. H. in his fourth Chap. <hi>of Schiſm,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to prove the Iuriſdictions of the Apoſtles were <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively-limited</hi>
to their own Provinces; ſo that they loſt
all power to preach to another Province: from which
Dr. H. prevaricating here, and not defending his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
produc't there to prove it; it follows that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<hi>S.</hi> W. charge to be true; (<hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd</hi> p. 52.)
that, <q>among thoſe many teſtimonies he produces to
prove it, there is not found any one ſentence, line, ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or letter excluding <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Authority from the
Gentiles; ſave onely what the Doctor puts in of his
own head: as he shews there in each particular alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This being then Dr. H's meaning, till <hi>S.</hi> W. charge of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115675:113"/>
the perfect dumbneſs of his teſtimonies put ſecond
thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hs into his Head; let us ſee how he waves his own
expreſs words and manifeſt intentions there: which being
ſo perfectly viſible, as hath been shown, we may be ſure
the prevaricating from them can coſt him no leſs than
plain ſelf contradictions.</p>
               <p>His firſt ſelf-contradiction is found <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 38. <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag.</hi>
2. where he makes the point he was to prove to be
no more but this, that <hi>the Apoſtles went not all to one, but
diſpoſed themſelves over all the world, to ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces:</hi>
By which, meaning, as he muſt, (for otherwiſe it
cannot be ſaid to be <hi>evident by it's own light</hi>) that one went
to one place, ordinary Province, or region of the world,
to preach, another to another, without any relation at all
to <hi>excluſiveneſs of Iuriſdiction;</hi> we have quite loſt the
queſtion: which was not Whether the Apoſtles one went
one way, another another way, to preach; but, whether
S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and conſequently the Pope his Succeſſour, had
an Vniverſal or limited Iuriſdiction, extending his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to all, or excluding it from all but his pittifull Province;
as was manifeſted before, by Mr. H's expreſs words, to
have been his meaning.</p>
               <p>His ſecond ſelf-contradiction is found in the ſame place;
where he ſayes that what was ſignify'd by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
(or <hi>excluſive Provinces</hi> belonging to each Apoſtle, which
was shown plainly before to be his expreſs meaning) <hi>is
evident by it's own light, and needs no evidencing.</hi> And
yet, in his book <hi>of Schiſm, c. 4. parag.</hi> 4. he ſet himſelf
very formally <hi>to offer his Evidences for that point;</hi> and
proſecuted his intent, from <hi>parag.</hi> 5. to the 20. to <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
it by ſuch clouds of teſtimonies, (which he calls <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi>
and ſome of them <hi>irrefragable</hi> and <hi>unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
ones) as may very neer, if not perfectly, equal all the
reſt that are found in his whole book. So that, either he
muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſs he ſpent the moſt ſubſtantial part of his book
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115675:114"/>
to <hi>evidence that which needed no Evidencing, but was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
by it's own light;</hi> or elſe, (which is the truth of the
buſineſs) that he hath chang'd the whole queſtion he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
from what it was there: For there it was of <hi>Excluſiue Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,</hi>
and therefore very obſcure, needing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of many teſtimonies (though dumbe) and his own
<hi>Id eſts</hi> and voluntarily add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d words, to make it ſeem evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
here it is onely of one Apoſtle going one way ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
going another to preach, which indeed needs no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing,
nor was ever in queſtion between us.</p>
               <p>His third ſelf-contradiction is, that, notwithſtanding
his own expreſs words, the ſcope of his whole Chapter,
the tenour of his whole diſcourſe; and the ſtate of the
whole queſtion manifeſting he both did and could not but
mean it of <hi>excluſive Iuriſdiction,</hi> (as hath been moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
and amply shown;) yet he calls my acception of
his words in that ſenſe, my <hi>miſtake; Anſw. p. 39. l.</hi> 34.
and again, <hi>p. 41. l.</hi> 7. 8. &amp;c. he complains that <hi>S.</hi> W.
<hi>would conclude from his words, that he would have all the
Apoſtles to have ſeveral Provinces limiting their Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
&amp; excluſive of one another's right;</hi> which he calls
there alſo <hi>a miſtake and detortion.</hi> Where the Reader
may ſee how perfectly he denies his own words of <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Iuriſdiction,</hi> and how openly he prevaricates from
all the foure formerly-mention'd pretences, shown alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to have been his own; which were the ſtrongeſt ries
imaginable to bind any man to hold to what he hath
ſaid, who had not forſworn all reſpect to truth or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</p>
               <p>His fourth ſelf-contradiction is, that, though in the
place now alledged he complains of me, that <hi>I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from his words that the Apoſtles had Provinces ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
of one anothers right,</hi> yet his own plain words,
<hi>Repl. pag. 56. l.</hi> 2. 5. moſt expreſſely grant it; where,
ſpeaking of thoſe Provinces proper to each Apoſtle, he
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115675:114"/>
hath theſe words; <hi>So his that he hath no right to any other;
ſo his, as excludes him from any farther right.</hi> Is not this
handſom?</p>
               <p>His fifth ſelf contradiction is a very neat one. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this place alledged, <hi>S. Peter</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Province is <hi>ſo his,
as excludes him from any farther right;</hi> that is, from any
right to Preach to anothers Province; yet in the ſame,
<hi>Sect. p</hi> 57. l. 18. he grants it <hi>lawfull</hi> for <hi>S. Peter to Preach
to Gentiles;</hi> that is, to thoſe of <hi>Pauls</hi> S. Province. Now
we duller Souls imagind that <hi>right</hi> &amp; <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> was all
one, &amp; that no man could <hi>lawfully</hi> doe what he had <hi>no
right</hi> to doe, but Dr. H. confronts &amp; counterpoſes theſe
two identicall notions, by excluding him in one place
from <hi>right</hi> to preach to another Province, &amp; in the other
place granting the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of his preaching to another
Province; which being the expreſſe places in which he
goes about to declare his meaning in that point, manifeſts
his <hi>tenet</hi> to be, that the Apoſtles might <hi>lawfully</hi> do what
they had <hi>no right</hi> to do, or might <hi>lawfully</hi> do <hi>againſt law</hi>
&amp; right, that is might do it <hi>lawfully</hi> but could not <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi>
which ſettles into this elegant Contradiction, that
they might <hi>lawfully</hi> doe it <hi>wrongfully.</hi> Thus ſelf-unkind
<hi>Soſia</hi> beats himſelf according as the change of his uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
&amp; phantaſticall Grounds puts his mind in ſeverall
Shapes.</p>
               <p>His ſixth ſelf contradiction touches more particularly
this point in hand of excluſive Provinces; He tels us (<hi>of
Schiſm,</hi> p. 70.) that <hi>Authority and Commiſſion was given
to all the Apoſtles indefinitely and unlimitedly, not reſtrained
by Chriſts words to any parti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ular Province;</hi> and again (<hi>Repl.</hi>
p 55.) ſpeaking of the particular aſſignations of <hi>S. Peter</hi>
to the Iews &amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the Gentils, he affirms expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely,
that <hi>it was not by any particular aſſignation of Chriſt's,
but by agreement amongſt themſelves that this aſſignation of
Provinces was made;</hi> yet, the ſame Author (<hi>of Schiſm
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115675:115"/>
p. 74. l.</hi> 4. maintains the direct contrary or rather contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
poſitionto the forme, ſaying that <hi>S. Paul had his
aſſignation immediately from Christ.</hi> So vtterly void of all
truth is this Chimera of excluſive Provinces, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it underſtands not his own meaning in it, or at
leaſt forgets what he ſaid before concerning it when he
comes into new circumſtances; or rather indeed volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
ſays any thing according as it ſutes beſt with his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
Hence, in the former places it fitted his turn to ſay
that the excluſive Provinces or aſſignation muſt come
from their agreement not from Chriſt; becauſe he was
there to show their Commiſſion &amp; Authority limitted,
which, as coming from Chriſt was held by all to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
Vniverſal; but in the laſt place, where he
had undertaken to shew <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s independence on S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
it favourd more his intent to ſay, that he had his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
imediately from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> leſt S. <hi>Paul</hi> should ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
any dependence at all on S. <hi>Peter,</hi> no not euen for
conſenting to his aſſignation,</p>
               <p>His ſeventh ſelf-contradiction is, that building upon
the words <hi>Gal. 2. 7. (the Goſpel of the Circumciſion is
committed to mee, as the Goſpel of the uncircumciſion to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>)
for the excluſive Provinces of thoſe two Apoſtles,
he by conſequence gets all the reſt of the Apoſtles leave
to play, ſince one as he ſaies is <hi>excluded from any right to
preach to anothers Province,</hi> and there can be no more
Provinces or people to Preach to than Iews &amp; Gentiles,
which are there diſtributed between theſe two Apoſtles:
nor is the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which, according to Dr. H.
(<hi>Repl.</hi> p. 55.) ſignifies the <hi>Agreement</hi> which was to give
them excluſive Provinces) applied in the place alledged
to any but <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi> in order to the Iews &amp; the
Gentiles. This kinde favour not withſtanding done to
the reſt of the Apoſtles, he afterwards ſpoils, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them Provinces too; treating them as diſcourreous
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115675:115"/>
Schoolmaſters vſe to treat their Schollars; that is, firſt
giving them leave to play while the ſupplicant is preſent,
but, he being gone &amp; the circumſtance changed, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them a task as labourious as had been their School
exerciſe it ſelf. When <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Vniverſal Iuriſdiction was
to be limitted, then it went currant that the Iews were his
peculiar Province, and the ſaid place brought to eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
it. But, this once done, he bethought himſelf that the
Power over all the Iews was too much to attribute to
<hi>S. Peter,</hi> and that the Pope might hap to grow proud to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
a perſon of ſo ample an Authoritie: wherefore finding
that ſuch and ſuch Apoſtles preached in ſuch &amp; ſuch a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to the Iews, he thought it beſt to call the Iews there
their Province; So that good <hi>S. Peter</hi> (whom all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
flatterd it ſeems with the title of Prince or Head of
the Apoſtles) hath allotted him by Chriſts Head-Steward
Dr. H. (<hi>of Schiſm, p. 71. l.</hi> 21. 22.) no more but <hi>one por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
(or a few miſerable Parishes) <hi>of the diſperſed Iews to be
under his Iuriſdiction</hi> But Dr. H. takes it ill (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 42)
that I laugh at him for thus treating <hi>S. Peter.</hi> I Anſwer,
the moſt ridiculous poſition that ever was made ſeriouſly
by any Divine in the world (as is this of excluſive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces)
is not treated as it deſerves unles it be laught at.
Next, he tels me that I <hi>never offer to conſider the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by which it was made evident.</hi> I Anſwer, ſure Dr. H.
is a ſleep, I conſiderd in <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd</hi> each allegation
of his minutely &amp; particularly through ſix whole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that is from p. 42. till p. 87. &amp; offerd to yeeld him
the whole controverſie, if he could shew me the leaſt word
in any one of them limiting <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Iuriſdiction to any
ſuch Province; which he dares not here accept, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
his own words &amp; flies from the whole queſtion as has
been shown. Thirdly, he calls my words <hi>a calumny,</hi> &amp;
complains very Soberly that I <hi>never relent at it.</hi> I Anſwer
that I confeſſe my ill nature, I never relent into retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115675:116"/>
of my tenet upon the perſuaſion of contradiction.
Rhetorick, though oftentimes I may relent into a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
mingled either with pitty, if I ſee the fault was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or elſe with juſt zeal &amp; ſcorn when I ſee Souls
traind to Hell by wilful frauds. Laſtly, he asks, upon this
occaſion, <hi>what contradictories may not this wonder-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
faculty of S. W's reconcile?</hi> I Anſwer, it cannot recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
Dr. H's contradictions here, this being a task beyond
miracle, but to return to his ſelf-contradictions.</p>
               <p>His eighth is, that whereas (<hi>Repl.</hi> p. 57. <hi>l.</hi> 19. 20. &amp;c.)
he would evade his own implicatory poſition in which he
was entangled by telling us, he meant onely that <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
&amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s Provinces were excluſive, when they met
at the ſame City; himſelf flatly contradicts it in his Book
<hi>of Schiſm,</hi> p. 84. where Speaking of <hi>S. Peters Baptizing
&amp; conſtituting Bishops in Britany,</hi> he tels us, <hi>it muſt in all
reaſon be extended no farther then S. Peters line, as he was
Apoſtle of the Circumciſion, Id eſt</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>to the Iews
that might at that time be diſperſed there.</hi> In which place he
manifeſtly makes <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Province excluſive in <hi>Brita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
where he never pretends that <hi>S. Paul</hi> met him; though
before he told us that the agreement between <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp;
S. <hi>Paul</hi> was onely excluſive <hi>when they met at the ſame Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp;c.</hi> How powerfull &amp; terrible is truth which can dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
her oppoſers to defend themſelves by ſuch miſerable
and weak implications?</p>
               <p>His ninth ſelf-contradiction quarrels with both parts
of his ſixth at once; according to the former part of which
<hi>S. Paul</hi> had not his Province from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s aſſignation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the later part of it he had it imediately from
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s aſſignation; yet maugre both theſe (<hi>Repl. 58. par.</hi>
5.) he makes <hi>S. Pauls</hi> peculiar Province Spring <hi>onely</hi> from
the Iews <hi>refuſing</hi> &amp; <hi>rejecting his doctrine;</hi> onely, I ſay;
for he affirms there expreſly that till the Iews refuſed &amp;
rejected it, he does not betake himſelf ſo peculiarly to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115675:116"/>
the Gentiles; whence follows, in all likelihood, that if
the Iews had not rejected <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s doctrine, tenderd by
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that Apoſtle had never gone peculiarly to the
Gentils, nor by conſequence should have had any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
or excluſive Province at all. Is not this a ſolid man?
To omit that this experiencing of more fruit among the
Gentiles then among the Iews is that which <hi>S.</hi> w. puts for
the reaſon of his peculiar Apoſtleship &amp; the Appellation
of Apoſtle of the Gentils enſuing thereupon.</p>
               <p>Theſe &amp; ſome others are the ſelf-contradictions with
which this Adverſary of mine, ſeing it impoſſible to shew
one word in any teſtimony excluding &amp; limiting the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
of the Apoſtles, shuffles to &amp; fro on all ſides,
that ſo what ever poſition he should be challenged with
he may ſlip &amp; avoyd it by shewing (as he eaſily may)
that he ſaid in another place the expreſſe contrary, and
then when he hath done he preaches repentance or elſe
Hell &amp; damnation to his wicked Adverſary for calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him who thus <hi>earneſtly deſires</hi> (for Sooth) to <hi>ſpeak
the full truth of God (Anſw.</hi> p. 18.) and that ſo carefully,
that to make ſure work, for fear one part of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
should not be the truth of God, he affirms both;
But I hope the Reader will be aware of his shifting weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes,
&amp; waving all his ſelf ſaid affirmations, his Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
non-ſence, his pious formalities, will preſſe him home
with this <hi>Dilemma.</hi> Either S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Authority was ſo <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi>
by his pretended deſignation to one Province, as
he had no power to preach to another, or it was not but
remaind ſtil <hi>illimited</hi> &amp; Vniverſal, not witſtanding
this imagind deſignation; if it remaind ſtil unlimited and
Vniverſal, how can the Pope's Authority be concluded
limited from his ſucceeding <hi>S. Peter,</hi> if S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s remaind
ever unlimited? But, if his Authority &amp; Iuriſdiction was
limited, and that this was the thing to be proved by Dr.
H. in his book <hi>of Schiſm,</hi> then why does he not vindicate
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115675:117"/>
his teſtimonies from that shamefull charge layd againſt
them particularly by <hi>S.</hi> W. that there is not one wordin
them limiting the Apoſtles Iuriſdictions, but what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
adds of his own Head? And why does he inſtead of
thus vindicating them here, ſometimes flatly deny the
queſtion, ſometimes shuffle about to blunder a point ſo
clear, at any rate, though it coſt him no leſſe then ſuch
numerous &amp; moſt palpable ſelf-contradictions, ſure the
knot muſt be great which could ſtand need of having
wedges thus driven in point-blank oppoſitely on both ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

ſufficiently expreſt (tract. of Schiſm c. 4. <hi>p.</hi> 7.) how far this
agreement extended, &amp; how far excluſive it was; not that it
should be unlawful for Peter to preach to a Gentil, or for Paul
to a Iew; but h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t at the ſame City (as at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch
certainly they did, and at Rome alſo I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion)
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115675:117"/>
then the one should conſtantly apply himſelf to the Iews,
receive Diſciples, form them into a Church, leave them to be
governed by a Bishop of his aſſignation, and the other should
doe in like manner to the Gentiles. <hi>Thus he very pithily:
let us unfold &amp; lay open what he has (as his cuſtome is)
involued here, &amp; ſee what a heap of weakneſſes lies ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
there, crowded up in ſo narrow a room.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, he brings theſe words here as an explanation of his
meaning, that is, of the ſtate of the queſtion between
us concerning how far theſe Provinces were excluſive:
whereas in the place cited (<hi>of Schiſm c. 4. par.</hi> 7.) it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put as an inſtance of their imagin'd excluſive Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
&amp; introduc't with an <hi>Accordingly;</hi> not purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely
Stating or determining the meaſure or extent of their
agreement; nor is there any expreſſion found there which
ſounds to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this Excluſivenes of Iuriſdiction, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made ſuch a loud ſound, is now onely come to be
ſuch when they met at the ſame City; &amp;, by conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
abſtracting from that circumſtance, S. <hi>Peter</hi> had Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Authority: which is a great largneſs of his towards S.
<hi>Peter,</hi> and I wonder whence this kindnes ſprings towards
the Pope's Predeceſſor.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſince theſe two Apoſtles, as far as we hear,
never met in any City after this pretended diſtribution of
Provinces ſave onely at <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; at <hi>Antioch,</hi> it follows
that, as far as Dr. H. knows, <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Iuriſdiction was
univerſal over both Iews and Gentiles in all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides;
&amp; at all other times except onely thoſe short ſeaſons
in which they met together. Fourthly, it follows that the
Pope's Authority is not limited ſave onely where he
meets <hi>S. Paul</hi> or his Succeſſors, (or perhaps, as he needs
will have it, S. <hi>Iohn</hi>) and then I conceive it will be very
ample.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, ſince he grants, that both the Congregations
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115675:118"/>
of Iews &amp; Gentils were joyned in one under Pope <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(of Schiſm,</hi> p. 79.) that Pope by conſequence ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
them both; &amp; ſo the excluſivenes of <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
when he met <hi>S. Paul,</hi> cannot poſſibly infer
ſuch an excluſivenes or limitation of Iuriſdiction in the
now Popes, or the Popes which have been ſince the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gind
conjunction of thoſe Congregations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
may pretend it makes againſt the univerſal Iuriſdictions
of thoſe Popes, who preceded <hi>Clemens.</hi> Thus at unawa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
Dr. H. grants the Pope as much as we deſire, &amp; yet
very innocently thinks he impugns him; or (as himſelf
expreſſes it <hi>Anſw. p. 11.) laies the Axe to the root and ſtocks
up Rome's univerſal Paſtourship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, the queſtion being turned into excluſivenes
of Iuriſdiction when they met in the ſame City onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it followes, there is not the leaſt pretence of a teſtimony
from Scripture for this poſition thus ſtated; for 'tis no
where found nor pretended to be found in Scripture, that
their Iuriſdictions were onely to be limited, in caſe of
meeting in the ſame City. So that now the pretence of
evidencing from Scripture, which in the book <hi>of Schiſm,</hi>
made a great noiſe, is, by this new ſtating the queſtion,
or rather evading it, ſtruck quite dumb.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, it is to be obſerved, he has not a word in
any teſtimony to prove their excluſive Iuriſdictions in
<hi>Rome</hi> &amp; <hi>Antioch,</hi> but onely thoſe which affirmed that
<hi>they preach't, were Bishop in Rome,</hi> &amp; <hi>founded the Church</hi>
in both places: All which might eaſily be done by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous
Authority; nor does he offer one word of proof
to underprop his weak teſtimonies why it could not be
thus performed.</p>
               <p>Eigthly, his place, in his book <hi>of Schiſm,</hi> which he
produces for their excluſive Iuriſdictions, falls short of
what he alledges it for, affirming onely, that when they
met at the ſame City one should <hi>conſtantly apply himſelf</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:115675:118"/>
to the Gentiles the other to the Iews. Now the prudent
conſideration of circumſtances may determine one man
to doe <hi>conſtantly</hi> this thing, another to doe <hi>conſtantly</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, without inferring that either of them loſt
their <hi>right</hi> to doe the other, by this <hi>conſtancy</hi> of action
exerciſed upon this one. By which faltring miſtake of his
own words we may ſee, that when he alledges them
now, as a <hi>ſufficient expreſſion</hi> of his tenet of excluſivenes,
he onely ſought to eſcape from &amp; change his former
queſtion; and to evade, by vertue of the more modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
word [<hi>conſtantly</hi>] which ſtanding in the confines bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween
excluſivenes &amp; not excluſivenes, might, at a dead
litf, by the Midwifry of an <hi>Id eſt,</hi> or a criticiſm, bring
forth either ſignification.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, the Iews (according to Dr. H.) being S.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Province excluſively to the Gentiles, &amp; not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively
till they met in one City; it follows that, unles
they had met, he had no excluſive Province at all. Hence.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, ſince they agreed upon excluſive Provinces
it follows, they agreed to meet at ſuch &amp; ſuch cities, elſe
the bargain of excluſive Provinces had been ſpoil'd; yet
t'is no where read, that ever they made any ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after this pretended diſtribution of Provinces.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, put caſe <hi>S. Peter</hi> had come to ſome City
two or three moneths. before <hi>S. Paul</hi> (and we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
their correſpondence ſo preciſe, nor their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
other where ſo indifferent, but this might very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
&amp; very often happen) then it muſt follow, that that
Apoſtle had univerſal Authority to preach to both till
<hi>S. Paul</hi> come, nor can we imagin him idle or negligent to
doe what good he could to all. Put caſe then that that
Prince of the Apoſtles, who by one Sermon converted
three thouſand, should by three months labour there
convert twice that number of Gentiles to Chriſt's faith;
to govern whom, the whole Authority over both being
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115675:119"/>
yet in his own hands, it is fitting he should uſe the ſaid
Authority in ordaining &amp; conſtituting Deacons, Prieſts
&amp; for the orderly governing his numerous Converts; and
thoſe too, diſtinct in all points from the Prieſts of the
Gentiles; for Dr. H. grounds interdict them <hi>all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
(See <hi>Sch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diſ. p.</hi> 64.) Things thus orderd, and the
Gentiles ſetled thus under <hi>S. Peter, S. Paul</hi> arrives at the
City. Then begins the hurliburly. <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Authority,
which before extended to both Nations, begins ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to feel the cramp &amp; conuulſion-fits, &amp; shrinks up to
the Iews onely; &amp;, in all probability, a very few, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
twenty or thirty more or leſſe may be imagined
to live in that City <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Iuriſdiction being thus grown
excluſive in reſpect of the Gentiles, by <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s coming,
conſequently all the Gentiles formerly converted by him
(however addicted to their Apoſtle, Paſtour &amp; more
then father <hi>S. Peter</hi>) muſt preſently change their Maſter,
&amp; doe Homage to <hi>S. Paul,</hi> acknowledging him their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
&amp; now-ſole-Governour. The Gentil Prieſts, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before his coming, either may be degraded lawfully
by <hi>S. Paul,</hi> or elſe ſubmit themſelves to him, &amp; receive
the approbation of their Iuriſdiction from him, as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Government requires. Moreover, if <hi>S.</hi> Paul had
hap to be alone in the ſame City before, and to have
converted Iews, as his cuſtome was, then the poore Iews
muſt avoyd <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s Congregation &amp; run to <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s
Church aſſoon as hee arrives.</p>
               <p>But, to proceed with our caſe, <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s occaſions call
him away from that City, and ere he removes Dr. H. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
that he muſt leave behind him a Bishop of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation,
that is, over the Gentiles; then preſently we
muſt imagin, that <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Iuriſdiction, which had felt
a kind of Winter-Seaſon during <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s reſidence the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
hee departing, begins to feel a happy Spring, budding
now &amp; Sprouting out a fresh towards the Gentiles. So
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115675:119"/>
that now the Scene of Iuriſdiction &amp; Government is qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
changed again, according to Dr. H's grounds; and,
were not <hi>S. Peter</hi> a good man, he might undo all that <hi>S.
Paul</hi> had done, &amp; be revenged on him for coming to the
ſame City where he was to limit his Authority. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
therefore which were converted before by <hi>S. Peter,</hi>
aſſoon as <hi>S. Paul</hi> is out of ſight, begin to face about again,
&amp; <hi>S.</hi> Peter recovers his own. To work therefore hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes,
and fals to preach <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s faith to the Gentiles the
ſecond time, which before he durſt not; Converts many,
&amp; having by this time got power enough to do it, being
about to depart leaves a Bishop of his own conſtituting
to govern them; So that we have now got two Gentil
Bishops in the ſame City; and, if Dr. H. ſay there was not,
he muſt ſay we are beholding to the Apoſtles prudence
&amp; goodnes for it, not to his grounds of illimited Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
when they met not, &amp; limited, when they met in
the ſame City, which infers they had Authority to do this
&amp; many other abſurdities, and by conſequence his poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in it ſelf deſtroyes all order both of Authority &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>Again, when they met at the ſame City, in caſe a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
had come to <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; deſired to hear <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<hi>S. Peter</hi> muſt refuſe to teach him it, &amp; ſend him
to <hi>S. Paul;</hi> telling him it was beyond his power, becauſe
<hi>S. Paul</hi> &amp; he had excluſive Iuriſdictions when they met
at the ſame City; or elſe deſiring him to ſtay till <hi>S. Paul</hi>
was gone away, or elſe to watch ſome handſome oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
when <hi>S Paul</hi> should go to the next Town, &amp; then
he would doe him the favour. And the like muſt wee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
in caſe a Iew went to <hi>S. Paul</hi> Laſtly when thoſe two
Apoſtles preach't <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s faith publikely (as their cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
was) then, in caſe <hi>S. Peter</hi> had ſpy'd ſome Gentiles
or <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſome Iews coming to their Sermon, preſently
(as if ſome excommunicated perſon had come in preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce)
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115675:120"/>
all muſt be ſuppoſed to be hush't, &amp; the Sermon
quasht; elſe we muſt imagin that that Apoſtle civilly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
a <hi>parentheſis</hi> in his diſcourſe, deſiring them to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
&amp; retire to the others Congregation, confeſſing
candidly that now that his counter-Apoſtle meets him in
the ſame city, his Iuriſdiction is excluſive, &amp; that he has
no power at all to give them any notice of Chriſt &amp; his
Law, but muſt be forced to exclude them from his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
Canſt thou refrain ſmiling, Reader, at ſuch a
heap of comical abſurdities.</p>
               <p>But, to return to the place in his <hi>Reply,</hi> the ſource of
all theſe gallant conſequences, &amp; to bundle up together
the other abſurdities in it, which to treat diffuſedly were
a weariſome &amp; ingrateful task; what meanes, his ſaying
here it is not unlawful to preach to anothers Province, &amp;
yet ſaying (<hi>Repl. p. 56. l.</hi> 2.) he had no right to doe it what
means his putting here, the meeting in one City to give
an excluſive and peculiar Province to <hi>S. Paul,</hi> whereas he
had before (according as it ſerv'd his turn beſt) made it
come from three other ſeverall cauſes and ſome of them
contradictories; to wit, imediately from Chriſt's aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
not from Chriſt, but from agreement among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and laſtly, onely from the Iews rejecting &amp; refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
him, as hath been shown from his own words befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in his ſixth &amp; ninth ſelf contradictions? what means
his putting here <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s excluſivenes of Iuriſdiction to
ariſe from the ſame circumſtance of meeting <hi>S. Paul</hi> in
the ſame City, &amp; yet (<hi>of Schiſm,</hi> p. 84.) excluding <hi>S.
Peter</hi> from medling with <hi>Gentiles</hi> in Britany, into which
countrye he pretends not to shew <hi>S. Paul</hi> came, much
leſſe met him there in the ſame City? what means his ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Iuriſdiction not excluſive, that is illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
till he meets <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and yet (<hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 71. <hi>l.</hi> 21.
24.) ſtating the ſame Iuriſdiction excluſive to all but <hi>one
portion onely of the diſperſed Iews,</hi> without reference at
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115675:120"/>
all to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meeting or not meeting him, but to the
diviſion of places &amp; Provinces onely. Laſtly, what mean't
he to talk of evidencing his then tenet from Scripture, &amp;
yet the excluſivenes of Iuriſdiction onely when they met
in the ſame City, not ſo much as pretended to be shown
from Scripture.</p>
               <p>Theſe man feſt &amp; manifold ſelf-contradictions &amp; heaps

to examin the point it ſelf, and laſtly Anſwer his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
alledged to conclude theſe excluſive Provinces.
Concerning the point it ſelf four poſitions are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderd,
which may be imagind to concern it; firſt, that the
Apoſtles went not all one way to preach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but one or more
one way, others another. The ſecond, that all the Apoſtles
made a poſitive agreement to goe one or more to ſuch or
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115675:121"/>
a Province. The third is, that they ſo agreed to goe to
ſuch &amp; ſuch Provinces, at their preſent parting as they
agreed never to go to any other for the future. The fourth
is that their Iuriſdiction was included within ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and excluded from all other imagind Provinces.</p>
               <p>The firſt is evident &amp; confeſt, but nothing at all to our
queſtion which is concerning limitation or illimitation of
Iuriſdiction; And who ſees not how shallow this inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
is; the Apoſtles went ſome one way, ſome another to
preach, therefore <hi>S. Peter</hi> is not Prince of the Apoſtles,
or Head of God's Church; Or thus, the Apoſtles, who
confeſſedly had their Iuriſdictions Vniverſall from <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
thought it more diſcreet &amp; fitting to goe ſome one way,
ſome another, therefore their Iuriſdictions become limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
which is as much as to ſay, that when Chriſt gave
to each Vniverſall Iuriſdiction, &amp; ſent them to teach all
Nations, he mean't they should all goe one way, for
otherwiſe (according to this manner of arguing) had he
meant they should goe ſeverall wayes, it could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
with that preſent intention of his to give them at
that very time univerſal Iuriſdiction.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, to wit that they all made a part or poſitive
agreement to goe determinate ſeverall wayes, or to ſuch
particular places, is very obſcure, &amp; rather related as a
thing imagind or opinionated to have been, then aſſerted
and manifeſted by any authentick proof. Nor does it at
all touch our queſtion, which is about Iuriſdiction, vnles
it can be proved that they made a part of excluſive o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
Iuriſdiction; Of which nature not the leaſt word
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> proof has hitherto been produced, not will ever be
producible for the future.</p>
               <p>The third, to wit, that they made a poſitive pact for
each one or more to go to ſuch determinate places &amp; no
other, is yet obſcurer &amp; leſſe authentick then the former,
no exact Itinerary of their travells being extant, much
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115675:121"/>
leſſe of their <hi>non-plus vltra's</hi> by pact &amp; agreement, but
all the whole buſines is left to blind and inconſequent
conjectures, according as they were found or obſeru'd
to haue preach't in one Country, and not obſeru'd to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
done ſo in another, but whether perſecution, a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
war, or conveniency of circumſtances diſperſed them
thus, nothing is or can be concluded hence. Nor, were
it all granted, can any inference be grounded upon this,
prejudicing our tenet, or even touching our queſtion,
which is concerning Iuriſdiction; ſince prudent conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of circumſtances might be of force to determin the
Apoſtles to agree that ſuch &amp; ſuch should ſtay conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this Province, and nor preach actually in another,
without any neceſſity of their agreeing to limit their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Iuriſdiction given by Chriſt; and ſo it cannot bear
any shew of inference, that they agreed to limit the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>
it ſelf, (about which our controverſie is) becauſe
they agreed to limit the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of that power.</p>
               <p>The fourth poſition, which concerns the excluſivenes
of their Iuriſdiction from all ſave their own Provinces, &amp;
is the onely thing which can ſeem to advantage Mr. H. or
concern our queſtion, which is about the limitation of
Iuriſdiction, is abſolutely falſe &amp; vterly groundles, not
warranted by any one teſtimony; firſt invented by Mr.
H's fancie, pretended to be evidenced by teſtimonies in
his book <hi>of Schiſm,</hi> challenged by <hi>S.</hi> W. not to have a
word concerning it in any one teſtimony there alledged
to prove it; not ownd conſtantly by Dr. H. in his Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
but abſolutely prevaricated from &amp; deny'd, though
at the coſt of ſo many &amp; ſo groſſe ſelf-contradictions;
attended on by a troop of abſurdities as hath been shown;
And laſtly not coming home the queſtion neither, as shall
be ſeen hereafter; for what inference is this; Each Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
was imediate overſeer of his own particular Province,
therefore one of them was not over all the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:115675:122"/>
The place from Scripture inſiſted on to evidence this
(for Dr. H in his <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 38. is of late grown jealous that

with more conſonancy to all circumſtances, then
Dr. H's, <hi>Excluſive Iuriſdiction when they met,</hi> does, let
the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The words, in the place cited, are</hi> S. Paul'<hi>s &amp; theſe;</hi>
When they ſaw that the Gospel of the uncircumciſion was
committed unto me as the Goſpel of the Circumciſion was to
Peter (for he that wrought effectually with Peter to the
Apoſtleship of the Circumciſion, was mighty in me towards
the Gentiles) And when Iames Cephas &amp; Iohn who ſeemed
to be pillars, perceived the grace which was given unto mee,
they gave me &amp; Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that
we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
onely they would that we should remember the poor,
&amp;c. <hi>This is the place upon which Mr. H. builds his tenet
of excluſive Provinces; with what right let this plain &amp;
connaturall explication inform the Reader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Lord &amp; Saviour determined the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his elect both of Iews &amp; Gentiles, &amp; had already
ſent down his holy Spirit upon his Apoſtles in Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
wher upon their zeal inciting them, &amp; the place they
were in giving them occaſion, they added, by their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
multitudes of the Iews to the new-growing Church.
Stil the Gentiles, out of <hi>Iudea</hi> heard no more news, of
him than the ſtar led Sages and ſome ſtraggling prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
had told and were ignorant of his heavenly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
except what rumour might have variouſly and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely
ſpread. He choſe therefore S. <hi>Paul,</hi> both for zeal
(though hitherto miſled) naturall &amp; acquired abilities,
as alſo his being bred among the Heathens being born at
<hi>Tarſus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> fit &amp; proportioned for that end. To him
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115675:122"/>
he appeared near <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> enlighten'd the eyes of his
minde by ſtriking blinde thoſe of his body, made him
powerfully his, told him his errand, that he should car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
his name before the Gentiles: not that his comiſſion
should extend to them onely (ſince the Commiſſion given
by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to each Apoſtle is acknowledgedly univerſall)
but that he was by God's all-ordering providence fitted,
chroſen &amp; deſigned more particularly for that end. The
former circumſtances gave him his addiction, his addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſo qualified produced great fruit, &amp; all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
got him the appellation of Apoſtle of the Gentiles;
particularly ſuch indeed, but not excluſively; it being
otherwiſe evident all over the Acts that he preach't com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
&amp; earneſtly to the Iews. Where he was converted,
there he imediately began to preach, &amp; ſo proceeded in
that work, till ſome began to ſuſpect him &amp; his doctrine
as not coming from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe he had not lived &amp;
conver'ſt with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the other Apoſtles had. Vpon
this he is forc't to come to <hi>Iudea</hi> to confer his doctrine
with the other Apoſtles and receive their approbations;
which they found exact &amp; entire, expreſt by thoſe words,
<hi>nihil comulerunt, they in conference added nothing to me.
S. Paul</hi> having thus given account of his doctrine, &amp; the
efficacie of his preaching to the Gentiles, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
finding that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was in like manner eminently
&amp; particularly efficacious in converting the Iews in <hi>Iudea</hi>
(expreſt here in the 8. <hi>v.</hi>) two things enſved here upon,
to wit, that by giving <hi>S. Paul</hi> the right hand of fellows<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip
they acknowledged him a true Apoſtle, or a fellow
Apoſtle; &amp;, at once determined, that ſince he thriu'd
beſt among the Gentiles &amp; <hi>S. Peter</hi> beſt among the Iews
(the greateſt harveſt of which was found in <hi>Iudea) S.
Paul</hi> should goe <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut of Iudea</hi> to the Gentiles, &amp; take <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
with him; <hi>S. Peter</hi> with thereſt remain <hi>in Judea</hi>
ſtill to preach to the Iews; and this is all the buſines which
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115675:123"/>
Mr. H. would make to be an agreement to diſtribute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
Provinces.</p>
               <p>The meaning then of [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Circumciſion]
in the ninth verſe to which <hi>S. Peter</hi> was to apply himſelf,
I take to be <hi>Iudea</hi> or the Iews <hi>there,</hi> not thoſe <hi>in diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi>
and of [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] the Gentiles to be thoſe <hi>out of Iudea.</hi>
Now, if this be ſo then to omit all which hath been ſaid
formerly, Dr. H's aſſigning <hi>S. Peter (of Schiſm, p.</hi> 71.)
onely the Apoſtleship of ſome of the Iews in diſpertion,
by founding the excluſivenes of his Authoritie upon this
place, vanishes into it's original nothing; for, in caſe any
diſtribution of Provinces be ſignified here, <hi>S. Peters</hi>'s
muſt be the Iews at home, <hi>in Iudea,</hi> not thoſe <hi>abroad</hi>
or in diſpertion, if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> denote here onely <hi>Iudea,</hi>
or the Iewes <hi>in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the reaſons for this explication of mine, are, firſt
becauſe the efficacie of <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s preaching to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
had been experienced <hi>with in Iudea,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s over
the Gentiles, <hi>without Iudea;</hi> &amp; conſequently their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
themſelves, being upon this account, should mean
that one should ſtay where he had experienced ſuch fruit,
that is, <hi>in Iudea,</hi> the other goe where he had found the
like, that is, <hi>out of Iudea.</hi> Secondly, the words very well
bear it; ſince the Iews doe not live vnited in any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
confluence, ſave <hi>in Iudea,</hi> nor the Gentiles but
<hi>out</hi> of it, which is the thing that gives a common deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to a people. Thirdly, <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>onely
they would that we should remember the poore,</hi> imediately
following, shew plainly the meaning is that he was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned
by theſe words to go <hi>out of Iudea,</hi> &amp; therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to remember the poor which were <hi>in Iudea,</hi> as he
accordingly did, <hi>Rom. 15. v. 25. 26. But now I goe to Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
to miniſter to the Saints, for it hath pleaſed them of
Macedonia &amp; Achaia to make a certain contribution for
the poor Saints which are in Hieruſalem.</hi> Fourthly, the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115675:123"/>
                  <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of all the circumſtances favour it. Fifthly the
place of Theophylact cited by Dr. H. (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 40.)
is expreſſe for it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>S.
Paul, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng come to Iudea, he departed thence, both becauſe he
was ſent a Preacher to the Gentiles, and becauſe he would
not build on anothers foundation.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>S. Hierome</hi> upon
that place is moſt clearly for it; where he makes the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s words to be theſe, <hi>me miſit ad Gentes, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
poſuit in Iudea; he ſent me to the Gentiles, &amp; put or
placed him in Iudea.</hi> Yet Dr. H. from this place gives <hi>S.
Peter</hi> an Excluſive Province, to wit, the Gentiles; nor
any Gentiles, but thoſe <hi>of the disperſion,</hi> out of <hi>Iudea</hi>
onely.</p>
               <p>This remaining of <hi>S. Peter</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s remou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
out of it, ſeemed then beſt for the preſent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but was far from ſignifying excluſivenes from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Province for the future; it being well known that
<hi>S. Peter</hi> preacht <hi>out of Judea</hi> afterwards, to wit at <hi>Antioch,
Rome</hi> &amp; other places; The ſumme then of their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was this that they reſolved to do what was moſt
prudent in thoſe circumſtances, to wit, that ſome should
ſtay among the Iews, others goe abroad among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;
which by conſequence was onely to conſent to do
prudently, not to make a formal bargain or pact, much
leſſe perpetuity of ſuch a pact; leaſt of all does it, even
intimate the limitation of power &amp; Iuriſdiction, as the
queſtion it is produced for, requires it should.</p>
               <p>Again this agreement of theirs being nothing but a
conſenting to that which they judged by circumſtances
was fore-determined by Gods will, conſequently there
was no more Excluſivenes after then before their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor their ſubſequent agreement any <hi>farther deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation</hi>
(as D. H. calls it) in reſpect of <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul,</hi>
then the antecedent deſignation by God Almighty; The
plain text manifeſts this moſt clearly; [<hi>when they ſaw
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115675:124"/>
that the Goſpel of the circumciſion was committet to me, as
the Goſpel of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion to Peter</hi>] where we ſee
their judging it was already ſo committed is the reaſon
why they decreed it should ſo remain, and that they
should preach ſtill where God had shew'd it his will, by
giving ſuch a bleſſing; which ſuperadds nothing to the
former.</p>
               <p>Next follows the motive why they judged that there
was ſuch a particular Commiſſion, in theſe words; <hi>for
he that wrought effectually with Peter to the Apoſtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ship of
the Iews, was mighty in met towards the Gentiles;</hi> So that
the efficacity of preaching &amp; experience of more ample
fruit was their ſole motive of the one's thus remaining,
the others ſending abroad; &amp; not an intention to limit
one another's Iuriſdiction or aſſign excluſive Provinces.
After this follows the reſult of their former conſideration,
in theſe words, <hi>Then they gave to us the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
that we should go to the Vncircumciſion,</hi> &amp;c. Which
expreſſes no more than this, that one should go one way
another betake himſelf another, as Dr. H. grants elſe
where (<hi>Anſw. p.</hi> 38.) which how far it is from even tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
any Iuriſdiction, much leſſe from limiting it, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Child may diſcern.</p>
               <p>Again, to ſpeak properly, &amp; according to the force
of the Greek, their going into diverſe countries was no
part of the agreement, but a pure ſequel ariſing out of
convenience. For, <hi>dederunt dextras</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is,
<hi>they gave us the right hands of communion or communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
ſignifies no more then that, by embracing or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
hands, they acknowledged us to be of the true faith
&amp; of their communion, in reſpect of which every one ſees
that the going into diverſe places was a meer accident; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
we will ſay that <hi>S. Peter</hi> would not have acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his doctrine good, nor receive him into communion
but upon promiſe that he should goe <hi>out of Iudea.</hi> To
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115675:124"/>
omit, that both the ſcope of <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s journey, &amp; the
Scripture's expreſſing that this was the reſult of it, joyntly
with the conſent of interpreters doe force us to this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of that place. Again, it is impoſſible theſe words,
ſpeaking literally, &amp; properly, should ſignifie an agreeing
to go to ſeuerall Provinces, both becauſe the phraſe, [<hi>they
gave the right hands of communication</hi>] ſignifies an acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting
&amp; acknowledging <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi> in ſomething
<hi>common</hi> to them &amp; the reſt, as was the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith, and could not relate to going to divers Provinces,
which were pretended to be particular, as alſo becauſe
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is no where found to ſignifie in the
Greek ſimply <hi>they agreed;</hi> and laſtly, becauſe an half
point in the Greek copies at <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>communion or fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
disjoyns that precedent phraſe from the following
of going to ſuch &amp; ſuch places. The words then, <hi>that we
should go to the Heathen, they to the Circumciſion,</hi> are a
meer ſequel, if we follow the rigour of the letter; &amp; ſo
the whole place ſignifies thus much, that whereas <hi>S. Paul</hi>
was diſturbed in his preaching, &amp; was glad to clear his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
by coming to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> they gave him the right
hand of fellowship acknowledging him their fellow Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
&amp; his doctrine entirely ſincere; that ſo each might
fall to their work again in the ſame places, &amp; in the ſame
manner as formerly.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. H's <hi>Diſarmer,</hi> proceeding upon the grounds
of this plain explication, held there was no other, that is,
no new &amp; <hi>farther deſignation</hi> (as Mr. H. calls it (<hi>Anſw.
p.</hi> 41) ſave onely this of Gods ſpecial cooperation with
them in thoſe ſeveral places, though he was far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
that one Apoſtle went one way, others another
to preach, (as the Dr. knows well enough) and that their
determination was onely a prudential ſubſcribing to what
Gods particular Providence had hinted to them; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
no novelty at all of deſignation appears here in
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115675:125"/>
reſpect of <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul,</hi> which was our queſtion;
and yet Dr. H. (not vnderſtanding that the ſubſcribing
to a former deſignation, or proceeding to act according
to it, is in it ſelf no new, or <hi>farther-deſignation</hi> as he calls
it) nicknames this explication of mine <hi>one litle deceit of
S. W. which the Catholike Gent. had not attaind to.</hi> And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tis ſo <hi>litle,</hi> that without the magnifying glaſſe of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
&amp; prejudice, which enhances nothing to great
ſomthings, &amp; makes vaſt beames of matters ſlenderer
then moats, it cannot at all be diſcernible. It shall bee
D. H's honour to be the Author of <hi>great deciets,</hi> &amp; ſelf-contradictions
which neither unskilful <hi>S.</hi> W. nor the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Gent. dare aſpire to.</p>
               <p>Again, were it <hi>a deciet</hi> to ſay, that there were no other
aſſignation there expreſt, yet D. H. is the moſt unfit man
in the world to undecieve others in that point, who in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place holds the ſame point himſelf, to wit, that the
Apoſtles agreement and the precedent deſignation ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the ſame thing. His words are theſe (<hi>Repl. p. 55. l.</hi>
12.) <hi>The right hands of fellowsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>p, the agreement that was
made betwixt them, &amp;c. is ſure the interpretation of the</hi>

which if it be ſo, to wit, that their <hi>entruſting</hi> expreſt

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115675:125"/>
in his <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 39. 40. And though, when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is to manage the buſines, we are to expect nothing but
contradictions from this Dr. as himſelf has amply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
us; yet, being now got into his own element of
comon-place-book teſtimony-parcels, we muſt imagin
his art is at it's vertical heighth.</p>
               <p>The firſt is from <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> on Gal. 2. 8. which I shall
tranſcribe as I finde it cited by him; <hi>Pétrum ſolum nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat
ac ſibi comparat, quia Primatum ipſe acceperat ad fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandam
Eccleſiam, ſe quoque pari modo electum ut Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
habeat in fundandis Gentium Eccleſiis. He names Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
alone &amp; compares him to himſelf, becauſe he had received
the Primacie to found the Church, and he likewiſe is choſen
to have the Primacie of founding the Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi>
where, firſt, if <hi>Primatus</hi> ſignifies <hi>Primacy of Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
(and unles it ſignifies ſo 'tis nothing to our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
which is about <hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> onely) then it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to imagin a teſtimony more expreſly for our tenet
of <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s univerſal Iuriſdiction and greater then <hi>S.
Paul</hi>'s, than this which he alledges againſt it; ſaying that
<hi>S. Peter had the Primacy to found the Church,</hi> without
any limitation at all mentioned confining him to this or
that Church; So that, if there be any excluſivenes or
shadow of excluſivenes found in that place as I ſee none)
then it ought in all reaſon be the excluſivenes of <hi>S. Paul</hi>
from the Iews, ſince he is particulariz'd by it to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;
and not of <hi>S. Peter</hi> from any, who is not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariz'd
here at all to any part or portion of the <hi>Church,</hi>
but extended to all, unles D. H. will ſay, that the word
[<hi>Eccleſia, Church</hi>] ſignifies a peece of the Church one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
This teſtimony therefore might ſerue to ſome purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,
were it brought to prove that <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Iuriſdiction
was Vniverſal, &amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s limited, but to prove <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s
limited from words that extend it to <hi>the Church,</hi> without
any note of limitation at all found there, is ſtill Dr. H's
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115675:126"/>
old &amp; bold trick, of gulling the Reader to his face, with
out either shame or conſcience. Secondly, the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
between thoſe two Apoſtles and the (<hi>pari modo
electus</hi>) if we will ſtand to the words in the teſtimony,
make this ſence as apply'd to particulars; that, as <hi>S. Paul</hi>
was particularly choſen to found the <hi>Gentiles Church,</hi> ſo
<hi>S. Peter</hi> was in like manner particularly choſen to found
the whole Church, which ſignifies that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Paſtor, and <hi>S. Paul</hi> vnder him: which is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done of Mr. H. and deſerves great thanks from us.
Though I wonder the ſincere Reader can without juſt
reſentment ſuffer himſelf to be ſo tamely deluded, as D.
H. endeavors here, by making him beleeve that teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Primacy to build the Church,</hi> ſignifies
that he was onely over the Iews; and that not all theſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but <hi>onely over one portion of them in diſperſion;</hi> nor yet
that theſe were his excluſive or peculiar Province, unleſs
<hi>S. Paul</hi> chanced to meet him in the ſame City. Thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
careleſs is he whether the place hee alledges be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
for him or againſt him (as hath been shown all
over in <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd</hi>) ſo he can dazle a vulgar headed
reader's eyes with the glorious pretence of a father's or
councill's teſtimony and make way to introduce it by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
voluntary and boldly-promiſing preamble of his
own as he does at preſent; aſſuring us here (<hi>Anſw. p. 39.
l.</hi> 35.) that theſe words of <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> are plain; but, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
plain for him, or plainly againſt him it matters not
with him; and that <hi>in them S. Ambr. aſſerts all that was
either his purpoſe or intereſt to affirm:</hi> as if it were either Dr.
H's intent or his advantage to conclude <hi>S. Peter</hi> over the
Church without any limitation put down, that is, over
the whole Church, and <hi>S. Paul</hi> over the Gentiles onely,
and ſo vnder him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond teſtimony is from <hi>S. Chryſoſtom,</hi> ſaying
that <hi>S. Paul demonſtrates himſelf to be</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>and compares himſelf with
Peter the chief of them.</hi> Thus hee. In Anſwer. Firſt the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> coming from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which ſignifies any kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall
honor, whether it ſprings from better parts,
greater efficacy, more induſtry in preaching, or from
what ſo ever cauſe and not onely from dignity of Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
it follows likewiſe that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> taken in it's
ſelf as indifferently appliable by circumſtances to ſignify
an equality in any of the former reſpects, as it is to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
an equality in the latter of Iuriſdiction; and the like
may be ſaid of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſince of it ſelf it onely
ſignifies that <hi>S. Paul compared</hi> himſelf to <hi>S. Peter;</hi> but, in
which of the former regards this compariſon was made,
the generall ſignification of the word leaves indifferent
and to be deermined by circumſtances. Secondly the
beſt circumſtance to judge what this word should ſignify
in that place is the <hi>ſubjecta materia</hi> or place it ſelf, of
which this is the explication; which being <hi>Gal.</hi> 2 8. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
there is nothing at all relating to Iuriſdiction but to effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiouſneſs
in preaching to Iews and Gentiles, of this the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
the compariſon between theſe two Apoſtles muſt
be underſtood; in this reſpect onely muſt they neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
be ſignified by theſe words to have been <hi>equally-digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
and not in <hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> or governing power which is
not there ſpoken of. Thirdly, that this is the meaning of
it is clearly shown by the following Teſtimony (which
is his third) out of <hi>Theophylact,</hi> who for the moſt part
tranſcribes out of and follows <hi>S. Chryſoſtom;</hi> 'Tis this,

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
So that the teſtimony taken entirely is this, <hi>he shows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115675:127"/>
equally honored with Peter, for he who had given to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  </gap> there ſpoken of was the
ſelf ſame as was expreſt by the (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>the ſelf-ſame
efficacy of preaching,</hi> which nothing concerns equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or ſuperiority of power or command in order to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as plain ſence tells every man, and Dr. H.
himſelf grants Anſw. p. 51. l. 26.</p>
               <p>The fourth teſtimony or rather the ſecond part of the
firſt is ſtill from <hi>S. Amb.</hi> which,) as the Caſpian ſea
runnes under ground a long way and then riſes up again in
the Euxine) ſculks under a <hi>parentheſis</hi> in which the two
late Teſtimonies are found, and shows it's Head again
at the end of it in this form. <hi>Ita tamen vt &amp; Petrus praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caret
Gentibus ſi cauſa fuiſſet &amp; Paulus Iudaeis nam vterque
invenitur vtrumque feciſſe; ſed tamen plena authoritas Petro
in Iudaiſmi praedicatione data agnoſcitur &amp; Pauli perfecta
authoritas in praedicatione gentium invenitur, yet ſo that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
might preach to the Gentiles alſo if there were cauſe, and
Paul to the Iews; for both of them is found to have done both:
but yet the full Authority is acknowledged given to Peter in
the preaching to the Iews and Paul</hi>'s <hi>perfect Authority is
found in preaching to the Gentiles.</hi> Where, the firſt part
of the teſtimony is expreſſely contrary to Dr. H. this gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that each might preach to either, he denying they had
<hi>right</hi> to doe ſo, <hi>Repl. p.</hi> 56. and that <hi>S. Peter had no Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
ſave over one portion onely of the diſperſed Iews
(of Schiſm p.</hi> 71.) The ſecond part of it which concerns
<hi>plena authoritas, full Authority</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> is onely meant
of greater powerfulneſs and authoritative efficacity in
preaching, not of <hi>fuller power of Iuriſdiction.</hi> No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> can it
be otherwiſe, either proceeding upon grounds common
to us both, theſe words being the explication or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the greater efficacity of preaching ſpoken of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115675:127"/>
in the 8. <hi>v.</hi> and ſo are to be underſtood to mean that ſaid
efficacy, which none imagins to ſignify Iuriſdiction; and
particularly upon Dr. H's grounds which makes no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
of Provinces till the agreement expreſt as he
will needs have it in the 9. v. by their <hi>giving the right hands
of fellowship;</hi> to which this ſpeciall efficacity of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
mention'd in the, 8. v. and it's expoſition are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent.
Again ſuppoſe it ſignified full power of <hi>Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
yet there wants (<hi>when they met in the ſame City one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>)
to make it expreſſe for Mr. H's tenet; So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can it concern our queſtion of Iuriſdiction; nor, did
it, could it reach home to Dr. H's purpoſe. Laſtly, to
render this place impoſſible to ſerve Dr. H's turn, let us
look Anſw. p. 51. l. 26. and we shall find him expreſſely
contend that <hi>preaching</hi> or <hi>converting is nothing to the matter
of Iuriſdiction and therefore not argumentatiue for us to</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>S. Peter</hi>'s larger Iuriſdiction from his preaching to
more: Now then, ſince the Authority here ſpoken of is
onely <hi>in praedicatione, in preaching</hi> (as the teſtimony it
ſelf inform us) conſequently it can neither concern our
queſtion which is about Iuriſdiction, nor make for his
purpoſe, and all this follows out of his own words and his
own grounds.</p>
               <p>The fifth Teſtimony is from S. <hi>Hierom</hi> (as hee tells
us) that <hi>the Churches of the Iews ſeorſim habebantur nec
his quae erant ex gentibus miſcebantur, were held a part nor
mingled with theſe of the Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>that the agreement
was made that S. Paul should preach to the Gentiles, Peter
Iames and Iohn to the Iews.</hi> The latter part of this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is already anſwered and shown that this was a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
conſent to act in ſuch ſort as God's ſpeciall concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
had manifeſted to be beſt in thoſe circumſtances.
To <hi>act,</hi> I ſay, not to make a formall and perpetuall pact
the one Province should be (as Dr. H. expreſſes it
(<hi>Repl. p. 56. l. 2. 5.) ſo one Apoſtles that he hath no right to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115675:128"/>
another</hi> part but <hi>is excluded from any farther right;</hi> which
includes two things beſides ſome to go one way and ſome
another; to wit perpetu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty of ſuch a right, and excluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
neither of which are any where expreſt in this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt part of this place concerning the <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
of the Iewish and Gentile Churches. Firſt I Anſwer,
that I doubt not but the Apoſtles did prudently let them
vſe their devotions a part as long as the Iewish cuſtomes
were in fresh obſervation, and therefore the conjuction
of them in common Acts of devotion would have been
ſubject to breed offence and ſcandalls; but, I deny ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
that which can ſerve Dr. H's turn, to wit, that
they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſed their endeavours to keep them ſtill a part for
the future, which they had done had they conſtituted
diſtinct Bishops over them to govern them as contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Provinces; for, this would have made the breach
which was onely occaſionall at firſt and ſo eaſily by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
alterable, paſſe into eccleſiaſticall Conſtitution, not
eaſily violable, by this means keeping on foot the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
and alſo this carriage of the Apoſtles would have
countenanced the breach and the groundleſs ſcandall
which occaſion'd the breach.</p>
               <p>All therefore the Apoſtles did was no more then as if
Magiſtrates who govern in common a City, if the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
chance to fall at variance, ſome prudently comply
with one ſide, others with the other to reduce both to
unity ad amity which is far from making two litle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>wealths
of them or aſſigning them diſtinct Magiſtrates
to govern them: which had they done who ſees not but
by taking a way the Vnity of Government they had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht
the diviſion. Such was evidently the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
here, ſuch their intentions; to wit, as much
as they could without ſcandalizing either party, to bring
them to Vnity and Vniformity into one Church and to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115675:128"/>
Vnite them in him whom they taught to be the head cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone,
<hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> in whom was no diſtinction of Iew
and Gentile: And ſurely had the diſtraction in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church been thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued by Apoſtolicall agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to ſever them as diſtinct Provinces and conſtitute over
them oppoſite-litled Bishops we should both have heard
news of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome of thoſe Bishops expreſt by ſome teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from antiquity to have been over Iews onely or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
onely; and alſo have heard of their reuniting after
wards under one common Bishop, and how the former
Bishops, either one or both, were diſpoſſeſt or loſt their
place. Yet not a ſyllable could <hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> find to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the former ſave his own, <hi>Id eſt,</hi> nor to countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
the latter but his own new invented <hi>Scholion,</hi> or (as he
calls it <hi>of Schiſm</hi> p 79. his <hi>clew,) to extricate the Reader out
of the mazes into which antient writers may lead him;</hi> as hath
been shown particularly in <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd.</hi> Part. 1. Sect.
10. 11. 12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to return to our Teſtimony Dr. H. prettily
ioyns theſe two places together thus, <hi>S. Hierom having
affirmed on Gal. 1. 22. that the Iewish and Gentile Churches
were ſeverd, addes</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>on this verſe of c. 2. that they
agreed that S. Paul should preach to the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. and
thence having found the word <hi>ſevering</hi> in the firſt place,
he infers a <hi>ſevering</hi> of Provinces, and introduces it with
a <hi>ſure.</hi> What means (<hi>having affirmed in his comment on the
firſt Ch. he addes in his comment on the ſecond,</hi>) as if the
ſecond place following ſoe far of and ſpoken in a nother
occaſion had been an <hi>addition</hi> to the firſt; all his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
book is <hi>added</hi> to any line of it if this be <hi>adding.</hi> But
this is another Gentile gullery of the Reader to his face
to make him conceit by (<hi>having affirmed he addes</hi>) that
the <hi>ſevering of Churches</hi> expreſt in the firſt place relates to
their <hi>agreement</hi> found in the latter, which would have
made ſome shew of a proof. But, alas, how far are theſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115675:129"/>
two from being <hi>added</hi> together or conjoyned? This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>agreement</hi> among the Apoſtles to which the ſecond
part of the Teſtimony relates, hapning fourteen yeares
after what was recounted in the firſt Chapter v. 22 on
which the firſt part of the teſtimony comments, as is
clearly ſeen in the firſt verſe of the 2. Chapter. <hi>After four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years,</hi> &amp;c. Soe that the meaning of Dr. H's (<hi>having
affirmed he addes</hi>) comes to this, that, having affirmed
one thing in one place he addes another thing in another,
which happend fourteen years after, and indeed much
longer the ſcandall between the Iews and the Gentiles ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been much ancienter, and ever ſince the beginning
of the preaching of the ſaith to both. Thus Dr. H. civily
abuſes his Reader; and, as long as he does it civily, <hi>S.</hi>
W. muſt not be angry with him or if he does he <hi>muſt not
hope to goe to heaven</hi> as Dr. H. hath told him from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
p. 3.</p>
               <p>What is ſaid hitherto is pretty but yet Dr. H. vſes to
be kinder when he alledges teſtimonies and either brings
ſuch as are expreſſely againſt him, as he did lately from
<hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> and in many other places; or elſe contradicts
himſelf; let us examin this a while and we shall ſee, hee
continues his former favours to us. I ſlall ſuppoſe with
Dr. H. that he produced the former teſtimony of <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
the ſaid Churches to prove thoſe ſeverall Provinces
both becauſe I find the word (<hi>ſever</hi>) which he vſes in his
inference no where but in that place onely; as alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
if it were not produced for that end, I know not
what it ſerves for at all. Again, I shall ſuppoſe with him
that theſe imagin'd <hi>leſſer Provinces</hi> of Iews and Gentiles
were aſſign'd by Apoſtolicall <hi>agreement,</hi> not by <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
as he amply declares himſelf <hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 70. And that
this agreement was that which is expreſt Gal. 2. v. 8. 9. &amp;c.
as he expreſſes himſelf in many other places of the two
Provinces of Iews and Gentiles. Now then this place of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115675:129"/>
                  <hi>S. Hierom's</hi> being (as he ſayes) upon Gal. 1. 22. which
concerns matters done fourteen years before this <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
(as the beginning of the ſecond Chap. manifeſts)
the reſult is that theſe ſeverall leſſer Provinces, as dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
from this teſtimony, were fourteen years before they
were. But this is a contemptible contradiction in Mr. H.
who aimes at higher matters. So much for the upshot
of Dr. H. (<hi>having affirmed, he addes</hi>) which ſignifies thus
much that <hi>S. Hierom.</hi> having affirmed one thing in one
place, and on an occaſion happening at ſuch a ſeaſon, he
addes a quite diſparate thing in another place a mile of,
and an occaſion relating to another time fourteen years
after, which Dr. H. prepoſterouſly adds or ioyns toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and then layes the blame on <hi>S. Hierom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much to shew how impertinent this teſtimony
had been, in caſe it were <hi>S. Hierom's;</hi> but now, if it be
none of that fathers but another author's, and he two an
heretick, nay in all probability the Arch heretick <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us,</hi>
and this confeſt by all ſides both Catholicks and
Proteſtants, and moreover moſt unlikely to be unknown
to Dr. H. what characters shall wee think ſuch a writer
deſerves who characters himſelf ſo earneſtly to <hi>deſire to
ſpeak the full truth of God (Anſw.</hi> p. 18.) and yet quotes
the moſt peſtilent <hi>hereticks</hi> for the moſt <hi>Orthodox</hi> fathers,
and would have his Readers rely for their ſalvation upon
their rotten Authority; which is in a manner to ſtand to
the devill's courteſy whether he will have their Souls

               <p>It is an ordinary thing to print in the volumes of the
fathers all Treatiſes which have hapt to be entitled theirs,
let them be genuine or ſpurious. To diſcern them or take
cognizance which are ſophiſticated, which not, belongs
particularly to learned men who read the fathers for
their own or others profit, leſt they rely on themſelves or
vent to others the poiſon of hereſy and error-tainted opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115675:130"/>
in ſtead of Orthodox faith; nay indeed this, for the
reaſon given, ought to be their firſt task; but moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
and ſpecially theirs who undertake to write and

of the employme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t engaging them to look with
the perfecteſt care how they play their game when Souls
ly at ſtake. If the thing then be obvious, the diligence
of ſuch an author is hugely concerned to look upon what
grounds he proceeds; but, if he bee alſo much read in
books of this nature, his candor and conſcience are bound
by the higheſt engagements God himſelf could impoſe

That Dr. H. had ſo litle inſight into fathers as not to know

                  </gap> he is
induſtrious and laborious enough, and takes as much
pains in reading to as litle purpoſe as moſt men living; and
I wish his indirect dealings in other places would let my
charity conſiſt with truth to think him innocent of the
latter and greater fault. However, I will not judge him
my ſelf, but I ſuppoſe his friends, who have a great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his generall reading, will think it not candidly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
after they conſider this which follows.</p>
               <p>Two commentaries on the Galatians are intitled <hi>S.
Hierom</hi>'s the one larger and acknowledged by both ſides,
the other briefer and acknowledged by neither; nor is it
poſſible that any man, who had run over the titles of
the Treatiſes which goe under <hi>S. Hierom</hi>'s name, should
be ignorant that <hi>two</hi> ſuch commentaries there were; and
ſo, had he meant honeſtly in citing a place out of one of
them, he would have told us in which it was found, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the larger or in the briefer. To put down then a
Teſtimony and cite onely <hi>Hier. in Gal.</hi> 1. 21. without tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us in which commentaries on the <hi>Gal.</hi> it was found
(when as Dr. H's much reading will not permit us to think
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115675:130"/>
he was ignorant there was <hi>two</hi>) joind with this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the teſtimony was not found in the larger one,
but in the leſſer; not in the genuine, but in thoſe which
are acknowledg'ly ſpurious, conſequently this ſleight
half citing it ſavours very ſtrong of a wilfully-affected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity.</p>
               <p>Now the exceptions of our Dr. againſt theſe briefer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
as alſo all thoſe shorter ones upon <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s
Epiſtles, are theſe, that it is manifeſtly shown from <hi>S Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>
that they were writ by the Arch heretick Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.
For that father in his third book <hi>de peccatorum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis
&amp; remiſſione c.</hi> 1. ſayes that he had read the short
commentaries of <hi>Pelagius</hi> upon all the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul;</hi>

was derived from Adam. After this he quotes <hi>Victorius</hi>

thou relieſt on, who though when they ſpeak freely and

it to maintain their paradoxicall faith, make <hi>S. Hierom</hi>
an Arch-heretick, or elſe the Arch-heretik <hi>Pelagius</hi> his

books his, ſo they can but glean any ſorry ſcrap of a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
thence to lend a dim colour to their cauſe, and
to countenance it by a ſophiſticate and counterfeit Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
nay, onely half-cite the place, to cloak the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity
of which their own hearts are conſcious; and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly,
which is moſt worth noting this very teſtimony ſo
miſerably authoriſed is ſoe mainely rely'd on, that he can
never make the ends of his diſcourſe meet without the
help of this, every foot, nor even pretend to show one
word in any teſtimony for his <hi>tenet</hi> but by making this
one of the three teſtimonies which muſt peece up that
one word, as shall be ſeen hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thus much to shew how weak this Teſtimony is in it
ſelf had it been true, and how the Dr. falſifies it's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to gain it an undue credit; but this is not all, the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying
the Authority of this Teſtimony could not ſerve
his turn, but he muſt falſify the words two, pretending
that <hi>S. Hierom</hi> added upon, <hi>Gal. c. 2. v</hi> 8. that <hi>the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was made that S. Paul should preach to the Gentiles
and Peter Iames and Iohn to the Iews</hi> whereas there is noe
newes of any <hi>agreement</hi> expreſt in that place; for upon the
words [<hi>dextras dederunt, they gave us their right hands</hi>]
in which phraſe Dr. H. places the <hi>agreement</hi> there is noe
comment at all found ſave onely this, <hi>ita nos docere debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> should teach thus and thus;
and upon the following words, relating to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
nothing but onely this, <hi>ambo enim miſſi erant ſimul vt

might preach to the Gentiles.</hi> But whether this <hi>ſending</hi> ſprung

from an <hi>agreement</hi> among the Apoſtles or from the ſole

cooperation with them, as alſo by thoſe words, <hi>ſeparate

hee <hi>could</hi> not build on another's foundation, or, as Dr. H.
expreſſes it Reply p. 56. <hi>had not right to doe it?</hi> if not, what
are theſe words to us, who do not deſire that <hi>S. Paul</hi>
should do imprudently, as it had been if leaving the

of ſo much fruit, he should apply himſelf to preach
in <hi>Iudea,</hi> where <hi>S. Peter</hi> had experienc't the like fruit;
which was, in other language, to leave a place where his
preaching was moſt needfull and moſt particularly fruit
full, and ſtay in another where his preaching was needles
and not ſo particularly fruitfull. Is this any thing at all to
our queſtion of limited or unlimited <hi>Iuriſdiction.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the words, <hi>becauſe he was ſent a preacher to the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>

for leſſer Provinces, is perfectly frivolous and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory.
Thirdly, this teſtimony is upon, Gal. 1. 21.
and ſpeakes of his coming to <hi>Judea</hi> to ſee <hi>Peter,</hi> which
was more then fourteen years before his next coming
thither, Gal. 2. when this diſtribution of thoſe leſſer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
by agreement are pretended to bee made. This is
ſeen moſt evidently from the direct tenour of thoſe places
counting exactly the years; I <hi>went to Hieruſalem to ſee Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
Gal. 1. 18. <hi>After,</hi> I <hi>went into the regions of Syria and
Cilicia. Gal.</hi> 1. 21. After which imediately follows, <hi>Then
after fourteen years I went up again to Hieruſalem with
Barnabas,</hi> &amp;c. at which time the pretended agreement
was made and the right hands of fellowship given, (as is
to be ſeene in the following verſes) upon which he builds
the aſſignation of thoſe fancied Provinces, (<hi>of Schiſm,</hi>
p. 73. Anſw p. 41. l. 5. Repl. p. 56. l 14. and p. 57. l. 4.
&amp;c. and in many other places ſoe that we ſee this ſecond
going up to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> when the Provinces are imagin'd
to be given, was fourteen years after his being in <hi>Iudea</hi>
mention'd in the Teſtimony, beſides the time <hi>S. Paul</hi> was
in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia.</hi> This diſtance of time is unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
the outward show of the letter; but, howſoever it
may be interpreted, this is moſt certain and without all
controverſy that it was afterwards. Theſe things being ſo,
what a shame then is it to bring a teſtimony, relating to
things done long before, to prove his conceit of leſſer
Provinces held by himſelf to have been aſſigned long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But is this all the shame? let us ſee. The teſtimony is
put down by him in indifferent termes, <hi>being come to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea
he departed thence,</hi> &amp;c. without any diſtinction when
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115675:132"/>
this coming was whether before, at, or after the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
agreement; whereas had it been known that it was at
his coming <hi>onely to ſee Peter,</hi> which hapened before that
agreement, whence he deduces theſe leſſer Provinces of
<hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> it had been manifeſtly diſcouer'd
to be perfectly uſeles to prove that there were ſuch leſſer
Provinces at all. Theſe words therefore hewarily leaves out
leaſt they should quite diſgrace the reſt. The teſtimony
entirely recited is this, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
&amp;c. <hi>coming to Iudea onely to ſee Peter;</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
words being ſo few, ſo link't in context with the other
words, and ſoe totally diſadvantaging his pretence of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
Provinces deducible hence (they being future, even
in his own grounds, in reſpect of this time he came to
ſee <hi>Peter</hi>) I shall take leave to think there was deſign and
Artifice in omitting them and producing the teſtimonie
ſoe advantageouſly imperfect, though I hazard another
excommunication in Greek from the crafty alledger and
abuſer of it.</p>
               <p>From his <hi>Anſwer</hi> let us go to his <hi>Reply,</hi> p. 55. where we
shall find him from falſifying in ieſt, fall to do it in earneſt;
and that, ſoe openly and manifeſtly as is impoſſible either
to be cloak't, with evading gloſſes or excuſed by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or miſtake. I commend therefore the examination
of it to Dr. H's friends more particularly; even ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my ſelf to their cenſure if he be found excuſable. To
put all clearer I will fully tranſcribe from the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
               <p>His ſeventh teſtimony; where after he had told us that

the right hands of fellowship which he calls their

were ſo far from oppoſing any thing that he had done, from
adviſing any thing more, from telling him any circumſtance
more then before he knew, that they not onely approved but
commended what he had done, and, to ſet things the more

finding his doctrine entire and perfect, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by ſeeing the grace that was given him, gave to him
the right hands of fellowship; acknowledging, by this
acceptation of him for their fellow Apoſtle, that his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was ſound Now <hi>S. Chryſoſtom</hi>'s comment upon that
place which is the teſtimony related to by Dr. H. is this.
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>what means, [but contrariwiſe] ſome affirm S. Paul
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115675:133"/>
ſayes that they not onely not taught him, but were taughtly
him; but I should not ſay ſo, ſave onely that they blamed him
not, but were ſo far from blaming him, that they alſo prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him; for praiſing is contrary to blaming;</hi> and ſo proceeds
in expreſſing their commendation and approbation of his
doctrine throughout this whole place alledged. Here,
reader, thou ſeeſt what <hi>S. Chryſoſtom</hi> makes the <hi>ſpec all
importance of the</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Hence appears the firſt wilfull falſification of Dr. H.

                  </gap>, <hi>but contrariwiſe</hi>] as if the <hi>commending S.
Paul</hi>'s doctrine, in which onely <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> puts the
<hi>antitheſis</hi> and oppoſition to the <hi>blaming</hi> it, did not onely
<hi>import</hi> but <hi>ſpecially, import</hi> the <hi>intruſting him with a leſſer
Province</hi> whereas all the ſpeciall importance of it is onely
this that Dr. H. hath a ſpeciall faculty of his own in falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiing,
and making ſpeciall fools his credulous Readers to
think all his forgeries goſpell becauſe he gives them ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
fine words, and aſſures them he hath a ſpeciall <hi>deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
to ſpeake the full truth of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet a ſimple falſification is too weak to defend Dr. H's
cauſe wherefore, to make ſure work, he twiſts them into
a compound forgery. In his book <hi>of Schiſm</hi> he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor's
to prove that theſe Apoſtles had ſeverall Provinces
at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Antioch;</hi> his Diſarmer show'd to the eye
of the Reader that he had not one word expreſſing that
poſition in any teſtimony alledged but what he added
with an, <hi>Id eſt,</hi> of his own head: It is expected therefore
that he should at leaſt produce new ones which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

home and expreſſe that I confeſſe ſome difficulty to Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
it; I mean the latter part of the long teſtimony lately
recited as from <hi>S. Chryſostome; and to ſet the things the

with Paul and Barnabas, that, when ſoever they should
come to the ſame City mixt of Iews and Gentiles, Peter and
Iohn should betake them ſelfs to the Iewish and Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas
to the Gentile part of it.</hi> This is expreſſely now and
full for Dr. H's tenet, not a teſtimony-bolt shot at rovers,
or onely touching the queſtion obſcurely, as was his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
in other places. But, alas, how is the good teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
ſpoile'd and the alledger of it expoſed to shame; not
a word of all this long rabble ſoe neerly importing the
Queſtion is found in the Author, but onely voluntarily
added by the good Dr. and fatherd upon <hi>S. Chryſoſtom.</hi>
no news, God knows, is there in the place it ſelf either of
<hi>ſetting things unqueſtionably for the future,</hi> nor of <hi>making
an agreement,</hi> nor of, <hi>meeting in the ſame City,</hi> nor of
<hi>Iews and Gentiles mixt,</hi> nor of <hi>betaking themſelves to the

but onely of the ſufficiency of <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s doctrine,
their <hi>approving</hi> it, <hi>praiſing</hi> it, and the like. So that Dr.
H. for want of a better Author quotes himſelf for his
own <hi>tenet,</hi> coins a pregnant and convincing teſtimony
out of the mint of his own brain; and then, to make it
currant, ſtamps upon it the Image and ſuperſcription of
<hi>S. Chryſoſtom.</hi> And all this out of his <hi>entire deſire to ſpeak
the full truth of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This falſification being ſo notorious, it were not amiſſe
to make ſome brief animadverſions upon it, that Dr. H's
art in this and many other places may be better diſcoverd,
and the reader more perfectly undeceiu'd in the opinion

               <p>Note firſt then, ere he introduces the teſtimony he
ſpeaks of the direct point in controverſie to wit, of <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting

of Provinces by Apoſtolicall agreement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note ſecondly, that, this done, he brings in a quite

<hi>S. Paul</hi>'s doctrine.</p>

hath been shown, yet, thoſe pretty confident words of
<hi>ſpeciall importance,</hi> and the fathering it upon <hi>S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>
make it ſeem authentickly true and paſſe down gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
with a curſory Reader.</p>
               <p>Note fourthly, how he layes out at large in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
half of the long teſtimony <hi>S. Chryſoſtom</hi>'s words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſufficiency and <hi>laudableneſſe</hi> of <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
as if it were importantly concerning the having <hi>a
Province entruſted</hi> him, whereas it is quite concerning
another matter; which is his old trick of a buſing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his face, ſo often diſcover'd.</p>
               <p>Note fifthly, how having alledged a teſtimony about
<hi>S. Paul</hi>'s praiſe-worthines, which nothing at all concerns
our queſtion, and by this means got a cloak for any thing
he should think good to add of his own head he proceeds
with a career in <hi>S. Chryſoſtom</hi>'s name to their <hi>agreement</hi> of
diſtinct Provinces when they met at the ſame City; to
countenance which not a ſyllable is there found: yet he
goes ſmothly from one matter to the other without the
leaſt rub ſo much as of an hypocolon to ſtop him; by
this means compriſing all under the common head of
(<hi>ſaith hee.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Note ſixthly, that, as he usher'd in his former falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
with the confident phraſe of <hi>ſpeciall importance,</hi>
ſo here, that the Reader may not diſtruſt nor doubt but
that all is reall, he ushers in his latter with <hi>un queſtionably;</hi>
to <hi>ſet all</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>unqueſtionably for the future.</hi> What
Reader now could be ſoe diſcourteous as to ſuſpect Dr. H's
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115675:135"/>
integrity where as he aſſures him with ſuch doubt-ſetling
expreſſions as theſe are, and makes his bold-fac'd teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
wear nothing but <hi>ſpeciall</hi> and <hi>unqueſtionable</hi> in
their ſerious countenances?</p>
               <p>Laſtly it is to be noted that in his book of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> he
uſed to add theſe ſelf-invented teſtimony-parcells with an,
<hi>Id eſt;</hi> but ſince, <hi>Id eſt,</hi> which ſtickled ſoe much before,
was shamed out of countenance by <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd,</hi> now
he adds what words he pleaſes in a ſmooth even tenour
with the true part of the teſtimony, without any, <hi>Id eſt</hi>
at all; both becauſe the words of the father and the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Dr. were ſoe diſparate that noe, <hi>Id eſt,</hi> would
poſſibly conioyn their ſenſe, as alſo, becauſe ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
notes are diſcernible, and ſo might prove tell-tales
and diſcover his craft, which he hoped by running from
the father's words to his own with a ſly ſmothnes might
remain leſſe diſcoverable.</p>
               <p>And ſoe much for theſe ſeven teſtimonies, the flower
of Mr. H's ſecond thoughts in his <hi>Reply</hi> and <hi>Anſwer,</hi>
to ſupport his tenet of excluſive Provinces which <hi>Schiſm
Diſarm'd</hi> had ruin'd. All which have been shown ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to the point they are brought to prove that he
might with better reaſon have alledged the firſt verſe of
<hi>Geneſis, [In the beginning God created the heaven and the
earth</hi>] as a teſtimony for his excluſive Provinces; for,
though that place were impertinent to his purpoſe, yet it
is not oppoſite nor contradictory to it; whereas theſe ſaid
teſtimonies produced by him are at beſt impertinent to
what they are intended for, and moſt of them directly
contrary to his on-all-ſides-deſtitute <hi>tenet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had forgot one ſmall teſtimony of Dr. H's for theſe
excluſive Provinces, which hides it ſelf ſoe nicely in a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis</hi>

how can onely his preaching to the Iews of the diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
countenance that they were his Province, ſince 'tis
known and granted that he preached alſo to the Iews in
Iudea; ſo that if from ſuch a manner of expreſſion it may
be infer'd that the one is his Province, by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it may conclude for the other alſo. Thirdly, obſerve
how neatly he brings <hi>Euſebius</hi> to ſpeak on his ſide, <hi>I ſay
Peter was the Apoſtle of the Circumciſion excluſively to the
uncircumciſion, as Euſebius ſayes he preached to the Iews of
the diſperſion:</hi> which ſignifies thus much; Iuſt as I ſay <hi>S.
Peter</hi> was Apoſtle of the Iews of the diſperſion <hi>excluſively</hi>
(in which word lies the whole queſtion) ſoe <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſayes
that he preacht to them not naming any excluſion at all,
and by conſequence not ſaying a word to our purpoſe or
the queſtion in hand, it being granted that each Apoſtle
preached to any Sect or nation as their occaſions invited
them. Is not this a worthy ſimilitude? yet this, expreſt
drily as is Dr. H's wily way, and the teſtimony touched
at ſleightly gulls an ordinary Reader to his face and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
him that <hi>Euſebius</hi> does perfectly ſecond Dr. H's

that this preaching to <hi>Cornelius</hi> was before the deſignation
of Provinces, <hi>Repl.</hi> p. 57. and therefore the argument is
of no force. I reply, 'tis <hi>S. Hierom</hi>'s argument upon, Gal.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115675:136"/>
c. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 7. where he moves the preſent queſtion in theſe
words. <hi>Occulta hic oritur quaeſtio, Quid igitur? Petrus ſi
inveniſſet ex Gentibus non eos adducebat ad fidem,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>here ariſeth</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>an obſcure queſtion; what if Peter
found any Gentiles, did not he bring them to Chriſt's faith;
or, if Paul found any Iews, did not he move them to the
baptiſ. of Chriſt,</hi> Then he proceeds to ſolve it, by ſaying,
that <hi>one had principale mandatum, a principall charge over
Iews and the other over Gentiles, that either ſide, haberent
quem ſequerentur, might have one whom they might follow.</hi>
All which the prudence of Magiſtrates requires to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
without limiting Authority as hath been shown.
This done he ſignifies their promiſcuous intention to
preach to both and conſequently their Iuriſdiction (for
certainly they did not <hi>intend</hi> to doe what they had <hi>noe
right</hi> to doe) in theſe words, <hi>In commune verò hoc eos ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buiſſe

their intentions to gather a Church to Chriſt out of all nations;
for we read that both Cornelius, a Gentile, was baptized by
Peter, and alſo that Chriſt was very often preached by Paul
in the Synagogue of the Iews.</hi> Where,</p>

matter, it had been impoſſible not to expreſſe it here;

ſince the diſcourſe it ſelf neceſſarily directed him to it.
For how could he Anſwer a queſtion about their exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivenes,
without ſaying they had ſuch an excluſivenes
when they met, if it were true that they had none at all
but onely in the occaſion. But, alas <hi>S. Hierom</hi> and all
antiquity were ignorant that there would ariſe in future
ages ſuch a quickſighted wit as Dr. H. who could ſee

               <p>Obſerve fourthly, that his Anſwer inſiſts onely upon

               <p>Obſerve fifthly, that this <hi>principale mandatum</hi> in which
<hi>S. Hierom</hi> places this particular application of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
was from God; both, becauſe none on earth had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to lay commands upon thoſe tow Apoſtles; as alſo,
becauſe it is ſufficiently intimated in the foregoing words;

with <hi>S. Hierom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oſerve laſtly, that <hi>S. Hierom</hi> bringing this paſſage
granted by Dr. H. to have happend before his imagind
<hi>agreement,</hi> as an inſtance againſt their excluſivenes, and
that upon the 2. to the <hi>Gal.</hi> the agreement is ſuppoſed

(as far as I have read) ſince it propoſes and ſolves the

ſee how far Antiquity was from Dr. H's chimericall
tenet of excluſive Provinces, and how perfectly for ours
of the Apoſtles ſtill-Vniverſall Iuriſdictions; each expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

toy, though the paſſage or expreſſion be perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
abſolutely diſparate, nay ſome times quite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit

join'd with his smooth-ſly art can make a quodlibeticall

Readers. Each leaf of his hitherto hath given
us ſeverall inſtances of this true charge yet none more
evidently then this preſent paſſage now to be replied
upon.</p>
               <p>He told us confidently <hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 73. that <hi>he quite took
of all pretenſions of S. Peter to the ſingular ſupremacy there,</hi>
that is, at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> where <hi>S. Iames</hi> was Bishop: his
<hi>Diſarmer</hi> askt him and now asks him again what he mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s

dreſt up in ſuch an expreſſion as this of <hi>ſingular

if he had a mind to be rightly underſtood, without ſuch
an odd Epithet? or, if he would needs give it an Epithet
why should it not rather <hi>univerſall,</hi> then <hi>ſingular.</hi> Again,
what means his adding the words [<hi>there.</hi>] The <hi>ſupremacy</hi>
in debate betwixt us is neither ſubject to <hi>Heres</hi> nor <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
but univerſall and ſpreading it ſelf to all places in the

                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:115675:138"/>
shown there at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was of S. <hi>Iames</hi> being <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Bishop</hi> of that place; and then indeed by proving <hi>S.
Iames</hi> ſuch; he quite takes of <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s pretenſion to
ſuch a ſingular ſupremacy; but what is this to his being
chief of the Apoſtles? cannot one be ſo without being
particular Bishop of each ſee in the world? I excepted
therefore againſt that illphrad title of honor, [<hi>ſingular
ſupremacy</hi>] as an ambiguous word, and apt to make the
vulgar Reader imagin that <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s univerſal authority
is loſt if any one be found ſingularly ſupreme in his own
ſee; and I had good reaſon to be iealous of it, knowing it
to be one of Dr H's beſt arts to couch himſelf in odd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
expreſſions which help't by ſome circumſtances
(litle more then indifferent alſo) may make the Reader
apt to take them in a ſiniſter ſence, and yet leave an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hole for the Dr. to ſay afterwards when his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
should challenge him, that he meant otherwiſe</p>
               <p>Thus much for his uncouth expreſſion of [<hi>ſingular ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi>]
as it was found alone in his book <hi>of Schiſm</hi>
without a Comment; here in his <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 42. he explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
himſelf to mean, <hi>ſuch a ſupremacy as was not common
to the other tow eminent Apoſtles;</hi> which is as wiſe as the
text it ſelf, and intimates thus much, that they had each
<hi>ſupremacy there,</hi> but that <hi>S Peter</hi>'s ſupremacy was not
<hi>ſingular</hi> or above theirs; which would ground this pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
contradiction to the former that none at all were <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi>
but all <hi>equall</hi> Or if he meant not that each was <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme

add <hi>ſingular</hi> at all? let him but grant us onely a <hi>ſupremacy</hi>
in <hi>S. Peter</hi> in reſpect of the other Apoſtles, and we shall
not deſire him to add the frivolous word (<hi>ſingular</hi>) nor
needed he impugn ſoe powerfully that expreſſion which
we never challenged nor ſtood upon, nay not ſoe much
as heard of till he coin'd it.</p>
               <p>But I accept of his comment; let it mean ſuch a <hi>ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:115675:138"/>
(Authority, he would have ſaid) as was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

impugn it, or, as he pretends, <hi>quite take of S. Peter's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
to it. Becauſe</hi> (ſaith hee <hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 73.) <hi>S. Iames
his Iuriſdiction was not by Peter alone entruſted unto him,

ſtands thus; <hi>S. Peter</hi> cannot be higher in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
unles he does all things alone by himſelf. Is not this
excellent? But, what follows is ſuperexcellent and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendently
rationall; his Diſarmer shew'd his conſequence
naught, becauſe an Arch-bishop going to conſecrate a
Bishop uſes to take two other Bishops with him, which
yet argues not that the Arch-bishop hath any greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
than a Bishop: ſoe that as it is inconſequent to
ſay, an Arch bishop does not alone entruſt a Bishop
with a Bishoprick, but takes two Bishops a long with
him to do it, therefore he hath noe higher Authority
then the Bishops he takes with him; ſo, it is equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent
to ſay, <hi>S. Peter</hi> did not alone <hi>entruſt Iames</hi>
with the Bishoprick of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> but took <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Iohn</hi> with him, therefore he had no higher Authority
then <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> This conſequence abſolutely denied
by me and an inſtance given to shew by parity the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of it, it was his task to ſtrengthen it here; yet he hath
the confidence to repeat it, and, in ſtead of ſodering the
incoherence of it, catches at my inſtance and tells me <hi>it
neither does nor ever will be made appear by S.</hi> W. <hi>that S.
Peter was an Arch bishop in reſpect of thoſe two other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragan
Bishops Iames and Iohn.</hi> Did I ſay <hi>S. Peter</hi> was an
<hi>Arch-bishop</hi> and the other two his <hi>ſuffragans?</hi> what means
then this laying out my words in ſuch a forme? that he
had higher Authority was mine and the Catholike Tenet
which higher Authority I showd not invalidated by his
taking other two with him by the parity of an Arch-bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops
carriage in the like caſe, and hence denied the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence:
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115675:139"/>
yet in deſpight of Logick and the commoneſt

I Anſwer denying the conſequence, and affirming that he

judgment of ſome preiudiced or weak underſtandings
conſerve his credit by ſuch Evaſions; but I am confident
that any knowing ſincere man will acknowledge that any
freshman in the Vniverſity would be hiſt out of the

Dr. hath proved his conſequence.</p>
               <p>He adds a Teſtimony out of <hi>Clemens,</hi> which he ſayes

it's being ſpoken in the plurall number in common: I ask
then and put it to Dr. H's choice; does this word ſound
priority or preeminence in <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Iuriſdiction,</hi> or
does it not, but ſome other priority, as of favour, gifts
&amp;c. If it does, then it makes theſe three Apoſtles ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
in Iuriſdiction to the reſt and puts the reſt ſubject to
them, which Dr. H. will (Iam ſure) by noe means admit
nay expreſly denies in this very page. If it does not, then
what does it concern our queſtion, which is about <hi>Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for let the reſt be never ſoe much before <hi>S. Peter</hi>
in all other regards, yet as long as they are not equall'd to
<hi>S. Peter</hi> in <hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> ſtill our Tenet is in
tire to us and untuch't. Teſtimonies therefore which can
make againſt us muſt concern <hi>Iuriſdiction,</hi> and shew an
equality among the Apoſtles in that; of which ſince this
place cannot be underſtood, as hath been shown, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conſequently pretend to tuch us at all. Again admit
the <hi>honoring above the reſt;</hi> ſpoke in common of theſe
three Apoſtles, ſignified any Iuriſdiction or higher degree
of Authority, yet how does it appear hence that one of
theſe three was not honoured above the other two; ſince
the words themſelves expreſſe nothing to the contrary
but eaſily permit it to be ſo without any violence offer'd
to their ſence; Cities are honored more then Villages,
yet it follows not from theſe words that all Cities are of
<hi>equall honor</hi> with one another. Soe miſerably weak is
Dr. H's reaſon, which is onely declamation pitch, that
it cannot be imagin'd, unleſſe a man had his ſtrong fancy,
how his beſt teſtimonies, which <hi>deſerve,</hi> as he tells us, ſuch
<hi>conſideration,</hi> can in any manner concern the queſtion for
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115675:140"/>
which they are alledged, nor carry home to the meaneſt
ſemblance or shadow of a concluſion.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; having proved gallantly from three
being honored before the reſt an equality of that honor
in all thoſe three, and ſuppoſed againſt his own Tenet that
this preference of honor means <hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi>
and ſo that theſe three Apoſtles were <hi>equall</hi> in that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
he adds, <hi>and as ſuch they choſe and ordain'd the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Lord; which, ſure, is not after the manner of an
Arch-bishop and his ſuffragan Bishops,</hi> where you ſee the
upshot of all expreſt in his ſure-footed concluſion, <hi>which
ſure,</hi> &amp;c. depends upon the (<hi>as ſuch</hi>) and the (<hi>as equall
in Authority,</hi>) and that (<hi>as ſuch</hi>) depends upon Dr. H's
invention; no ſuch reduplicative expreſſion being found
in the teſtimony: ſo that, as long experience hath tought
us, Dr. H's arguments and teſtimonies put to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick
teſt, are reſolved into his own ſayngs and ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<hi>ſures,</hi> as into their firſt principles and the ground
work of his teſtimonies, which are allowed onely to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
and reflect glancingly upon his own more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
ſolid and pregnant affirmations.</p>
               <p>Thus much to show how impoſſible it is this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
should prejudice us; now (though we have better
grounds then to ſtand need to build upon it) in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
it makes rather for us: for, what ſtrange matter
was it or worth taking notice of, that they should <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

                     </gap>y?</hi> what ſoe high commendation is it in thoſe
Apoſtles that none of them ſtrove for preeminence of
Authority, if there had been unqueſtionably none at all
belonging to any one of them? Or what novelty is it that
perſons of <hi>equall Authority</hi> should doe things by <hi>common
conſent?</hi> Whereas, had ſome one had power to do it alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
and yet condeſcended to it with the joint-conſent
and joint-execution of others, the carriage was worth

obſervation for the particularity of their peaceablenes,
humility, mutuall confidence and brotherly charity.</p>
               <p>After this worthy teſtimony comes hobbling in a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-proof,
to make good all that went before, in this
form. <hi>And ſo alſo in the place to the Gal. e. 2. v. 9. Iames
and Cephas and Iohn are equally dignified by S. Paul and

                  </gap>, <hi>ſeeming to be
pillars.</hi> This teſtimony hath two parts as it is put by Mr. H.
the firſt, that <hi>they were equally dignified by S. Paul in the</hi>
9. <hi>v.</hi> the ſecond, that <hi>they are all three called pillars.</hi> But
as for the firſt look in the place and you shall find noe
other note of their being <hi>equally dignified</hi> ſave onely that
theſe three are named together. Hath not this Dr. of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
a ſtrange reach of reaſon, who can conclude men
equall in Authority becauſe he finds their names in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
place? ſo that, should he hap to find the King, Tom
fool and Iohn a Nokes named all together, preſently his
levelling logick concludes them all <hi>equally dignified.</hi> The
like acutenes is shown in the ſecond part which ſounds to
the ſame time, both being non-ſence in Ela. <hi>They are all
called pillars, ergo,</hi> they are all <hi>equall,</hi> cries the Dr. as if
one <hi>pillar</hi> could not be higher then another. But he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
noe diſtinction between a community and an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor will vouchſafe to underſtand that degrees are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſuperadded to the common <hi>ſpecies</hi> of things; wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tever
things he finds named by the ſame name in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

to all of each kind, by Dr H's paralell logick which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the Apoſtles <hi>equall</hi> becauſe they are called <hi>pillars,</hi>
nay even from their being named together. Is the anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

time, were it not that the ſleight-reaſond preaching-vogue,
which now takes vulgar heads, had got him an
opinion amongſt many, and ſo, by means of that, not
by any force of his reaſons, enabled him to do miſchief,
unleſſe his wilfull and affected weakneſſes be laid open. I
might hope alſo for ſome ameandment from another, but
I finde him ſo long beaten to his ſlender-woven cobwebb

               <p>He was told in <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd</hi> of the ſame faults; to

becauſe they were all called ſo in the <hi>plurall;</hi> that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
were all <hi>equall</hi> becauſe that common Appellation

               <head type="sub">Dr. H's Pretences of Teſtimonies (as hee calls them) and
his manifold falſification of S. Chryſoſtome, to prove
Iames at Hieruſalem clearly ſuperiour to S. Peter.</head>
               <p>AS for the point it ſelf concerning <hi>S. Iames,</hi> I am
reprehended for <hi>misunderſtanding</hi> Dr. H. and that
he endeauored not to <hi>prove S. Iames his priority of dignity
and Authority,</hi> but <hi>onely to prove that in his ſee James was
conſidered as a Bishop,</hi> Anſw. p. 43. l. 20. 21. and 27. whereas
neither any man denied him to have been Bishop there,
nor could it any way advantage Dr. H's cauſe if this were
ptoved; for what follows againſt <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s being chief of
the Apoſtles that <hi>S. Iames</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and
the Iuriſdiction of that Metropolis? Hath not each Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Bishop the ſame now a dayes over his private
Dioceſe, and yet remains ſubject to the head of God's
Church notwithſtanding? Again, if he intended not that
<hi>S. Iames</hi> had <hi>greater Authority there,</hi> what meant his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his having <hi>the principall place,</hi> and <hi>giving the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi>
that <hi>the Reſcript is grounded upon his ſentence,</hi> &amp;c.
Surely when one gives <hi>the ſentence,</hi> and the others onely
propoſe, the former muſt be held to have greater power
in that place and thoſe circumſtances then the latter. But
[<hi>principall</hi>] with him ſounds noe priority at all, nor can
he be held to any thing who hath got once the priviledge
to ſay and unſay again as hee pleaſes. He was accuſed of
making <hi>S. Iames</hi> at <hi>Hieruſalem, ſuperior to S. Peter,</hi> which
he denies p. 43. blaming me for <hi>misunderſtanding</hi> him,
yet in the p. 44. ere the Eccho of the former words were
well out of the Reader's ears, he goes about to prove and
infer in expreſſe words from teſtimonies that <hi>Iames in this
council was clearly ſuperior to S. Peter;</hi> which is clearly
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115675:142"/>
contradictory to his former words. But we are not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at what is grown cuſtomary and familiar.</p>
               <p>Next, he goes about to shew (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 44.) that he
hath <hi>at leaſt pretences of teſtimonies that S. Iames had the
principall place,</hi> the firſt of which <hi>pretences</hi> is, that <hi>he is
named before Peter,</hi> and unleſſe this conclude our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s being named firſt muſt be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
I Anſwer, our argument drawn thence for his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
place among the Apoſtles inſiſts upon his <hi>conſtantly</hi>
being named firſt, and not <hi>once</hi> onely; which might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
without any great miſtery in it. Again, what mean
theſe words, <hi>the Romaniſts argument from the</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>concluding his primacy from being firſt named.</hi> Theſe are two
quite different things. The argument from his being <hi>firſt
named,</hi> conſiſts in this, that in the orderly naming of the
Apoſtles his name is found firſt placed: whereas, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> lies in this, not that he is
<hi>firſt named,</hi> but that he is in theſe words <hi>nam'd</hi> or <hi>expreſt</hi> to
be the <hi>firſt</hi> of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>His ſecond <hi>pretence of a Teſtimony,</hi> as he calls it, is from
<hi>S. Iames</hi> his <hi>giving the ſentence;</hi> and though their own
tranſlation rendred the words [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>wherefore my
ſentence is,</hi> by this means making it onely his iudgment
in the matters, yet Dr. H. tells us, <hi>he ſtill beleeves it ſignifies
the ſentence.</hi> The firſt ground of this his beleef is, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
'tis <hi>S. Chryſoſtomes</hi> obſervation that his <hi>ſpeaking laſt</hi>
was founded in his being Bishop <hi>of Hieruſalem:</hi> what
then? could not he be Bishop there and <hi>ſpeak laſt</hi> both,
without giving <hi>the ſentence?</hi> were there noe worthier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
preſent, or did the thing to be concluded onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
his ſee, or indeed did it concern it at all? the Reſcript,
the effect of this conſult, being directed onely to Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
which were noe wayes ſubject to the Bishoprick of
<hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> But let us ſee <hi>S. Chryſoſtomes</hi> teſtimony

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>therefore he ſpeaks laſt upon

               <p>His ſecond worthy proof is that <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayes

               <p>He had already proved from his late-mentioned unau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
teſtimony that S. <hi>Iames had the principall place
becauſe he ſpoke laſt;</hi> then he names the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which
hee englishes, <hi>good order,</hi> in <hi>ſpeaking, ſet down</hi> (as he
ſayes) <hi>by S. Chryſoſtome;</hi> Next, he leaves out all thoſe
words which might manifeſt what was meant in that place
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115675:143"/>
by <hi>good order,</hi> to wit that there was <hi>noe haughtineſſe in that
Congregation,</hi> that <hi>their Souls were free from vainglory</hi>
which should have shewn plainly that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>good
order</hi> conſiſted onely in behaving themſelves modeſtly
and peaceably and not in the beſt man's ſpeaking laſt.
Thirdly he tells us that <hi>after Peter Paul ſpeaks</hi> but leaves
out the following words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>and noe man ſtops
his mouth</hi> or hinders him, leſt we should apprehend that
the <hi>good order</hi> conſiſted onely in this that they did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
one another in ſpeaking, which apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion would
have ſpoile'd the Drs <hi>good order</hi> of the principall man ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>laſt</hi> fourthly, to hinder the Reader from the ſame
right apprehenſion, he omitts all the words following that
which related to <hi>Iames,</hi> to wit <hi>Iohn ſayes nothing here, the
other Apoſtles ſay nothing, but keep ſilence and take it not
ill,</hi> becauſe it was impoſſible that <hi>Keeping ſilence,</hi> and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying
<hi>nothing,</hi> should ſignify <hi>good order inſpeaking;</hi> which
hee pretends is meant there Fifthly, by picking out of the
teſtimony theſe words, <hi>after Peter Paul ſpeaks and Iames
forbears, and interpoſes not, for he was entruſted with the</hi>
(Bishoprick or) <hi>principality,</hi> and there ending, he gains
a rare ſemblance for his purpoſe that <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> made
<hi>S. Iames</hi> for <hi>good order</hi>'s ſake reſerve himſelf till the <hi>laſt,</hi>
becauſe hee was the beſt man; whereas take the whole
entire teſtimony concerning that matter) more then three
quarters of which he omitts,) and it is moſt evident to
every ordinary Reader's eye that it is impoſſible it should
ſignify any ſuch matter, as hath been shown. Sixthly, to
come to that imperfect piece of a teſtimony, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
by him to corrupt the ſence which is the ſoule of it,
the Interpreter acknowledgeth not the cauſall particle
[<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>for</hi>] upon which he builds <hi>S. Iames</hi> his warines not
to ſpeak till his turn the <hi>laſt</hi> place. Seventhly had Mr. H.
been ſoe candid as to put the words as he found them in
the context, related to ſo particularly by himſelf, <hi>tom.</hi> 4.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Iames flies not back</hi> or <hi>reſiſts not,</hi>
without recurring to the marginall <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>interpoſes
not,</hi> all colour had been waſtht of from his ſophiſticated
teſtimony, even as dreſt up by himſelf. For, what cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
make theſe words in Dr. H's grounds, <hi>he reſiſts not,
for he was entruſted with the Bishoprick,</hi> if the being a Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop
they gave him the <hi>principall place,</hi> and ſoe made him
more able to reſiſt or diſſent. Add that the Interpreter to
whom his own ſide defer much render's it <hi>non reſilit, he
flies not back,</hi> which makes the marginall word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (to
which Dr. H. recurrs without giving us notice of it) leſſe
authentick. In a word the whole teſtimony manifeſts one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they demeaned themſelves peaceably and quietly
without contentions and proud interrupting one another;
and the particular line, pickt out by his ſence-corrupting
art, notes on the by, amongſt other things which show'd
their humble and peaceable charity, that one of theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely
<hi>S. Iames</hi> had a particular charge over the Iewish
Sect, whoſe cauſe it ſeemd to be to obſerve the Moſaicall
law and ſoe it was by conſequence his Intereſt to oppoſe
<hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s contrary Verdict; yet not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
ſuch was his peaceable carriage that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>he
reſiſts not,</hi> or as the Interpreter render's it, <hi>Iacobus fert &amp;
non reſilit, illi erat principatus concreditus,</hi> with comes to
this ſence that he ſuffers it quietly and flies not back from
their fore determination, although the charge he had
ſeemd to engage him rather to favour the Iewish party.
But Dr. H. by omitting all the words which could shew the
true import of the place, by taking a line onely which
could by additional arts give a gloſſe to another quite-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
ſence, by mangling that otherwiſe-ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt
line by adding it after his former teſtimony of being
Bishop becauſe he ſpoke laſt; by introducing it with the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
confident words [<hi>and yet more expreſſely ſetting down the</hi>

the maimed and corrupted teſtimony down thus, <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Peter Paul ſpeaks and Iames forbears and interpoſes not,
for he was entruſted with the Principality,</hi> and laſtly, by shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up cloſe his teſtimony there, leſt the vigor of it should
take aire by admitting in the following words; by all the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
numerous evaſions, I ſay, he makes the honeſt and
unwary Reader beleeve that <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> ſets down
their <hi>good order in ſpeaking</hi> (as hee renders it,) to conſiſt
in this that <hi>Iames</hi> having the principall place forbears till
the reſt have done, and ſpeaks in the laſt place as his hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
dignity and as the Dr. expreſſes it a little after his being
<hi>clearly ſuperior to S. Peter</hi> required where as the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or
<hi>good order</hi> ſpoken of there, rather ſignifies <hi>noe order</hi> at
all as Mr. H. takes order; but that he who had any thing to
ſay might freely and quietly ſpeak without feare of being
proudly check't or contentiouſly interrupted by another.</p>
               <p>Laſtly I would know with what face Mr. H. renders
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which ſignifies onely <hi>good order [good order in
ſpeaking</hi>] ſince 'tis plain from the teſtimony that <hi>S. Iohn</hi>
and the reſt of the Apoſtles ſpake nothing at all, and yet
they are put there as bearing part in this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and quiet demeanour here ſpoken of. So that the words
[<hi>of ſpeaking</hi>] are added by Dr. H's own imagination to
the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>good order,</hi> and for no other end but to
prove that the <hi>firſt</hi> should ſpeake <hi>laſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This manner of alledging Teſtimonies may be reckon'd
as another head or common-place of Dr. H's wily shifts;
and conſiſts in this, that though the whole ſcope and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

and in paſſing, as it were, at two or three words of
it, which taken alone and introduced with a handſome
boldnes ſeem to ſound for his purpoſe whereas the whole

               <p>AFter this <hi>hyſteron-proteron,</hi> teſtimony concerning
<hi>Iames</hi> his firſt-laſt place, we have another from <hi>S.

for thus (ſpeaking of <hi>S. Iames) it behoves him that is in
great power or Authority to leave the sharper things to others,

               <p>This ſeems terrible; but, to render good for evill and not
to wrong Dr. H. who thus baffles us with teſtimonies, we
will make himſelf the rule of interpreting this place. He
tells us p. 43. that he <hi>pretends not that any of the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
had any greater Authority then Peter, much leſſe Iames
the Bishop of Hieruſalem, who, as he ſuppoſes, was none of
the twelve, but onely that as Bishop he had the principall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
even in S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>preſence.</hi> How this <hi>equall power</hi> of all
the Apoſtles conſiſts with <hi>S. Peter</hi> having no power ſave
over <hi>one portion of the diſperſed</hi> Iews onely, as Dr. H. affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 71. I will not now examin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
us to obſerve in it is onely this, that he produces
not theſe teſtimonies to prove the <hi>greater power</hi> of any in

being clearly his meaning, (as it is alſo more particularly

                  </gap>, directly and properly ſignify, we willingly
grant; ſince we deny not his being Bishop there but that
he had <hi>greater,</hi> or, as Dr. H. expreſſes it, was <hi>clearly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
to S. Peter,</hi> is both expreſſely contradictory to
himſelf, and to his whole ſcope and intention; which was
to prove as he tells us <hi>not his greater power</hi> but <hi>principall

he was about; and that in ſtead of proving the principall
place onely, he having light on an odd teſtimony which
ſpoke expreſly of <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Iames was clearly ſuperior there to S. Peter,</hi> meaning <hi>in power;</hi>
let all this I ſay be granted and pardoned, if S. Iames we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<hi>ſuperior</hi> there <hi>in power</hi> to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> I ſuppoſe he was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe
ſuperior to the reſt; (for I fear not that Dr. H.
should deny his inference of all the Apoſtles equality
from their being called foundation-ſtones pillars and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
in the plurall) then I ask whither Dr. H. thinks in
his conſcience that theſe Apoſtles who had Authority to
conſtitute <hi>Iames</hi> Bishop there had not Authority likewi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
to remove him, if they ſaw it convenient? if they had,
then they had an Authority <hi>ſuperior</hi> to <hi>S. Iames</hi> even in
his own ſee; and, I would ask Dr. H. even in his own
grounds why <hi>S. Peter</hi> should not be his ſuperior ſtill aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
as <hi>S. Paul</hi> was yet ſuperior to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> after
they were fixt Bishops <hi>S. Iames</hi> being conſtituted Bishop
in <hi>Iudea</hi> shown to have been <hi>S. Peter's</hi> Province; (I mean
ſuch Province as he is pretended to have had) as well as
the Gentiles, over whom <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Bishops were pretended to bee <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s Province.
Again wee will pardon Dr. H. his affirmation that the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:115675:146"/>
Apoſtles diſtributed their univerſal great Province into
ſeverall leſſer ones. Thoſe famous <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and yet giving <hi>S. Iames</hi> here an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
alſo, whom he holds here to be no Apoſtle. Or if
Dr. H. refuſe to accept the pardon and fall to qualify the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fact,
then I vſe my advantage and vrge him; was <hi>S. Iames</hi>
independent, or was he ſtill ſubject as <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
are held by himſelf to have been, even after they;
were Bishops? If he were independent, then he went a
breaſt with the Apoſtles in ſelf Authority, and had his
catachreſtically-nam'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, aſwell as they; But, if
he remain'd ſtill ſubject, then his territory being amongſt
the Iews, and <hi>S Peter</hi> being by Dr. H's excluſive place
of Scripture nam'd Apoſtle of the Iews in the ſame te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
as <hi>S. Paul</hi> was over the Gentiles. Gal. 2. it is given
us by Dr. H's grounds that in all probability he could be
ſubject to none but to the Apoſtle of the Iews <hi>S. Peter,</hi>
and that in his own ſee, which was in <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Province,
at leſt that kind of Province which he can be pretended
from Scripture to have had.</p>
               <p>But what should thoſe words of Dr. H's ſignify (<hi>Anſw.</hi>
p. 43.) that <hi>in his ſee Iames was conſidered as a Bishop, and
ſo had the principall place even in Peter's preſence.</hi> Cannot
one be a Bishop, but he muſt ſit in a council before his
betters? Suppoſe the Apoſtles had conſtituted a Bishop
of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> in England, and aſſembled themſelves there
in conuncil; muſt therefore the honeſt Bishop of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>
ſit before <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles?
Nay more, let us imagin a nationall council to bee met
there, ought not the Bishop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> give place to his
Metropolitan the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and let
him <hi>pronounce the ſentence?</hi> yet D. H. here out of his ill
will to the Pope's predeceſſour <hi>S. Peter,</hi> will let <hi>S. Iames</hi>
do neither though he hold's him to have been <hi>no Apoſtle.</hi>
But 'ts ſufficient with him that he is a Bishop in that place
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115675:146"/>
to infer him to bee <hi>clearly ſuperiour</hi> to all there, to have
the <hi>principall place, give the ſentence,</hi> and what not? Nor
matters it that even according to Dr. H. the others are
Apoſtles and he none, nor how high they, how low he bee
in Authority; if <hi>S. Peter</hi> bee in company, the private Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop
shall be <hi>clearly ſuperiour</hi> to them all; whereas, had he
been abſent, <hi>S. Iames</hi> had neither been thus exalted, nor
the other Apoſtles thus depres't 'twas <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s being
there which put all out of order.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, what means his inference of his being <hi>clearly
ſuperiour in that council?</hi> This is the moſt unlikely point
of all the reſt; this council (as hath been shown) concern'd
not <hi>S. Iames</hi> his particular Iuriſdiction, but the common
good of the Church, of which the Apoſtles were overſeer's;
nor did this in particular concern <hi>S. Iames,</hi> who (as Dr.
H. here grants) was none of the Apoſtles. In a word, if
he contend that they let him have the principall place out
of a reſpectfull and courteous deference upon another
ſcore, as he was our Lord's brother and very ancient, let
him bring authentick teſtimonies that they did ſo, and
wee shall eaſily grant it. But what does <hi>courteſy</hi> concern
<hi>power,</hi> or the <hi>right</hi> to a thing, or place. Thus wee read that
Pope <hi>Anicetus,</hi> gave <hi>S. Polycarp</hi> the preeminence even
in his own Church, yet wee think not that his civill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion
wrong'd his Iuriſdiction; though (I know)
if Dr. H. could prove ſo much of <hi>S. Iames</hi> here, all were
loſt to <hi>S. Peter</hi> without hopes of recovery. But if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
his principal place by <hi>right</hi> upon the account onely
of being Bishop there, 'tis infinitly weak, and inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;
reaſon abſolutely diſclaiming any ſuch inference;
and as for authority the very teſtimonies he brings to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
it are either expreſſely againſt him and contrary to his
own grounds, or els unauthentick; or, laſtly, nothing
at all to his purpoſe, as hath been shown.</p>
               <p>His next teſtimony that S. Iames ſaith, <hi>with power I
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:115675:147"/>
iudge,</hi> makes neither for him nor againſt us: ſince wee
grant that each here had power, and vſed that power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting
or decreeing; ſoe hath, and doth each member in
Parlament, which yet conſiſts wel enough with their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
degrees of power in thus voting, and decreeing;
ſo that, though wee read that one member did it, upon
an occaſion relating to him in particular, without exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the reſt, wee cannot upon that negative argument
either infer that he alone did ſo, or pronounced the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
unles his expreſſion had ſomething particular, not
competent to the reſt; As for example, had it been phras'd
thus. <hi>Let it be enacted, Bee it decreed,</hi> &amp;c. there had been
ſome ground that he pronounced <hi>the ſentence,</hi> but his
words being onely <hi>I iudge,</hi> or (as their own tranſlation
renders it) <hi>my ſentence</hi> is, which ſounds no higher ſtrain
of authority nor any thing not equally-competent to any
or each of the reſt, ſince each might without any great
ambition, ſay, <hi>my ſentence is thus,</hi> and thus, 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any reaſon unprejudiced can think any more deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thence then that his particular ſentence was expreſt by
thoſe words.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the words, following Dr. H's explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them. But to give <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> leave to explicate
himſelf, let us hear what hee ſayes. In the ſame Homily
and upon the ſame paſſage wee find theſe words; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>he with
good reaſon ordains thoſe things to witt</hi> to abſtain from things
ſtrangled, &amp;c. out of the law, leſt he should ſeem to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate

<hi>And obſerve how he
lets not them hear thoſe things from the law, but from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ſaying I iudge, that is from my ſelf, not having heard it
from the law.</hi> Where we have two things remarkable in
this prudent cariage of <hi>S. Iames,</hi> whoſe circumſtances
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115675:147"/>
(being Bishop, and Reſident in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>) required
on the one ſide that he should not disguſt the Iews his
Dioceſans by ſeeming to ſleight the law; on the other ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
he was not to wrong Chriſtianity, by making thoſe
things neceſſary to be obſerved preciſely upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
becauſe the law of Moſes preſcribed them. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
himſelf equally in this caſe without giving offence
to one ſide, or other, <hi>S. Chryſostome</hi> obſerves firſt that
<hi>he ordains theſe things out of the law,</hi> that is, ſuch things
as were materially found in the law; and commanded the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
and ſo auoids the Iews diſpleaſure; but does not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
them formally, becauſe they were commanded by
the law, ſoe avoiding the wronging of Chriſtianity, but
of himſelf who as an Apoſtle had power to do ſuch things:
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I <hi>iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,</hi>
that is, <hi>of my ſelf</hi> (or <hi>own Authority) not as having
heard it from the law;</hi> that is, not as from the Authority
of the law of Moſes. This being ſo, the words cited by
Dr. H. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I <hi>iudge, that is,
I ſay with power,</hi> is given by all reaſon to ſignify the ſame
as the former explication now layd out at large, and of
which this ſeems to bee onely a brief repetition. For firſt,
why should wee imagine that <hi>S. Chryſoſtome,</hi> should gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
two diſparate interpretations of the ſame word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
taken in the ſelf ſame circumſtances? Next, were it not
onely a repetition of the former, why is he ſo short in this
latter explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as to paſſe it over ſleightly in theſe words;
nothing neither before, nor after relating to that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.
Thirdly becauſe the words I <hi>ſay with power</hi> are
perfectly conſonant to the other, I <hi>ſay it of my ſelf, not as
from the law:</hi> that is, from mine own power not from the
power of the law, to which mine ſucceeds, And laſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
if wee look more narrowly into the place wee shall
find that neither Teſtimony is an explication of the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>iudging,</hi> or (as Dr. H. will needs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve

it) <hi>giving the ſentence,</hi> but of the emphatical [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>I;]
which in the firſt place denoting a ſelf authoritative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of his power in oppoſition to the law and it's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
conſequently in the latter place, where the <hi>emphaſis</hi>
of the ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is explicated by [with power] there is no
ground imaginable why it should ſignify otherwiſe than
the forme <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>of my ſelf;</hi> or, why it should have any
emphaticall relation or oppoſition to any other Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſave that of the law onely. So that there is not the ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt
appearance of S. <hi>Iames</hi> his having <hi>the principall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi>
or <hi>giving the ſentence,</hi> from the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>with

there ſpoken of relating to the law's <hi>no power</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of power in thus decreeing, not to the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<hi>leſſer power</hi> then his as Bishop. But, as his ordinary
cuſtome is, Dr. H. picks out any two words, neglecting
to conſider the true import of the father's meaning by
them, and having thus ſingled them out, he onely touches
them ſleightly with a grave careleſnes and thinks the
deed is done.</p>
               <p>What follows in his 12. paragraph craves onely that the
Readers would vſe their eyes to avoyd his crafts who
would blind them, All I need do in anſwer is to quote
particularly the places in which I am ſure there can bee
no deceit. Dr. H. told us in the laſt line of p. 72. and the
firſt of p. 73. in his book <hi>of Schiſm,</hi> that the <hi>Reſcript was
grounded upon S. Iames his ſentence</hi> (which a little before
he made <hi>the ſentence</hi>) quoting for it, <hi>Acts 15. v.</hi> 22. My
anſwer <hi>Schiſm Diſar.</hi> p. 59. l. 1. 2. &amp;c. Was, that in that
place there was nothing particularizing <hi>S. Iames,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that <hi>then</hi> (to wit, after <hi>S. Peter, S. Paul,</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
and <hi>S. Iames</hi> had ſpoken) It <hi>ſeemed good to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and Elders with the whole Church,</hi> &amp;c. Now if there
be nothing in that Verſe alledged, ſignifying that the
<hi>Reſcript was grounded upon S. Iames his ſentence</hi> for which
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115675:148"/>
it was brought, then 'tis plain I neither misvnderſtand nor
miſtake. To avoyd all caville I took the Verſe as I found
it in their own tranſlation, in which nothing was found
ſounding to that purpoſe yet all this exacteſt diligence
avails nothing at all with an Adverſary, who takes liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſay any thing, I muſt needs commit two faults in
tranſcribing one Verſe, and yet tranſcribe it right too;
ſo that <hi>S.</hi> W. faultines is now become the Text, and this
Text (beloved) is divided into two parts, the firſt part is
<hi>a misunderſtanding</hi> the ſecond is <hi>a Miſtake.</hi> The firſt that
<hi>S.</hi> W. would make him <hi>imagin the ſentence was ſo his, as not
to bee the Councills;</hi> whereas indeed <hi>S.</hi> W. made him <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi>
noe ſuch thing, but onely (as himſelf told me there)
that <hi>S. Iames</hi> his particular ſentence expreſt by [<hi>my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>]
was <hi>the ſentence.</hi> But this was antecedent to the
point there treated, and here vindicated, the queſtion the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
was, whether the 22. <hi>v.</hi> there cited, ſignified that <hi>the
Reſcript was grounded upon S. Iames his ſentence,</hi> which was
the thing he produced it for but to this point he ſayes
nothing, neither vindicating that ſignification of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,
nor ſo much as putting it down: Thus much for <hi>S.</hi> W.
firſt fault of <hi>misunderſtanding.</hi> The ſecond fault is as hee
courteouſly counterfeits is <hi>a farther miſtake</hi> and that the
words [<hi>then ſeemd it good,</hi> &amp;c.] mean <hi>a ſubſequent deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to the Dogma, or Decree,</hi> If ſo, I wonder who
was in the fault or miſtook? I pretend to prove nothing
from it, and ſo was not in poſſible circumſtances to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
it he pretended to prove from it that the <hi>Reſcript is
founded on S. James his ſentence,</hi> which he ſays here, it
ſignifies not, but <hi>a ſubſequent determination of ſending men
to Antioch,</hi> and then when he hath done he kindly and
courteouſly layes the blame from himſelf, and on <hi>S.</hi> W.
telling him he hath <hi>miſtaken</hi> which when hee hath done
hee concludes with a Gloria Patri, how well hee hath <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd</hi>
S. W. to conſider whether Dr. H. or hee bee <hi>wiſer</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:115675:149"/>
or <hi>honeſter.</hi> But in caſe I had miſtook in calling thoſe
words [<hi>then ſeemed it good,</hi> &amp;c.] the <hi>Dogma,</hi> or <hi>Decree</hi>
I at leſt miſtake with good Company; for good <hi>S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>
was expreſſely of my mind, who after he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
upon the former Verſes he makes his tranſition
to this in theſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>after wards
the common decree follows,</hi> and immediately produces this
very Verſe which the Dr. denyes here to ſignify the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gma,</hi>
or <hi>Decree,</hi> but onely a ſubſequent determination.</p>
               <p>Next he tells the Reader (par. 13.) that I <hi>would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in fauour of S. Peters Authority from his ſpeaking firſt,</hi>
&amp;c. It had been more ingenuous to repreſent me in mine
own language, I uſe not to build concluſions abſolutely
upon conjecturall premiſſes without expreſſing how far
I build on them, as I did there <hi>Schiſm Diſar.</hi> p. 60. by
ſaying that <hi>in reaſon one should rather think,</hi> &amp;c. nor did
I rely even for thus much upon onely his <hi>ſpeaking firſt,</hi>
but that <hi>after ſuch debate</hi> as had been concerning this
<q>matter <hi>v.</hi> 7. in reaſon one should rather think, it argued
ſome greater Authority, in him who should firſt break
the ice, and interpoſe his iudgement, in ſuch a ſolemnly
pronounc'd oration as did <hi>S. Peter.</hi>
                  </q> But Dr. H. omits that
which I grounded on, to wit, [<hi>after ſuch debate,</hi> &amp;c.]
which add's a circumſtance much encreaſing the rather-probability
of his greater Authority; and truly to a man
not prepoſſeſt with prejudice the Text it ſelf is ſufficiently
fauourable as far as I pretended. <hi>And the Apoſtles &amp;
Elders came together for to conſider of this matter; and when
there had been much diſputing Peter roſe up and ſaid vnto
them,</hi> &amp;c. Now Dr. H. will have his <hi>firſt ſpeaking</hi> ariſe
hence that he had been accuſed of preaching to <hi>Cornelius</hi>
a Gentile, and ſo gives an account of his actions. But the
Text it ſelf gives no countenance at all, but looks much
awry upon ſuch an evaſion. <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s words are, <hi>men and
brethren you know that a good while ago God made choice
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115675:149"/>
among us that the Gentils by my mouth should hear the words
of the Goſpell.</hi> where wee ſee that his preaching to the
Gentiles was a thing already <hi>known</hi> to the Congregation,
<hi>known long agoe,</hi> and known to have been God's <hi>will</hi> and
<hi>choice,</hi> the former knowledge of which was enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
ſuch perſons, and to make <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s giving a new
account of that action needles and to no purpoſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed does it ſound like an Apology, nor is there any
circumſtance fauouring that interpretation. The occaſion
was about the neceſſity or no neceſſity of circumciſion
<hi>v.</hi> 5. and more immediatly their long diſputing upon that
matter. Next the action of preaching to the Gentiles is
expreſs't clearly here as needing no account but as <hi>known</hi>
by them <hi>long ago</hi> to have been God's will. And laſtly,
pursving the ſame matter, and ſaying that <hi>God had put no
difference between Iews, and Gentiles,</hi> he comes to the
point; <hi>Now therefore why tempt yee God,</hi> &amp;c. where the
word [<hi>therefore</hi>] making his former diſcourſe have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon this latter of not obliging to Circumciſion,
show's it to bee meerly a pertinent, and orderly <hi>exordium</hi>
to confirm and give light to what follow'd, which this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Interpreter of Scripture in deſpite of all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
(as his cuſtome is) will need's have to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
<hi>S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Apology</hi> or <hi>iuſtification of him ſelf for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
to the Gentiles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, were <hi>S. Peter</hi> neceſſitated to <hi>iuſtify</hi> himſelf,
how does it follow that he muſt therefore need's ſpeak
firſt? Do even thoſe who hold up their hand's at the bar
vſe to begin with their defence, and Apologize for their
innocence in the <hi>firſt</hi> place! No ſtrength of reaſon but
Mr. H's could have defended it ſelf ſoe confidently with
ſuch a paper-buckler, or have thought cob-webs impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable.
Iames muſt be <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe he <hi>ſpoke laſt,</hi> and
<hi>S. Peter</hi> muſt <hi>ſpeak firſt</hi> becauſe he was to <hi>Apologize</hi> and
give account of his actions. Whereas <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> in
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115675:150"/>
Act. 1. v. 15. whom Dr. H. moſt relies upon in this place,
makes his ſpeaking firſt, both here, and in all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
an argument of his <hi>Primacy;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>S. Peter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as entruſted by Chriſt with the sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
and as the firſt of the quire always begins to ſpeak firſt.</hi>
What can bee more expreſsly deſtructive to Dr. H's tenet,
and interpretation of this place, yet (it not belonging to
me at this time to alledge teſtimonies, and object) I went
not far to fetch it, or ſeek it in remote Authors, but took
the firſt obvious teſtimony I met, in this very father
which he chuſes here for his beſt Patron, and in that very
treatiſe which he built upon, as moſt expreſſe, for this his
altogether-unwarrantable poſition. Nor conſequently
can it bee imagin'd but that Dr. H. muſt needs ſee how
averſe <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> was from what he would make him
profeſſe, in caſe hee ever look't into the very Author he
quotes, and moſt relies on.</p>

I deny it,</hi> I marry replyes Dr. H. but you muſt prove

Logick a fortnight will imagin that the whole

non-ſence with ſuch gravity and ſobriety; and acquit his

indiſcretion to think the anſwering ſuch an adverſary
worth his pains.</p>
               <p>Secondly he anſwers, that <hi>unles the ſame Chriſt that
gave him this power immediatly appear to have ſubjected it
to S. Peter, as clearly, as that he gave him the power, which
'tis certain appear's not, this cannot be ſayd with any ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
Where beſides the relapſe into the ſame fault of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
his Reſpondent should make his own diſtinction
appear, it is worth obſervation how cautious the Dr. is to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115675:151"/>
make all ſure againſt S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Primacy. It muſt be <hi>the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Chriſt</hi> which muſt do this, leſt there be juggling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand.
A weighty caution? and he muſt appear <hi>full as
clearly,</hi> to have ſubjected this power, as to have given it:
extreme rigour! or elſe S. W. muſt forfeit his <hi>ſobriety</hi> for
affirming it. Hard meaſure! In anſwer; I am not afraid
of all theſe cautions but tell him more, and ſtick not to
aſſure him that it equally apperes to me, as it appears that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is God. If he ſtartle at this, and demand by what
means I can give him ſuch an aſſurance? I reply, that the
voyce of the Catholick Church, infallible, becauſe ever
built upon the teſtification of a world of immediate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Paſtours, equally aſcertain'd all who deſerted
not that Rule for that point, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Simon
the firſt</hi> ſignified not an onely-complementary but Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Primacie in the Church as it did aſcertain them, or
does the Proteſtants againſt the Socinians that the words
<hi>I and my Father are one</hi> ſignify an vnity in Divine Nature
or the Godhead: and the like I ſay of all other places of
Scripture which can be pretended to aſcertain it infallibly.
This voyce of the Church <hi>equally,</hi> I ſay, aſcertains one
point as the other; by which words I mean not but that
the latter point concerning Chriſt's Godhead is in it ſelf,
out of the nature of the thing, of more eminent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
neceſſity for ſalvation then the former; but my
meaning onely is that the teſtification, and recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, as comming from <hi>Chriſt</hi> is equall in the one, as
in the other, being indeed the ſelf fame. But perhaps Mr.
H. will deny the infallibility of immediate atteſtation
which ſometimes he grants at unawares (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 36.)
and will have it equally appear by Scripture. If ſo, then I
ſet an Anabaptiſt upon his back, arm'd with Dr. H's own
words, and let them ſcuffle for it. Vnles the ſame Chriſt
(ſayes the Anabaptiſt) appear as clearly from Scripture
to have commanded the Apoſtles to baptize little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115675:151"/>
which yet beleeve not, as to have ſent them to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize
beleevers (which 'tis certain appears not) it cannot
be ſaid with any ſobriety that an Infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ought to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
Thus Mr. H. trips up his own heels when he thought
to kick at <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and the Anabaptiſt getts the upper
hand. Or if Dr. H. runns to Tradition for the certainty of
one point, and denyes it's certainty for another, then he
is to be askt by the Anabaptiſt why he should in reaſon
rely upon that Authority which himſelf grants is taken in
aly in the point of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Primacy, and in all the other
points in which Catholicks differ from them? and alſo <hi>S.</hi>
W. muſt demand by what ſecurer Rule he guids him ſelf
when he affirms it hath err'd in ſome, and not in other
points, and why it may not perhaps erre in all if it can er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in any.</p>
               <p>But why muſt I bee accus'd of want of ſobriety, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguishing
without making the parts of my diſtinction
appear, and yet Dr. H. who is the Opponent, paſſe for
a <hi>ſober</hi> man though he ſays what he pleaſes at randome,
nay more, places in his confident ſelf affirmations the
ſumme of his whole Defence. He tells us here wee <hi>muſt
make it appear</hi> that this power was ſubjected to <hi>S. Peter;</hi>
but himſelf makes it not appear wee doe not, by any other
argument then this, that he aſſures the Reader within a
parentheſis, that <hi>'tis certain it appears</hi> not, what ill luck it
was that <hi>S.</hi> W. had not the forecaſt to ſay <hi>'tis certain,</hi> too
for then he had ſav'd his <hi>ſobriety,</hi> and all had been well.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſcious to him ſelf that all hitherto was eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
he would ſeem at length for fashions ſake, as it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
to touch the point; but ſeems onely, after his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed

and yet then he depended not on him.</hi> Attend Reader here
is a dreadfull ſentence pronounced againſt <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy;
for if, after it was given, it was no ways depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115675:152"/>
on <hi>S. Peter,</hi> all is loſt to <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Superiority. Firſt
I know thou wonderſt why, the point being ſo mainly
important, and Dr. H. having found a place of Scripture
to prove it from, expreſſely too, (as he tells thee) he
should not be larger in it citing thoſe expreſſe words, and
then making invincible arguments from them. To loſe
his advantage in ſuch circumſtances, onely relating haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the place, then touching it ſleightly, and not proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it home, nor indeed at all, but ſaying onely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
there upon, ſounds a betraying of his cauſe, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
prepoſterous fauour to his therein-befriended Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<hi>S.</hi> W. Secondly, thou mayſt obſerve, that there are
here two propoſitions; one, that <hi>the place Gal. 1. 17. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
expreſſely to the power after it was given:</hi> the other
that <hi>yet then he depended not on him.</hi> The firſt is pretended
from the Text, and expreſſely too. The ſecond is left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
(as his blinding manner is) whether it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Text, or by his own affirmation; If the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I muſt put it upon this ſcore of his <hi>'tis certain,</hi> and ſo
it needs no further anſwer; But, if it be pretended as from
Scripture, it shall have audience, and thou shalt hear it
examin'd. Thirdly, pleaſe to take notice that the Verſe
Gal. 1. 17. which he brings to teſtify his <hi>tenet expreſſely,</hi>
but, by omitting it ſlubberingly, bids it ſay nothing, is
this, as I find it in their own tranſlation. <hi>Neither went I
up to Hieruſalem to them which were Apoſtles before me, but
I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damaſcus.</hi>
And this is all: where wee hear no news of any <hi>power</hi> at
all, much leſſ <hi>expreſſely</hi> belonging to power; nay more,
<hi>expreſſely</hi> to the power <hi>after it was given,</hi> as Mr. H. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
us. Fourthly grant yet all this, that it belong'd <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
to the power after it was given,</hi> yet how does this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
prove that the power given was not dependent on <hi>S.
Peter</hi>'s as an inferiour degree to a ſuperiour, which is the
whole queſtion between us? Nothing is ſaid here but
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115675:152"/>
onely that <hi>S. Paul preach't in Arabia,</hi> &amp;c. ere he went
to the Apoſtles before him. The place there named by
him, taken in it ſelf, without relation to the other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
expreſſes nothing of <hi>power</hi> at all, but onely that <hi>S.
Paul</hi> went to other places ere he went up to <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi>
and, taken with other adjoyning Verſes, onely intimates
this, that <hi>S. Paul,</hi> having commiſſion immediatly from
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> had Authority, to preach to other places without
demanding firſt the other Apoſtles order, and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is both granted by us, and innocent to our
cauſe: but whether the <hi>power given</hi> were leſſe, equall, or
greater then <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s nothing is found there at all, much
leſſe doth the 17. Verſe it ſelf ſpeak of power, ſtill leſſe
doth it <hi>expreſſely</hi> belong to it; leaſt of all to <hi>power after
it was given, as imdependent on S. Peter,</hi> as Mr. H. braggs.</p>
               <p>To make this yet plainer, the Reader may pleaſe to
advert that there is no Catholick in the world but holds,
that, if our Saviour immediatly command a thing he may
be obayed without asking counſell, or leave of any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,
nay even againſt their contrary command, or
prohibition. Next, that our Saviour not onely could, but
did give immediate commands, and Commiſſions to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of different ranks; as to the Apoſtles, and Diſciples
to preach to the whole world; and to Philip the Deacon
to goeto convert the Eunuch Acts. 8. v. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 29. Theſe
things being ſo, all shadow of reaſon in Dr. H's diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevanishes,
which would conclude <hi>S. Paul</hi> independent
and of equall, and not ſubordinate power with <hi>S. Peter,</hi>
becauſe he had an immediate Commiſſion from <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and proceeded to act according to that Commiſſion wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
going to ask <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s leave firſt. The Diſciples,
having immediate order from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> preach't the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
without asking leave, or receiving approbation from
the Apoſtles. Were it not, now a worthy inference to
parallell Dr. H's and conclude that therefore the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:115675:153"/>
were of equall Authority with the Apoſtles. But Dr.
H. is ſo wary that he ſpeaks his non-ſence, ſleightly,
sprinklingly, and in brief, that, that lineaments of it not
being diſcovered, the deformity of it may not appear.
And this is the moſt frequent with him of all the reſt of
his ſly ricks, and in a manner naturall to his whole ſtrain
of writing.</p>
               <p>From Dr. H's reaſon, and Scripture teſtimonies wee
come to fathers to prove that the <hi>power given</hi> was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to, or dependent on <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s. He appeals to <hi>S.
Chryſoſtome</hi> for this point, <hi>affirming</hi> (as he layes it out)
of <hi>S. Paul diſtinctly,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>not needing Peter nor his voyce,</hi> The explication of
this place is already given here in the paragraph foregoing,
to which adde in particular, that if by voyce he means
Commiſſion, and order to preach; t'is clear he needed
it not, having received it immediatly from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of doctrine he needed not that neither, having
learned it fully and perfectly from Divine revelation; what
follows hence neceſſarily for <hi>equality of power</hi> wee ſee not,
and Dr. H. pretends here to prove it by no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then onely by telling us within a parentheſis that
<hi>he ſuppoſes it.</hi> Both the former interpretations then wee
grant each of them fits the words very well, whereas his
of <hi>equality of power</hi> is impoſſible to bee evinced from
this teſtimony, and inconſiſtent even with Dr. H's
grounds, as shall be shown.</p>
               <p>It follows, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>for</hi> I <hi>will ſay no more.</hi> Vpon which words
Dr. H. exults, <hi>which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what it is an intimation
of, I leave S.</hi> W. <hi>to conjecture.</hi> Nor is <hi>S.</hi> W. nice to tell him
his thoughts what <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> intimated by thoſe
words, to wit, that he could have ſaid more with truth,
but repreſt him ſelf as not willing out of reverence to tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115675:153"/>
Apoſtles to make compariſons of inequality between
them; which manifeſts plainly that <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> in that
place ſpeakes not of <hi>power</hi> at all, or equality in that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect;
ſince neither was it ever heard of that <hi>S. Chryſoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi>
or any els, no nor the moſt perverſe Proteſtants held
<hi>S. Paul</hi> above <hi>S. Peter</hi> in <hi>power;</hi> nor can it conſiſt with
Dr. H's own grounds, who Anſw. p. 43. l. 25. diſclaims
profeſſedly any ſuch pretence that any of the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
had greater Authority then <hi>S. Peter.</hi> Thus Dr. H.
thinking he had ſerved <hi>S. Peter</hi> and the Pope a trick, by
making <hi>S. Chriſoſtome intimate</hi> that <hi>S. Paul</hi> had greater
Authority then he; hath at once contradicted his own
grounds, and quite diſanull'd his own beſt teſtimonie;
rendring it impoſſible to relate to power, or Authority,
for which he produced it, unleſſe the opinion of the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
world, or (which is firmer and more inviolable) Dr.
H's. own word's bee a miſtake, aſſerting that <hi>no Apoſtle
had greater power then S. Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <hi>equall honour</hi> of thoſe two Apoſtles
it hath already been shown formerly from the father's

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
efficacity of preaching;</hi> and, in this place, both it, and
the <hi>not needing S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>voyce,</hi> relate onely to the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency

                  </gap>,
&amp;c. <hi>not as if S. Paul were to learn
any thing of S. Peter, &amp;c.</hi> And thus indeed the poſſibility
of <hi>S. Chryſoſtomes ſaying more</hi> of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> or that he was
<hi>more honour'd,</hi> and higher then <hi>S. Peter</hi> may have good
ſenſe; many holding that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was higher in learning,

on <hi>S. Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> whoſe judgment I

But,</p>
               <p>My firſt place (which I rather make choice of becauſe

it relates to <hi>S. Iames</hi> whom Dr. H. would make clearly Sue
periour to <hi>S. Peter</hi> in his own ſee) is taken out of Hom. 87.

ſubjoyns this interrogatory <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>If this be ſo how then came Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes

                  </gap>,
<hi>becauſe he ordaind him (S. Peter) not
Maſter of that ſeat, but of the whole world.</hi> Here wee ſee
the vaſt difference between <hi>S. Iames</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
one being Maſter of that private ſeat at <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
the other, <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>whole world;</hi> whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
evidently that neither <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Iuriſdiction is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by any other bounds then the world it ſelf is, and that
he had Iuriſdiction alſo at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> it ſelf, not after the
nature of the particular Bishop there, but of an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
Governour or Maſter of the world; unles perhaps
Mr. H will alledge that <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> is no part of the world;
for then indeed <hi>I</hi> shall not know how to reply. Neither
let him, as his cuſtome is, run to the Dictionaries, and
<hi>Lexicons</hi> to tell me that the proper ſignification of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is ſuch a <hi>Maſter as teaches</hi> or inſtructs, and ſo ſounds
no Government nor Iuriſdiction: for he muſt know that
that is the proper ſignification of the word as it is found
here which the circumſtances accompanying it determin
it to have. To them then let us look, the ſame word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
or <hi>Maſter</hi> is appropriated here to S. <hi>Peter</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the whole world, as it is to <hi>S. Iames</hi> in order to <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi>
it being expreſt but once, and in conſtruction,
refer'd to both. Since then, as applyd to <hi>S. Iames</hi> it ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies
his being <hi>Bishop of Hieruſalem,</hi> and ſo expreſſes
directly <hi>Iuriſdiction,</hi> and power of Government, it is
againſt all reaſon to ſay it can poſſibly ſignify another
thing as apply'd to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> According to this teſtimony
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115675:155"/>
then S. <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>univerſall Bishop</hi> of the Church, and of
an illimited Iuriſdiction. But perhaps Dr. H. will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the parentheſis in the teſtimony I anſwer I put down
the teſtimony here as I found it in the Greek Context ſet
out by themſelves and printed at Eton; and, though it
were left out, the ſence it ſelf putt's the oppoſition bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween
S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s being <hi>ſuch over the world,</hi> as <hi>S. Iames</hi> was
over <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which concerns commanding power,
and Iuriſdiction.</p>
               <p>My ſecond place is fech't from his comment on Act.
1. where, ſpeaking of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s behaviour about the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a new Apoſtle he hath theſe words; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>with good
reaſon doth the firſt (S. Peter) undertake the buſines with
Authority as having them all delivered into his hand.</hi> What
can this ſignify, but that he as <hi>firſt,</hi> and as a ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
had power over all the reſt that were preſent; and,
who were thoſe who were preſent? all the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and the chief of the Diſciples. In what other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he as firſt can be ſaid to have had all the reſt within
his hand, and therefore with good reaſon to have taken
the management of that buſienes <hi>authoritatively</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
I profeſſe I cannot in Dr. H's behalf imagine; and,
am perſwaded himſelf will confeſſ it (after peruſall of the
following teſtimony) that this was <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi>'s mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>The Third teſtimony which shall be alſo my laſt (for
I deem it impoſſible to finde another more expreſſe for
this, or any other point) is taken from the ſame place,
and ſpoken upon the ſame occaſion the election of ſome
one to bee Apoſtles, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>What then?
was it not in Peter's power to elect him? yes, it was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his power, but he does it not, leſt he might ſeem to do
it out of fauour.</hi> What can be more expreſſe and full? The
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115675:155"/>
thing to be performed was an Act of the higheſt Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
imaginable amongſt the Apoſtles, to wit, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a new Apoſtle. The other Apoſtles, and chief Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
were preſent to the number of one hundred, and
twenty; yet <hi>S. Peter</hi> had power to do this of himſelf in
their preſence Nor is this expreſt dubiouſly by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but as a thing certain and beyond all queſtion, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>yes altogether, abſolutely,</hi> or <hi>without doubt.</hi> Nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
wee here any divers Lections to diminish the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the words which the Dr. makes a pittifull and little
prevailing uſe of, in his lisping teſtimonies; nor is it a
word, or two pickt out blindly, and wreſted to a quite
different interpretation, as is his of diſcovered Method,
but a pithy expreſſion of the full ſcope, and import of
the place. Nor is this perfect expreſſion put alone, but
ſeconded with a note, that he did it not of his own ſingle
power, leſt he should bee miſtaken by others to make
ſuch a one, an Apoſtle <hi>out of favour;</hi> which is the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and ordinary carriage of every wiſe, and prudent
Governour. Nor do wee pretend to any higher ſtrain of
Iuriſdiction in <hi>S. Peter</hi> then that he could elect a new Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
by his own power which this father not onely grants,
but ſtrenuouſly aſſertes; nor! in our paralell <hi>tenet</hi> of the

                  </gap>lar
act, more ſupreme, or more ſavouring of higheſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
than to conſtitute Bishops and Patriarchs in the
Church by himſelf, and of his own particular power. Nor,
laſtly, was this teſtimony peep't out for in ſtrange places
but offred me by the ſame Author whom Dr. H. moſt
relies on, and in the ſame Treatiſe which he moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cites. Iudge then, Reader, whether it bee likely
or no that Dr. H. conſidering his induſtrious reading this
father and this Treatiſe (as he manifeſts here) could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
remain ignorant what was <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi>'s tenet in
this point, and then tell me what he deſerves who againſt

Whom though our Lord choſe to be the firſt of the Apoſtles,
and upon him built his Church, yet, when Paul contended
with him, he did not challenge, and aſſume to him ſelf any
thing, in any inſolent and proud manner, as to ſay he had the
Primacy, and ſo should rather be obeyed by new, and late
Apoſtles; nor did he despiſe Paul becauſe he had formerly
been a Perſecutor of the Church, but admitted the counſell of
truth.</hi> Dr. H. preparing to anſwer this place (Anſw. p. 46.)
notes firſt that <hi>this is the firſt teſtimony I have brought from

Opponent and defendent both; but as it was not my task,

imaginable. Next, he tells us that <hi>he never doubted</hi> S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
<hi>Primacy in the ſence this holy fathers ſpeaks, any more
than of Chriſts building his Church on him, and that he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
me a teſtimony even now from</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe which expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely
avouched it</hi> I remember indeed ſuch a Teſtimony
<hi>Anſw.</hi> 39 in the Margent, but I remember withall that
he brought it not, nay would not let it ſignify S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Primacy in any ſence over <hi>the whole Church,</hi> but over the
<hi>Iews onely</hi> as appears by the fourlaſt lines of the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge

gaves us a teſtimony from S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> which <hi>expreſſely
avoued</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Primacy</hi> in any ſence over the Church,

he had ſcarce writt eight lines after this profeſt
<hi>expreſſe avouching</hi> it but he quite forgets his ſo ſolemn
promiſe, and makes the ſaid place in <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> ſignify
a limited, and contradiſtinct Primacy ſaying that by the

is a good memory to defend a bad cauſe! Thirdly
he <hi>onely denyes</hi> (as he ſayes) <hi>that this Primacy gave him

indeed the words, but have quite forgot that he had
any reaſon to deduce from thoſe words equality of honor
ſprung from Government or <hi>power of command,</hi> having
shown from thoſe fathers explicating themſelves that it is
impoſſible the words can beare that interpretation. Fourt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hly,
in relation to thoſe words [<hi>he did not vindicate any
thing to himſelf inſolently, or aſſume it arrogantly, as to ſay
he had the Primacy, and rather ought to bee obeyed,</hi> &amp;c.]
Dr. H. diſcant's with this gloſſe, <hi>leaving us</hi> (ſaith he p. 47.)
<hi>to reſolve that if he had claimed any obedience at all from
Paul by this Primacy he could not have iuſtified it from arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
of aſſuming that which did not belong to him.</hi> Thus he:
ſoe that the difference between Dr. H. and mee in expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
this place ſtands thus; that he makes thoſe words
<hi>non vindicauit ſibi aliquid inſolenter aut arroganter aſſump ſit</hi>
to ſignify that <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s praiſe worthines expreſt conſiſted
in his not chalenging what did not truly belong to him;
whereas, I make it conſiſt in his not chalenging it in tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
circumſtances, though it truly belonged to him; he
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115675:157"/>
would have the words <hi>inſolenter</hi> and <hi>arroganter</hi> ſo taken as
if the pride they denoted did involve falſehood, injuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
or overweening; whereas I contend that they ſignify
onely <hi>in an inſolent</hi> and <hi>proud manner,</hi> well expreſt in our
English phraſe, by <hi>ſtanding upon his point,</hi> which well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
with the truth of what he challenges and the right of
what he aſſumes.</p>
               <p>Ere I deſcend to manifeſt that this is the ſence of that
place, I deſire the Reader to review the entire teſtimony,
in which he will do right both to my diſcourſe, and his own
memory; and, when he hath done this, I offer him for his
ſatisfaction theſe following notes.</p>
               <p>Firſt that it had been no ſuch great commendation of
humility to ſay that <hi>S. Peter</hi> did not uſurpingly challenge
what was not his right; but rather an impudence, and an
abſurd haughtines to have done it; ſince then the fathers
intend here a particular commendation of <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
it muſt conſiſt in this that though he might with
rigour of right have ſtood upon his tip-toes (as wee may
ſay) yet his goodnes ſo moderated his height that he was
content with mildenes to bear an inferiour's reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
in which great vertue is shown, and, which being
put, thoſe fathers ſuppoſe that truly he was Superiour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, unles this bee the meaning of that place, wee
have quite loſt the adverſative ſence which yet is unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable;
for what ſence is this, <hi>Though our Lord choſe him to
be the firſt, yet he did not challenge to himſelf more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to him;</hi> or what ſpeciall commendation do theſe
words import; Though King <hi>Iames,</hi> was King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
yet he did not challenge, or aſſume to himſelf to
bee Emperour of <hi>Germany?</hi> ſure it muſt bee an enuy of
<hi>S. Peter</hi>'s ſanctity as well, as of his dignity to diminish his
praiſe-worthines intended here by ſo frivolous and inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
an explication.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the words, <hi>non vindicauit ſibi aliquid inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115675:158"/>
he challenged not any thing inſolently to himſelf,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
good my explication; for, it had been a very hard ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
if he could have challenged nothing at all to himſelf
with truth according to theſe fathers; no not even that
which themſelves had granted, the line before, to wit,
<hi>that our Lord had choſen him to bee the firſt,</hi> and <hi>had built his
Church upon him;</hi> with truth therefore he might have
challenged that, which out of modeſty he ſtood not inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenty
and arrogantly upon.</p>
               <p>Fourthly Dr. H. grants that a Primacy at leaſt in ſome
ſence is granted <hi>S. Peter</hi> from this place: wherefore the
redditive part of the teſtimony; <hi>yet he challenged not any
thing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo as to ſay, he had the Primacy,</hi> muſt be granted
to bee true alſo, or rather it is the ſelf ſame. Neither is it
poſſible that any man not totally poſſeſt by prejudice can
imagine any other, but that in theſe words. <hi>Though our
Lord choſe him to bee the firſt, yet he ſaid not, or alledged
not that he had the Primacy, or was the firſt,</hi> the latter part
should be falſe unles the former were ſo too.</p>
               <p>Firfthly, this being ſo, the following words in the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive
part of the teſtimony <hi>and ought rather to be obey'd by
la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. muſt neceſſarily bee true too, ſince
they follow in the ſame tenour of redditive ſence to the
adverſative, and are joyned immediately by a copulative
particle to the former of <hi>having the Primacy.</hi> True there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is that he might in right expect <hi>obedience</hi> in other
circumſtances from <hi>S. Paul;</hi> and by conſequence this
<hi>Primacy</hi> here ſpoken of was not a dry and barren one as
the Dr. would fancy it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly the ſubſequent words of his not objecting to <hi>S.
Paul</hi> that <hi>he had been a perſecutour of the Church,</hi> make it
yet more evident; ſince he might with truth have ſaid ſo,
but of his goodnes would not; ſince then the foregoing
word's of his <hi>having the Primacy</hi> are true, and the follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
ones alſo of <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s having been <hi>a perſecutour</hi> are
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:115675:158"/>
true alſo, upon what grounds can this Adverſary of <hi>S Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
imagine that the midle words importing his <hi>rather
right</hi> to <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s obedience which run on in the ſame even
tenour with both the other should be falſe? or how could
he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hink to evade by deducing from thoſe words that the
<hi>fathers left us to reſolve hence, that if hee had claimed any
obedience from Paul by this Primacy he could not have iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
it from arrogance of aſſuming that which did not belong
to him;</hi> nay making this the ſumme of his anſwer to that
place.</p>
               <p>Laſtly the concluding words, [<hi>but admitted the counſell
of truth</hi>] expreſſing the reſult of the whole buſines, show
that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> plainly imports an <hi>Encomium</hi> of <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s candour;
that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thing objected againſt him was <hi>true,</hi> he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
not his own ſaying by Authority, but made his

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h of dignity, expreſt there to bee moſt eminent, ſtoop
to the ſincere acceptation of <hi>truth;</hi> which in a Superiour
and Governour is a moſt laudable carriage, and an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell'd
commendation. And thus Dr. H. comes of in anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering
<hi>S.</hi> W. firſt teſtimony; which being preſt ſpeaks mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
againſt him then was at firſt intended, being onely
brought to show that theſe fathers thought that manner
of carriage between <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> expreſt Gal. 11. ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
argued <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s greater humility then his leſſer, or
equall Authority.</p>
               <p>After Mr. H. had endeavoured by wreſting the former
teſtimony to win <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> to ſide with
him againſt <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Authority he proceeds to deſtroy
the Popes Authority in that Apoſtles, even from dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
teſtimonies alſo: His own canon law approved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly
by himſelf as legitimate shall ſecretly by Dr. H's
inſpiration play the Traitour, and under mine now in
theſe latter dayes the ſaid Authority which till now every
one took it to confirme. A ſtrange attempt, if Mr. H's
ſtrength were equall to his courage. The place is cited in
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115675:159"/>
the <hi>Decret.</hi> out of the 2. Epiſt. of Pope <hi>Anacletus,</hi> which
makes it yet more home and terrible againſt the now
adays-Popes, it begins thus: <hi>Poſt Chriſtum a Petro ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotalis
coepit ordo, After Chriſt the ſacerdotall order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
from Peter</hi> and ſoe goes on in other expreſſions of
that ſtrain ſoe far from prejudiciall that they are very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable;
and as for theſe firſt words, if wee look into the
Epiſtle it ſelf, it makes <hi>S. Peter</hi> the ſame in order to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Hierarchy, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was to the <hi>Leuiticall,</hi> which
wee account no small honour. He addes (ſaith Dr. H.)
that the Apoſtles, <hi>ipſum Principem eorum eſſe voluerunt,
would have him to bee their Prince;</hi> that is, conſented he
should bee ſuch; To which words Dr. H. ſubjoyns in a
parentheſis (<hi>where he read this I know not</hi>) Thus Dr H.
takes liberty to talk ridiculouſly, yet should I ſmile at
him a little he would excommunicate me again in Greek,
and his friends would be diſpleaſed. <hi>Anacletus</hi> lived in the
Apoſtles dayes, and (as he tell's us in the ſaid Epiſtle)
was ordained by <hi>S. Peter</hi> himſelf, yet Dr. H. finds fault
with this his aſſertion becauſe he knows not <hi>where he read
it.</hi> Chriſt, and his Apoſtles came not with books in their
hands, but with words in their mouths, to teach the world
their doctrine. Therefore Dr. H. should rather have ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
where he had <hi>heard it,</hi> then where he had <hi>read it,</hi> and
put the force of his exception there; and then wee could
have told him there was none in thoſe dayes for him to
hear but onely either <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his Apoſtles and Diſciples;
neither can wee doubt of his immediate converſation with
them, who was (as the ſame Epiſtle expreſſes) ordained
by <hi>S. Peter</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>Theſe preambulatory expreſſions favouring ſoe much
our cauſe would make one think that the ſame Author
could not bee ſo forgetfull, as to undo vtterly the ſame
Authority in the ſelf ſame Epiſtle, nay in the next line,
after he had calld S. <hi>Peter, Prince of the Apoſtles;</hi> nor that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115675:159"/>
                  <hi>Anacletus</hi> was ſuch a Courtier as to ſpeak thoſe former
kinde words onely for complement ſake, and afterwards
when it came to the point, immediately deny all: yet Dr.
H. expreſſes him here as ſpeaking firſt <hi>on the one ſide,</hi>
then <hi>on the other;</hi> and that when <hi>on the one ſide</hi> he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us the former favorable word's, the falſe tokens it
ſeems of otherwiſe-meant friendship, preſently (like Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery's
good cow which gave a good meal, and when she
had done kick't it down with her foot) <hi>on the other ſide,</hi>
as Mr. H. tells us, <hi>with equal clearnes</hi> he prevaricates from
what he had pretended, and over-throws <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
quite. The clear words (as he calls them) are
theſe, <hi>caeteri verò Apoſtoli cum eodem pari conſortio hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,
&amp; poteſtatem acceperunt. But the other Apoſtles in like
conſortship received honour and power with him.</hi> Which he
never explicates, nor applies (as his ſleighting cuſtome
is) but puts them onely down and then triumphs upon
them, as if they could not poſſibly bear any other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.
Whereas, I make account every good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
may grant theſe words without any difficulty, and
that they make nothing at all againſt us. For, to ſay that
<hi>the other Apoſtles received pari conſortio honorem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in
like conſortship honour, and power,</hi> does not infer that they
received <hi>parem honorem &amp; poteſtatem equall honour, and
power,</hi> but that as he had received it from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo they
<hi>pari conſortio,</hi> likewiſe, or <hi>in like manner</hi> as being his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
received it to. Again our <hi>tenet</hi> granting to each uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Iuriſdiction all over the world, grants likewiſe that
each preciſely under the notion of Apoſtle, that is, of one
ſent to preach <hi>Chriſts</hi> faith, had <hi>a like conſortship</hi> of honour
and power; each of them being dignify'd with an unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Apoſtleship, and Iuriſdiction or power to preach; but,
ſpeaking of the Apoſtolicall Colledge as a community
and ſoe requiring order of Government, wee affirm with
<hi>S. Hierome</hi> that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was ſupreme in that reſpect, nor
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115675:160"/>
is there any thing to the contrary found in this place.
Again, the words <hi>cum eodem</hi> appear by their placing to be
better joynd with <hi>acceperunt,</hi> then with <hi>pari;</hi> for then they
should rather have been put after it, <hi>paricum eodem,</hi> &amp;c.
and ſoe the whole place imports thus much, that though
our ſaviour choſe S. <hi>Peter</hi> to be firſt yet the reſt of the
Apoſtles <hi>acceperunt cum eodem received with him</hi> that is,
at the ſame time he received it, <hi>in like conſortship</hi> (that
is, of Apoſtleship (<hi>honour</hi> and <hi>power;</hi> which was verified,
when he in a common indifferent expreſſion after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
gave them their laſt and unlimited Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
miſſion, <hi>euntes in vniuerſum mundum praedicate Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium
omni creaturae. Going into the whole world preach
the Goſpell to every creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this it appears that the place may have another mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
than that which Mr. H. fancies; now that it muſt
have another, none but <hi>Anacletus</hi> him ſelf in the ſame
Epiſtle shall certifie us; who manifeſts himſelf as plain a
Papiſt in this point of the Pope's ſupremacy as either the
Cath. Gent. or <hi>S.</hi> W. Putting down there the orderly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of Eccleſiaſticall judicatures after that of Bishops
being to be judged by their Metropolitans he riſes higher
to that of Primates and ſtill higher to that of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
ſeat or the Pope's in theſe words. <hi>Primates tamen (vt
praefixum eſt) &amp; tunc, &amp; nunc habere iuſſae ſunt, ad quos poſt
ſedem Apoſtol cam ſumma negotia conueniant, yet the Cities
are order'd to have their Primates, to whom the chief buſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
(after the Apoſtolicall ſeat) may come.</hi> And a little

(Saluà Apoſtolicae ſedis authoritate) iuſtiſſimè termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentur.
And let the cauſes of Bishops, and the judgments of
the higheſt matters bee moſt, juſtly decided by them, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Apoſtolicall ſeat remaining unprejudic'd.</hi> By theſe
two places wee may take an eſtimate of Dr. H. ſolidnes,
and ſincerity, who catches at the shadow of a word, or two,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115675:160"/>
                  <hi>pari conſortio, in like conſortship,</hi> ſo waxen natur'd that they

thence argues <hi>ad hominem,</hi> againſt us that our own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and our canon law, are clearly oppoſite to our
doctrine; whereas he could not but know, and ſee in the
very ſame place that there was noe teſtimony imaginable,

he argues <hi>ad hominem</hi> in alledging theſe words, and ſoe it
imports not his cauſe at all what the Epiſtle it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſayes,

came to the ſame Citie, the one conſtantly apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the Iews, received Diſciples of ſuch, formed them into
a Church, left them when he departed that region to bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd

               <p>Now my words <hi>Schiſm Diſarm</hi> p. 62. upon his [<hi>Thus
wee knew it was at Antioch,</hi> &amp;c] were theſe. <q>That his
firſt teſtimony was his own knowledge <hi>Thus wee know,</hi>
&amp;c. but that he put down no teſtimony at all to confirm
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115675:161"/>
the weaker one, of his [<hi>wee know</hi>] which yet had been
requiſite, that wee might have known it too.</q> And this was
all. What railing words the Dr. find's here which should
make him complain ſo hainouſly, I know not, unles it
were that I calld the teſtimony of his own knowledg, <hi>weak;</hi>
and indeed if this be railing, deſpaire of learning more
courteſie till Dr. H. by growing wiſer teach me it. But my
predominant fault of an <hi>ill and frail memory</hi> for which sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
muſt make change colour is this, that I ſaid <hi>he put no
teſtimony at all to confirm the weaker one, of his: Wee know,</hi>
yet afterwards ſet down two teſtimonies of that, of which
I lately, denyed any. If hee means ſuch things as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
for teſtimonies, I ſet down indeed the very next Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
not onely <hi>two,</hi> but <hi>ten</hi> of them: But, if he means
ſuch teſtimonies as I expreſt my ſelf to deny there, that
is, ſuch as did confirm his own <hi>Thus wee know</hi> I am ſoe
far from blushing at it, that I ſtill make him this bold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that, if amongſt all the following teſtimonies there be
found any one word confirming his own <hi>Thus wee know,</hi>
and what it relates to, that is, making <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>excluſive</hi> to <hi>the Iews,</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s to the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
when they met at the ſame City but what himſelf adds of
his own head I will yeld him the whole controverſy. Nor
let him tell me what he fancies to bee deduced thence, but
what the teſtimonies themſelv's expreſſe; the deductions
are his, the words onely are the teſtimonies: let him show
me any one excluſive word in any <hi>one</hi> teſtimony, and I
profeſſe before all the world that I will not onely pardon
him the impertinency of the reſt, but alſoe grant him all.
Iudge now Proteſtant Reader, who hath moſt cauſe to
blush: examine well if ever thou heardſt ſuch a challenge
made to any writer yet extant, and not accepted of; and
then ſee to what a trifler thou truſteſt for thy ſalvation;
who in ſteed of replying to the purpoſe, and showing thee
thoſe excluſive words, tells his Adverſary that <hi>it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115675:162"/>
fault in him</hi> to chalenge him that he had <hi>never a
teſtimony to confirm his own: Wee know;</hi> and then, ſeing
himſelf unable to show any, thinks to evade by telling
his challenger, he ought to <hi>blush</hi> for his <hi>frail memory;</hi>
whereas he should rather have blam'd him for his bad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and bad eyes, neither apprehending nor
ſeeing a word in any teſtimony to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to his pretended teſtimonies I noted (<hi>Schiſm
Diſarm.</hi> p. 63.) that they affirmed no more but the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Church of Antioch by Peter, and Paul,</hi> which
<q>might be done by their promiſcuous endeavours wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
diſtinction much leſſe excluſion of Authority and
Iuriſdiction.</q> Dr. H. anſwers here; <hi>'tis true, this was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and if it had been true had manifeſtly prejudged S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
<hi>ſingular Iuriſdiction and clearly joynd Paul ſocially with
him.</hi> It is impoſſible to gett a poſitive word of ſence from
this man, firſt, he will never willingly uſe the common
words which expreſſe the queſtion between us, as <hi>chief in
Authority</hi> amongſt the Apoſtles, <hi>their Head, Prince,</hi> &amp;c.
but, as before he uſed the ambiguous phraſe of <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s
<hi>having noe ſingular ſupremacy at Hieruſalem,</hi> ſoe now he
recurr's to <hi>ſingular Iuriſdiction at Antioch;</hi> which being
doubleſenc'd if wee take it in one, he will be ſure to evade
hereafter by taking it in another. Secondly, let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him to mean honeſtly, that is to intend by it,
that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was not higher in Authority of Government
than <hi>S. Paul,</hi> as the queſtion determines it, let us obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
how this quodlibeticall reaſoner argues: his whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was to conclude againſt <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Authority in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
from his being excluſively limited to the Iews when
he met with <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the ſame Citie; and now here,
though he should grant their preaching in the ſame city
to have been promiſcuous, and indifferent both to Iews
and Gentiles, yet hee ſayes <hi>it manifeſtly prejudges</hi> S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
<hi>higher Authority</hi> ſtill: nothing can come wrong to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115675:162"/>
him let it be <hi>excluſive</hi> or <hi>not excluſive,</hi> ſtill either part of
the contradiction equally fitts his concluding faculty.
Dull Ariſtotle! Dull Schools, and Vniverſities who could
never light on this ſecure method of diſputing! Thirdly,
let us put this manifeſt proof into form, and it ſtands ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
thus <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> preach't promiſcuouſly
to the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> therefore <hi>S. Peter</hi> had manifeſtly noe
higher Authority then <hi>S. Paul.</hi> Good: did not <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Titus</hi> do the ſame in other places, were they therefore
<hi>equall</hi> in Authority? Fourthly obſerve theſe words, that
their promiſcuous preaching <hi>clearly joyn'd Paul ſocial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with him.</hi> Here again wee muſt give Dr. H. leave to
talk impertinently, and be content not to underſtand
him; for if he means that he was <hi>ſocially joyn'd with S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
as his fellow-Apoſtle, or fellow-labourer, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doubts it or imagins that it prejudices us: but, if he
means that he was equall in Authority what force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
can make theſe two ſo remote ends meet in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion:
he was his fellow-preacher, or preach't with him,

               <p>In anſwer to his dumbe teſtimonies which affirmed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul taught the Antiochians,</hi> and
<hi>founded the Church,</hi> there, I replyd <hi>Shiſm Diſar.</hi> p. 63.
<q>that this might have been done by the promiſcuous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors

48. to <hi>remove this might be,</hi> that is to shew it impoſſible
that they promiſcuouſly taught the Iews and Gentiles at
<hi>Antioch.</hi> His firſt argument is drawn from the <hi>Inſcription
of the Reſcript, which was directed to the Gentiles, ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Iews, that they should abſtain from things ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,</hi>
&amp;c. Let us not wrong the argument, but put it into
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115675:163"/>
form as it deſerves. The Reſcript was directed to the
Gentiles, and not to the Iews; <hi>ergo S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi>

in <hi>Antioch;</hi> what unſeen myſterious wires there are

beſides ſome others of another Sect, but they expreſſe
nothing at all of preaching, nor of promiſcuous, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
Authority over either; or if either be intimated
here it muſt be the former of promiſcuous Iuriſdiction
over the Gentiles, ſince the Reſcript was ſent to them as
well in the name of <hi>S. Peter</hi> (whom he will have onely
over the Iews there) as of <hi>S. Paul</hi> whom he places over
the Gentiles; yet this he calls <hi>an Evidence,</hi> introducing
his ſecond teſtimony thus. <hi>And beſides more Evidence
which therefollows Act 15. to the ſame matter,</hi> which as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant
wee muſt imagine he omitts and chuſes this
impertinent proof even now related for a more <hi>irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
Evidence</hi> than all the reſt. After this follows his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
proof againſt their promiſcuous preaching out of <hi>S.
Hierome</hi> as hee ſayes, <hi>Seorſim,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Churches which we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of the Iews were held a part, nor were mixed with thoſe
which were of the Gentiles.</hi> Which teſtimony in the ſpace
of four pages he makes uſe of thrice; and it deſerves to
bee made much of by Dr. H. for it is borrowed from the
Arch-heretick Pelagius, and falsly impos'd upon <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
as hath been shown largely heretofore Sect. 7. As
for the argument he makes from it wee shall do it the
right to put it into form alſo, which done, it ſtand's thus.
<hi>The Churches of Iews and Gentiles were held a part, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
S. Peter, and S. Paul could not impoſſibly preach both
to Iews and Gentiles,</hi> Thus Dr. H. undertakes to remove

<hi>Antioch</hi> impoſſible to have been promiſcuous, by ſuch
a <hi>Medium,</hi> as none can poſſibly imagine the neceſſary
connexion it hath with other termes. What forther reply

(<hi>Reply</hi> p. 61.) where he undertakes to anſwer it, recurs

               <p>See here, Reader, a patern of the Proteſtant manner
of writing in Dr. H's, which is to lay the whole force of
their proof upon any harsh-ſounding Text &amp; ſomething
difficult to explicate, though they know in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that there are an hundred nay a thouſand other Texts
expreſly againſt their pretence from that one. Two things
then I offer in anſwer to this objection; the one, that it
is the moſt abſurd poſition that ever blurr'd paper to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that the Iews were forbidden by the Iudaicall law to
conuerſe with or teach a Gentile. Next that, had it been
ſo, it had neither prejudiced us, nor availed Dr. H. in
order to theſe circumſtances at <hi>Antioch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the firſt, there is ſcarce any one point imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſo frequently contradicted in Scripture as is this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mr. H's. For, to begin with the law it ſelf, Leuit.
22. 10. <hi>There shall no ſtranger eat of the holy thing, a ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Preiſts, or an hired ſervant shall not eat of the holy
thing,</hi> where we ſee ſuppoſed that <hi>ſtrangers, ſojourners</hi> and
<hi>hired ſervants,</hi> which might not eat the paſſover, that is,
who were Gentiles, might live amongſt the Iews. And in
the 12. <hi>v.</hi> a much more difficult point is ſuppoſed, tow it,
of a <hi>Prieſts daughter marryed to a ſtranger.</hi> Again, 1. Kings
8. 41. 42. 43 Salomon prayes that <hi>all the people of the
earth may hear God's name,</hi> and that God would <hi>heare that
prayer of the ſtranger who cometh out of a farre countrey to
the houſe at Hieruſalem.</hi> So farre were they from abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to convert &amp; converſe with Gentiles as they expreſſe
themſelves zealous of both.</p>
               <p>Now as for examples of their converſing with Gentiles
there are ſo many of them recorded in holy writ, that I
know not where to begin to recount them. Spies ſent by
<hi>Ioſvah</hi> were deſigned to do it, <hi>Rachab</hi> the harlot, &amp; her
fathers houſe were ſaved &amp; lived with the Iews after they
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:115675:165"/>
had taken <hi>Iericho,</hi> particularly it is expreſſed by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
writer that <hi>she or herpoſteritie lived in Iſraël even to the
time he writ</hi> Iosh. 6. 25. <hi>Elias</hi> converſed nay lived in the
houſe with the widow of <hi>Sarepta, Elizeus</hi> with <hi>Naaman</hi>
the <hi>Syrian; Dauid</hi> lived with <hi>Achis; Salomon</hi> converſed &amp;
made a league with <hi>Hiram, 1. Kings.</hi> 5. 12. the <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi>
legates converſed with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the ſpartiatae
&amp; themſelves made a league with them without ever ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
at it, though they choſe rather to die then eat wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
flesh forbidden by the law, which manifeſts that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
with Gentiles was not <hi>equally</hi> (as Mr. H. affirms)
forbidden by the ſame law as the eating unclean meats.
The Iews converſed with Gentiles in captiuity, neither
do we hear of any expreſſion of abhominating their civil
ſocietie with them. Or that they broke Moſes his law in
ſo doing, or any one put to death upon that ſcore. Our
ſaviour expreſſes of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> that they did <hi>circuire ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras
&amp; Maria, goe about Sea &amp; land to make one Proſelyte,</hi>
which was impoſſible to be done without both <hi>converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
&amp; <hi>preaching.</hi> Innumerable other examples might be
gather'd out of Scripture of their converſing with Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
by one who thought ſo manifeſt a point worth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
clearing; and conſequently I cannot think that this
Folio-annotation Bible man could poſſibly be ignorant,
but that the contrary to this euading aſſertion of his built
upon one wilfully miſunderſtood place, was moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Nor was onely <hi>Moſes</hi> his law &amp; the whole ſtream of
Scripture-inſtances oppoſite to this new <hi>tenet</hi> of his, but
the poſition it ſelf is abſolutely implicatory, ſuppoſing
the lawfulnes to make a Proſelyte; for, how could a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
poſſibly come to be of the Iewish law without the
<hi>converſation</hi> &amp; <hi>inſtruction</hi> of ſome Iew. In a word, <hi>Dauid
commanded together the ſtrangers in the land of Iſraël, 1.
Chron.</hi> 22. 2. and, <hi>they were found,</hi> when <hi>Salomon</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered

them afterwards, to amount to <hi>one hundred fify three
thouſand ſix hundred 2. Chron</hi> 2. 17. and thoſe able men
fit to work, as appeares by <hi>v.</hi> 18. that is there were <hi>one
hundred fiftie three thouſand, ſix hundred ſtrangers,</hi> beſides
male-infants, boyes, very old men, &amp; the whole female
ſex, which in likelihood were as many as the men. Let
us then put them in all, as we can in reaſon iudge no leſſe
to amount to <hi>three hundred thouſand.</hi> Now, is it poſſible
that any but a mad man should imagin that either there
were none amongſt this vaſt number Gentiles ſtill, ſince
none was forced to be a Proſelyte, nor (as far as I ever
read) turned out of the countrey becauſe he would not
become of the Iewish law; can any imagin there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
amongſt this numerous multitude as yet a cathecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
(as we may ſay) and learning his duty when he should
become a Iew? or, grant them all to be Proſelytes and of
<hi>Moſes</hi> his law already, yet, can any man without having
great title to Bedlam think that three hundred thouſand
Gentiles were converted to <hi>Moſes</hi> his law &amp; became Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes
without any Iews very frequently both converſing
with them &amp; inſtructing them; or laſtly, that (conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
how ſtrict the Iews were in obſerving the law of
<hi>Moſes</hi>) this ſo frequent-converſation &amp; inſtruction <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unlawfull</hi> according to Dr. H. as eating any unclean
diet, could have been uſed, &amp; yet then no conſcience
made of it that ever we heard of; no prohibition of that
unlawfull cuſtome, no banishing the Gentiles from
amongſt them; but rather making their countrey a <hi>ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devous</hi>
for all to come that would; no reprehenſion, no
animadverſion, ſtoning <hi>&amp;c.</hi> uſed towards the practiſers of
this converſation with &amp; converſion of the Gentiles; but
it muſt be imagin'd that <hi>Moſes</hi> his law was publikely and
frequently, &amp; yet calmly &amp; quietly broken; and that, in
<hi>Dauids</hi> reign &amp; the beginning of <hi>Salomons,</hi> the pureſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of the Iewish Church, rather than a Proteſtant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115675:166"/>
one Dr. H. should fail in vindicating his unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld
abſurdity, that the Iews at <hi>Antioch</hi> had no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
at all, no not even civill converſation with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
their fellow-Chriſtians, becauſe they were forbidden
to do it by the Iudaicall law, of which they were zealous.</p>
               <p>Thus much for Dr. H's abſurdity of abſurdities that it
was forbidden by Moſes his law that the Iews should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
civilly converſe with or charitably endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
a Gentile. Now, put the caſe it had been thus <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,</hi>
&amp; thus <hi>unlawfull,</hi> what likelyhood was there
that the apprehenſion of that <hi>unlawfulnes</hi> should ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
at the time we ſpeak of, ſo as to make the Iewish
Chriſtians abhor ſtill all converſation with the Gentile
ones at <hi>Antioch.</hi> For this viſion of <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s, directing
his endeavours to preach to the Gentiles could not but be
univerſally known both by the occaſionall relating it, of
which there was great neceſſity by reaſon of the ſcandall
which that nouelty cauſed at firſt, as alſo by it's effects,
the converſion of multitudes of Gentiles which enſved
thereupon. Grant then that the action was accounted
ſcandalous to all that heard it, &amp; that this viſion of <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
iuſtify'd it, &amp; him for doing it, it cannot be imagind
but that this relation of his viſion was ſpread far &amp; near
amongſt the Iews with whom he converſed, ſpecially Dr.
H. granting that when <hi>S. Paul</hi> met him not he preacht
both to <hi>Iews</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he was obliged to publish the
ſaid viſion as a warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table excuſe of his and the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
frequently preaching to the latter. Again, we read
that thoſe that were ſcandalized at <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s converſing
with the Gentiles Act. 11. after he had cleared himſelf, &amp;
related his viſion expreſt their full ſatisfaction by <hi>holding
their peace &amp; glorifying God for it v.</hi> 18. Now then I argue,
either the Iews at <hi>Antioch</hi> were in like diſpoſition of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
to be ſcandalized, ſeeing <hi>S. Peter</hi> converſe with Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
there, Gal. 2. or not: if not, then there is no ground
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115675:166"/>
why Mr. H. should thinke that the Iewish Chriſtians
there held it <hi>unlawfull</hi> to converſe with the Gentile ones;
if they held it unlawfull, then I ask again upon what grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
can Dr. H. think that <hi>S. Peter</hi> should not (as he was
obliged) endeavour to ſatisfy them that it was God's will
by declaring his viſion to them alſo aſwell as he did to the
Iews at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> Act. 11. Or why he should conceit that
the Iews at <hi>Antioch</hi> were ſo incomparably more unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
than the others, that whereas thoſe at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>
though at firſt ſo hott as to <hi>contend</hi> with <hi>S. Peter</hi> about it
Act. 11 <hi>v.</hi> 2. yet remaind ſo perfectly ſatisfied by <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
diſcourſe as to <hi>glorifie God. v.</hi> 18. thoſe at <hi>Antioch</hi>
should perſiſt ſtill obſtinate &amp; unſatisfied, &amp; not give any
credit at all to their Apoſtle and according to Mr. H. their
onely Governour, <hi>S. Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, ere this conteſt happen'd at <hi>Antioch</hi> about
eating the Gentile diet, it was no new matter, which is
that which cauſes ſcandall, but a publike &amp; known thing
that the Gentiles were convers't with &amp; preach't too,
Act. 11. <hi>v.</hi> 1. we read that <hi>the Apoſtles &amp; Brethren which
were in Iudea heard of it,</hi> v. 20. that <hi>ſome who were of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus
and Greece preached to the Grecians in Antioch,</hi> v. 22.
that <hi>when the Church at Hieruſalem heard of it, they ſent
Barnabas</hi> (to them) to <hi>Antioch</hi> for the ſame end: So that
ſee how the Church of the Iews further'd &amp; promoted
the preaching to the Gentiles, ſo far were they from being
now ſcandalized at it. After that, <hi>Barnabas brought Paul
alſo thither,</hi> &amp; <hi>they preach't there one whole year,</hi> v. 26. and
more particularly to the Gentiles, as Dr. H. grants, at
leaſt promiſcuouſly none ever deny'd; nor did this year
onely intervene (ſufficient time to let the Iews in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
city know that the Gentiles might be convers'd with
&amp; preach't to) but many more ere the controverſy about
the Gentile diet happen'd, as may eaſily be gather'd from
the 2. chapter to the Gal: it being expreſt there to have
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:115675:167"/>
been fowerteen years at leaſt after S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s converſion,
which is related, Act. 9. immediately before the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Act. 10.</p>
               <p>Now, as for other particulars <hi>Philip</hi> had preached to
the Eunuch a Gentile. Act. 8. 35. and in <hi>Samatia,</hi> Act. 8.
5. and in the ſame Chapter <hi>v. 25. S. Peter</hi> alſo with him
preacht the Goſpell in many villages of the <hi>Samarians.</hi>
Yet Dr. H after all this publike preaching to Gentiles &amp;
Samaritans, avowed to be lawfull by the ſo long &amp; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
practice &amp; doctrine of the chiefeſt Apoſtles &amp; pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of Chriſtianitie, and (which is worth noting) moſt
ſolemnly &amp; openly profeſt &amp; exerciſed at <hi>Antioch</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
will yet after all this have the Iewish Chriſtians
in <hi>Antioch</hi> ignorant that it was lawfull to converſe with
or preach to a Gentile; And all this, becauſe rather then
he will yeeld to the plaineſt truth, there is no paradox ſo
abſurd, ſo non-ſenſicall &amp; contradictory, but he thinks
it worth his patronage, ſo it yeelds him the mutuall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
of any ſorry evaſion, when he is taken in a falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
or ſome other unavoidable weaknes.</p>
               <p>But, though nothing elſe could bridle Dr. H. from
ſuch extravagancy of inſincerity &amp; weaknes, yet, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
much his own words could not curb him, &amp; make
him if he needs would run the Maze, to do it at leaſt with
in his owne liſts. His owne words which occaſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

debate, <hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 75 are theſe, <hi>we read of S. Peter &amp;
the Iewish Proſelytes, Gal 2. 11. that they withdrew from
all Communion &amp; Society with the Gentile Chriſtians.</hi> Now,
if they <hi>withdrew</hi> from all Communion &amp; Society, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they <hi>had</hi> &amp; uſed <hi>formerly</hi> both Communion &amp; So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
with them; elſe, how could they be ſaid to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw</hi>
from it; yet this Patron of Proteſtantiſm from whom
'tis impoſſible to get a word of ſence or ſincerity, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
he both corrupts other mens ſayings &amp; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
his own, will have them <hi>never</hi> to have <hi>had</hi> at all, that
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:115675:167"/>
from which he tells us they <hi>withdrew;</hi> ſince they were
equally zealous of <hi>Moſes</hi> his law, <hi>before</hi> as <hi>after</hi> the breach,
by which law he aſſures us it was forbidden ſo much as to
converſe with a Gentile.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, is it poſſible that paſſion should inveigle any
man of reaſon to ſuch a ſtrange conceit, as to imagin
that, each party being Chriſtians, they should avoid even
courteous or civill commerce one with another: or, that
the Apoſtles would have countenanced by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
ſuch an uncharitable carriage? But is this all? let
us ſee between whom this <hi>all-Communion</hi> was broke;
between two Churches; and by whom? by <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; his
Iewish Proſelytes: Now, ſince <hi>Schiſm</hi> is formally &amp; point
blank counterpos'd to <hi>Vnion</hi> &amp; <hi>Communion</hi> between
Churches, if <hi>all-Communion</hi> be broke between thoſe
Churches, it is a perfect contradiction in terms, to ſay
there is not a <hi>Schiſm</hi> made between them: And, ſince it
was <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; his Iewish Proſelytes who behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>actively</hi> in this point, it follows by moſt abſolute
&amp; neceſſary conſequence, that they muſt be all Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and Bleſſed S. <hi>Peter</hi> their Ringleader. But 'tis no
matter with him; rather shall <hi>S. Peter</hi> inſtead of being
Head of the Church, be an Head of Schiſmaticks, than
Dr. H. be acknowledged a Schiſmatick &amp; a falſifier: and,
not onely the Authority but alſo the Sanctity of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Apoſtle be ſacrific'd to the Proteſtant intereſt, rather
than ſo great a Patron of theirs, and ſo ſaintly a falſifier
shall want an evaſion to ſoder his crack't credit. Neither
let Dr. H. think to eſcape making S. <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; his Iewish
converts <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> by ſaying that this was <hi>a prudent
managery</hi> onely (<hi>Rep.</hi> p. 62.) &amp; ſo iuſtifiable by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
circumſtances; ſince it is moſt undeniable that the
<hi>breaking of all Communion</hi> with another <hi>Church</hi> is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
Act of Schiſm; &amp; then, let him remember his own
grounds layd againſt himſelf in his firſt Chapter <hi>of Schiſm</hi>

p. 10. that <hi>the matter of fact onely</hi> is to be <hi>conſidered</hi> not <hi>the
cauſes or motives.</hi> Since <hi>eo ipſo</hi> that fact is Schiſm, nor can
be iuſtifi'd from being ſuch by any cauſes, motives, or
circumſtances what-ſoever; Now then, ſince the fact of
breaking from <hi>all-Communion</hi> which the Gentile Church,
that is <hi>of Schiſm</hi> from it is in expreſſe terms imputed to
<hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; his Iewish Proſelytes by Dr. H. I expect then
what poſſible motive this Author can pretend to alledge
ſufficient to excuſe them from <hi>Schiſm,</hi> whoſe doctrine it
is in the place cited that no motive or reaſon was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

iuſtify it from being <hi>Schiſm,</hi> nay damnable, worſe then
ſacriledge, Idolatry, &amp;c. as the fathers there cited by
D H. avouch.</p>
               <p>The ſumme then of this part of Dr. H's defence is,
that he takes no notice at all of his falſifying by adding
the onely important &amp; large-ſenc't word <hi>All</hi> to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
nor attempts to clear himſelf of it; but, inſtead of
doing this, he goes about to maintain his poſition coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
to be found there to wit, that <hi>Iewish Chriſtians
withdrew from all-Communion with the Gentile ones,</hi> by
this argument that it was <hi>equally forbidden</hi> by Moſes his
law to converſe with or preach to a Gentile, as to eate
their diet. A paradox ſo incomparably &amp; notoriouſly
abſurd, that it is at once both perfectly oppoſite to the
law it ſelf, repugnant to innumerable examples from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to the contrary, &amp; the univerſall practice of the
Synagogue; injurious to the Iewish Church in it's pureſt
times, making them frequently, publikely &amp; uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolledly
break the law in a point (as he ſaies) <hi>equally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden</hi>
as eating the Gentile diet; implicatory in terms,

univerſall Tradition of the foregoing Church, importing,
involving &amp; bringing downe to us all imaginable motives
of the contrary truth evidence that Interpretation to be

as hath amply been shown.</p>
               <p>Now as for <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s words that it was <hi>unlawfull for a
man that was a Iew to keep company or come to one that is of
ther Nation,</hi> upon which onely he build his poſition,
otherwiſe altogether deſtitute of any shadow of proof. I
anſwer, that the Scribes &amp; ſuch like pretenders to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſer
Kinde of holines, had lately introduced many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
of their owne forging, under the notion of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
(of ſome of which they are accuſed by our ſaviour)
and obtruded them upon the conſciences of the Iews to
be religiouſly obſerved; eſpecially at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devous
of Iewish Doctors, and the place where their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
had more immediate influence upon the mindes of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115675:169"/>
of thei Auditors. Of thoſe preciſe cuſtomes this was one,
of not going to a Gentiles houſe, or converſing with
them. To this, amongſt others, <hi>S. Peter</hi> was inured by
long education, in ſo much that though he heard our
B. Saviour with his own mouth give them commiſſion
to go to preach all over the world, <hi>in vniuerſum mundum</hi>
and <hi>omni creaturae, to every creature;</hi> yet, finding employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough amongſt thoſe of the Circumciſion, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
attempted it till by a viſion he was immediately ſet
upon it by Almighty God, eſpecially the obligation to
his country laying a ſtronger ty upon him, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
order to preach firſt to the Iews untill they shew'd
themſelves unworthy, he needed a viſion to tell him when
that time came, &amp; circumſtances were ripe for it. In li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
manner we read that <hi>S. Paul,</hi> though choſen particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to preach to the Gentiles, Act. 9. 15. yet he affirmed,
Act. 13 46. that it was neceſſary that the words of God
should firſt have been ſpoken to the Iews, &amp; did not turn
to the Gentiles but upon their rejecting him.</p>
               <p>By unlawfull then in this place I take not to bee mean't,
not <hi>againſt the law of Moſes;</hi> but, what their Teachers
and Doctors, who govern'd their Conſciences, bore them
in hand was unlawfull: in the ſame manner as wee now
call many things <hi>unlawfull,</hi> which are not found forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by Chriſt's law, but which our Doctours and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts
iudge to bee unlawfull. Again, wee read that though
<hi>the Apoſtles and Brethren that were in Iudea had heard that
the Gentiles had received the word of God.</hi> Act. 11. v. 1. yet
the ſecond verſe letts us know of none that found fault
with him ſave thoſe at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> onely; and that, not
meerly upon the account of going to the houſes of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
but of <hi>eating with them</hi> alſo, as the third verſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes.
But let their zeal have been never ſo hot to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this new-fangled apprehenſion, and let it bee never
ſo univerſall to abhorre the converſation of Gentiles,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115675:169"/>
whiles they remain'd Gentiles; yet, it is the ſtrangeſt fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that ever entred into a rational head, to imagin that
they should ſtill retain the ſame uncharitable feud to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them after they were become Chriſtians and their
fellow-Brothers in him, in whom they were taught the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
was no diſtinction of Iew nor Gentile. Which ſounds a
far greater abſurdity in a Chriſtian eare, than to ſay that
they likewiſe abhorr'd ſtill the converſation of the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes
to the law of Moſes after their converſion; &amp; that
thoſe one hundred fifty three thouſand workmen who
lived diſperſed among the Iews in Salomon's time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
converſt with their neighbour Iews, nor took dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

               <p>Foure obſervations I shall recomend the Reader to let
him ſee that this inſincerity in Dr. H. was affected &amp; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.
Firſt, the words in the teſtmony importing their

Next, all the words added of his own head are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

Thirdly, that he never particulariz'd the place in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
where this teſtimony was to be found, which he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily

Laſtly, he ſo iumbles together the two different letters (as
his comon trick is) that no man living can make any
gheſſe which words are the teſtimonies, which his own;
and, should we pitch upon any to be the teſtimonies, rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the tranſlation letter, in that part <hi>they ſate at the
ſame time Bishops,</hi> we finde the moſt conſiderable word
<hi>ſame</hi> put in a leſſe letter, as if it were part of the citation,
whereas no ſuch word nor any thing to that ſence was
found in the Author. And thus Dr. H. (as he profeſſes

               </p>
               <p>But inſtead of clearing himſelf from being an arrant fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifier,

us the pretended words in his <hi>teſtimony,</hi> he recurs to the
<hi>defence</hi> of the <hi>poſition</hi> it ſelf. And firſt he cries quits which
the Catholike Gentleman who, as he tells us in a drie
phraſe (<hi>Repl. Sect. 7. num. 1.) caſts one ſtone at all his buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
together.</hi> And what <hi>ſtone</hi> is this? He challenged him
not to have brought one word out of Antiquity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
the <hi>with drawing from all Communion</hi> (already ſpoken
of) to have been the cauſe of the diviſion of the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priks
in <hi>Antioch</hi> &amp; <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Catholike Gentleman's <hi>ſtone,</hi> as he calls it,
which levell'd by him at ſuch an impenetrable Rock of
ſolid reaſon as Mr. H. rebounds upon the thrower's head
with this violence.</p>
               <p>Firſt that <hi>he manifeſted from Antiquity in his book of
Schiſm that the Church of Antioch was founded by S. Peter
&amp;</hi> S. <hi>Paul, Repl.</hi> p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 63 I anſwer, 'tis graunted; but what
is this to the point; ſince this might eaſily be performed
by their <hi>promiſcuous</hi> preaching, without excluſion of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,

               <p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:115675:171"/>
Secondly, that he <hi>manifeſted there,</hi> that there were two
Churches at <hi>Antioch, the one of the Iews the other of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Chriſtians.</hi> I anſw. he hath not one teſtimony in the
whole book <hi>of Schiſm</hi> which expreſſes this poſition nor in
theſe later books, ſave onely that from the Arch-heretick
<hi>Pelagius,</hi> already reply'd to, <hi>Sect</hi> 7</p>
               <p>Thirly that <hi>in thoſe Churches at the ſame time ſate two
diſtinct Bishops, Euodius &amp; Ignatius.</hi> I anſwer this is onely
prou'd from his owne falſification of the teſtimony from
the Apoſtolicall Conſtitutions; not a word of the <hi>fitting

               <p>Now let us ſee what Dr. H. who braggs ſo much of a

upon in this his Anſwer to <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd:</hi> in which
Treatiſe, p. 66. I objected all theſe weakneſſes in this
one point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that were it granted that two <hi>ſate together</hi> it would
not ſerve his turn a iott the more. For what would he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
hence? that <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi> were diſtinct Bishops
there alſo? Grant this too, what follows hence againſt the
Pope's Authory? I know his intent is to conclude here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
that, therefore <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi> had excluſive
Iuriſdictions at <hi>Antioch,</hi> therefore <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Iuriſdiction
was limited, therefore the Pope had not an illimitted one:
but how doth the one's preſiding over Iews the other over
Gentiles argue a limitation of that power it ſelf, or at all
neceſſarily touch the interior Right? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uppoſe I should
deny his conſequence, &amp; uſing Dr. H's word (<hi>Repl.</hi> p.
62. upon a like occaſion at <hi>Antioch</hi>) ſay that this might
have been onely <hi>a prudent managery, a wiſe ordering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
by S. Peter &amp; S. Paul;</hi> I wonder how he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115675:171"/>
with his argument &amp; prove his conſequence that it
was intended for a reall not ſeeming counter-Iuriſdiction.
I am ſure as yet he hath not produced any thing at all to
diſannull this inſtance of his arguments in conſequence,
nor ſtrengthen'd his proof againſt this obvious pretence
that it might have been thus otherwiſe. Again, was there
not room enough in <hi>Antioch</hi> (and the like may much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be ſaid of <hi>Rome</hi>) for two to preſide &amp; preach in? could
not they divide the City into two halves for the better
convenience of their Auditours coming promiſcuouſly to
hear their doctrine, but there muſt neceſſarily be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of the Iewish &amp; Gentile <hi>caetus,</hi> the Iewish <hi>under
one</hi> &amp; the Gentiles <hi>under tother,</hi> as Dr. H. expreſſes it
<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 48. lin. vlt.) telling us there that <hi>there could not
be two Bishops in Rome without this diſtinction.</hi> Further, let
us ſuppoſe that the Iewish Chriſtians would not mingle
with the Gentiles in the exerciſe of divine worship where
there was this ſcandalizing diverſity of their ceremonies
(for I cannot think that, holding them their fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
they should be ſo uncharitable as to abhorre their
Communion as much as if they had been excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, or as if they had ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
Heathen as Dr. H. contends) yet I ſee no impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
that <hi>S. Peter</hi> in his half of the City should ſome
times go to Iewis Congregation, ſometimes to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile;
&amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi> do the like in his; So that ſtill Dr. H's
ſupple bow of reaſon is farre from carrying home to his
mark, or concluding what he purpoſed. Nor let him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that this diſtinction of the City into two parts, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
excluſion of Iuriſdiction when they met: It infers no
more but that they acted prudently in ſo doing, &amp; ſo as
no wiſe man can be imagind' willing to do otherwiſe; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
common ſence teaches us that if two Preachers come
to one City &amp; each be able to perform his office without
the aſſiſtance of the other, it were the height of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:115675:172"/>
not to ſeparate themſelves &amp; preach a part; nay &amp;
to show a particular care, affection, &amp; over ſight towards
their own converts, and to let them know 'twas conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
they should continue rather with him wtih whom
they had begun. And this shall ſerve for an Anſwer to
his liſping teſtimony out of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> that <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp;
<hi>S. Paul were Bishops in Rome.</hi> Which Dr. H. Anſw. p. 48.
relies upon as a buſines <hi>whoſe force it is not poſſible S.</hi> W.
<hi>should dicert;</hi> though neither it nor any teſtimony elſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

was at Antioch.</hi> But to return to his prudent neglects.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly he was told, that the teſtimonies alledged
by himſelf out of <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> calling <hi>Ignatius</hi>
the ſecond, &amp; out of <hi>S. Ierome</hi> calling him the third,
make againſt the ſitting of thoſe two together, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
&amp; important pretence.</q> Yet he never anſwers theſe
ſelf oppoſed teſtimonies; but inſtead of doing ſo adds
two more <hi>Reply</hi> p. 63 out of <hi>Simeon Metaphraſtes</hi> &amp; an
<hi>Anonymus ancient writer,</hi> to witnes the ſame &amp; confirm
my objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly he was told that he will never finde <hi>S. Paul</hi>
was accounted a parcell-Bishop in <hi>Antioch</hi> that he
should have a properly call'd ſucceſſor there, &amp;c. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which, he offers us no reply ſave onely his owne

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fourthly that he undid all he had ſaid with a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> which affirm'd in expreſſe oppoſition to
his former place out of the Apoſtolicall Conſtitutions,
that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was ordain'd by S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </q> To which oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
teſtimony inſtead of anſwering, he (ſeconds it with a
another <hi>Reply</hi> p. 63. <hi>lin. vlt.</hi>) was ever ſuch a diſputant
heard of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:115675:172"/>
                  <q>Laſtly, it was objected that the Apoſtolicall Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
upon which he builds, was a book excepted
againſt by all ſides; &amp; <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who oppoſes it in this
point, was an Author beyond exception, and that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
wee have far more reaſon to iudge that <hi>S. Peter</hi>
ordain'd <hi>Ignatius</hi> alſo then <hi>Evodius</hi> onely.</q> Whence I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
deduce that if, in the Drs. grounds, <hi>Ignatius</hi> were over
the Gentiles, &amp; ordain'd by <hi>S. Peter,</hi> as <hi>Theodoret</hi> his
better Author teſtifies, <hi>S. Peter</hi> by conſequence was over
the Gentiles alſo in <hi>Antioch.</hi> Now what reply attempts
Dr. H. againſt an objection which enervates all the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
Authority he relies on &amp; shows him baffled in his own
teſtimonies? not a word: yet, he tells us in Greek that
he attends his aduerſaries <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>ſtep by ſtep;</hi>
though hee ſtill auoids him then moſt warily, when his
<hi>attendance</hi> is moſt neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Nothing therefore hath Mr. H. reply'd to thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Exceptions of mine, nothing to his own teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in particular, though shown to have been againſt
him. Yet ſomthing he muſt ſay to every thing in one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or other; that's reſolu'd; except it be to shew the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying
words in a teſtimony where they are not found, in
which caſe he is wiſely ſilent His argument from theſe
contradictory places is founded (<hi>Repl.</hi> p. 64) in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
them and making them friends; the <hi>difference</hi> he
tells us is but <hi>ſeeming</hi> &amp; he goes about to <hi>remove</hi> it; which
way of arguing, in the firſt place is perfectly abſurd, unles
he firſt prove the neceſſity of each teſtimonies being true,
which he never attempts; otherwiſe, to go about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
a truth by reconciling falshoods, or truths with fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoods,
is ſuch a new inuention or arguing, that Dr. H.
hath all the right &amp; reaſon in the world to get a Patent of
it, that none should uſe it without his licence. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Authority of the Apoſtolicall Conſtitutions is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowled'gd
to be corrupt by the Proteſtants themſelves;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115675:173"/>
&amp;, conſequently, unles he vindicate firſt that his main
teſtimony fetc'ht thence is true, for any thing he knows
he goes about to reconcile a truth with a falshood; at leaſt
<hi>Theodorets</hi> Authority ſtanding againſt it, it is iuſtly preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be ſuch, which makes Dr. H's plea for his ſaid
Patent ſtronger. Thirdly is it ſuch news that Authors
should be of ſeverall opinions? or, was there ever Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
till Dr. H. who held ſo, even of the fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
yet, contrary here to his own Grounds, he will
have none of them miſtaken though they contradict one
another; he hath inuented a fancy how to reconcile their
ſayings, ere he knows or proves whether they were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
or no in an obſcure matter of fact done long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their time. Nor cares he what this reconcilement of
contradictions coſts, though it make all Antiquitie blind,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 79. l. 12. gave light to the world, yet as long
as he can by ſcrewing &amp; wreſting make them favour his
cauſe, he is a man of peace &amp; contradictions shall shake
hands and bee friends.</p>
               <p>But who is the Vmpire to decide this contradiction-quarrell?
one, God knows whom, called <hi>Ioannes Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
Antiochenus:</hi> and the teſtimony from him is found in a
manuſcript in <hi>Oxford</hi> Library: that is, we may goe look
it God knows where. Yet we will truſt Dr. H. for once in
a teſtimony not extant, who hath deceived us ſo often in
thoſe which were publike &amp; eaſie to be examined, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
the place as we find it by himſelf. <gap reason="foreign">

expreſſe againſt this very point in controverſie and that

his proof. See his booke <hi>of Schiſm.</hi> p. 75. l 26. 27. where

<hi>Bishoprick</hi> in the ſingular, <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Patriarch</hi>
in the ſingular; whereas Dr. H. all over makes it his who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
deſign to prove Bishops, two Bishopricks at once in
the ſame City. Obſerve the word <hi>Patriarch,</hi> &amp; ask Dr. H.
whether he thinks in his conſcience there were two <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi>
at <hi>Antioch</hi> one over Iews, another over Gentiles,
or where ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he even preten'd to have read or heard of ſuch
an abſurd <hi>tenet.</hi> In a word there is ſcarce any propoſition
affirm'd by Dr. H. in order to this preſent point, but finds
here it's expreſſe contrary; and yet he brings this as the
upshot of all his proofs, and as that where in he mean't
to make all ends meet; introducing it here in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
terms, (<hi>Repl.</hi> p. 64. l. 2. 3.) that <hi>the ſeeming diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
of his former teſtimonies <hi>is removed by Io. Malela
Antiochenus, who thus ſets down the whole matter:</hi> whereas
indeed the matter he <hi>ſets down</hi> is wholy contrary to Mr.
H. Does this man care a pin with what falſe pretences he
mocks his Reader &amp; abuſes his very eyes?</p>
               <p>But was there no deſign in alledging this teſtimony, or
can he make it, though quite contrary to his <hi>tenet,</hi> ſerve
his turn for nothing? yes; for, there is nothing ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to Dr. H's doctrine in it's ſelf, but by cooking
it up hand ſomely he can make his advantage of it. He
wedges in two parentheſiſſes of his own in the middle of
the teſtimony and then all is evident: The teſtimony then,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115675:174"/>
as by him put down, ſtands gaping thus; <hi>when Peter went
to Rome paſſing by Antioch the Great, Euodius Bishop &amp;
Patriarch of Antioch happen'd to dy, and Ignatius</hi> (who was,
<hi>as was ſaid,</hi> firſt conſtituted by S. Paul over the Gentiles
there) <hi>received the Bishoprick</hi> (that, <hi>I ſuppoſe,</hi> muſt now
be of the Iewish Province alſo, over which <hi>Euodius</hi> had
been in his life time) <hi>S. Peter ordaining &amp; enthroning
him.</hi> Now, as for the teſtimony it ſelf, taken alone it is
expreſly againſt him, as hath been shown; the onely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
&amp; force of it lies in the <hi>parentheſiſſes;</hi> and if we examin
theſe, the totall ſtrength of the firſt lies in the words, <hi>as
was ſaid,</hi> that is, by himſelf, for he hath produced as yet
never a teſtimony which ſays <hi>Evodius</hi> was conſtituted by
<hi>S. Paul</hi> over the Gentiles; the ſole force of the latter <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis</hi>
lies in the all-conquering, <hi>I ſuppoſe,</hi> which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<hi>gratis,</hi> and without all show of any Ground either
in Antiquitie or comon ſence, as hath been largely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted.
And ſo by this mean's, we have gotten two other
very ſtrong teſtimonies to confirm his own <hi>we know;</hi> to
wit, <hi>as was ſaid</hi> and, <hi>I ſuppoſe;</hi> nor have we one expreſſe
word from any teſtimony ſave from his <hi>own knowledge,
his own ſaying,</hi> and <hi>his owne ſuppoſitions.</hi> The reſult is that
this teſtimony, the upshot &amp; knot of all the reſt, is it ſelf
abſolutely againſt him, and onely brought to countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
his <hi>parentheſiſſes,</hi> not with it's influence, but with it's
preſence; So that his teſtimonies are as it were the Stock
upon which he ingrafts his owne ſayings either in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
by way of a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> or by means of an, <hi>Id eſt,</hi> in
antecedent or ſubſequent words; ſometimes with diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ſometimes with none; and ſo, it matters not with
him what nature the Stock it ſelf is of, ſince the fruit of
teſtifying in favour of his <hi>tenet</hi> is to be expected from the
acceſſory ſcyons or ſpriggs (his voluntary additions) and
ſo need not reſemble the Stock, which may be of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,

onely ſignify that they <hi>founded the Church</hi> there, and we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> &amp; <hi>Bishops</hi> there: Secondly, he was accuſed
there for calling thoſe obſcure teſtimonies <hi>Evidences</hi> for
the <hi>excluſive</hi> Iuriſdiction of theſe Apoſtles one over Iews
the other over Gentiles; whereas, there was not one <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive</hi>
particle in any one of them, nor ſo much as Iew
or <hi>Gentile</hi> named by them. Thirdly, in order to this, the
notion of an <hi>Evidence</hi> was ſet down &amp; manifeſted how far
his twilight-teſtimony-proof were from the pretence of
being ſuch. Fourthly, his ſly gullery of the Reader to
his face, by endeavouring to make him beleeve that the
teſtimonies were parallell to his owne confident affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that <hi>it was evident,</hi> was there layd open, &amp; shown to
be a deceit: His words (<hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 76) being, <hi>the ſame
is as evident at Rome, where theſe two Apoſtles met again,
and each of them erected &amp; managed a Church S. Peter of
Iews, S. Paul of Gentiles:</hi> whereas the teſtimonies which
he usher'd in with ſo many <hi>Soes</hi> had not a word to that

               <p>Of all theſe weakneſſes Dr. H. was accuſed by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armer,

learned mock-Reply that is, ſaid over again out of his

related us back in the margent to that very place in it
which I had impugned as thus manifoldly weak he ends
with theſe words, that <hi>Sure there can be no need of farther
proofs or teſtimonies from Antiquity in this matter.</hi> That bold

trumps,</hi> there is no reſiſting it; when the game ſeems
quite gone, it retrives the loſſe &amp; carries all before it. My
anſwer was that all which thoſe teſtimonies intimated
might have been performed by promiſcuous preaching
of each both to th' Iews &amp; Gentiles; the ſumme of his
Reply is onely this, that <hi>Sure</hi> it cannot, I objected that
thoſe teſtimonies were weak &amp; concluded nothing at all

               <p>As for the teſtimony of <hi>S. Prosper,</hi> in which he was
accuſed to render <hi>Eccleſiam Gentium, the Church of the

with Gentiles in <hi>Rome,</hi> which words should they be
render'd <hi>the Church of the Gentiles</hi> muſt neceſſarily follow,
he referts me to his <hi>Repl.</hi> p. 65. parag. 10. for ſatisfaction;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115675:175"/>
where he acquaints me with his <hi>deſire</hi> that <hi>the truth</hi> of his
interpretation <hi>may be conſider'd by the words cited from him.</hi>
The words are theſe, <hi>in ipsâ Hieruſalem lacobus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
at Hieruſalem, Iohn at Epheſus, Andrew &amp; the reſt
through out all Aſia, Gentium Eccleſiam ſacrârunt,</hi> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
the Church of the <hi>Nations</hi> (ſayes Dr. H.) <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
(ſays S. W.) Vpon this teſtimony Dr. H. argues thus.
<hi>What Nations were theſe? Sure of Iews aſwell as Gentiles:</hi>
then follow the Grounds of this his aſſurance; <hi>elſe Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem
could be no part of them, no nor Iohn's converts at
Epheſus, for they were Iews,</hi> and then he concludes his
mild-reaſoning diſcourſe with as mild a reprehenſion, that
<hi>therefore the Catholike Gentleman did not doe well.</hi> Now, as
for his <hi>Sure,</hi> 'tis indeed a pregnant expreſſion; but I deny
the ſufficiency of the Authoritie which ſo Magiſterially
pronounces it; And, for what concerns the Grounds of
his aſſurance, they are both of them found onely in his
own ſayings, &amp; no where in any teſtimony; my <hi>tenet,</hi> he
knows, is, that all thoſe Apoſtles preach't promiſcuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Gentiles alſo where ſoever they came. But, leſt he
should think me hard hearted for not beleeving his <hi>Sure,</hi>
I shall at leaſt show my ſelf far from cruelty in making
him this friendly proffer, that if he can show mee any one
word in any teſtimony yet produc't, which expreſſes that
<hi>S. Iames</hi> preach't to <hi>Iews onely</hi> in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> or S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
to <hi>Iews onely</hi> in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> upon which alone he builds he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
that <hi>Gentium</hi> cannot ſignifie <hi>Gentiles,</hi> I will pardon him
the anſwering this whole book; which to doe on any
fashion will I know be very laborious &amp; shamefull to
him; but to doe it ſatisfactorily impoſſible, unles he could
put out his Reader's Eyes, &amp; ſo hinder them from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his corrupted &amp; falſified citations aright. Is there
anything eaſier then to show us an excluſive particle or
expreſſion if any ſuch thing were to be found there: But,
if there be none, what an emptines, vanity &amp; open co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:115675:176"/>
of his Reader is it to cry <hi>Sure, Surely, Certainly,
Vnqueſtionably,</hi> and the like, when there is no other war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to ground this aſſurance, ſave his owne weake fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
inconſequent deductions, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his facing the teſtimonies with antecedent, peecing
them with ſubſequent words; whiles, in the meane time,
the teſtimony it ſelf muſt ſtand by &amp; look on onely like
a <hi>conditio ſine quâ non,</hi> as if it were an honourable ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to grace his perſonating; and not have any efficacious
influence, or act any part in the Argument which bears
it's title.</p>
               <p>But to come to the teſtimony it ſelf: firſt, I would
know of Mr. H. how oft he hath read <hi>Gentes</hi> taken alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
without any additionall &amp; determining expreſſion to
ſignifie <hi>both Iews &amp; Gentiles;</hi> unles it be in this ſence as it
probably might be in <hi>S Proſper's</hi> time, that <hi>Gentium Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia</hi>
ſignified the Chriſtian Church, in which the Iews
were included, yet being no conſiderable part of it, they
needed not be expreſt. Next, as for the word <hi>Nations</hi>
which he recurs to, I would ask whether (though thoſe
in <hi>Iudea</hi> were ſtyled the <hi>Nation of the Iews</hi>) yet, whether
thoſe in diſperſion at <hi>Rome</hi> were called a <hi>Nation</hi> or no,
or rather a <hi>Sect</hi> Thirdly, let <hi>Gentium</hi> ſignifie, <hi>of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
as he would have it, let us ſee how Dr. H. hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged
his cauſe: For, if it be ſo, then the words <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
Eccleſiam ſacrarunt, they conſecrated the Church of
the Nations,</hi> are to be applyed to all the Apoſtles there
mention'd: Now then, ſince <hi>Nations</hi> (as Dr. H. tells us
here) is <hi>Sure of Iews aſwel as Gentiles,</hi> the teſtimony muſt
run thus, <hi>Iames at Hieruſalem conſecrated the Church of
Iews aſwell as Gentiles, Iohn at Epheſus conſecrated the
Church of Iews aſwell as Gentiles, Andrew &amp; the reſt throug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
all Aſia conſecrated the Church of the Iews aſwell as
Gentiles;</hi> and the like of <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus
Dr. H. thinking to ſtop one hole hath made other three
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115675:176"/>
quite deſtroyes the ſubſtance of his excluſive tenet, while
he went about to mend a circumſtance. Fourthly if he
will not allow this ſignification of the word given &amp; allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
by himſelf (as'applyed to <hi>S Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi> when it
was his intereſt) to be appliable to all the reſt of thoſe
Apoſtles likewiſe, let us ſee what an unreaſonable beleef
he exacts of his Readers; to imagine that the word <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium</hi>
should dance from one ſignification to another as his
fancy shall pleaſe to ſtrike up a diverſe tune. Hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to <hi>S. Iames</hi> &amp; <hi>S Iohn,</hi> it muſt be imagin'd to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
<hi>Iews onely,</hi> becauſe 'tis againſt the intereſt of his tenet
that they should open their mouths to convert a Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Epheſus:</hi> But then <hi>S. Andrew</hi> &amp; the
reſt are not Apoſtles of the Circumciſion, &amp; ſo according
to him muſt not preach to a Iew in <hi>Aſia,</hi> preſently upon
this the <hi>Ianus fac'd</hi> word <hi>Gentium</hi> turns the other ſide of
it's viſage towards us, &amp; repreſents to us Gentiles onely;
yet, all this could not content Dr. H. he had a minde to
limit S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Authority when he met <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
City, which he could finde no handſomerway to doe
then by making one over the Iews onely, the other over
onely the Gentiles: No ſooner had Dr. H fancied this,
but immediately the obedient word <hi>Gentium</hi> turn'd
round, &amp; shew'd us both it's faces; and did not now ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify
Iews onely, nor yet Gentiles onely, as fomerly
but Iews &amp; Gentiles <hi>both;</hi> And yet, when this is done,
it expreſſes nothing to the contrary, but that each preach't
to both. Is not this a rare diſputant? Laſtly, I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know where he ever heard or how he came to imagin
that the word <hi>Gentes</hi> could ſignifie <hi>Iews onely,</hi> as it muſt
according to his Grounds, as apply'd to <hi>S. Iames</hi> at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Epheſus?</hi> Reader perhaps it may
cauſe mirth in thee to read ſuch Gottam-abſurdities in a
Dr. of Divinitie, but I aſſure thee it is moſt weariſome to
me to ſtand laying open ſuch weake impertinencies, nor
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115675:177"/>
doe I hope for any honourable triumph from the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſuch trash.</p>

that they were brought for a teſtimony of the Church of

I shall ask no further ſatisfaction of him ſave onely to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
him to the Reader's iudgments when I shall have once
conuinc't him by their eyes. In his booke <hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 76.
the 9th paragraph begins thus. <hi>The ſame is as evident
at Rome, where theſe two great Apoſtles met again, and
each of them erected &amp; managed a Church one of Iews ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Gentiles.</hi> After which poſition immediately follow
the teſtimonies which should have proved it, begining
thus; <hi>So ſaith S. Irenaeus, &amp; more expreſly Epiphanius,
So the Inſcription on their Tombes, So Gaius, So Dionyſius,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115675:177"/>
So Prosper;</hi> Then, after the ſaid teſtimonies, immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
likewiſe follow theſe very words, <hi>And the very Seals
of Popes are an Irrefragable Evidence of the ſame.</hi> Now,
what this <hi>ſame</hi> was, is manifeſt by the beginning of the

over the <hi>Gentiles at Rome.</hi> But 'tis an ordinary evaſion
with him to deny his owne words.</p>
               <p>Nor is this all which theſe Seals of the Popes were to
<hi>Evidence Irrefragably;</hi> Let us trace the originall poſition
for which it was produced, &amp; we shall finde it, (<hi>of Schiſm</hi>
p. 74.) to be this long rable; that <hi>whenſoever thoſe two
great Apoſtles came to the ſame City, the one conſtantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
himſelf to the Jews, received Diſciples of ſuch, formed
them into a Church, left them when he departed that region
to be governed by ſome Bishop of his aſſignation, and the
other in like manner did the ſame to the Gentiles;</hi> This is his
chimericall poſition, which he pretended to manifeſt to
have been <hi>at Antioch</hi> in his 8th parag immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
theſe words, and beginning with, [<hi>Thus we know
it was at Antioch;</hi>] and to have been <hi>at Rome</hi> in his 9th
beginning thus, <hi>The ſame is as evident at Rome,</hi> (to wit
that whenſoever thoſe two great Apoſtles came to that
City to wit <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c.) after this follows his proofs for
the ſame tenet, <hi>So ſaith Epiphanius, Gaius, Dionyſius,</hi> &amp;c.]
and, laſtly, immediately after theſe follows this <hi>Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

<hi>Repl.</hi> p. 64. par. 6. he told us that <hi>Epiphanius his
words cleered the buſines-concerning Rome,</hi> that the other
teſtimonies were <hi>Evidences to that purparſe;</hi> and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that <hi>Sure there can need no farther proofs, nor teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

to the teſtimony of <hi>Epiphanius, Anſw.</hi> p. 48. that he
maintain'd it <hi>impoſſible for S. W. to divert the force of it.</hi> So
that the, ſame ſix teſtimonies &amp; Popes Seals were there
called <hi>Evidences, clear</hi> &amp; <hi>ſole-ſufficient proofs,</hi> which are
here deny'd to be <hi>proofs</hi> at all, but onely things <hi>ſpoken
in agreement.</hi> But the reaſon of this double dealing is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
for, there, he was challenged not to have one teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
from Antiquity of thoſe Apoſtles excluſive Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115675:178"/>
and ſo had then no better shift ſave onely to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
another dumbe show of the ſelf-ſame teſtimonies, &amp;
then crie them up for <hi>clear Evidences</hi> &amp; <hi>ſole-ſufficient proofs</hi>
from Antiquitie. Here the weaknes of his pretended beſt,
I mean his <hi>Irrefragable Evidence,</hi> was shown to be moſt
ſilly &amp; weak; where upon himſelf modeſtly decries both
that &amp; it's fellow Evidences of an inferior rank, &amp; ſayes
that they are <hi>no proofs</hi> at all, but <hi>things ſpoken in agreement.</hi>
Nor let him ſay that in his Reply where he called them
ſuch <hi>clear evidences</hi> &amp; <hi>proofs,</hi> he mean't they were onely
ſufficient proofs that thoſe Apoſtles both founded the
Church at Rome; This was never in queſtion between
us, but granted by both ſides; Neither did <hi>Schiſm Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarm'd</hi>
ever challenge him to prove this; but that they
founded that Church with <hi>excluſive</hi> Iuriſdiction over Iews
&amp; Gentiles. Now then, ſince in his <hi>Anſwer</hi> to that exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pt
on, p. 48. l. 34. 35. he refers to the ſaid place in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi>
he muſt mean there that they are <hi>ſole-ſufficient proofs</hi>
&amp; <hi>clear Evidences</hi> to prove <hi>excluſive</hi> Iuriſdiction of the
one over Iews at <hi>Rome,</hi> the other over Gentiles, unles he
will confeſſe himſelf an open &amp; manifeſt prevaricatour
from the whole Queſtion. Thirdly, ſince he puts down
his own <hi>theſis</hi> in theſe words, that <hi>each of them at Rome
erected and managed a Church, S. Peter of Iews</hi> S. <hi>Paul of
Gentiles,</hi> and then immediately ſubjoyned his proofs in
this form, <hi>So ſaith Irenaeus,</hi> &amp;c. it is impoſſible to imagin
other, but that theſe teſtimonies were produced to prove
the immediate foregoing <hi>theſis.</hi> Fourthly, by denying
theſe to be proofs, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> over Iews,
<hi>S. Paul</hi> over Gentiles, he denies by conſequence that he
hath produced any proof at all for that fancie of his, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
his owne blush-proof confident expreſſion [<hi>The
ſame as evident at Rome</hi>] ſince in the 9th parag. the
proper place to prove that point, there is nothing at all
ſound, but thoſe teſtimonies denied by him here to be
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:115675:179"/>
proofs, and his own now recited words: Though, I muſt
confeſſe, towards the latter end of the 10th parag. he
hath a very expreſſe proof in theſe words, [<hi>of S. Peter</hi>'s
<hi>being over the Iews at Rome we make no Queſtion</hi>] he muſt
mean over <hi>Iews onely,</hi> for otherwiſe it oppoſes not us
who hold him our ſelves to have been over both Iews &amp;
Gentiles there; So that he carries the whole queſtion
between us by ſaying <hi>'tis evident,</hi> and <hi>himſelf makes no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
of it;</hi> relying finally upon nothing but theſe confident
raw affirmations of his own, ſince he denies all the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
he produces to be proofs of the point. Laſtly,
ſeeing he ſayes that theſe teſtimonies are ſpoken onely in

as appears by my firſt note, &amp; are moſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; manifeſtly related to prove the <hi>excluſive theſis</hi> it ſelf,
as is evident by my ſecond, let us examin a litle nearer
Dr. H's reach of reaſon, and ſtrength of Logick. What
mean theſe words that <hi>they are not produced for proofs but
in agreement.</hi> I ask, have they any influence or efficacitie
at all upon the concluſion or thing they are brought for,
or no? if they have, they are proofs; if not, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.
If any thing follow out of them they infer or
prove it; if nothing, what do they there Either they are
for the point &amp; then they ground a deduction to eſtablish
it and are argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; proofs in it's behalf; or elſe they are
againſt it, &amp; are ſtill proofs, though for the contrary; or,
laſtly, they are in themſelves indifferent, that is neither
for it nor againſt it, and then the firſt chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi>
would have ſerved his turn aſwell as theſe neutrall teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
yet Dr. H. takes it ill here that I should offer to
make any <hi>incoherence appear</hi> in his diſcours who never in
his life knew what it was to make any notions <hi>cohere</hi> at
all, ſave onely in a looſe Sermonary way, which the leaſt
puffe of declamatory aire would counterbuffe and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate

up with a numerous recruit, in the form of queſtions (<hi>Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>

<hi>an Evidence that Paul aſwell as Peter had the planting the
Church of Rome.</hi> I anſwer, grant it; what follows hence?
this could have been done by their promiſcuous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
<hi>And is not that agreable to Peter</hi>'s <hi>preaching the Iews
and Paul</hi>'s <hi>to the Gentiles when they met in a City where we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
multitudes of both?</hi> I anſwer you muſt mean to <hi>Iews one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
for 'tis our tenet that each preach't to both; and then
you have been often challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged that you have not brought
one ſyllable of proof for it but your owne word onely.
Nor is their founding the Church agreable even to your
owne words in any other ſence then as <hi>agreable</hi> ſignifies
<hi>indifferent,</hi> or <hi>not contrary</hi> to it, ſince the founding a
Church, ſignifies onely the thing done in common, not
the particular manner of doing it, either promiſcuouſly
or excluſively which is all our queſtion but is equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable
to both: or rather indeed, ſounding onely a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
endeavour in doing it, 'tis rather inclinable to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous
ſence; nay, the force of the word, <hi>the Church,</hi>
which is to be underſtood of God's Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
gives us to underſtand that there was but one
Church, not two, for otherwiſe he was bound to ſay the
<hi>Churches</hi> not the <hi>Church.</hi> It follows immediately after
his former queſtion. <hi>And was not that the importance of
the agreement Gal.</hi> 2. 9. I anſwer there was no <hi>agreement</hi>
there to any ſuch purpoſe. The giving the right hand of
fellowship was to acknowledge <hi>S. Paul</hi> a fellow-Apoſtle
and his doctrine ſincere; the applying themſelves ſome
to Iews others to Gentiles was a pure ſequell: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>the Circumciſion,</hi> to which <hi>S. Peter</hi> lent at that time his
ſpeciall endeavours, ſignified the countrey of <hi>Iudea,</hi> not
<hi>the Iews in diſperſion,</hi> all which hath been manifeſted moſt
particularly heretofore, Sect. 6. much leſſe is it impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:115675:180"/>
there, as Dr. H. after his openly-falſifying manner
pretends here, that <hi>when they met in a City where were
multitudes of both</hi> they should carry themſelves thus &amp;
thus; there being no talk there of either <hi>Cities</hi> or <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi>
which he tells us here <hi>the agreement</hi> there <hi>imported,</hi>
and then cites immediately for it Gal. 2. 9. without the
words. But he proceeds. <hi>And is not that an Argument
that Peter was not the univerſall Paſtor, but that the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
were S. Paul</hi>'s <hi>Province, as the Iews S. Peter</hi>'s. Not a
jott good Dr. your premiſſes are no ſtronger then your
bare ſaying, which makes your inference thence wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker

of all your pitifull dicourſe was shown to be a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
fiction. Nor, were there ſuch, would it make for your
purpoſe unles they were <hi>excluſive;</hi> nor would it ſerve your
intent that there was <hi>excluſivenes</hi> in the actuall endeavours
of the Apoſtles, but you muſt evince an Excluſivenes in
<hi>Right</hi> ere you can pretend to limit a <hi>Right:</hi> nor have you
brought as yet one expreſſe word of any teſtimony to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
good the leaſt of theſe. Again, if by <hi>univerſall Paſtour</hi>
you mean one who hath Iuriſdiction to preach in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the world and to all ſorts of people, as your wiſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
ſeems to intend, you need not trouble your ſelf,
we grant each Apoſtle to have been an <hi>univerſall Paſtour</hi>
in this ſence; but, if you mean that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was not hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
in Authoritie amongſt the Apoſtles, how does this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
though he were ſuppoſed to be limited as a particular
Bishop to his private Province; or, as a Bishop, had a flock
diſtinc't from <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s, is not even now a dayes, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe's
Bishoprick limitted to the <hi>Roman Dioceſe</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchate
to the Weſt, and ſo his Authority under both
theſe notions limited excluſively and contradiſtinguisht
from other Bishops and Patriarchs, and yet wee ſee <hi>de

in Authoritie then the reſt notwithſtanding. Doe not
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:115675:180"/>
our eyes and the experience of the whole world teſtifie
this to be ſo? yet were all the former abſurd inventions
of <hi>Apoſtolicall Provinces,</hi> their <hi>excluſivenes, S. Peter</hi> over
the <hi>Iews onely,</hi> &amp;c. granted; ſtill his utmoſt inference
would be no ſtronger then this now related which the eyes
of all the world gainſay; to wit, that becauſe others had
their particular aſſignations, Provinces, or Bishopriks
diſtinct from <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s, therefore <hi>S. Peter</hi> could not be
higher in Authoritie then thoſe others; by which one
may ſee that my learned Adverſary underſtands not what
is mean't by the Authority he impugns; but makes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the Pope cannot be Head of the Church, unles he
be the particular &amp; immediate Bishop of every Dioceſe
in it. Whereas, we hold him contradiſtinct from his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Bishops, for what concerns his proper &amp; peculiar aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation;
and onely ſay that he is higher then the reſt in
Iuriſdiction &amp; <hi>power of command</hi> in things belonging to

never held by us, that none in the Church hath his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:115675:181"/>
to the ſtory of Scripture, which (according to the brevitie of
the relations there made) onely ſets down</hi> S. <hi>Peter to be the
Apoſtle of the Circumciſion; and of his being ſo at Rome we
make no queſtion</hi> Vpon theſe words, his Diſarmer (<hi>Schiſm
Diſarm.</hi> p 73.) enumerated as many ſignifications im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by that word <hi>onely,</hi> as were obvious, &amp; confuted
them ſeverally, becauſe he found the words ambiguous;
telling him that <hi>neither doth Scripture onely ſet down S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as Apoſtle of the Circumciſion but Iames &amp; Iohn alſo
Gal. 2. 9. nor is S. Peter any where expreſt as Apoſtle of one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Circumciſion but expreſly particularized the contrary
Act. 15. &amp;</hi> 7. His Anſwer. p. 50. affords us a third ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
ſo impoſſible for S. W. to imagin, as it was to
foreſee all the weakneſes Dr. H's cauſe could put him
upon. 'Tis this, that <hi>the words (onely) is ſet clearly in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the Scripture's, making more particular relations
of S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>preaching to the Iewish caetus at Rome,</hi> &amp;c.
Now, had the Scripture produced by him made any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
relation at all of any ſuch matter, then indeed his
[<hi>onely</hi>] might have been thought to mean the want of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
particular</hi> relation, &amp;c. but if in no place alledged by
him there had been found the leaſt particular relation at
all either of a <hi>Iewish caetus at Rome,</hi> or <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>preaching
to it particularly,</hi> or indeed ſo much as intimating his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in that City, then what ground had Dr. H. given
me to imagine that the reſtrictive particle <hi>onely</hi> was put in
oppoſition to a more particular relation from Scripture of
that, of which the Scripture had given me no relation at all?
Is there a greater miſery then to ſtand trifling with ſuch a
brabbler? To omit, that, take away the former <hi>parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
from having any influence upon the words without it,
as it ought, &amp; then one of the ſignifications given by me
is abſolutely unavoidable.</p>
               <p>But againſt the firſt ſignification impugned by me, he
challenges my <hi>knowledge</hi> that he <hi>could not mean ſo without
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:115675:181"/>
contradicting himſelf;</hi> and my knowledg challenges his
conſcience that he cannot be ignorant how he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
himſelf frequently &amp; purpoſely upon any occaſion
when he cannot well evade. As for the ſecond ſence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that ambiguous word might bear, I repeated my
challenge to him Schiſm Diſarm. p. 73. that, <hi>If he could
shew me the leaſt ſyllable either in Scripture or other teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
expreſly and without the help of his, Id eſts, and ſcruing
deductions reſtraining S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Juriſdiction to the Iews one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; excluding it from the Gentiles, I would yeild him the
Laurell and quit the Controverſie.</hi> This challenge though
offered him before p. 52. 53. &amp; p. 68. yet he here firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
not for the Laurell's ſake, he remitts that to S. W.
but <hi>upon ſo tempting an hope as to be at an end of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,</hi>
which I dare ſay he repents he ever medled with;
yet was hee very haſty to begin with Controverſies vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
&amp; unprovoked; and now when he ſees himſelf
anſwer'd &amp; unable to reply, the moderate man growes
weary &amp; wishes himſelf at an end of them, as if he thought
himſelf, when hee begun firſt, ſo great a <hi>Goliah</hi> that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
could not be found in the whole Army of the Church
a ſling and a ſtone to hit him in the fore head.</p>
               <p>Ere I come to lay open how he acquits himſelf of this
accepted challenge, I deſire the Reader to conſider,
firſt, the import of it; which is to exact onely of him to
show one <hi>excluſive</hi> word expreſt in order to <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
in any one of thoſe many teſtimonies he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for that end. Secondly, let him candidly obſerve what
infinite diſadvantage I offer my ſelf, &amp; what an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
advantage I offer my adverſary in ſuch an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld
proffer and condeſcenſion; one reſtrictive word
for the reſtrictive point now in queſtion between us, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
him and undoes mee. Thirdly, let him remember how
Dr. H. call'd thoſe proofs <hi>Evidences</hi> for that reſtrictive
point, the whole Controverſie being about the limitation
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:115675:182"/>
or illimitation of Iuriſdiction; and the totall ſcope of that
firſt half of c. 4. to limit <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s to the Iews onely.
Fourthly, hence follows that it is mainly important &amp;
moſt abſolutely neceſſary that Dr. H. should now lay hold
of this fair occaſion to <hi>lay the Axe to the root of Rome,</hi> as he
expreſt his intent <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 11. Fifthly, the conditions of
the victory are the moſt facil that can be imagin'd; for,
what eaſier than to shew one <hi>excluſive</hi> particle, as <hi>onely,
ſolely, alone,</hi> or ſome ſuch like, expreſt in any teſtimony
if any ſuch thing were there. Sixthly, it is to be obſerved
that he hath accepted of the challenge, &amp; ſo ſtands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to shew ſome ſuch word expreſt in ſome teſtimony.
Seventhly he is allured to do it by <hi>the tempting hope to be
at an end of Controverſie,</hi> as himſelf confeſſes. And laſtly,
unles he come of well from ſo condeſcending, &amp; ſo eaſy
a challenge already accepted of, that is, unles he show
ſome ſuch <hi>excluſive</hi> particle expreſt in ſome teſtimony he
cannot avoid manifeſting himſelf the moſt shamefull wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that ever handled pen, the moſt pernicious ruiner of
Souls that ever treated controverſy, the moſt inſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcienc'd
man that ever pretended to the name of a
Chriſtian, if in treating a queſtion about Schiſm in which
is intereſſed mens eternall ſalvation &amp; damnation, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
proves amply of Schiſm c. 1. and the moſt fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
point thereof, as himſelf likewiſe confeſſes this to be,
which concerns <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s univerſall Iuriſdiction (<hi>Anſw.</hi>
p. 74) hee cannot produce nor pick out <hi>one</hi> expreſſe
word to that purpoſe from that whole army of his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
which he call'd <hi>Evidences,</hi> but from his own words
onely; So that all the motives imaginable conſpire to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Dr. H. as good as his word, the hazard of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
eternall damnation; the care of his owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
&amp; of his owne credit; the hope to be at an end of
Controverſie, (none of the leaſt to him as he is caught
in theſe preſent circumſtances) promiſe of victory, the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:115675:182"/>
extreme moderation &amp; facility of the underſtanding, and
laſtly his owne acceptation here of the challenge.</p>
               <p>By this time I know the Reader expects that Dr. should
come thundering out with a whole volly of teſtimonies,
shewing in each of them plain words expreſſing his <hi>tenet,</hi>
at leaſt that he should produce ſome <hi>one</hi> expreſſe particle,
limitting <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Authoritie without the help of his
ſcruing deductions, as he promiſt his challenger; But, he,
never ſo much as attempts what he late pretended; th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t is,
he attempts not to <hi>show</hi> any <hi>expreſſe</hi> word in any teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but inſtead there of prevaricates to his old shuffling
tricks, huddles together three teſtimonies, and fancies a
shadow like alluſion from one to the other, and thence
adventures to infer a concluſion. What is this to our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
or my challenge, it debarr'd his ſcruing deductions,
and required ſome <hi>one expreſſe reſtrictive</hi> word; he linkes
three citations together to make a ſleight gloſſe, which
no one alone could do, and then <hi>deduces</hi> &amp; <hi>concludes,</hi>
which was interdicted by his ſelf-accepted challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge. What
need three teſtimonies, ſtrung together, to shew <hi>one</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictive
word? or, what relation hath the pointing out to
us ſuch a word to the <hi>inferring a concluſion</hi> from three te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies?
I deſired &amp; he promiſt me ſome <hi>one word</hi> which
was expreſſ, that is, which needed <hi>no concluſion</hi> at all; he
puts me of with a <hi>concluſion</hi> onely which intimates there
was never an <hi>expreſſ word.</hi> His <hi>deductions</hi> are his, the <hi>words</hi>
are the teſtimonies; I never challeng'd him that he could
not deduce the moſt ivicy concluſion, from the moſt flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
teſtimony, as he did the beſt in all his book <hi>of Schiſm</hi>
from the bare monoſyllable <hi>come;</hi> My challenge was that
his deductions were loud, his teſtimonies quite dumbe,
without one expreſſe word in them to his purpoſe. This
<hi>word</hi> which would have ſav'd &amp; gain'd Dr. H. ſo much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
&amp; Eaſe I deſired should be shown me; But ſince he is
ſilent in pronouncing it, he gives it for granted that he
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115675:183"/>
could produce none; and ſo the Reader &amp; I know what
to think of him, whoſe ſelf-conciet dares hazard his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
Salvation upon his owne bare unauthorized ſayings,
and altogether unwarrantable imaginations.</p>
               <p>Now, as for his three teſtimonies themſelves, they are
the former old ones already anſwered over &amp; over; towit,
that from Gal. 2. of the imagin'd agreement for excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
Provinces, that of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaying that the two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
were Bishops in Rome, and that of the Arch he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
<hi>Pelagius,</hi> concerning the holding a part the Iewish
&amp; Gentile Churches. The firſt he can make nothing of
without an <hi>Ellipſis,</hi> which he makes up himſelf. Our bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
was that he should show me ſome <hi>excluſive</hi> word,
<hi>expreſt</hi> in any one of his citations for his excluſive <hi>tenet,</hi>
and the firſt of the three lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g letterd teſtimonies which by
being put together were to ſpell this one excluſive word,
is imperfect without ſomething <hi>underſtood,</hi> that is, <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſt.</hi>
Good! The whole force of the ſecond from <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
lies in this word <hi>Bishops,</hi> which yet affirms <hi>S. Peter</hi>
&amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi> to have been at Rome; which word is ſo far
from being of an excluſive ſignification, that it is common
&amp; incluſive of both. Yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he tells us here that it is <hi>expreſſe;</hi>
&amp; makes it more ample by reciting it thus, that <hi>in Rome
Peter &amp; Paul were the ſame perſons, both Apoſtles &amp; Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops.</hi>
What force he puts in the [<hi>ſame perſons</hi>] none but
himſelf can imagin, ſince none ever dream't that <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
ſpoke of two different <hi>Peters</hi> &amp; <hi>Pauls</hi> whom he call'd
<hi>Bishops,</hi> from thoſe he call'd in the ſame line &amp; with in
the ſame comma, <hi>Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And, as for his laſt teſtimony
'tis borrowed, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Arch-heretick <hi>Pelagius</hi> as hath been
shown heretofore, Sect. 7. Moreover grant that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
of Iews &amp; Gentiles were for a while during the
heat of the Scandall held a part at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and ſome other
places, yet this Arch-heretick's teſtimony expreſſes not
it was ſo at <hi>Rome</hi> when the Apoſtles met there, which was
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115675:183"/>
ſome years after that fit of Iewish zeal at <hi>Antioch;</hi> and the
vehemency of the Scandall, by the Apoſtles prudence,
went on mitigating every day; So as this unauthentick
teſtimony borrow'd from the wicked <hi>Pelagius,</hi> hath not
one expreſſe word of excluſion even of the Iewish <hi>caetus</hi> at
<hi>Rome,</hi> much leſſe of the Apoſtles were excluſively over
thoſe two <hi>caetuſſes</hi> (as he terms them) nor hath Dr. H.
any reaſon to think that all the Iews of the diſperſion we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
thus zealous, ſince we may gather eaſily (Act. 13. 42.)
that both Iews &amp; Gentiles were together when <hi>S. Paul</hi>
preached at the Synagogue at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> and moſt
expreſſely Act. 14. v. 1. 19. we read that in <hi>Iconium, Paul
&amp; Barnabas went both together into the Synagogue of the
Iews &amp; ſo ſpake that a great multitude both of the Iews &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of the Gentiles beleeved</hi> Which, beſides that it shows
plainly the Iews there thought it not againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> his
law to avoid the converſation of a Gentile, ſo it manifeſts
likewiſe that they were in a diſpoſition rather to admit
converted Gentiles than unconverted (which yet we ſee
here they did) ſince the unconverted deny'd nay laught
at <hi>Moſes his law</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> to boot, which the converted
did not; which shows that though he may have ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
pretence that the Iews at <hi>Antioch</hi> were too nice, yet
he hath none at all, no not ſo much as a word, that this
faſtidious zeal was epidemicall, or that it was ſo at <hi>Rome;</hi>
Nor does this teſtimony from <hi>Pelagius</hi> expreſſe this at all
either in circumſtances of time or place; and this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
place of Scripture with it's fellows are main prejudices
againſt it. Yet Dr. H. vaunts his undaunted valour, that
from theſe three teſtimonies <hi>he shall adventure to infer
the concluſion that S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Iuriſdiction was reſtrained
to the Iews onely &amp; excluſively to the Gentiles.</hi> And, I
queſtion not but Dr. H. is a very bold adventurer, &amp;
is not a fraid to infer the moſt abſurd &amp; remote poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that ever were dream't of, out of the moſt uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:115675:184"/>
&amp; dumb teſtimonies all over his hook.</p>
               <p>But, it ſeems that even this Concluſion of his which he
deduces out of teſtimonies inſtead of shewing me one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
word in them, is not of it ſelf evidently conſequent
neither, but needs ſtill further proofs &amp; reaſons to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it, which he puts thus (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 51.) <hi>For how could
there be two Bishops in one City, (a thing quite contrary to
all Rule &amp; practice as ſoon as the diviſion betwixt Iews &amp;
Gentiles was taken away) unles there were two ſuch diſtinct
caetus.</hi> I anſwer, he neither hath nor can show that the Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of two in one City then ſprung from ſuch a diviſion
of the Iewish &amp; Gentile caetus: And, if by <hi>practice,</hi> he
means <hi>common practice,</hi> 'tis granted; but if he means it
was never practiſed upon occaſion, as his words [<hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all practice</hi>] intimate, then I ſuppoſe one inſtance
will ſuffice to deſtroy his univerſall poſition to wit that
three paires of Bishops <hi>Meletius</hi> and <hi>Paulinus, Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
and <hi>Flauianus, Flauianus</hi> and <hi>Euagrius,</hi> ſate ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely
two together Bishops of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Now what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
there was for this in the Apoſtles dayes shall quickly
be shown. It follows, in proof of the one expreſſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded-Concluſion,
<hi>If there were two ſuch caetus, then they that
were of one caetus under one Bishops, were not of the other cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
under the other Bishop.</hi> I anſwer, 'tis evident by the light
of nature that <hi>one</hi> is not <hi>another,</hi> and needed no proofs;
yet, to show his Skill, he gives it a double one. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the caetus were kept a part &amp; impermixt. So indeed
ſaid the Arch-heretick <hi>Pelagius</hi> cited by Dr. H. ſo oft,
and relied on ſo firmly for the onely prop of his cauſe as
to this point; for hee can never make his unconnected
ends of teſtimonies meet but by the mediation of this.
Secondly, becauſe no Bishop was to medle in another
man's Province. Which, till the Teſtimony from Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius
bee made authentick, touches not us; for till then
it is not prou'd theſe two Apoſtles had ſuch diſtinct Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:115675:184"/>
Hee proceeds: <hi>And if it be pretended that it is true
in coordinate Epiſcopaties, but holds not betwixt a Bishop &amp;
his Primate</hi> (this is the firſt time he hath yet ſeem'd even
to come near the queſtion) <hi>then the former arguments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again, that shew'd from Scriptures &amp; Antiquitie that
S. Paul was independent from S. Peter, and that S. Paul
had the Primatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prmacy among the Gentiles as Peter among
the Iews.</hi> I reply, that my anſwer are full as nimble as his
arguments, &amp; return as faſt as they; telling the firſt of
them that he haht not produc'd a word either from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
or Antiquitie showing that the <hi>power given</hi> to <hi>S.
Paul</hi> was not dependent on <hi>S. Peter,</hi> which was the thing
in queſtion though indeed in what concerns not the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
towit, that the <hi>actuall giving</hi> the power depended not
on <hi>S. Peter,</hi> but was done immediately by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
is expreſſe &amp; plain. As for his ſecond argument 'tis
a flat falſification, the words (are <hi>S. Ambroſe's</hi> (which he
here omits to tell us) which as cited by himſelf, <hi>Anſwer</hi>
p. 39. in the margent. Say that Peter, <hi>Primatum accepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
ad fundandam Eccleſiam, had received the Primacy to
found the Church;</hi> which word <hi>Church,</hi> he makes here
to be the Iews onely as contradinguish't from Gentiles,
though by the force of the very phraſe it ſignify the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> made up of both Iews &amp; Gentiles, &amp;
ſo is expreſly contrary to him, &amp; definitive for our tenet
as is shown heretofore, Sect. 7. His laſt Stop-da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger is, that,
<hi>though it may be that S. Peter did conuert ſome other ſuch
as Cornelius</hi> (that is, other Iews) <hi>yet this is not argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
for S.</hi> W. <hi>being nothing to the matter of Iuriſdiction, and
withall but a whimpering (may be) in his language.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
firſt he is reſolved to purſve his ſo oft affected miſtakes
that I am to <hi>argue</hi> &amp; <hi>prove,</hi> who (he knows well) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to <hi>Anſwer</hi> him, &amp; show that his arguments &amp; te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
prove nothing. Nor did I tell him that a <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be</hi>
may not ſerve, or is not proper for an <hi>Anſwer:</hi> my
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:115675:185"/>
words are plain <hi>Schiſm Diſarm.</hi> p. 20. that <hi>he ought not bring
May bees for proofs.</hi> For how can a proof conclude evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
unles the inference be neceſſary? or how can the
inference be neceſſary, unles the Concluſion <hi>muſt be ſo!</hi>
and, who ſees not that a <hi>May-be otherwiſe</hi> doth, out of
the force of the terms, deſtroy a <hi>muſt be ſo.</hi> Wherefore,
as, if I were to argue for the ground of my faith, I should
hold my ſelf obliged to leave no room for a poſſibility to
the contrary, ſo I am ſure I cannot wrong mine Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
in expecting the ſame meaſure from him: If then
Dr. H. whoſe turn it is to diſpute here (ſince he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
teſtimonies &amp; <hi>proofs,</hi> which he calls <hi>Evidences</hi>) will
conclude any thing neceſſarily, his teſtimonies ought to
infer that the matter, pretended to be proved thence <hi>muſt
be,</hi> that is, the contrary <hi>may not be;</hi> and then, though it
be not <hi>augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tative for S.</hi> W. whoſe task it is not to argue;
yet it is ſufficiently <hi>reſponſive</hi> for him to show that the
contrary <hi>may be.</hi> And this is all can be exacted of me or
any other defendant in rigour of Logicall diſputation. If
I have done more in moſt places than I was obliged, and
shown that the contrary not onely <hi>may be,</hi> but <hi>is,</hi> &amp; very
many times that it <hi>muſt be;</hi> and ſo have wrong'd perhaps
my ſelf in taking more pains with ſuch a trifler then needs;
I hope I have not been iniurious to my cauſe by showing
my ſelf a too zealous though perhaps in ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
an unſeaſonable Patron of it in over acting the part of
a Reſpondent or Anſwerer.</p>
               <p>Now that <hi>converſion,</hi> (as Dr. H. ſayes) <hi>is nothing to
the matter of Iuriſdiction</hi> (though it concerns not me at
preſent to define one way or other, yet) as coming from
Dr. H. it is the moſt unbeſeeming &amp; ſelf-contradicting
poſition, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futing at once almoſt all his third Chapter, the

               <p>THus much in anſwer to my wordish Adverſary; now
for the point it ſelf of thoſe Apoſtles being <hi>both</hi>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:115675:186"/>
Bishops in one City, to clear that more throughly, let
us conſider what was likely to happen out of of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of the thing it ſelf joyn'd with the prudence of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
The Spirit confirmed twelve were ſent to preach to
all Nations; when, &amp; where, was left to God's prouident
diſpoſing of circumſtances apply'd to their prudence. For,
the task being difficult, &amp; they not knowing by prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
fore-ſight what place &amp; time would for the future
be alwayes moſt convenient (as appears by <hi>S. Paul</hi> nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a viſion of a man of <hi>Macedonia</hi> to direct him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and other times of a ſpeciall direction of the Holy
Ghoſt) they were to govern themſelves by that high pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which amongſt other gifts rain'd down upon them
in <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> Moſt linger'd in <hi>Iudea</hi> till occaſionall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
together with the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt,
diſperſt them; ſome went one way, ſome another. Amongſt
the reſt (to particularize in two, &amp; come nearer our point)
<hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul,</hi> the two moſt efficacious Apoſtles, were
after ſome years by an eſpeciall provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce directed to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi>
that Chriſtian faith might gain a more advantageous
propagation by the influence that Head City had over
the ſubject world. Coming thither, &amp;, each being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
able to preach a part from the other, it was very
unfitting they should preach both together, but, that
they should accommodate themſelves in ſuch a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
diſtance that the whole City might be beſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to Chriſt's Faith by the noiſe of theſe two Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
Trumpets. This done, they fall to preach; the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
newnes of their doctrine, the prodigiouſnes of their
miracles make multitudes flock to them from all parts.
In the City were Gentiles &amp; Iews both. Nor have we any
ground to imagin that God's providence was ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
particular, as to direct onely Iews to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> &amp;
onely Gentiles to <hi>S. Paul.</hi> Equally promiſcuouſly then
they both came to each, according as chance, rumour,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:115675:186"/>
acquaintance, or other circumſtances guided them. The
Apoſtles did not enviouſly deny the knowledge of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſts</hi>
law to any that came, but preach't it impartially to all;
equally promiſcuouſly then they preach't each of them
both to Iews &amp; Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles. For it had been the hihgeſt impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to hazard the loſſe of yet weake &amp; ſlenderly-mou'd
Souls by ſeeming to neglect them, and ſending them away
to another; &amp; to order their actions ere they had ownd
their wills. The converts baptized by each could not but
take a very particular ply &amp; addictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their proper Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
&amp; father. Let us put caſe then that there should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
a ſcandall of the Iewish converts vnder each againſt
the Gentiles (which yet Dr. H. no where show'd to have
been at this place, Rome; nor at this time in any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her
place,) about eating of Gentile diet; (for that there ever
was any farther quarrell between them, or that they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd
from <hi>all Communion,</hi> is an abſolute impoſſibility
aſſerted onely by a plain falſification, as hath been shown.)
Let us conſider what effects ſuch a ſcandall was likely to
produce. Is it imaginable that all the multitude of the
Gentiles under <hi>S. Peter</hi> should shift ſides &amp; run to <hi>S. Paul,</hi>
and all the Iewi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h from <hi>S. Paul</hi> to <hi>S. Peter?</hi> or rather that
the Apoſtles prudence order'd things ſo, that, when in
any aſſembly where ſome practice emergent out of the
favorable conciet the Iews had of <hi>Moſes</hi> his law, was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely
to come in play, or any thing to the contrary, they
would order them to keep a ſunder to avoid the ſcandall.
We finde plainly by the place lately cited that in other
circumſtances the Iews met with perfect Gentiles in the
ſame place both at <hi>Antioch in Piſidia</hi> &amp; <hi>Iconium;</hi> or, had
there been ſuch hatred between them, as not to endure
one another's ſight or company (as Dr. H. wildly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins)
each might preach and celebrate to one after the
other was departed, or elſe in ſeverall places; any thing is
more eaſy to be imagin'd than that all of each ſide should
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:115675:187"/>
forſake their proper Apoſtle &amp; more than father, to whom
under God they ow'd all their hopes of Heaven, or that
the Apoſtles at their firſt coming should poſt them from
one to another, and not give them audience if they would
ask, or leave to hear Chriſt's law if they would learn.
But, to proceed; ſuppoſing on that each was converted
by either, hence follow'd a particular addiction of their
converts to their reſpective Paſtors; and, from this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
a greater aptitude to be directed according to
<hi>Chriſt's</hi> law, to be inſtructed corrected, &amp; governed by
one rather than by the other, and by conſequence a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
good to the Governed; whence it was neceſſary that
thoſe two Apoſtles, living in ſo great a City that it was
fully capable of both their endeavours, should continue
their diſtinctive way untill their deaths. Nor doth this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
us at all, ſince not onely reaſon grants it, but our own
eyes &amp; evident experience atteſt it, that either of them
may be immediate Bishops over ſeverall particular flocks,
and yet with this it may be eaſily conſiſtent that one of
thoſe may be ſuperior in Authority to the other, as we
ſee in a Bishop &amp; an Arch-Bishop, an Arch-Bishop &amp; a
Primate. Hence appears that the being Bishops at Rome
both at once, which proof the Dr. moſt relies upon, as
that <hi>whoſe force it is not poſſible to divert,</hi> neither conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
the one was over Iews onely, the other over Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
for which hee produced it; nor yet that one of them
was not Superiour to the other. But to return to my
Aduerſary's Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Another agreable teſtimony of Dr. H's which (as he
told us candidly before) were not proofs, that is proved
nothing, is, that <hi>the Scripture affirms of S. Paul that he
preached at Rome in his owne hired houſe receiving them that
came vnto him. Act. 28. 30. which will moſt fitly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to the Gentiles of that City, the Iews having ſolemnly
departed from him. v.</hi> 29. Thus he, <hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 78.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:115675:187"/>
I reply'd (though ſuch a ſaples trifle required none)
that there was no ſuch word as <hi>ſolemnly</hi> in the teſtimony,
upon which onely he grounds. He anſwers here p. 52.
that he cited not the word <hi>ſolemnly</hi> from that verſe as any
part of the ſacred Text. I ask, why then did he put the
word <hi>ſolemnly</hi> which is not found there in the ſame letter
with, <hi>departed,</hi> which is found there, and immediately
cite, v. 29. It was his inſincere common trick I glanced
at, and 'tis this, that he omits the words of Scripture
themſelves, either confounds the two letters promiſcuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or elſe puts his own &amp; the Scriptures words equally in
the common letter, and then immediately cytes the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
for it, without intimating at all, that 'tis his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
onely from that place, but, by the whole carriage
of it, gulling the unwary Reader that all is pure Scripture,
to which he ſubjoyns his inſincere citation, relating us
to a place where the moſt important words are wanting.</p>
               <p>Next, he goes about to prove the <hi>ſolemnity of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture</hi>
from other verſes in the ſame Chapter. I ask;
what is this to the pretence that their <hi>ſolemne departure</hi>
was found v. 29. which hee cited for it? I deny'd not the
ſolemnity of reprehenſion exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſt to the unbeleeving
Iews in other verſes, but onely, that there was any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of departure expreſt in that verſe; for read the
whole place, &amp; we finde not a word of any reſolution in
them to come no more, much leſſe of any reſolution in
<hi>S. Paul</hi> not to preach to them, whereſoever he found
them in other places (which nevertheles was that which
Dr. H. should have show'd) and indeed nothing but an
ordination of God, that his law should be preach't to
Gentiles. [Firſt then, the words of <hi>ſolemn reprehenſion,
[The heart of this people is waxen groſſe, and their ears dull
of hearing</hi>] are impoſſible to be apply'd to the Iews which
<hi>believed,</hi> as is expreſt v. 24. we have therefore no ground
hence of any <hi>ſolemnity of departure</hi> in order to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:115675:188"/>
Secondly S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> whom he cites here for this
point onely ſays as he puts him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>when they agreed not they departed; that is, they not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
forſook him,</hi> where 'tis plain he ſpeaks expreſly of
the <hi>unbeleeving</hi> not of the <hi>beleeving,</hi> and yet plainer f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om
what Dr. H. puts after wards <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>thoſe words of Scripture he apply'd to them upon their
unbelief.</hi> Now, ſince S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaks of thoſe to
whom <hi>S. Paul</hi> apply'd the words of Scripture, &amp; theſe
are impoſſible to be apply'd to the Iews which v. 24. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,</hi>
it is equally impoſſible his words should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable
to the <hi>beleeving Iews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, grant he had ſolemnly reprehended the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
beleeving Iews alſo, was it not poſſible for them to
return after ſuch a diſmiſſion, nor for <hi>S. Paul</hi> to apply
himſelf again to them? nay was it not poſſible this might
have been don even to the unbeleevers themſelves? I am
ſure the Texts ſays nothing to the contrary, for to this
<q>purpoſe I inſtanced (<hi>Schiſm Diſarm.</hi> p. 74.) that Act.
13. 46. both <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi> told the Iews boldly that
they <hi>would turn to the Gentiles,</hi> &amp; departed more ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>shaking of the duſt of their feet, v.</hi> 51.</q> and yet they
afterwards preach't many times to the Iews, as is to be
ſeen in the Acts. By which I onely could mean that this
greater vehemency &amp; ſolemnity of their departure hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
them not yet from applying themſelves to the Iews
for the future: But my acute Adverſary takes it as if I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
the ſelf-ſame <hi>shaking of the duſt of their shoes,</hi> at
Rome alſo; and, having given his reaſons, concludes that
<hi>therefore this ceremony was not now ſeaſonable.</hi> A very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
and pertinent Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Now, as for the beleeving Iews remaining with <hi>S.
Paul</hi> he anſwers this with <hi>If's</hi> and expects I should <hi>produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
Evidence</hi> againſt them. Is not this a gallant diſputant?
when his argument is shown to be weak, he under props
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:115675:188"/>
it with a lame <hi>If,</hi> and then tels his Aduerſary he muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his turn and argue, becauſe he (alas) is weary, hath
already done his beſt, &amp; can ſtretch no further. Yet he
grants that <hi>thoſe Iews which beleeved</hi> (if <hi>they continued) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a part of S. Paul</hi>'s <hi>caetus,</hi> and allows it poſſible that
ſome Gentiles might be in <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s, inſtancing himſelf in
<hi>Clemens.</hi> Now, then, I would ask, if this be ſo, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Iews <hi>S. Paul</hi> might convert &amp; govern, and how many
<hi>S. Peter?</hi> ſome, he ſays here, is no prejudice to his <hi>tenet;</hi>
I would know then what be the ſtints &amp; limits of this
number of heterogeneus converts, beyond which their
Iuriſdiction might not paſſe; or, why they should be ſo
partiall as to admit ſome &amp; ſend away others who came
to them with the ſame deſire to hear Chriſt's doctrine.
Again, I would ask, what the Iewish converts vnder <hi>S.
Paul</hi> should do in caſe they hap to take a toy againſt the
Gentiles for eating a peece of Pork; Dr. H's grounds in
this caſe interdicts them <hi>all Communion</hi> &amp; converſation;
According to his doctrine, <hi>S. Peter</hi> muſt have two alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether-unco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nected
Churches under him, a greater one of
Iews a leſſer of Gentiles; and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> on the other ſide,
a vaſt Church of Gentiles &amp; a smaller kind of a Chappell
of Iews. And thus Dr. H's former <hi>agreable</hi> diſcourſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
agrees with any thing els nor it ſelf neither; ſince,
the ſame difficultie occurs here as if each Apoſtle had
preach't promiſcuouſly &amp; indifferently both to Iews &amp;
Gentiles; ſince each muſt be over two Congregations if
the Iews hapt to be too zealous for <hi>Moſes</hi> his law, aſwell
as in the other caſe of <hi>preaching to both,</hi> which he ſo much

               <p>SChiſm Diſarm'd p. 76. accuſed Dr. H of ſubjoyning
out of his own head words moſt important &amp; expreſly
teſtifying the point in hand, to a dry teſtimony of <hi>S.
Ignatius.</hi> He qualifies the fault, too great to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
with what truth shall be examin'd. The place it
ſelf onely related that <hi>Linus was Deacon to S. Paul Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
to S. Peter.</hi> Dr. H. <hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 78. puts it thus, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
in Ignatius Ep. ad Trall. we read of Linus &amp; Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
that one was S. Paul</hi>'s <hi>the other S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Deacon, both
which afterwards ſucceeded them in the Epiſcopall Chair
Linus being conſtituted Bishop of the Gentile, Clemens of the
Iewish Chriſtians there.</hi> Where, note.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that there is nothing but a ſimple <hi>comma</hi> at the
word [<hi>Deacon</hi>] where the teſtimony ends; nor any a
thing like a full point of a teſtimony till the words [<hi>the
Iewish Chriſtians there.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is no other diſtinctive note imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to let us know which are teſtimonies, which his own
words.</p>
               <p>Thirdly all the art inſincerity could imagin was uſed
here to make no diſtinction appear: as to tell us <hi>we read</hi>
what follow'd there, &amp; never telling us <hi>how far we read</hi>
it; to iumble the two different letters confuſedly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and to put the words, <hi>Epiſcopall Chair, Bishop,
Gentile, Iewish Chriſtians,</hi> which were not found in the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:115675:189"/>
teſtimony, in the ſmall tranſlating letter, and the ſame
with the word <hi>Deacon,</hi> which was found therein.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the word [<hi>Deacons</hi>] found in the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
is nothing at all to our controverſy, for what is it to
us that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had ſuch a <hi>Deacon,</hi> and <hi>S Paul</hi> ſuch
another? whereas the other words ſubjoined by himſelf
are mainly important to his point.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this confident affirmation of his, that <hi>Linus
was conſtituted Bishop of the Gentile, Clemens of the Iewish
Chriſtians there,</hi> is no where els either found, or ſo much
as pretended to be shown, and ſo it could not be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
but that thoſe words were part of this teſtimony. For
who could ever think that any man should be ſo sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleſly
inſincere as to put down ſuch concerning expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
under the shadow of a teſtimony, and yet thoſe
expreſſions authoriſed by nothing but his owne word,
nor found any where but in his ſelf-inuented additions.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſleights diſcover plainly that there was artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
and deſign in the buſines; and that he ſlily abuſed his
Reader, by putting a teſtimony, which ſignify'd nothing,
for a cloake, and then adding what he pleas'd; hoping it
might be countenanced by the grave Authority <hi>of Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
and, by ſuch a dexterous management, bee taken
for his, at leaſt he hop't it might paſſe unſuſpected by his
confident aſſerting it; or, how ever, he hop't at leaſt that
for his laſt refuge he could evade by ſaying he mean't it
not for a <hi>proof,</hi> but <hi>in agreement onely,</hi> or (as hee pretti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
calls it here) <hi>a branch of accordance;</hi> and that's a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
good enough for him, being as good as the nothing-proving
proof was. The shadow of a buckler is the fitteſt
to defend the shadow of a body.</p>
               <p>He is troubled that I expected this teſtimony should
ſay any thing to <hi>S Peter</hi>'s <hi>being onely over the Iews.</hi> What
could I expect other? our queſtion is about the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Iuriſdiction, what ſerve his teſtimonies for, or
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:115675:190"/>
what do they there unles they can prove that? But he
ſay's that <hi>that concluſion was proved out of Scripture;</hi> which
is a flat falſification, ſince he could neither show me one
<hi>reſtrictive</hi> word in Scripture to that purpoſe, whereas his
poſition even now put down &amp; pretended to be proved
thence is <hi>reſtrictive;</hi> nor durſt he rely upon Scripture alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
when he was to find us that ſo much deſired <hi>one word,</hi>
but was forced to peece it out with other two places from
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> &amp; <hi>Pelagius the Archeretick,</hi> To omit that
the teſtimony it ſelf Gal. 2. expreſſes nothing of any <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
for ſuch an end, as (<hi>Sect.</hi> 6.) hath been amply
shown. He adds that <hi>this from Ignatius is onely a branch
of accordance with that.</hi> In the name of wonder where shall
we look for Dr. H's proofs? There is not one teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
he hath produced out of Antiquitie as yet for this
point, but he falls from it when he should maintain it, &amp;
ſay's 'tis <hi>no proof</hi> but onely <hi>spoken in agreement,</hi> or (as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

and <hi>a ſeaſonable advertiſſement.</hi> Come along Reader let
thee and I go hunt after Dr. H's proofs for this point from
the firſt ſtarting it; To trace it ſtep by ſtep, we begin with
<hi>of Schiſm,</hi> c. 4 par. 4. where he ſay's that queſtion of
<hi>S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>ſupremacy muſt be managed by Evidences, &amp; ſo
concluded either on the one ſide or the other;</hi> profeſſing the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
that he <hi>began to offer his Evidence for the Negative.</hi> Let
us not deſpair then of theſe <hi>Evidences</hi> &amp; <hi>proofs</hi> ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
promis't us, but addreſſe our ſelves for their queſt.
The fifth par. begins thus; <hi>And firſt it is evident by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
S. Peter was the Apoſtle of the Circumciſion or Iews
excluſively to the Vncircumciſion or Gentiles.</hi> Here we ſe
the point to be <hi>evidenced,</hi> and <hi>from Scripture.</hi> Now in
this par. (which hath ſuch a fair promiſing beginning)
there are two places of Scripture, the famous <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, both which he denies to be Evidences
<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 38. But to proceed: The 6. par. begins with an
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:115675:190"/>
                  <hi>If,</hi> proceeds with a <hi>parentheſis, agreable</hi> onely as hee the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
expreſſes it; and ſo, according to him, <hi>no proof.</hi> The
reſt are his own words onely till we come at <hi>S. Iames,</hi>
and the proofs following till we come to the end of the
par. are not in order to the main point, but onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
that <hi>Iames at Hieruſalem was conſider'd as a Bishop</hi>
(which was out of queſtion between us) as himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
his owne meaning <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 43. <hi>l.</hi> 27. The reſt of
that as alſo the next parag. proceeds with <hi>Accordingly,</hi> p.
74. <hi>l.</hi> 4. and again, <hi>Accordingly</hi> ibid. lin. 20. <hi>According</hi>
p 75. lin. 22. which show that all theſe were not proofs,
but things ſpoken <hi>in agreement,</hi> or <hi>branches of accordan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi>
onely. Five teſtimonies follow par. 9. in order to thoſe
two Apoſtles planting the Church at Rome; which he
expreſly denies to be proofs of this our point <hi>Anſw</hi> p.
49. <hi>l.</hi> 32. 33. and ſayes they are ſpoken <hi>in agreement</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as alſo the next three which are found in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the tenth, though one of them be here call'd an
<hi>Irrefragable Evidence.</hi> But let us purſve our game. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
teſtimonies over paſt, the next from Scripture are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc't
with <hi>Agreable,</hi> and ſo are meant to be <hi>in agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
onely and <hi>no proofs.</hi> The 11th par. begins with <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly</hi>
again, which leads in the late-ill-treated teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from <hi>Ignatius,</hi> deny'd here <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 53. to be a proof
for the pretended point, and expreſt to be <hi>onely a branch
of accordance</hi> lin. 26. The reſt of the 11th par. is his own
<hi>Scho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are nothing but his owne words relating to the
former <hi>onely accordant no proofs;</hi> and ſo being meerly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary
<hi>accordances</hi> or thin deductions from the other,
can have no more force then their aiery Parents. And if
we look narrowly into them we shall finde the whole
ſtrength of the one conſiſts in the words [<hi>by all which it

<hi>S. Iohn</hi> over the <hi>Iews alſo,</hi> and not <hi>S. Peter</hi> over the <hi>Iews
onely,</hi> and that <hi>Timothy</hi> was over Gentiles, but not a word
that he was over <hi>Gentiles onely</hi> there found. In the 16 par.
he huddles together a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of his own dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds; which,
I conceive, are not things like proofs. Though I confeſſe
towards the middle of it he hath a moſt pregnant proof,
and enough to make his honeſt Proteſtant Reader as
glad as if he had found an Hare ſitting; but, when Schiſm
Diſarm'd brought him nearer it, it proved to be nothing
but a brown clodd. It was his moſt ample &amp; moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portantly-expreſſive
Scripture-teſtimony from the bare
monoſyllable <hi>Come.</hi> The 17. par. hath no pretence of
proofs; Nor yet his 18th, but is totally built upon his
own words, [<hi>The ſame may certainly be ſaid</hi>] and [<hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Controverſy; the next par. that is the 20th begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a new buſines; that is, the donation of the Keyes.
All the teſtimonies then hitherto related are <hi>accordances</hi>

means is beſt known from himſelf, <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 49. <hi>l.</hi> 32.)
that they are <hi>not proofs</hi> of the thing they agree to; that is,
have no influence to conclude or infer it to be ſo, whence
follows that the ſaid teſtimonies are in themſelves indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to the main point, and onely appliable to it; the
ſleighteſt manner of arguing that ever was argued by any
man for ſuch an important point, whoſe Soul a ſecurity
in his Schiſm hath not made ſleepy.</p>
               <p>But, let us ſee to what theſe indifferent &amp; nothing-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>accordances</hi> relate and <hi>agree</hi> to; that is, let us ſee
what is his onely proof for his main point. He intimates

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:115675:191"/>
To it then let us go, as being his onely proof he ſtands to
for this point, which therefore we have purpoſely reſerv'd
till the laſt. We finde it in the beginning of parag. 7. <hi>of

as he expreſly pretended <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 53. <hi>l.</hi> 22. from the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
or elſe the following verſes. Thirdly, this particular
Commiſſion hath already (<hi>Sect.</hi> 6.) been shown from

aſſiſtance. Fourthly, here is not the leaſt news of
<hi>S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>own confeſſion &amp; acknowledgment</hi> of any thing,

after his citation of this verſe, which manifeſts this to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
been the place pretended for his <hi>onely proof,</hi> to which
the reſt <hi>accorded.</hi> Laſtly, this being then his ſolely-relied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>proof,</hi> after what a ſtrange manner he manages it? one
would think that he should have put down the words, and
either have show'd them expreſſe; or elſe, if they were
not, make his deductions from them: what does this
acute-ſincere man; he omits wholy the words; gravely
and ſleightly touches the falſe ſence he hath given, them;
puts downe his owne tenet, ſubjoins to it the words [S.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>own confeſſion and acknowledgment</hi>] pretends them
to be Scripture; &amp; immediately cites the place, where
no ſuch words were found. Was ever ſuch a weak Soul
put into a body; and yet this is the man cry'd up for the
beſt of the Proteſtant Controvertiſts.</p>
               <p>Thus ends the ſlender-ſented purſuit of Dr. H's <hi>proofs</hi>
for this main fundamentall point of his, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was
not over the Gentiles. The reſult of which is, that all
the Teſtimonies he alledged for it are <hi>no proofs</hi> but dwind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>accordances</hi> onely; and his <hi>onely proof</hi> Gal. 2. both
impertinent &amp; falſified. So rotten are all Dr. H's <hi>bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of accordances</hi> and alſo the ſaples tree it ſelf, whence
thoſe ſoon-blaſted Imps Sprouted.</p>

way to reconcile thoſe repugnants of ſtory concerning Linus

               <p>Dr. H. <hi>of Schiſm</hi> c. 4. par. 13. affirmed that <hi>for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great part of the Chriſtian world It is manifeſt that
S. Peter had never to do, either mediately or immediately,

this is manifeſtly evinced by the teſtimonies annexed p.

               <p>I shall put down all his teſtimonies as largely as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
did in the 14. par. to which he refers me. The firſt is
from <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>he admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
the Churches there.</hi> Now, in theſe three teſtimonies
we finde onely that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> appointed Bishops in <hi>Aſia,</hi>
which we grant that each Apoſtle might do where ever
he came over all the world; that he obtained one certain
lott or Bishoprick, to wit that of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
no more but that he was a particular Governour
there; that he adminiſtred the Churches there; all which
is competent to every Metropolitan in God's Church,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:115675:193"/>
whom yet wee ſee daily with our eyes to be under an hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
Eccleſiaſticall Governour, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
under him are under the ſame Governour <hi>mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
although <hi>immediately</hi> under the inferior onely. His
fourth teſtimony is a flat &amp; wilfull falſification; 'Tis ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from <hi>S. Proſper,</hi> &amp; put down by him thus, <hi>Ioannes
apud Epheſum Eccleſiam ſacrauit, Iohn at Epheſus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
a Church.</hi> Whereas the place it ſelf is <hi>Gentium
Eccleſiam ſacrauit, conſecrated the Church of the Gentiles.</hi>
Now becauſe all over this par. 'tis Dr. H's pretence that
<hi>S. Iohn</hi> was at <hi>Epheſus</hi> over <hi>Iews onely,</hi> and the word
<hi>Gentium</hi> would by no means be won to ſignify that, nor
yet would the word [<hi>Nations</hi>] (as he render'd it before)
any way ſerve to ſignify <hi>onely Iews,</hi> he prudently maim'd
the teſtimony, &amp; left out the malignant word <hi>Gentium,</hi>
becauſe it could by no art be brought to favour, but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
defy'd &amp; contradicted his party. A politick Divine!
yet as long as this rare crafts man in the art of falſifying
can but call S. W. an <hi>Artificer</hi> all is well, &amp; the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
will believe him.</p>
               <p>The teſtimonies for Timothy under <hi>S. Paul</hi> being
over the Gentiles in <hi>Aſia,</hi> are of the ſame ſtrain or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe;
the firſt of which expreſſes no more but, that <hi>he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the care of the Metropolis of Epheſus,</hi> that is, was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Metropolitan of that place. The ſecond affirms
at large that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>An whole entire Nation,
that of Aſia, was entruſted to him.</hi> Now S. W. imagining
that an <hi>whole entire Nation</hi> could not ſignify <hi>Gentiles one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
or a part of that Nation, call'd it an unpardonable
blindnes to alledge this teſtimony for a <hi>tenet</hi> quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what it expreſt; But I am ſuddenly ſtruck blind
my ſelf and caught that diſeaſe onely by ſeeing Dr. H's
blindnes. And firſt, I am blind for not ſeeing that the
teſtimony related to <hi>Timothy &amp; not to S. Paul;</hi> whereas
himſelf promiſing us in the end of his 13. par. to inſiſt on
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:115675:194"/>
                  <hi>S. Iohn</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and after he had treated of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in
the 14th uſing theſe very words in the 15. <hi>throughout all the
Lydian Aſia the faith was planted by S. Paul among the
Gentile part and by him Timothy conſtituted Bishop there;</hi>
and then immediately introducing his teſtimony with <hi>ſo
ſaith Chryſoſtome,</hi> he muſt be blind who could think this
teſtimony was not mean't of <hi>S. Paul.</hi> Add that the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
it ſelf ſpeaks not of <hi>conſtituting a Bishop,</hi> &amp; ſo gave
me no occaſion to imagin it related to Timothy's being
thus conſtituted; and beſides, the words (<hi>throughout all
Aſia</hi>) which he joyns there with <hi>S. Paul,</hi> were fitteſt to
be related to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the teſtimony. Nor, can it
be pretended to have been an affected overſight; ſince I
gain not the leaſt advantage by it, it being equally ſtrong
for Dr. H's weak argument whether <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>S. Paul</hi>
were onely over Gentiles there, for which it was produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
My ſecond blindnes is that I could not ſee the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Anſwer, which is that <hi>S. Chryſoſtome puts it onely
in oppoſition to the word</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, precedent; the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
being) as he afterwards puts it) that <hi>Timothy was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a Church,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an entire Nation.</hi> Now in the book of Schiſm he
omitted himſelf the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the former part
of the teſtimony, &amp; then tells me 'tis obvious it was put
in oppoſition to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſo I am become blind for
not ſeeing that which was not at all there, but left out by
himſelf. Gramercy good Dr. When he ſay's that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>is not ſet to denote all the ſeverall ſorts of caetus in Aſia;</hi>
I ask, do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s it exclude any, or is it ſet in oppoſition to the
Iews? if not, how can it poſſibly ſignifie the <hi>Gentile part
onely,</hi> for which hee produced it? my blindnes then,
Reader, conſiſts in this that I would not renounce the
moſt common light of nature, &amp; think that an <hi>whole</hi>
&amp; a <hi>part</hi> is the ſame; nor conſent to believe that the
words (<hi>an whole entire Nation</hi>) ſignifie <hi>one ſort</hi> of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:115675:194"/>
people living there or <hi>part</hi> of that Nation onely.</p>
               <p>In order to theſe late teſtimonies it is to be obſerved,
firſt, that our tenet makes the Pope over the whole
Church in this ſence (not that he governs each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church immediately but) that he is chief in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
&amp; over thoſe inferior Bishops, Metropolitans,
&amp;c. who are the immediate Governours of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Churches, and ſo he becomes <hi>mediately</hi> in this
ſence over all Churches, or the whole Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly our parallel tenet of <hi>S. Peter</hi> is not that when
he was Apoſtle he could preach in more places then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but that he had an higher Authority then the other,
each of which could preach in any or all places of the
world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that when he was fixt Bishop, he had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of Authority over any other Apoſtles when they
were fixt Bishops in other places, not that he was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Bishop or Metropolitan of their particular Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hence is evident that the proofs which can
prejudice this point muſt ſignifie that thoſe particular
Apoſtles, Metropolitans, or Bishops, had none ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to themſelves, and by conſequence who were <hi>media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y</hi>
over their Churches, and that it avails nothing at all
nor comes to the point to prove that ſuch &amp; ſuch were
over ſuch &amp; ſuch particular Iuriſdictions <hi>immediately:</hi>
no more than if ſome writer 500. years hence should ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
that the Pope was not in the year 1650. Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
in our Church, becauſe he findes at that time
ſuch a one Primate in <hi>France,</hi> &amp; another Arch-bishop
of <hi>Toledo</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is no leſſe evident that Dr. H's pretence
that <hi>it is manifeſt that S. Peter had nothing to do either me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
or immediately in governing the Churches of Aſia,</hi>
from the former teſtimonies which expreſt onely that
thoſe Churches, or that country were under thoſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:115675:195"/>
or Bishops, without a Syllable ſignifying that thoſe
Apoſtles themſelves were not vnder an higher Apoſtle,
and ſo their Churches <hi>mediately</hi> ſubject to him; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
I ſay, that he hath not produc't a word to prove
his poſition except his own, <hi>It is manifeſt;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it was no <hi>artificiall</hi> trick, but plain downright
naturall Truth to challenge him with that palpable weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, his whole proceſſe is in another reſpect totally
impertinent &amp; frivolous. His fundamentall intent was to
limit the Iuriſdictions of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as ſuch; &amp; to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
them mutually-excluſive under that notion, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to each proper <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> Provinces; and here,
proceeding to make good that his intent, he proves them
limitted as they were <hi>Bishops;</hi> which is a quite different
thing. For every <hi>Bishop,</hi> as ſuch, is over his own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
flock and particulariz'd to it; where as that of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle;</hi>
being not a ſettled Authority as the other, hath
not in it's own nature any ground to be conſtant to ſuch,
but may be promiſcuous to all. Though it was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to any Apoſtle to ſettle himſelf in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſeat, &amp; ſo become a Bishop of that place.</p>
               <p>The reſult then of all the former teſtimonies is this,
that Dr. H. avoyd's the whole queſtion of the <hi>mediate
Government</hi> of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> which is the point his Adverſary
holds, and diſproves the <hi>immediate</hi> onely which wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
held, and, when he hath done, tells his Readers <hi>Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>
p. 56. <hi>S. W. hath little care to conſider that, wherein the
difficulty conſiſts;</hi> when as himſelf never toucht the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
at all.</p>
               <p>But I had forgot the beginning of his 14. par. that <hi>S.
Iohn had the dignity of place before all other in Chriſt's life
time, even before S. Peter himſelf.</hi> Now I went about to
parallell it by the proportion an elder Brother hath to a
younger, which is a precedence without Iuriſdiction, &amp;
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:115675:195"/>
ſo reſembles Dr. H's dry Primacy. But the Dr. (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p.
55.) catches my ſimilitude by one of thoſe feet by which
it was not pretended to run, add's to it <hi>excellencie of power</hi>
of his own head which was never named nor inſiſted on
by me, and when he hath done ſay's that <hi>'tis an addition
of my fertile fancy;</hi> whereas I never pretended it as his
words but my parallell; nor yet put force in the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
of Iuriſdiction, but in that of a dry precedency
onely: neither meaning nor expreſſing any more by <hi>hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſt
in dignity,</hi> than himſelf did by <hi>dignity of place before
all others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his Anſw. p. 54 he tells us he mention'd two things
of <hi>Iohn. 1. of Chriſt's favour to him,</hi> and this (he ſay's)
is <hi>infallibly inferr'd from the title of beloved Diſciple.</hi> I ſtand
not upon the thing, both becauſe 'tis unconcerning our
queſtion, &amp; true in it ſelf; onely I am glad to ſee that
Dr. H. is more certain in his inferences than his Church
is of her faith; ſince he is confident of his <hi>infallibility</hi> in
thoſe; whereas, in this, to wit, in faith, he onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm's
that <hi>it is not ſtrongly probable his Church will erre,
Repl.</hi> p. 16. At length, Proteſtant Reader, thou ſeeſt
whether thou art to recurre for thy infallible Rule of
faith; to wit, to Dr. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s <hi>inferences.</hi> The ſecond is <hi>S. Iohn's
dignity of place before all others,</hi> which (he ſay's) <hi>was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragably
concluded from the leaning in his breaſt at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
Here again Dr. H. is <hi>irrefragable</hi> &amp; <hi>infallible;</hi> yet
he no where reads that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> thus lean'd on <hi>Chriſt's</hi>
breaſt more then once: nor can we imagin that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
taught his Diſciples that complementalnes as to
ſit conſtantly in their ranks at meat, ſeeing that in this

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:115675:196"/>
Is not he that ſitteth at meat? But I am among you as he
that ſerveth.</hi> So far was our Saviour from giving occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for over weening by any conſtant partiality of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them at table, that his expreſſe doctrine and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was to bring them to an humle indifferency, and that
in ſerving one another, much more in ſitting before or
after another.</p>
               <p>But, to return to Dr. H. as he is <hi>Maſter of ceremonies</hi>
to the Apoſtles, &amp; places them at table; His doctrine is
that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had <hi>a Primacy of order</hi> onely amongſt the
Apoſtles without Iuriſdiction, which conſequently could
be nothing but a dry complementary precedency to
walk, ſtand, or ſpeak firſt, &amp;c. for no greater Primacy
can be imagin'd, nor in higher matters, if we abſtract
(as he does) from Iuriſdiction. Again, his doctrine is
likewiſe that <hi>S. Iohn at table had the dignity of place before
all others even before</hi> S. <hi>Peter himſelf;</hi> ſo that to make his
doctrine conſonant, we muſt conceive that <hi>S. John</hi> had
a Primacy of order before <hi>S. Peter</hi> and the reſt <hi>in ſitting,</hi>
&amp; <hi>S. Peter</hi> had a Primacy of order before the reſt &amp; <hi>S.
Iohn</hi> too <hi>in ſtanding</hi> or <hi>walking</hi> A rare doctor! 'Tis a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that he gave not <hi>Iudas</hi> alſo a kinde of Primacy befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
all the Apoſtles in a third reſpect, to wit, in <hi>dipping</hi>
with out Saviour at the ſame time <hi>in the dish;</hi> ſince the
<hi>leaning</hi> on Chriſt's breaſt was done no after then the <hi>dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi>
in the dish was, for any thing we read, both were
equally accidentall, for any thing we know (for we finde
it no where expreſt that our Saviour plac't him or he
himſelf there by deſign,) And in this the <hi>dipping</hi> argues
more dignity then the <hi>ſitting,</hi> in that the <hi>ſitting</hi> was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>next</hi> our Saviour, but the <hi>dipping was at the ſame time:</hi>
which would haue grounded an <hi>infal ible</hi> and <hi>irrefragable
inference</hi> for Dr. H. that <hi>Iudas</hi> had an abſolute Primacy,
and have ſerved him rarely to over throw <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s, had
it not hapt that <hi>Iudas</hi> was in other reſpects malignant,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:115675:196"/>
and ſo it was not the Drs intereſt to own the argument.
But Dr. H. proceeds. <hi>And accordingly it unavoydably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
that Lazarus, being repreſented parabolically in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
boſome, is there deſcribed to be in the next place to the
father of the faithfull, and it being certain that ſome one or
more ſaints are next Abraham, I preſume we may believe
Chriſt that Lazarus is capable of that place, all S.</hi> W. <hi>ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
have not the leaſt validity in them.</hi> Obſerve the ſolid
Logick of this man. My ſcruples or objections were
<hi>Schiſm Diſarm.</hi> p. 79. that if being in Abrahams boſome
<q>were being in dignity of place <hi>next</hi> to the father of the
faith full, it follow'd that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was a bove all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
and Prophets except <hi>Abraham:</hi> As alſo, that
none was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome except <hi>Lazarus</hi> onely,
ſince there could be no more <hi>Nexts</hi> but one.</q> Inſtead
of anſwering he repeats what he had ſaid before; onely
he add's fine words to amuze his Readers (whom he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
muſt be fools) as <hi>Accordingly, unavoydably, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolitically,
it being certain,</hi> I <hi>preſume we may believe
Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. gentilely, calls my objections, <hi>ſcruples,</hi> &amp;
then aſſures the Reader <hi>they have not the leaſt validity in
them.</hi> But, if we ask, where did <hi>Chriſt</hi> ever ſay that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
was above all the Patriarchs &amp; Prophets except
<hi>Abraham,</hi> truth would anſwer us that <hi>Chriſt</hi> never ſaid
any ſuch thing, but one Dr. H. who, like a more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
kinde of <hi>David George,</hi> calls his own words. <hi>Chriſt's,</hi>
his own ſayings God's word when he liſts. And as for <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of glory,</hi> which he talks of here, I wonder what
would become of them if his doctrine should take place;
for ſince he knows well the Ancient fathers conſtantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that all the former faithfull were in the boſome of
Abraham, and this according to him (as being <hi>next</hi>
Abraham) ſignifies dignity of place before all others, it
follows that all the multitude of faith full Souls had <hi>each</hi>
of them the dignity of place before all others; that is, each
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:115675:197"/>
of them was <hi>next Abraham</hi> &amp; higheſt; hemming him in
(as you muſt conjecture) on every ſide, without any
more priority of order between them than the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
make between the right hand &amp; the left in a round
pillar. And thus much at preſent (which is as much or
more than ſuch trifling non-ſence deſerves) for <hi>Infallible,
irrefragable, according, unavoydable, Parabolicall, Chriſt-pretending,
all-ſcruples invalidating</hi> Dr. H.</p>

               <p>IN his book <hi>of Schiſm</hi> c. 4. par. 16. Dr. H. demanded
very confidently of the Romaniſts <hi>what could be ſaid
in any degree probably for S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>univerſall Paſtorship over
this Aſia whoſe ſeven Metropoles are ſo early famous, being
honoured with Chriſt's Epiſtle to the Revelations.</hi> Now S.
W. as any ordinary Reader would, imagin'd that Dr. H.
put ſome force in theſe latter words to prove the former,
that <hi>S. Peter had nothing to do with them,</hi> both becauſe
theſe are the onely poſitive words in the whole paragraph
all the reſt being interrogatories onely, as alſo becauſe I
could not gheſſe what they did there elſe, unles it were to
divert the Readers eye from the queſtion by ſuch imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
expreſſions, nor had I obſerved yet that Dr. H.
was ſuch a ſtrong reaſoner, as to think a proof even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his <hi>tenet</hi> much leſſe impertinent, unworthy his
method of arguing.</p>
               <p>He pretends to have mean't nothing by thoſe words
ſave onely that <hi>thoſe ſeven were conſiderable parts of the
univerſall Church,</hi> as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> wrote Epiſtles to Churches,
not becauſe they ſtood need, but becauſe they were bigg ones.
But let them be <hi>conſiderable,</hi> what then: he ſay's
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:115675:197"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 57. <hi>there is no pretence that S. Peter should be ſaid</hi>

there is the ſame pretence that he was <hi>mediate</hi> Governor

but repeating to show it notorius; 'Tis this (<hi>of Schiſm</hi>
p. 83.) <hi>doth not S. Paul give Timothy full inſtructions and
ſuch as no other Apoſtle could countermand or interpoſe in
them, leaving no other Apoſtle or place of application for
farther directions, ſave onely to himſelf when he shall come
to him, 1. Tim.</hi> 3. 14. 15. Here, Reader, thou ſeeſt terms
moſt reſtrictive of Iuriſdiction, &amp; ſo moſt nay ſolely-important

&amp;c. <hi>no other Appeall, no farther directions, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Thou ſeeſt, I ſay, theſe; and thou ſeeſt
likewiſe the place of Scripture quoted immediately for
all theſe. Now, <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd</hi> p. 81. show'd from their
own tranſlation that there was not one word of this long
rabble in the place alledged, but the bare, barren &amp; uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
monoſyllable <hi>Come.</hi> Is it poſſible now that any man
should go about to cloak ſuch a falſification, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:115675:198"/>
as clear as eyeſight had manifeſted in it's moſt sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
full nakednes? nothing is impoſſible to be done in Dr.
H's way.</p>
               <p>He excuſes himſelf firſt <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 57. <hi>l.</hi> 9. becauſe <hi>he
thought it was concluſible from thoſe words, 1. Tim.</hi> 3. 14. 15.
But who bad him <hi>think</hi> ſo, when there was never a word
in the teſtimony or in the whole Epiſtle but might have
been ſaid by a Metropolitan to a Bishop, or a Bishop to
any Prieſt; to wit, that he would <hi>order things when he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi>
bidding him <hi>be have himſelf well,</hi> &amp;c. Again, if he
intended to <hi>conclude,</hi> why did he not put ſome expreſſion
of that his intent, that the Reader might not be deluded
by his quoting the place immediately after thoſe words:
This pretence therefore is moſt frivolous &amp; vain. Firſt,
becauſe his words are poſitive, abſolute, &amp;, as it were,
commanding our aſſent from the Authority of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
not expreſt like an <hi>inference</hi> or <hi>concluſion; doth not S.
Paul,</hi> &amp;c. as alſo becauſe they are relations of matters
of <hi>fact;</hi> and, laſtly, becauſe they who <hi>conclude</hi> from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
put the place firſt, &amp; then deduce from it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas,
he quotes the place after his own words, as we uſe
to do for words found really in Scripture; wherefore,
either he intended not to <hi>conclude</hi> but to gull the honeſt
Reader that his ſole important forgeries were ſure Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
or elſe, if he meant to <hi>conclude,</hi> he very wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put his <hi>concluſion</hi> before the <hi>premiſes,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi>
as had but one unconcerning &amp; uſeles word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to it &amp; the <hi>premiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, he tells us, that <hi>to ſay that he inferr'd the
whole concluſion from the word come is one of S. W's arts</hi>
whereas I charged him not for <hi>inferring</hi> thence, but for
putting down thoſe words for pure Scripture. Again,
himſelf (ſo good is his memory) confeſſes this ſame thing
ſeven or eight lines before, which he here renounces;
where having mention'd the former long rabble, he told
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:115675:198"/>
us in expreſſe terms that <hi>he thought it was concluſible from
S. Paul</hi>'s <hi>words, 1. Tim.</hi> 3. 14. 15. Now then, there being
not one word of this pretended <hi>concluſion</hi> found in that
place, ſave the monoſyllable <hi>Come,</hi> nor one excluſive
particle, nor even the leaſt ground of any, he muſt either
infer his pretended concluſion from that or from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he alledges that <hi>he thought his grounds had been
viſible enough being thus laid;</hi> and then proceeds to lay
them. But the ieſt is he never layd down any ſuch preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
grounds at all in the book of Schiſm where he cited
that place, and ſo it was impoſſible they should be <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
being then, perhaps, not ſo much as in their cauſes.
And as for theſe pretended grounds they are nothing but
a kinde of explication of that place, that <hi>S. Paul ſent an
whole Epiſtle of Inſtructions,</hi> &amp; <hi>hoped to give him farther
inſtructions, that he should behave himſelf well in his office,</hi>
&amp;c. which are all competent to any Bishop in order to
a Prieſt, or to any ſubaltern Governor in reſpect of an
inferior; and ſo hinders not but <hi>S. Paul</hi> might be <hi>under
another,</hi> though thus <hi>over Timothy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, as for thoſe excluſive words, <hi>no other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
could countermand or interpoſe in them, leaving no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
no place for farther directions, onely to himſelf,</hi> which
were objected, &amp; ſo it belonged to him if he could not
show them expreſt there &amp; ſo clear his falſified citation,
at leaſt to show them <hi>concluded</hi> &amp; <hi>deduced</hi> thence, as 6.
or 7. lines before he had promiſt us. But he quite preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricates
even from <hi>deducing</hi> them thence when it comes to
the point, and inſtead of doing ſo &amp; <hi>proving</hi> them from
the pretended place, he repeats again the ſame demands
bids us prove the contrary. <hi>I now demand</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>whether S. Paul left any other Appeal or place for farther
directions ſave onely to himſelf.</hi> I anſwer, does the place
alledged ſay any thing to the contrary, or is any ſuch thing
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:115675:199"/>
                  <hi>concluſible</hi> thence, as you pretended: If it be, why do not
you make good your own proof from the place, &amp; show
this reſtrictive ſence either there in expreſſe terms, or el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
by framing your <hi>concluſion</hi> from it? why do you inſtead
of thus doing your duty, ſtand asking me the ſame que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
over again? He proceeds. <hi>Whether could any other
Apoſtle by any power given him by Chriſt countermand or
interpoſe in them?</hi> what need you ask that queſtion? you
knew long ago that our Anſwer would be affirmative that
<hi>S. Peter</hi> could, in caſe he ſaw it convenient for the good
of God's Church; or, what is the asking this queſtion
over again to the showing that the contrary was either
expreſly or <hi>concluſively</hi> there, as you pretended. <hi>If any
could, let him be named &amp; his power ſpecified,</hi> ſaith the Dr.
Is not this a rare man to counterfeit himſelf ignorant
whom we hold for Head of the Apoſtles, when as himſelf
hath from the beginning of this Chapter impugned <hi>S.
Peter</hi> as held ſuch by us! And to carry the matter as if he
delay'd his proofs till he knew our Anſwer, aſwell known
to him before hand, as his own name. It follows, <hi>&amp; let
the power be proved by virtue whereof he should thus act.</hi> I
marry: now the Dr. is ſecure, when all elſe fails he hath
conſtantly recourſe hither to hide his head. When his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
or proof is shown to bee falſify'd in the expreſſe
terms, hee pretends to <hi>conclude</hi> thence; and when 'tis
shown unable to <hi>conclude</hi> any thing, inſtead of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to make it good or show that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſible from then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
which he promiſed, he leaves it of, as ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
queſtions, and bids his Anſwerer take his turn &amp;
<hi>prove;</hi> becauſe he (alas) is graveld and cannot go a ſtep
further. This done he triumphs. <hi>But S.</hi> W. <hi>dares not, I
am ſure doth not affirm this.</hi> What <hi>dare not</hi> I, and <hi>do not</hi> I
affirm? that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had power over the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
in things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the good of the univerſall Church.
'Tis my expreſſe <hi>tenet,</hi> which he is at preſent impugning;
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:115675:199"/>
and which I both <hi>do affirm</hi> &amp; <hi>dare</hi> maintaine (ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
is Truth) againſt Dr H. though back't by forty mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
learned then himſelf. But this politick Adverſary of
mine, ſeeing he could not argue me out of my faith,
would needs fright me or perſuade me from it, threat'ning
me firſt that I <hi>dare not;</hi> next, aſſuring mee that I <hi>do not
affirm i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> This ſolid diſcourſe premiſed, hee shuts up with
an acclamation of victory thus: <hi>And, if it cannot be ſaid
(as no doubt it cannot) then where was S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>ſupreme
Paſtorship?</hi> Where all the force of this upshot of his
lies in the <hi>If,</hi> and <hi>no doubt,</hi> both of them equally addle
&amp; frivolous, ſince himſelf &amp; all the world knows very
well that we both <hi>can</hi> &amp; <hi>do</hi> affirm &amp; hold that <hi>S. Peter</hi>
was Superior in Authoritie to all the reſt of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</p>
               <p>Thus Dr. Hr. toyes it with his Readers, hoping that
the greater part of them will be arrant fools. Firſt, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down a company of expreſſions totally diſanulling
<hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Authority, and immediately quoting for them,
1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14. 15. Next, when he is challenged of falſifying,
inſtead of showing any word there more then the poor
monoſyllable <hi>Come,</hi> ſaying, <hi>he onely mean't it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſible</hi>
or deducible thence. And laſtly, inſtead of <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
proving, or deducing that Iuriſdiction limiting ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
from thoſe words, which at leaſt was neceſſary, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaying the ſame words over again, asking ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
to which he knew the anſwer long ago, bidding his
Anſwerer ſupply his turn &amp; <hi>prove,</hi> telling us we <hi>dare not</hi>
&amp; <hi>do not</hi> affirm what his own knowledge &amp; what his own
eyes aſſure him we both <hi>dare</hi> &amp; <hi>do</hi> in this very preſent
Controverſy, and then concluding all with an <hi>If</hi> built

grounded upon his own fancy. Is ſuch an Adverſary
worth the loſſe of an hour's time to confute! were it not
that the Authority he hath got by a ſleightly-connected

<q>a <hi>Teſtimony Evidence (Schiſm Diſarm.</hi> p. 88.)</q> was this,
that the teſtimony it ſelf muſt be authentick beyond

Whether he likes this definition of a Teſtimony Evidence
or no, he is reſolu'd wee shall not know. He dares not
be negative or ſay he diſlikes it, becauſe, what ever te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
falls short of this, falls short likewiſe of proving

<hi>may be;</hi> which being too weak a ground in the iudgment
of every prudent Conſcientious man to hazard his Soul
upon, as he muſt if he begin to Schiſmatize upon no
better Grounds, he ſaw it could turn to his diſgrace if he
deny'd the notion given, or pretended that leſſe Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
would ſerve in a Controverſy about Schiſm: nor durſt
he bee affirmative or approve of it, becauſe he ſaw he
had not produced one teſtimony in his whole book
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:115675:201"/>

               <p>Wherefore being in this perplexity, and (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb

of my Deſcription of an <hi>Evidence,</hi> tells me (<hi>Anſw.</hi>
p. 58.) what he meant by his own <hi>Evidences;</hi> to wit, that
<hi>he takes Evidence in the familiar vulgar notion for a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

Teſtimonies in the words? or cannot a Negative teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
teſtify a Negative point without neceſſarily recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to ſolve Affirmatives? Wee were taught in Logick
to prove Negatives by concluding in <hi>Celarent</hi> or <hi>Ferio,</hi>
without being forc't neceſſarily to ſtand anſwering the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
in <hi>Barbara</hi> and <hi>Darij</hi> for the Affirmative: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas,
according to Dr. H's new Logick, the onely way
to prove a Negative point muſt be to ſolve the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
proofs. To omit that it shall bee shown preſently
how the ſolving Affirmatives, was <hi>no one way</hi> to teſtify a
Negative.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Again, he was shown by <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd</hi> that this
way of arguing was rather indeed to bring obſcurity
than <hi>Evidence,</hi>
                  </q> for all that it can pretend is this, that the
concluſion follows not out of thoſe teſtimonies or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
&amp; therein is terminated it's force, nor doth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
ſo far as to prove or infer that the thing in it ſelf is
vntrue. Indeed, if it be known firſt that the Opponent
holds his <hi>tenet</hi> upon no other Grounds ſave onely that
teſtimony, and that be shown plainly to be vnable to
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:115675:202"/>
conclude, he will be obliged to relinquish his <hi>tenet</hi> ſo far
as not to hold it any more, till he ſees better ground;
yet ſtill he is not obliged to embrace, or aſſent to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
poſition, if he ſees no <hi>Evidence</hi> for it; but to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
all aſſent one way or other; and to think rather that
perhaps his may yet have other Grounds to prove it true,
for any thing he knows Much leſſe is it proved at all that
the contrary is true, though all his arguments be ſolved
till evidence be brought for it. Wherefore, as long as this
is not manifeſted, to wit that he hath no other tenour
upon which he holds his poſition, the thing is much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from being concluded, no not even <hi>ad hominem</hi> to be
falſe; for though that <hi>medium</hi> do not eſtablish it, another
may. But now, if it be manifeſt that the Adverſary builds
leaſt of all upon thoſe places the other ſolves, nay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all in the manner that the other thinks they are
to be managed and undertakes to ſolve them, then the
ſolving ſuch Teſtimonies ſinks into the miſerableſt, &amp;
loweſt degree of force, nay even as low as nothing.</p>
               <p>This being our preſent caſe, obſerve I beſeech thee
prudent Reader the infinite weaknes of this Drs diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
facultie. He firſt goes about to prove our <hi>tenet</hi> falſe
from ſolving 2. or 3 places of Scripture; whereas that
very way of arguing can infer no more, but that thoſe
places conclude not for it; nor are places of Scripture ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that we build upon at all for our faith, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
by wit, in which ſence he impugns them, but
onely as they are explicable by univerſall Tradition, our
Rule of faith. Since then Dr. H. not ſo much as pretends
to ſolve them according to the ſence which Tradition gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
them (for he no where pretends to shew that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
&amp; practice of immediate forefathers did not
ever give them this ſence) 'tis evident he hath not in this
proceſſe impugned our faith at all, ſeeing he impugns no
tenour nor argument at all upon which we build, or hold
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:115675:203"/>
our faith Indeed, our Drs undertake ſometimes to argue
<hi>ad hominem</hi> againſt them and abſtracting from our Rule
of faith, univerſall Tradition, fall to interpret Scripture
with them proceeding upon other Grounds, to wit, upon
private skill &amp; learning, to shew our advantage over them
in their own, and to them the onely way. If then Mr. H.
pretended onely to try his wit with our Doctors in this
place; then (were his way of procedure by ſolving Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
allowable in reaſon) I should approve of his
intention, ſo he expreſt it; But, if he ſay he mean't to
impugn our faith, or build his own, he can never pretend
it, unles he ſolve, or impugn thoſe Grounds upon which
wee build our faith. Make account then, Reader, that
that which Dr. H. and I are now about is nothing at all
to faith, but onely an exerciſe of wit and private skill;
and conſiſts in this, whether of us can make words leſt
without life &amp; ſtark dead to our hands, by Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
&amp; Criticall quibbling move more dexterouſly &amp;
smartly towards the end we drive at; and is all one as if
Lawyers should conſent to abſtract from cuſtome &amp;
knowledge of Anceſtors, and the books of the known
laws, (as I do now from Practiſe &amp; Tradition, the ſole
true Foundation of faith,) and diſpute out of ſome plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or obſcure paſſages in odde hiſtories, and ſome let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
written onely upon occaſion, as Gildas, &amp; ſome ſuch
few remnants of that time in the Reign of the Brittains,
by what laws the kingdom was then governed.</p>
               <p>Again, ſince we build not all upon places of Scripture
as explicable by private learning, it belongs not to us to
shew them evidently concluding for us, as thus explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
no more then it doth to divines to demonſtrate my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of faith by reaſon, which depend upon another
ground, to wit, <hi>Authority.</hi> Wee acquit our ſelves well if
wee shew that, what is there, is conſiſtent with our faith;
as divines do, if they can show myſteries conſiſtent with
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:115675:203"/>
and not contradictory to reaſon; and wee do more then
the neceſſity of our cauſe, or reaſon obligeth us to, if
wee shew them rather ſounding to our advantage as thus
explicable. For, how can any man be bound in reaſon
to show that thing ſounding in his behalf, upon which
neither he nor his cauſe relies? whereas, it belongeth to
the Proteſtants, who rely upon Scripture explicable by
private wit for their faith, to prove evidently that it is for
them, and bears no probability againſt them. In the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
manner, as when Catholikes go about to prove their
faith from Scripture as explicable by Tradition, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them to shew that explication infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
becauſe they rely upon it as the Rule of their faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly, Dr. H. was charged with a palpable iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſnes
in making the anſwering our places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

doubt but Dr. H. inherits his father <hi>Calvin's</hi> faults, &amp;
ſo deſerves the ſame reprehenſion. But, how dealt <hi>Dr.

                     </gap>n?</hi> why <hi>he call'd
a Text of Scripture the moſt important place, becauſe it was
not mention'd,</hi> So ſayes <hi>Mr. Calvin's</hi> friend, Dr. H if
wee will beleeve him; but, till he proves it better then
by onely ſaying it, wee shall take libertie to think that
friendship blindes. Next, he tells us he hath given <hi>ſome
account</hi> Rep. Sect. 8. n. 10. <hi>why hee had done us no injury
in omitting it;</hi> and indeed, 'tis onely <hi>ſome account;</hi> for he
tells us there ſleightly no more than this, that <hi>firſt, by
the very poſition of it: but, ſecondly, more by the occaſion;
and yet more, Thirdly, by the matter of the words that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
is prejudged from being any more than an Exhortation to
S. Peter to diſcharge his duty.</hi> But, is there no particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in order to <hi>S. Peter?</hi> An hard caſe, that after thrice

ſaing, <hi>Simon Son of Ionas loueſt thou me? more than theſe?</hi>
(and there upon) <hi>feed thou my sheep,</hi> nothing should be
yet ſpoken in order to <hi>S. Peter</hi> in particular. The <hi>ſome
account</hi> then, which Dr. H hath rendred us in the place
related, is that he hath ſaid there three things upon his
own head &amp; proved none of them; which (as I take it)
is to give <hi>no account at all.</hi> His anſwers to it in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
shall be replied to other where. Thirdly, he aſſures
us that <hi>his reaſon of omitting it was by him with perfect truth
rendred</hi> p. 93. <hi>from his full perſuaſion that it had ſo very
litle appearance of Strength in it, and had been ſo often anſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wer'd
that it would not be deemed vſefull to any that hee
should deſcend to it.</hi> Let us examin a litle Dr. H's <hi>perfect
truth.</hi> I ask, had he reckon'd all the numerous places in
Controvertiſts where this &amp; other texts had been anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wet'd,
&amp; found that this had been far ofter replied to? if
he did not, how can he affirm it, or alledge this for his
excuſe? if he did) which I confeſſe is a task very proper
for his (<hi>Genius</hi>) why does not he show us tables of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
how many times the one, &amp; how many times the
other hath been vrged? till which time, he gives us lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
to beleeve that it is as incredible he hath done it, as it
were ridiculous to have done it. Again, me thinks rea<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on
should tell him, that if it were oftner anſwered, it was oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
vrged; and that it had not been oftner vrged without
having ſome more appearance of truth in it, then the reſt,
which yet the other part of his excuſe denies. If he ſay,
that it was vrged more prevalently; ſtill, it will ly at his
dore that it was more worthy his taking notice of: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
to excuſe himſelf, he indites his fellow-Proteſtan'<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
of plain folly in anſwering that place oftner, which on
the one ſide had very litle apperance of truth in it, and
on the other ſide had been neither very often, nor very
prevalently vrged. Fourthly, he asks <hi>if there be any far<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
inviſible reſerve in that place not taken notice of by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Hart in the conference with Dr. Reynolds,</hi> I anſwer; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I was not by; nor shall I credit a relation which their

from which being</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſoon beaten by evidence</hi> (This
<hi>Evidence,</hi> I conceive, was ſome nothing-proving <hi>branch

a great wit to bring ſuch unauthoriz'd &amp; unlikely trifles
for his excuſe? yet neceſſity (alas) hath no law: He tells

a thing which he can never make good; and is in it ſelf
the moſt unlikely truth and the likelieſt fiction that can
be imagined.</p>
               <p>Thirdly Dr. H. was charged of manifeſtly calumniating
the Catholikes in calling their <hi>tenet</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the power

about to diſcharge his credit and Conſcience by shewing

had <hi>ſome particular power of Keyes,</hi> &amp; ſayes he mean't
onely that this particular power was <hi>a peculiarity &amp; inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of S. Peter.</hi> That the Catholike <hi>tenet,</hi> &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mine is that he had ſuch a particular degree of power
of the Keyes promiſed, and given him, I willingly gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
and, had Dr. H. expreſt ſo much there, he had not been
charged with <hi>Calumny;</hi> but if he expreſt no ſuch thing
there, nay carried it ſo, as if wee had held that no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
had the Keyes but <hi>S. Peter,</hi> then all the emptie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishnes
in his <hi>Reply</hi> &amp; <hi>Anſwer</hi> will avail nothing to clear
him from ſo groſſe a fault.</p>
               <p>Now, my reaſons why I charged him with the ſaid
<hi>Calumny</hi> are theſe, becauſe <hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 86. Speaking of
<hi>the Donation of the power of the Keyes</hi> in an unlimitted &amp;
univerſall expreſſion, he ſays of himſelf, that <hi>this power</hi>
Math. 16. 19. <hi>is promiſed to S. Peter;</hi> by which words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
he muſt mean the power of the Keyes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
for it is oppoſite to his <hi>tenet</hi> to ſay that any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
degree of that power was promiſed that Apoſtle.
This done he puts down the text of Scripture, I <hi>will give
unto thee the Keyes,</hi> &amp;c. and then ſubjoyns theſe words. <hi>But
to him that from hence pretends this Donative, &amp; conſequent
power as a peculiarity &amp; incloſure of S. Peter</hi>'s, <hi>theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
will be of force to ſuperſede his concluſion.</hi> Now,
what this <hi>Donative</hi> and <hi>power</hi> was meant of, is ſufficiently
expreſt before, to wit the power of the Keyes in generall
without any reſtriction or particularization. Wherefore,
it is moſt manifeſt from his own words that he would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
made the honeſt Reader beleeve our <hi>tenet</hi> was that the
power of the Keyes in generall &amp; common was <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s
<hi>peculiarity &amp; incloſure.</hi> Secondly, one of his conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to <hi>ſuperſede our concluſion</hi> (as he calls it) were two
places of Scripture, expreſſing onely that the Keyes were
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:115675:205"/>
given to all the Apoſtles in common, but nothing at all
that they were given equally to all; wherefore they can
no wayes impugn the inequality of <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s having ſuch
a power, but onely <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s having it <hi>alone;</hi> ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be imagin'd plainer then that the ſame Notion
of a thing may plurally agree to many, and yet in une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
degrees notwithſtanding, there being almoſt as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Inſtances of it, as there are things in the world. Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
therefore it is that he impugned <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s having the
power of the Keyes alone, and ſo calumniated us in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting
that to be our <hi>tenet,</hi> &amp; impugning it as ſuch,
unles perhaps he will ſay hee inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to impugn nothing
at all. Thirdly, what means the word [<hi>incluſive</hi>] Is it not
(if applied to <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s having the power of the Keyes
(as it is by him) as plain an expreſſion as could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
to ſignify none had that power but <hi>S. Peter?</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
therefore it is that he intended to make his Reader
beleeve that wee held ſuch an abſurd Poſition, and then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
erected a rare Trophee of his own Victory, by she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
(as he eaſily might) that all the other Apoſtles
had that power as well as he, or in common.</p>
               <p>But obſerve how neatly Dr. H. deludes his readers in
going about to clear himſelf of this <hi>Calumny;</hi> for inſtead
of shewing from his own words that he ſignified that
which wee held for <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s peculiarity &amp; incloſure was
onely a higher degree of that power, which had been the
proper way to shew him not faulty in the ſaid words, he
prevaricates quite from that onely neceſſary method, and
runs to shew from my words &amp; the Catholick <hi>tenet</hi> that
wee grant <hi>S. Peter</hi> a more particular power of the Keyes;
<hi>entangling</hi> poore <hi>S.</hi> W. on all ſides p 61. and obliging him
by moſt powerfull arguments to grant that which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
already as a point of his faith; and, when he hath
done, he inſults that that particular power was S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
<hi>peculiarity, &amp; incloſure;</hi> but never goes about to shew
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:115675:206"/>
(which onely was his duty) that he applied thoſe words <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity
&amp; incloſure</hi> to that particular power of the Keyes
in his book of Schiſm, where he was charged to have ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated
us but to the <hi>common power</hi> onely. Though
the queſtion be not whether Catholicks hold that <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
had an higher degree of this power, which was his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure,</hi>
but whether Dr. H. expreſſed ſuch to be our <hi>tenet</hi>
in his book of Schiſm, or rather pretended that the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the very power of the Keyes it ſelf was held by us to
be his <hi>incloſure,</hi> &amp; <hi>peculiarity,</hi> and ſo calumniated us in
the higheſt degree. Thus Dr. H. pleads his own cauſe,
and then concludes himſelf <hi>ſecure from being like S.</hi> W. <hi>in
calumniating him with whom he came to dispute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 62. the Dr. is miſtakingly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
of Sprights, and is troubled at the <hi>two appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of the ſame Romaniſt.</hi> For impoſing on him two
propoſitions which he never ſaid, and diſgraces the ſaid
<hi>appearances</hi> by asking the reader <hi>what truſt is to be given
to ſuch diſputers.</hi> But what ſaid the <hi>two appearances of the
ſame Romaniſt?</hi> one <hi>appearance</hi> ſayes that Dr. H. affirms
no power of the Keyes was given eſpecially to <hi>S. Peter.</hi>
The other <hi>appearance</hi> ſayes that hee confeſſes the Keyes
were eſpecially promiſed to <hi>S. Peter.</hi> He anſwers, <hi>the
truth is, he neither ſaid one, nor the other.</hi> One of the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances</hi>
replies. The truth is, he ſaid both. The firſt <hi>of

to wit, the <hi>Keyes,</hi> or the words importing them, <hi>are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in common and equally to all &amp; every of the eleven
Apoſtles.</hi> Now I imagin'd that thoſe words <hi>equally to all
&amp; every one</hi> is the very ſame, as <hi>particularly to no one.</hi> But
Dr. H. thinkes otherwiſe. (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 62. <hi>l.</hi> 18 denying

that the power was given in common, and equally to

the former as the very common light of nature teaches
us, that they are both one, and that <hi>not eſpecially,</hi> &amp; <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,</hi>
are perfectly equivalent. To omit that this very
poſition: That no power of the Keyes was given eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> is his own main nay ſole <hi>tenet,</hi> he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
in this place, which yet he ſayes here, he affirms
not, and complains of my foul play in diſputing, for
ſaying he holds his own <hi>tenet.</hi> The ſecond poſition is
found p. 57. <hi>l.</hi> 11. where he grants that <hi>this promiſe was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
to S. Peter peculiarly,</hi> and <hi>l.</hi> 21. where he ſayes that <hi>the

               <p>Mr. H. undertooke to ſolve ſome places of Scripture
which were uſed by our Doctors for <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
where upon, I was obliged to undertake two things;
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:115675:207"/>
firſt, that our Saviour promiſed the Keyes to <hi>S. Peter</hi>
in particular, and after a particular manner, that is, the
manner of promiſing them was particular in order to <hi>S.
Peter.</hi> Secondly, that, it being worthy our Saviour to
perform his promiſe after the manner &amp; tenour in which
he promiſed, conſequently he performed that promiſe
to <hi>S. Peter</hi> after a particular manner, that is, gave him
the Keyes particularly, <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd</hi> p. 90. 91. urged
the firſt place Matth. 16. v. 19. &amp;c. which concerned the
<hi>promiſe,</hi> And, though Dr. H pretends in the end of this
Chapter, that he <hi>attends me in this Section</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>foot
by foot,</hi> yet he gave it no ſuch <hi>at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>endance</hi> in order to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering
it but onely p. 60. 61. 62. he would needs engage
me thence to confeſſe a point of my faith that is, that <hi>S.
Peter</hi> had ſomething, or ſome degree of power which
the reſt had not, that ſo he might clear himſelf from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
calumniated our <hi>tenet.</hi> Since then I muſt be forc't to
repeat again what I ſaid there, I shall do it by arguing
after this ſort.</p>
               <p>Theſe words, I <hi>will give vnto thee the Keyes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. importing a <hi>promiſe,</hi> were ſpoken
to <hi>S. Peter</hi> after a particular manner, therefore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
was made to <hi>S Peter</hi> after a particular manner. The
conſequence is evident, for the promiſe was <hi>made</hi> by <hi>ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
it; If then it were <hi>ſpoken</hi> to <hi>S. Peter</hi> after a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larizing
way, the promiſe was <hi>made</hi> to <hi>S. Peter</hi> after a
particular manner. The antecedent I prove thus, thoſe
words were ſpoken to <hi>S. Peter</hi> after a manner not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
nor common to the reſt of the Apoſtles; therefore
they were ſpoken to <hi>S. Peter</hi> after a particularizing way.
The conſequence is moſt evident, ſince <hi>particular,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
the ſame with <hi>not common</hi> or not competible to
the reſt. The Antecedent is proved no leſſe evidently
from the whole <hi>Series</hi> of the Text; where we have firſt a
particular Bleſſing of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> ſprung from a particular
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:115675:207"/>
act of his, to wit, his Confeſſion of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Divinity.
<hi>Bleſſed art thou;</hi> his particular name, and, to avoyd all
equivocation which might communicate that name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
whoſe ſonne he was, <hi>Simon Bar-Iona: my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> in particular. Next
follows <hi>Chriſt's</hi> applying his words in particular here
upon, <hi>And I ſay vnto thee;</hi> then alluding to his particular
name given him by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf with an <hi>emphaſis</hi> and

                     </gap> Peter</hi> (or a Rock) <hi>and upon this Rock
will I build my Church,</hi> &amp;c. And after all theſe particular
deſignations follows the promiſe in the ſame tenour co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulatively.
<hi>And I will give vnto thee</hi> (ſtill with the ſame
ſpeciality) <hi>the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven,
and whatſoever thou shalt looſe on earth shall be looſed in
Heaven.</hi> Now, hence Iargue. The Confeſſion of Chriſt
to be the Son of God, the Bleſſing there-upon, The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<hi>Simon Bar-Iona,</hi> The deſigned alluſion to that name,
are not competible nor common to the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
therefore, the promiſe-expreſſing words conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant
were ſpoken to <hi>S. Peter</hi> in a way not common, or
competible to the reſt of the Apoſtles. But (to returne
whence wee came) theſe words are a <hi>promiſe</hi> of the Keyes,
and their power; therefore a <hi>promiſe</hi> of the Keyes, and
their power was made to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> after a manner not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
that is <hi>particular,</hi> and that upon occaſions origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
ſpringing from, and conſtantly relating, and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s particular perſon and particular name.
And thus much for the <hi>promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, as for the performance of this particular <hi>promiſe,</hi>
wee argue thus. It is worthy our Saviour, not onely to
perform his <hi>promiſe,</hi> but alſo to perform it after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and tenour he promiſed. But he promiſed the power
of the Keyes to <hi>S. Peter</hi> after a particular manner, (as
hath been shown) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>erefore he perfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>med his promiſe,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:115675:208"/>
and gave it to <hi>S. Peter</hi> after a particular manner, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
(which is the poſition wee vltimately aym at)
<hi>S. Peter</hi> had the power of the Keyes after a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
manner then the other Apoſtles. The <hi>Major</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
becauſe no man living would think himſelf reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
dealt with if a promiſe were not performed to him
after the manner it was made; nay, reaſon would think
himſelf deluded, to have his expectation raiſed (as in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it would) by ſuch a particular manner of promiſing
to ſomething extraordinary, and more then common,
and, when it comes to the point, to have his hopes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
by a common, and meerly-<hi>equall</hi> performance.
The <hi>Minor</hi> is already proved in the foregoing paragraph.
The concluſion is the poſition in controverſy.</p>
               <p>Reaſon therefore informs us, ſuppoſing once that the
promiſe was made to <hi>S. Peter</hi> after a particular manner
that it should be performed to him after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
nor need's it any other proof from Teſtimonies, if
we once grant (as none will deny) that our B. Saviour
did what was moſt reaſonable, and fitting. Yet ſome of
our Drs, arguing <hi>ad hominem</hi> againſt the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, make
choice particularly of that place of <hi>Iohn 21. v.</hi> 15. 16. 17.
to infer ſuch a performance. I proceed therefore in the
way I begun, and endeavour to show two things; firſt
that reaſon gives it, ſecondly that the Scripture favours
it, that this place ſignifies a particularity of performance
to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> or a performance to him after a particular
manner.</p>
               <p>The firſt I prove <hi>ad hominem</hi> thus, the promiſe being
made to <hi>S. Peter</hi> after a particular manner, and regiſter'd
in Scripture (as hath been shown) it is fitting that the
correſpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dent performance ſo worthy our Saviour should
be expreſt there likewiſe; eſpecially in the Proteſtant
Grounds who grant a kind of ſelf-perfectnes and ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency
to Scripture. But, there is no other place in
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:115675:208"/>
Scripture ſo apt to ſignify a particular performance as
this (for the other places cited by Dr. H. <hi>Receive yee the
Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp; <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s my father ſent me ſo ſend I you,</hi> expreſſe
onely a common performance) therefore in all reaſon
wee should think that the particular performance is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
there. The ſecond I show thus, the particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
had preceeded, apt in it's own Nature to breed ſome
greater expectation in <hi>S. Peter.</hi> Theſe words were apt to
ſatisfy that expectation; they ſignify'd therefore a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
performance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Again, the thrice particularizing him
by his name, and relation, <hi>Simon ſonne of Ionas,</hi> denotes
the ſpeaking of the following words to him <hi>particularly.</hi>
But the following words, <hi>paſce oves ineas,</hi> were apt, and
ſufficient to inſtate him in the Office, and give him the
Authority of a <hi>Paſtor:</hi> It was therefore given him in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
manner to be a Paſtour in theſe words. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi>
is e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ident, the <hi>Minor</hi> is proved. For, should any Maſter
of a family bid one of his ſervants in the ſame words <hi>feed
his sheep,</hi> that ſervant would think him ſelf ſufficiently
Authorized to perform that duty. Thirdly, the word
<hi>amas me plus his, Doſt thow love me more than theſe,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
put both a particularity, and a ſuperiority in <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
above the other Apoſtles in the interrogatory: The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore,
the inference there-upon; <hi>feed my Sheep,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
reaſon should ſignify after the ſame manner,
and ſounds as if it were put thus, <hi>Doſt thow love me more
then theſe,</hi> to which <hi>S. Peter</hi> aſſenting, our Saviour may
be imagin'd by the naturall ſence of the words to reply,
<hi>If it be ſo that thou loveſt me more then theſe, then feed my
Sheep more then theſe;</hi> or, <hi>have thou a Commiſſion to feed
my Sheep more then theſe,</hi> ſence he is more likely to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his duty better, and ſo more capable and worthy
of a higher charge who bears a greater affection to his
Maſter. This paraphraſe the words them ſelves ſeem to
ground. For otherwiſe to what purpoſe was it to make an
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:115675:209"/>
interrogation concerning a <hi>greater degree of love?</hi> or, to
what end was that particularizing, and perferring words
[<hi>more then theſe</hi>] put there if they had no correſpondent
influence nor connexion with the inference which enſves
upon it. Fourthly, the verb <hi>paſce</hi> being expreſt impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively,
and ſpoken by a lord to his ſervant, ought in
all reaſon to ſigni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y a <hi>Command,</hi> unles the concomitant
words in the Text force another ſence upon it, which
cannot be alledged here. Since then every command of
a lawfull Superiour gives a Commiſſion to do that which
he commands, and that the words expreſſing this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
are moſt evidently by the circumſtances in the
Text, in a particular manner ſpoken to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> it follows
that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had by them a particular Commiſſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him to feed Chriſt's flock, which is the thing to be
proved.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the property of the word <hi>paſce,</hi> as it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from <hi>praedicate</hi> shows that there was a kind of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
care commanded to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> whereas by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Apoſtleship he and his fellows had but an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and (as it were) a <hi>voyager</hi> Authority; for, an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>
might preach in many Cities; but, to be <hi>Paſtor</hi> he
muſt fix himſelf in one Citie becauſe he could be but a
particular Paſtor: But, <hi>S. Peter</hi> having for his charge,
<hi>oves &amp; Agnos,</hi> that is, all the faithfull, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he needed not fix any where; and, that he did ſo was <hi>

an eſpeciall force above <hi>Praedicate</hi> it follows that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething
was here given to <hi>S. Peter</hi> by that word, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
and particularly.</p>
               <p>This is, Reader, what I conceive follows gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inly out
of the Texts themſelves, as explicable grammatically.
Two things I deſire both mine Adverſary and thee to
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:115675:209"/>
take notice of. The one, that we are not now diſputing
how the many-winded Commenters interpret this or
that word; but what follows out of the acknowledg'd
words of the Texts, as managed by Grammaticall skill.
Nor do I pretend to <hi>Evidence</hi> out of my own interpreta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
(that is, Animating of dead words) neither my cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
needs it, nor can my own reaſon ſuffer me to engage
ſoe far, aſſuring me how ſeldome demonſtrations are to
bee expected from the toſſing of meer words; My one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intent then (as I tould thee at firſt) was to show what I
conceived moſt connaturally and probably follow'd out
of theſe Texts, and their circumſtances. Nor is it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for mine Adverſary to imagin that another explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be invented. But (ſince our contention now is,
about what the words can-beſt bear) he is to show that
another can ſo connaturally agree to the ſame particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
circumſtances in the ſaid Texts. And, if any man
living can draw an argument out of the ſame words, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
coherent with all the circumſtances there found, and
more connected in it ſelf then mine is, nay from any
other Text in Scripture, to show that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had no
promiſe of the power of the Keyes made to him in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
manner, and no performance of that promiſe in
the ſame manner, in which is founded his ſuperiority to
the other Apoſtles, I will candidly confeſſe my ſelf to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
the worſt in this wit-combat, and shall lay down the
cudgells for the next comer.</p>

               <p>AGainſt, this inference of mine from the words of

from the force of the ſame words a more connaturall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,

proceeding had been allowable, in caſe we had built our
faith upon ſuch wit originiz'd explications; or, if in trying
our acutenes with them in their own wordish way we had
pretended to evidence or conclude demonſtratively that

               <p>Solution 3. <hi>Each ſingle Apoſtle had this power as diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
promiſed to him as S. Peter is pretended to have, and the
words of Scripture, Math. 18. v. 18. are moſt clear for that
purpoſe. Of Schiſm</hi> p. 88. Reply, there is not a word the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
expreſſing any <hi>diſtinction</hi> in order to any other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
much leſſe ſingularizing <hi>each of them diſtinctly</hi> as

you here pretend but a <hi>common</hi> and <hi>plurall</hi> donation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

by which you would evade the shameleſnes of
this aſſertion <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 66. by ſaying that you mean't
onely the Apoſtles were <hi>each of them ſingly to have and
exerciſe the power of the Keyes, and not all together in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
or joyn'd together in Communion; firſt, neither
agrees with your other words, for it is one thing to ſay
each could <hi>diſtinctly uſe</hi> that power, another thing to ſay
as you (<hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

promiſed to each of them,</hi> and then quoting, <hi>Math. 18.

but a <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon</hi> expreſſion <hi>whatſoever yee shall binde on earth
shall be bound in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. without any diſtinction at
all expreſt. Nor can ſuch a pretended meaning ſtand with
common ſenſe, unles the Dr. will confeſſe him ſelf to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
calumniated our <hi>tenet,</hi> which imputation he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
taken ſuch pains to avoid; for either it is put in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to us, or not; if not, what does it there, or to
what end are all thoſe teſtimonies brought <hi>of Schiſm</hi> p.
89 to ſecond it? If it be put in oppoſition to us, and yet
mean onely (as Dr. H. ſays here) that <hi>it was promiſed to
all the Apoſtles as to twelve ſingle perſons each ſingly to have
and exerciſe it, and not all together in common;</hi> then our
<hi>tenet</hi> muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed and pretended by him
to be, that no ſingle Apoſtle could bind or looſe, but
<hi>all of them together in common</hi> onely which is ſo manifeſt
a calumny that himſelf dares not openly own it, though
he ſlily impoſe it; as he did the other about the Keyes
being <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s incloſure. Yet it is as neceſſarily his, as
the excuſe given is his; which if he diſclame he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
the objected fault.</p>
               <p>Solution 4. <hi>The addreſſing the ſpeech to S. Peter in the
ſingular is a token onely that Peter as a ſingle perſon should
have power, but not, either that no others should have it too</hi>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:115675:212"/>
(obſerve Reader how the calumny he formerly would
have acquitted himſelf of, ſtill ſticks to him) <hi>or that the
manner in which S. Peter should have it should be ſingular
to him, and ſo as it was not to each of them, Anſw.</hi> p. 64.
65 Reply, this is onely your own ſaying; show us out
of the words themſelves that this is more probable, as I
show'd the contrary, and then I shall acknowledge that
you have animated the dead letter more artificially then
I; otherwiſe you have done nothing: for the queſtion is
not whether you can ſay ſo, or no; but whether the
words oblige you to ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>Solution 5. <hi>The particularity, gives him particularly the
power, but excludes not others from the ſame power and the
ſame degree of power. Anſw.</hi> p. 65. Reply. This is onely
ſaid again, not shown that the words gave occaſion to
ſay it, which was onely to be done. He quotes indeed
drily the places of Scripture, yet puts down no words,
as his cuſtome is, but talks before and after the barren
and unapply'd citations what he pleaſes. Wee take the
words of the Text, debate them minutely and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and bring them home to the point, to show that our
<hi>tenet</hi> of a more particular powre is more probable out of
their native force. Let him do the like and show by the
ſame method his explication more connaturall then mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
and I shall grant he won the field in this probability-skirmish.
Himſelf will not deny that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had as much
promis'd him as the reſt when it was promis'd in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Math. 18. v. 18. The having then over and above
this common promiſe at another diſtinct time and with
moſt particularizing and diſtinguishing circumſtances a
promiſe of he ſame Keyes; moſt manifeſtly is a priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
peculiar to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and that on which wee ground
the probability of having them promis'd in a particular
manner, and conſequently performed in the ſame ſort;
which wee make accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wee find with the like particularit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ies
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:115675:212"/>
                  <hi>Io.</hi> 21. Let the Reader then obſerve what countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
the words, Grammatically &amp; prudentially ſcann'd,
give to our explications and deductions, and expect what
other explication, ſo well circumſtanc'd, Dr. H. can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
of the ſame words taken in their own native force
and energy, not what he will ſay upon his owne head.</p>
               <p>Solution 7. <hi>The ſpeciall energy of the applying the words
particularly to S. Peter, concludes that the Eccleſiaſticall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of aeconomy or ſtewardship in Chriſt's houſe belongs to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
perſons, ſuch as S. Peter was, and not onely to Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or Aſſemblies. Of Schiſm</hi> p. 87. Reply. This is ſtill
your own ſaying without ever endeavoring to show from
the words, and their circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances, they perſuade that this
is the ſenſe of them. But, let it be ſo that you have evinc't
againſt the Preſbyterians from this place that a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
muſt not govern but a <hi>Bishop,</hi> that is, one who is
Superiour to that community; who ſees not how much
better, and more probably it follows hence that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was <hi>Superior</hi> to the conſiſtory of the Apoſtles (they
being preſent when thoſe particularizing words were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
whence Dr. H. proves the Epiſcopall Authority
over the conſiſtory) then it will follow that in ſucceeding
times, and diſtinct circumſtances, ſome one should be
chief and over the Aſſembly. Again, the words not being
expreſſe for his poſition, he can onely make a parallell
deduction thence after this ſort, if he will argue from
the words, that the ſame should be obſerved in a Bishop
and his conſiſtory afterwards, which was I deated in this
firſt conſiſtory of the Apoſtles; wherefore, ſince Dr. H.
grants no higher degree of Authority in <hi>S. Peter</hi> than in
the reſt of the Apoſtles, he can conclude no more but
this, that the Preſbyters are all equall in Authority, as
the Apoſtles were; that is, there ought to bee no more-highly-authoriz'd
<hi>Bishop</hi> over them, but onely that one
of thoſe equally-dignify'd Preſbyters ought to ſit, talk,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:115675:213"/>
or walk before the reſt, according to Dr. H's explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, by <hi>Primacy of order.</hi> Thus whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
the Dr. diſputes from this place againſt the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
he falls into Popery. As for what he tells me here
that <hi>it is the intereſt of S.</hi> W. <hi>as well as of the Proteſtants to
mantain this point againſt the Preſbyterians who</hi> a lone can
gain by the queſtioning it. I anſwer, that I love the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſbyterians</hi>
ſo well as not to wish them renounce their <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
that is, <hi>man's nature,</hi> which they muſt doe if they
aſſent to what the Proteſtants ſay upon a probability one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
nay a totally improbable, and rather oppoſit Text.
Nor should I wish them ſo much hurt, as to beleeve
<hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> unles I made account the Catholick Church
was able to give them rigorouſly convincing <hi>evidence</hi> for
her Authority aſſerting it, which is impoſſible the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
should do, unles they plow with our heifer, and
recur to our Rules of faith, univerſall Tradition, ſo oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
by them for other points.</p>

you muſt show that the words perſuade it was <hi>onely an

to <hi>S. Peter</hi> in the preſence of the reſt are apt in their

Let the reader examin Dr. H. by what force of the words

are words of <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> there being nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

t's ſoe ſilly as a ſillier cannot be imagin'd; ſince neither

or poſſible that <hi>Chriſt</hi> should impoſe <hi>precepts</hi> upon

becauſe he ſaid vnto him the third time, Loveſt thou
me, which Sure he would not have been, if he had looked on
it as an introduction to ſo great a preferment.</hi> Reply: Dr. H.
hath here at unawares bewray'd what kinde of Spirit he
is of; who makes account that the getting ſome <hi>great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment</hi>
is a ground of more gladnes then our Saviours
ſeeming to doubt of his love to him would be occaſion
of ſorrow. But he shall give me and all good Chriſtians
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eave to think that good <hi>S. Peter</hi> was of another temper;
and that he valued the good opinion of his Maſter, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning
ſo much his love to him, above the attainment
of any dignity imaginable. Though I muſt confeſſe Dr.
H's <hi>Noe doubt,</hi> and <hi>Sure,</hi> upon which all depends, are two
<hi>ſure cards,</hi> were they authoris'd by any thing beſides his
own words; and, 'tis a very competent anſwer with him
to ſay <hi>he is ſure,</hi> and <hi>there is no doubt</hi> but that <hi>S. Peter</hi> gap't
ſo much after a <hi>preferment</hi> that he car'd not, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it, what opinion his B. Maſter had of him, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his <hi>loving</hi> him.</p>
               <p>Again, how do the words ſoe put it <hi>beyond all doubt</hi>
that the asking him thrice, <hi>loveſt thou mee, was deemed
by S. Peter a reproach of his thrice deniall;</hi> whereas the
Text tells us that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was fully perſuaded of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
knowledge of his love, and confidently appeal'd to
that knowledge, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt
that I love thee.</hi> Nor have wee any ground to think that
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:115675:214"/>
                  <hi>S. Peter</hi> apprehended his ſweet Maſter ſo cruell as to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
a forgiven ſin, eſpecially ſeeing the return of ſo
much love in the breaſt of his dear Diſciple. If Dr. H. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that it was to excite in him a greater care of <hi>Chriſt's</hi>
flok, the words indeed give countenance to it. But then
it should be ask'd what neceſſity was there of exciting a
greater care in <hi>S. Peter</hi> in particular? had he shown him
ſelf of ſoe negligent a nature as to give occaſion of doubt
that he was not likely without this exciration to perform
well this particular charge? or rather, did not his whole
carriage demonſtrate the quite contrary that he was ever
moſt zealous, vehement, and hot to proſecute any thing
he went about? What reaſon then there could be of a
particular incitement to <hi>S. Peter</hi> to perform and look well
to his charge, more than to the reſt without ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity
in his charge more than in the reſt, paſſes reaſon
to imagin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The force therefore in this thrice repetition
of <hi>loveſt thou me</hi> in all probability and according to the
words rationally explicated, wee make to bee this; that
ſince it is ever the method of God's ſweet providence to
diſpoſe and fit the perſon for the charge, ere he impoſes
the charge it ſelf, and the beſt diſpoſition to perform any
charge with exact diligence is a greater affection towards
the perſon who impoſes it, our Saviour, by asking <hi>S. Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter</hi>
thrice in that tender manner <hi>loveſt thou me more then
theſe, loveſt thou me,</hi> excited and ſtirred up in him a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
affection, both to diſpoſe him at preſent for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly-expreſt
charge of <hi>feeding his Sheep,</hi> and alſo to
minde him for the future upon what terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and with what dear and tender expreſſions he had
pledged vnto him the care of his flock. This explication,
I ſay, of that thrice asking wee think moſt connaturall
and conſonant to the Text, as rationally ſcann'd accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what is moſt befitting the divine wiſedom; by
which rule or any other principle had Dr. H. guided him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:115675:215"/>
in ſtead of recurring to and relying upon meerly his
owne fancy for his voluntary explications, I hope he
would have been of the ſame minde too.</p>
               <p>Solution 11. <hi>Wee need ſeek no other performance of this
promiſe than that which was at once afforded all the Apoſtles
together. As, ſuppoſe a Generall should promiſe a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

Reply</hi> p. 67. Reply: Dr. H. pretends a parallell, and yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
leaves all that in which the force of the parallell was to be
put, taking the common and indifferent circumſtance
onely. Firſt he puts the ſuppoſition that a Generall should
promiſe a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> this day to one, but he omits all that
in which wee place the ſtrength of our argument, to wit,
that the Generall should promiſe the ſaid Commiſſion to
that one in a manner of expreſſion <hi>not competent or compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
to the reſt,</hi> as he did here, ſounding an advantage over
the reſt in his <hi>deſert,</hi> his <hi>confeſſing of Chriſt's Godhead</hi> by
<hi>the revelation of his heavenly father;</hi> with ſuch alluſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to
his <hi>name,</hi> and other particulariſations, as in all prudence
are apt to breed an expectation of ſomething particular
in the thing promiſed. He should have made his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
have promiſt a Commiſſion to one in this manner,
and then the anſwer had been, that that one man ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifoldly
particulariz'd, and, as it were, call'd and ſingled
out from the reſt in their owne preſence, had no reaſon
to think himſelf ingenuouſly deal't with, if his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led'g
deſert being particular, and the promiſe there upon
ſo particularly directed to him, and him alone at that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
he had received an <hi>equall</hi> Commiſſion onely, that is,
ſuch a one as was common to all the by ſtanders, and not
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:115675:215"/>
particular at all to himſelf. Next, Dr. H's following words,
ſuppoſe this Generall should <hi>to morrow make the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to eleven more, that one being in their company,</hi> hath
two equivocations in it; the one in the words, <hi>the like
promiſe;</hi> by which if he means the promiſe of the ſame
common thing, to wit the power of the Keyes, t'is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but, if he mean's (as he ought, this being the thing
in controverſy, and the ſence beſt ſuting with that word)
that the like promiſe denotes a promiſe made <hi>after th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The next equivocation lies in theſe words, <hi>ſuppoſe he
should make a promiſe to eleven more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that one being in their

had it promiſed particularly before, had it not promiſed

while it was promis'd to the <hi>other eleven.</hi> By which devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
he hath avoided another point in which wee put force,
and left it out in his parallell; and 'tis this, that <hi>S. Peter</hi>
went a breaſt with the reſt in having the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
made to him as well as they had; and exceeded or
was preferr'd before them in this priviledge, that, over
and above his <hi>common promiſe,</hi> hee had a promiſe made
to him at other times <hi>particularly</hi> and in a particularizing
manner, ſo that the Drs ſimilitude hath not ſo much as
one foot left to hop on, that is, it reſembles no part of
the point as it is in queſtion betveen us, nor touches at
all the controverted difficulty, and is all one as if, going
about to paint <hi>Ceſar,</hi> he should draw onely the rude li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments
common to all mankind, and omit all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
proportions and colours which were proper to
delineate that perſon. But the Dr. makes up his ſimilitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
by ſuppoſing twelve Commiſſions ſent to the twelve
Captains, in which he would ſubtly have his Reader
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:115675:216"/>
ſuppoſe the Commiſſions were <hi>equally;</hi> for, if they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<hi>unequall</hi> it would prove iuſt contrary to his pretence.
But what he mean's by his <hi>ſeal'd Commiſſions,</hi> or how he
thinks this is verified in the Apoſtles, wee shall ere long
diſcuſſe when he declares his meaning in it.</p>
               <p>Dr. H's parallell having thus lamely play'd it's part,
let me ſee if I can make another more pat, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
then his was. Suppoſe then the late King of <hi>England,</hi>
as head of the Church there, could have made, and had
been to create <hi>Bishops</hi> all over <hi>England;</hi> and had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
caſt his eye particularly upon ſome one particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſo far as to give him in particular the ſir name of <hi>Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop</hi>
(as he did <hi>S. Peter</hi> the name <hi>Cephas,</hi> a <hi>Rock</hi>) this
done, upon occaſion of a particular ſervice of his firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledging
or confeſſing him <hi>King</hi> (which wee may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
not to have been then acknowledged) he breaks
out into thoſe parallell expreſſions. <hi>Happy art thou N.
N. who, when others weakly doubt of my Royalty doſt out
of a particular affection to me acknowledg me King; and I
ſay vnto thee, Thou art Bishop, and upon this Bishop I wil
build the Church of England, and thus built it shall ſtand
ſtrong againſt all oppoſition; and J will give vnto thee the
power of binding &amp; looſing and whatſoever fault againſt our
Eccleſiaſticall laws, thou shalt abſolve from, I will hold that
perſon thus abſolved guiltles; and whatſoever thou shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to pardon, I will hold it unpardon'd likewiſe.</hi> Now I
appeal to Dr. H's co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience whether this perſon he would
not in prudence judge by this carriage that he should ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
ſome thing particualr given him, and whether though
the King afterwards, in a <hi>common</hi> expoſition, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis't
to make him, aud the reſt <hi>Bishops,</hi> yet there would
not remain ſtill imprinted in his minde an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he should be a <hi>Bishop</hi> in a higher degree then
the reſt; to wit, an <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> or <hi>Yor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke?</hi>
ſince I think it as plain in prudence that ſuch a carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:115675:216"/>
and ſuch expreſſions should breed ſuch an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as moſt prudentiall actions uſe ordinarily to bee.
Therefore, it was worthy our Saviour not to delude the
expectation of <hi>S. Peter</hi> iuſtly, rationally and prudently
raiſed by his particularizing carriage, and expreſſions to
higher hopes; Therefore, he ſatisfy'd it with a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
performance; therefore S. <hi>Peter</hi> had in higher
manner and degree the power of the Keyes than the reſt
of the Apoſtles, which is the thing to bee evinced.</p>
               <p>And thus ends this wit-combat between me, and Dr.
H. in which, I hope, I have performed fully my taks, which
was to shew out of the very words in the Text that they
ſound in all probability and likelihood more favorably to
my advantage. And, if Dr. H. goes about to anſwer me, let
him show out of thoſe very words, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udentially ſcann'd,
that they perſuade another interpretation, and not tell
us of his own fancy what he is able to imagin, as he does
here all over. Nor let him thinke t'is ſufficient to ſolve
my deductions by showing them not to ſpring from tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
words by rigorous evidence. For, firſt, this is to oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
that which was never pretended; for, I pretend not to
<hi>evidence</hi> by my private wit working upon pliable natur'd
words: a greater probability is pretended from the letter
of the Text as it lies; how he will impugn this but by
showing his more probable from the letter of the ſame
Text I confeſſe I know not. Next, to fancy an explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which the words themſelves perſuade not, and ſo to
ſolve my <hi>probable</hi> deduction, becauſe another is <hi>poſſible</hi>
in it ſelf is very diſallowable, and unreaſonable; becauſe
a meer <hi>poſſibility</hi> of another, deſtroy's not the <hi>probability</hi>
of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely a greater, or <hi>equall probability</hi> pretended,
can fruſtrate a greater probability preſumed, where the
Grounds of controverting exceed not probability. And-laſtly,
to think to prejudice our <hi>tenet</hi> or faith even by ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thoſe places thus interpreted by privates skill, is the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:115675:217"/>
weakeſt errour of all; ſince neither our faith nor my ſelf
as one of the <hi>faithfull,</hi> rely at all upon any place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
as thus interpreted. This conceit therefore is noe
wiſer than if a man should thinke to throw mee down,
or diſable me from walking by taking away my ſtilts,
and yet leaving me my leggs whereas I ſtand a thouſand
times more firm upon theſe, than I did upon the former.
And I ſo totally build my faith upon the ſence of the
Church, ſo litle upon places of Scripture play'd upon by
wit, that what Dr. H. ob ects, and thinks me <hi>in chanted</hi>
for holding it. (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 64.) I freely, and ingenuouſly
confeſſe, to wit, that the infallibility of our Church,
conſiſting in this that she acknowledges no rule of faith
ſave immediate atteſtation of forefathers, would equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have done it, and <hi>equally</hi> have aſcertain'd me that <hi>S.
Peter</hi> was cheef of the Apoſtles, <hi>as if our Saviour had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
asked S. Peter three times, loveſt thou me?</hi> Although,
in other reſpects, I doubt not but that theſe ſacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the written word are both a great confort, and
ornament to the Church, and very uſefull to our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors;
yet not to hammer or coine a faith out of them
by the dints and impreſſions of wit, as the Proteſtants
imagin.</p>

Not will Dr. H. ſuffer him to be deluded in that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,

               <p>Note, Reader, what is in queſtion at this time. Wee

interpret this place to relate to the day of iudgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
to mean the Apoſtles ſitting upon twelve thrones <hi>to jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,</hi>
the Dr. interprets it of the regeneration of the world
by faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the firſt beginning or ſettling of
Chriſt's Church immediately, or not long after his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion,
and the Holy Ghoſt's coming; and of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
ſitting then upon <hi>twelve Epiſcopall chaires,</hi> to jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
(<hi>id eſt</hi> ſaith he) to preſide in the Church. Now, to
our Teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hilarius Pictavienſis</hi> his interpretation of this place is
found in his explication of ſome paſſages upon <hi>S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi>
the title of that particular Section is, <hi>De adventu filij
hominis ad iudicium in maieſtate ſua, of the comming of the

the Text which he is to interpret to mean the time of the
regeneration by grace according to Dr. H. put down
thus, <hi>Canon 28. Cum autem venerit filius hominis in maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate

                     </gap>th him, and the reſt.</hi> This ſeems very ominous to Dr.
H's interpretation of this place for the regeneration by
grace; and to relate as expreſly to the day of judgment
as words can ſignify. But let us proceed to the Authours
own words, upon which Dr. H builds. <hi>De iudicij tempore

&amp; in dextrâ &amp; ſiniſtrâ collocans, vnumquemque dignà
aut bonitatis aut malitiae ſuae ſede conſtituet. He speaks of the
comming and time of iudgment, in which he will ſeparate the
faithfull from the infidells, diſcern the fruitfull from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull,
to wit, the goats from the Lambs, and placing
them on his right hand, and his left, shall ſet every one in
the ſeat of his goodnes, or wickednes.</hi> And now I appeal to
the judgment of the moſt partiall friend of Dr. H. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be not to renounce all shame, honeſty, and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:115675:218"/>
conſcience, reſpect to his Readers, care of his own and
other men's ſalvations, to name fathers as <hi>vouching his

                  </gap>e
to invent words more fully ſignifying mine, more
palpably contradicting his interpretation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His third teſtimony from</hi> Author imperfecti operis <hi>upon
the words</hi> ſedebitis &amp; vos <hi>&amp;c</hi> you alſo shall ſit upon twelve

               <p>Obſerve, Reader, theſe words particularly; and then
I an confident if thou knowſt what Controverſy is, thou
with pity me for being task to anſwer ſuch a dreamer.
Here is not a word here which even ſeems to make againſt
us but theſe, <hi>without any particular mark allow'd to S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and the <hi>having the Holy Ghoſt equally;</hi> neither of
which are, or can be prov'd by any man living (for who
can ſee man's heart, or know in what degree he hath the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but God onely? or who can tell us now that
<hi>S. Peter</hi> had no <hi>peculiar mark,</hi> or greater tongue of fire,
than the reſt, as the wiſe Dr. pretends and builds upon,

be higher in Authority but he muſt neceſſarily have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:115675:221"/>
of the Holy Ghoſt in him. As for all the other words,
they nothing at all concern our purpoſe, or impugn our
preſent <hi>tenet;</hi> ſince wee hold that each Apoſtle had the
<hi>promiſe</hi> made, had a <hi>performance</hi> of that promiſe, that
the fiery tongues <hi>ſate</hi> on every of them, &amp;c. And, as for
his ſaying that <hi>this promiſe of twelve thrones was finally
performed in the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> though it be
moſt miſerably weak, (as shall be shown) yet it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all impugns us; inducing onely that each Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
had <hi>power</hi> in the Church, which wee voluntarily grant.</p>
               <p>To anſwer theſe phantaſtick toyes the better, I will
take the whole peece a ſunder into propoſitions, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn
them ſingly.</p>
               <p>The firſt propoſition is, that <hi>the promiſe of the twelve
thrones of Epiſcopall preſidency was finally performed in the
deſcent of the Spirit.</hi> Obſerve, Reader, that our queſtion
is about <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> (as Dr. H's chairs to
<hi>rule</hi> and <hi>preſide</hi> in tells thee) and then ask Dr. H. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was ever heard of before in this world that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Holy Ghoſt gave Iuriſdiction or Authority
to the Apoſtles, but zeal, charity, knowledge, courage,
vigor, ſtrength, and ſuch other gifts onely. See the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>Luke 24. 49. Tarry yee in Hieruſalem untill yee be
endued, virtute ex alto,</hi> that is, with <hi>power,</hi> or powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
efficaciouſly to proſecute what they were a ready
deſign'd and commiſſioated for; not, till you have final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> given you. Again, the Holy
Ghoſt fell upon all the 120. as appears by <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and
upon multitudes both of men and women in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and occaſions afterwards, and yet, no man ever
dream'd that they got by this means any <hi>Authority,</hi> or
<hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> But to show the abſurdity of this conceit
there needs no more but to reflect upon the Drs words.
He ſayes that <hi>the promiſe of twelve thrones of preſidency</hi> or

p. 67. <hi>was finally performed in the deſcent of the Spirit,</hi> if
ſo, then the Holy Ghoſt conſecrated the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles

                     </gap>e</hi> is the
<hi>actuall giving</hi> a thing, and the thing, to be given then, is
by him expreſt to be twelve <hi>Epiſcopall chairs:</hi> wherefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
actually then, and not before, the Apoſtles were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<hi>Bishops,</hi> and had ſo many Epiſcopall chairs given
them: ſo pretty a foolery that laughter is it's propereſt
confutation. But, to mend the ieſt, himſelf in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſtrenouſly defends that the diſtinction of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<hi>preſidencies</hi> of <hi>Provinces by Apoſtolicall agreement
long after the coming of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as appears by the
place Gal. 2. on which hee relies. And, if we should ask
him how there could be twelve <hi>Epiſcopall chairs</hi> to rule,
and preſide in without twelve ſorts of ſubjects to be
<hi>preſided</hi> over, and <hi>ruled,</hi> that is, twelve <hi>Bishopricks;</hi> and
then ask him again where thoſe twelve diſtinct Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks
were at the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, I know the
good man, in ſtead of making good his owne argument,
would be forc't to turn taile (as he does often) and bid
us prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition is this. <hi>The fire which repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that Spirit was divided and</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>ſate upon each of them,</hi> Who ever deny'd but that each of
them had a tongue of fire, and that this tongue of fire
<hi>ſate</hi> upon them? what then! what follows hence againſt
us. He tells us <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 68. in theſe words, <hi>This I ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
an argument of ſome validitie that the promiſe being ſeald
diſtinctly to every one of them was mean't (in the making of
it) diſtinctly to every one of them.</hi> Grant the inference,
shown lately to be nothing worth, whas <hi>tenet</hi> of ours does
his concluſion contradict? onely this, that the promiſe
of the Keyes was mean't to one Apoſtle <hi>onely</hi> or els to
them <hi>altogether,</hi> or <hi>in common,</hi> ſo that each ſingle Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
could not uſe it; neither of which being out <hi>tenet,</hi> as
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:115675:222"/>
he willfully counterfeits, his argument of <hi>ſome valedity</hi>
onely impugns a calumny forg'd by himſelf; and onely
proves that he hath bid his laſt adieu to all ſincerity, who
newly hath pretended an endeavour to clear himſelf of
calumny in making our <hi>tenet</hi> to be that the power of the
Keyes was <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s peculiarity, and incloſure, and yet
ever ſince reiterates it upon all occaſions with the ſame
vigour. Once more Mr. H. I deſire you to take notice,
that wee hold, and are readie to grant, nay mantain, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſert, that each particular Apoſtle had the power of the
Keyes given him, and that he could uſe them ſingly; the
inequality and ſubordination of this power in the other
Apoſtles to a higher degree of it in <hi>S. Peter</hi> is that wee
aſſert. If yoouintend really to impugn it, bring proofs
for an equality, and no ſubordination; and do not thus
willfully wrong your own conſcience, hazard the loſſe of
your own and other men's Souls, and laſtly, thas open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abuſe your Readers by calumniating our <hi>tenet,</hi> and
calling your wiſe proofs <hi>arguments of validity,</hi> whereas
they neither invalidate nor touch any thing which our
adverſary holds.</p>
               <p>The 3d propoſition is this. <hi>There was no peculiar mark
of fire allow'd to S. Peter.</hi> In anſw. <hi>Schiſm. Diſarm.</hi> p. 97.
call'd this proof <hi>a dumb negative,</hi> and askd him how he
knew there was no particular mark allow'd <hi>S. Peter,</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
he was not there to ſee, and there is noe hiſtory ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſacred or profane that expreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es the contrary. Now
the Dr. in ſtead of shewing us upon what Grounds he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
this (which properly belong'd to him) makes this
impertinent and prevaricating objection (<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 68.)
<hi>It ſeem's a negative in S.</hi> W. <hi>mouth is perfectly vocall though
it be but dumb in another man's,</hi> ſo that the good Dr. ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
that I go about to prove <hi>S. Peter</hi> to have had a
peculiar ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k of fire becauſe 'tis no where heard of, ſo
much is the moſt common ſence above his short reach.
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:115675:222"/>
Whereas I onely ask't him why he did affirm it without
knowing it? or how he could know it having noe ground
to know it? perhaps it would clear his underſtanding a
litle better to put his ſence, and mine into ſyllogiſme;
mine ſtand's thus; No man not having ground from ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
nor Authority can know, and ſo affirm a matter of <hi>fact;</hi>
but Dr. H. hath neither ground from ſenſe nor Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had no peculiar mark; therefore he hath
no ground to know it, nor affirm it. His can onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
this Enthymene; wee read of no peculiar mark or fire
allow'd <hi>S. Peter,</hi> therefore he had none. Or if it be made
a compleat ſyllogiſm it muſt be this the Apoſtles had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which is not read of in Scripture, but <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
mark of fire is not read of in Scripture, therefore
he had noe ſuch mark. And then, the ſillines of the <hi>Major</hi>
had shown the wiſedom of it's Author, who may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
by the ſame Logick as well that the Apoſtles had
no noſes on their faces, ſince this is equally not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Scripture as <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s peculiar mark is.</p>
               <p>Next, it was ask't him why <hi>S. Peter</hi> could not be head of
the Church but God muſt needs watch all occaſions to
manifeſt it by a particular miracles? or why he could not
be chief of the Apoſtles without having a greater tongue
of fire? ſo that could the equality of fiery tongues bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted,
yet, the ſillieſt old wife that ever liv'd could not
poſſibly ſtumble upon a more ridiculous proof; but, the
poſition it ſelf which he affirmed, being impoſſible to be
manifeſted, it ſurpaſſes all degrees of ridiculouſnes, and
ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to move rather a iuſt indignation in any Chriſtian
who underſtands what belongs to Grounds of faith, to
ſee it ſo brought to the loweſt degree of contempt and
diſgrace as to be debated by ſuch childish non-ſence, and
by one who profeſſes him ſelf a Chriſtian and a Dr.</p>
               <p>Now Dr. H. againſt theſe exceptions made in <hi>Schiſm
Diſarm'd</hi> ſayes not a word; that is, he neither goes about
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:115675:223"/>
to show that there was no particular mark, nor that it
was to any purpoſe had there been one, onely he tells us
(<hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 68.) that, <hi>thought it be a negative argument</hi> (that
is, though it prove nothing) yet <hi>he hopes by being annex't
to the affirmative probation precedent, it will not be a gagge
to make that dumbe and negative alſo.</hi> So that he confeſſes
it does no good at all, onely he hopes it will do no hurt
to his <hi>affirmative probation;</hi> that is, to his <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

validity</hi> already ſpoken of; and truly no more it does,
for it remains ſtill as arrant an affected, &amp; willfull calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our <hi>tenet</hi> as ever it was.</p>
               <p>I added, that <hi>if wee may judge by exteriour actions, and
may beleeve that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
ſpeaks, then perhaps the Dr. may receive ſome ſatisfaction
in this point alſo that S. Peter, had in more peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the Holy Ghoſt. For it was he that firſt burſt out into that

both my intent and degree of reliance on it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
in theſe moderate words; <hi>perhaps the Dr. may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſome ſatisfaction,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, he ſayes I bring
it to <hi>evidence he know's not what, for 'tis not expreſt but left
doubtfully betwixt his being Head of the Apoſtles, and his
having ſome peculiar mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet one (he ſuppoſes) deſigned

is expreſſely put down in my words now repeated by him
ſelf to wit, that <hi>S. Peter had in a peculiar manner the Holy
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:115675:223"/>
Ghoſt;</hi> and the neceſſary connexion of this with his hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
Authority expresſly diſclaim'd in the place even
now cited. Thirdly after he had repeated my whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
he ſubjoyn's immediately, <hi>here was one honeſt
word the (perhaps.</hi>) As if our Saviour's words <hi>out of the
abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> and thoſe others
of the Scripture that <hi>S. Peter converted three thouſand</hi> by
his firſt Sermon were all <hi>dishoneſt</hi> words. But, ſince I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
onely to give the Dr. <hi>ſome ſatisfaction,</hi> of which
(knowing his humor) I was not certain why was it not
honeſter to expreſſe my ſelf ambiguouſly then to cry
a loud, <hi>Certainy, ſurely, no doubt, unqueſtionably, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably,</hi>
as Dr. H. does all over before his Teſtimonies;
whereas, all is <hi>obſcure,</hi> uncertain, <hi>falſified,</hi> not a word in
them ſounding to the purpoſe, as hath been shown all
over this book. It may be the Reader may accound Dr.
H. the greater <hi>wit</hi> for uſing ſuch confident, and loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying
expreſſions when there is ſo litle wooll, but I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
he will thinke S. W. the <hi>honeſter</hi> man for ſpeaking
withim compaſſe. Fourthly, he ſayes that <hi>the Dr.</hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
himſelf) <hi>may not be ſatisfy'd thence that S. Peter had
received the Holy Ghoſt in a more particular manner,</hi> to
which he addes of his own falſifying invention, <hi>or was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
head of the Apoſtles,</hi> as if I had pretended this either
as equivalent, or neceſſarily conſequent out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
whereas he knows I abſoluty diſclaimed againſt him
any ſuch pretence; This done without having afforded
owne word of anſwer or ſence, he bids us farewell in theſe
words, <hi>I shall anſwer it no further then by repeating.</hi> Good
night good Dr.</p>
               <p>But to let the Reader ſee how much ſtronger my
[<hi>perhaps</hi>] is than the Drs <hi>ſurely,</hi> I will briefly put
doun the import of this late proof <hi>ad hominem;</hi> and
'tis this, that ſince out of the abundance of the heart
the mouth ſpeaks: 'tis probable that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had the
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:115675:224"/>
Holy Ghoſt in his heart more abundantly or in a higher
degree, ſince he firſt expreſt it's interiour motions by
ſpeaking, and ſpeaking ſoe vigorouſly, and <hi>powerfully:</hi>
Now then, ſince, in Mr. H's Grounds, the receiving
the holy Ghoſt <hi>ſeald the Commiſſions of the Apoſtles,</hi> and
<hi>finally performed</hi> the promiſe of their <hi>ruling,</hi> and <hi>preſiding</hi>
in the Church whence he contended alſo that all had this

in <hi>Iuriſdiction;</hi> it follows unavoidably <hi>ad hominem</hi>
it againſt him, that if be probable <hi>S. Peter</hi> had the Holy
Ghoſt in an higher degree, it is probable likewiſe that he
had a higher <hi>rule,</hi> and preſidencie in the Church perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to him. The argument bearing this ſence, who ſees
not 'tis Dr. H's task to let us knowe why this ſo early

who concluded alleggs <hi>equall,</hi> and that none
had more meat in it than another, becauſe all were <hi>full.</hi>
To take of theſe exceptions, and ſtrengthen his feeble
argument, the Dr. offers nothing; though he braggs at
the end of the Section that he hath attended me <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
onely he tells us here p. 69 gentily that he <hi>is not concern'd
to doubt but that they which are full of the Holy Ghoſt may
have it unequally if by unequally be meant the inequality of
divine</hi> endowments. How he is <hi>concern'd to doubt it,</hi> shall
be ſeen preſently; in the meane time let us reflect on his
other words, and ask him what is meant by the Holy
Ghoſts abiding in the Souls of the faithfull? or by what
other way he imagins him to be there than by divine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
onely. I hope he thinks not that the Holy Ghoſt
is hypoſtatically united to them or incarnate in them. An
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:115675:225"/>
inequality then of divine endowments is all the inequa'i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which can be imagin'd in this matter; and thefore, if
any inequality prejudice Dr. H's <hi>tenet</hi> he is concern'd to
avoid this.</p>
               <p>Now, how much it concerns Dr. H's circumſtances
to avoid an inequality of the Holy Ghoſts being in the
Apoſtles, is as plain as it is that it concerns him to ſay
any thing to the queſtion, and not talk onely in the aire.
He is about to impugn <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s higher Authority by
the performance of the promiſe of <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
made <hi>finally</hi> (as he thinks) by the deſcent of the
Holy Ghoſt upon them; wherefore, unles he prove that
the Holy Ghoſt deſcended equally upon each, he can
never argue hence againſt the inequality of <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s
Authority pretended by us, and ſo it avalis him nothing.
He ſaw this in his book <hi>of Schiſm,</hi> where he uſed theſe
words <hi>They were all fill'd with the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo this
promiſe equally performed to all.</hi> But, being shown the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
weaknes of his arguing from <hi>fulnes,</hi> to <hi>equality</hi> he
shuffles about, neither poſitively ſtanding to his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
proofby going about to make it good, nor yet gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or denying any thing poſitively or giving any ground
to fix upon any word he ſays, but telling us firſt, in a
pretty phraſe, that <hi>he is not concerned to doubt of the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of fulnes, and inequality of the Holy Ghoſt if it bee
mean't of the inequality of divine endowments,</hi> and then,
when he should telle us the other part of his diſtinction,
and of what <hi>other inequality</hi> beſides that of endowments
and graces, the Holy Ghoſt can be ſaid to be in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
founding Commiſſion, and ſo concerning him to
impugn and deny he shufflingly ends thus; <hi>Our queſtion
being onely of power, or Commiſſion to Authority and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity
in the Church, and every one having that ſealed to
him by the Holy Ghoſt deſcent upon every one, there is no
remaining difficulty in the matter.</hi> Where firſt he ſayes, the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:115675:225"/>
queſtion is of <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>dignity,</hi> whereas indeed it is of
the <hi>equality</hi> or <hi>inequality</hi> of this dignity, not of the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it ſelf, ſince none denyes, but that each Apoſtle had
<hi>power</hi> in the Church, but that the reſt had <hi>equall power</hi>
to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> Secondly he never tells us, in what manner
of the Holy Ghoſts inexiſtence, beſides that of divine

if nothing be likely to kill me but Dr. H's harmles blunt

               <p>Next he tells me that I have <hi>deformed his anſwer to the
Text tu es Petrus;</hi> but in what I have <hi>deformed</hi> it he tells
me not Nor, indeed, was it an anſwer at all to us, ſince
he not at all put our argument, much leſſe impugned it.
Our argument ſtands thus, that the name <hi>Peter,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
a <hi>Rock,</hi> and this name being not onely given par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> but alſo after a particularizing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
in all probability <hi>S. Peter</hi> was in particular manner
a <hi>Rock</hi> to build Gods Church. Now the way for Dr. H. to
take in this wit conteſt about words of Scripture (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the method already ſet down) is to show out of
the words, that it was not either given to <hi>S. Peter</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and after a particularizing manner; or els, that,
though this were ſo, yet that there was no ground (pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially
ſpeaking) to think that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was in an higher
degree or in a particular manner a <hi>Rock</hi> than the reſt. As
for the firſt to wit the giving the name to him in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
wee argue thus from it. Suppoſe there were twelve
Orators, and yet one of thoſe twelve called antonoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically
or particularly <hi>Orator</hi> and were as well known by
that name, and as comonly called by it, as by his own
proper name; certainly if that name were ſuppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to be
prudently appropriated to that one, it were great impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
not to think that that perſon was in an higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
an <hi>Orator,</hi> than the reſt. Since then our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this common appellative of <hi>Rock</hi> the proper name to
<hi>S. Peter</hi> (none being call'd <hi>Peter</hi> but he) and that wee
cannot doubt of our Saviours prudence in thus appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating
it to him, wee expect what Dr. H. can show us

to our diſadvantage ſo much as this ſounds to our
manifeſt advantage. As for the ſecond, to wit the repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the words after a particularizing manner, beſides all
other circumſtances concerning the power of the Keyes
heretofore which are competent to this alſo, two things
in particular are energeticall or of force here; to wit that
repeating the name <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

immediatly after his confeſſion of Chriſt's divinity; an
occaſion as proper to make him confirm'd a <hi>Rock</hi> in a
particular manner and degree, as it would be to confirm
the Antonomaſticall title of <hi>Orator</hi> to that other parallell
perſon upon occaſion of ſome excellent oration made
and pronounced by him. Wherefore, as the repeating
and confirming the name <hi>Orator</hi> to him, by ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and knowing Governour, upon ſuch a proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
would in prudence argue that this perſon was in
an higher proportion &amp; degree an <hi>Oratour,</hi> ſo the repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this name in ſuch a way to <hi>S. Peter [and I ſay vnto
thee thou art Peter,</hi> or <hi>a Rock</hi>] after a parallell occaſion,
his particular confeſſion of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> divinity, as much fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him for it, ought in prudence to infer that he was in
an higher degree a <hi>Rock</hi> than the reſt. The other thing in
which a particular energie is placed is in the alluſion of
the words [<hi>hanc Petram</hi>] as impoſſible to relate to the
other Apoſtles in the ſame particular manner, as it is to
pretend that all their particular names were <hi>Peter.</hi>

unles he can anſwer firſt the particularizing circumſtances
in the Text, which entitle him to be a <hi>Rock</hi> after a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

if by [<hi>as well</hi>] he means that the reſt were ſo too, 'tis

the Church was built upon <hi>all the Apoſtles:</hi> but, if by
[<hi>as well</hi>] he means <hi>equally</hi> as hee ought, this being the

us out of the words that this is equally probably their

makes ſtill in his prejudice, and is iuſtly preſumed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute

               <p>His reaſon againſt <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Superiority upon theſe

                  <hi>of power to one foundation</hi> above another, which
he <hi>manifeſt's from the known poſition of foundation-ſtones,
one by, not on the top of another.</hi> Thus this Apocalypticall
Architect. In anſwer, firſt, I ask him how he knows that
this place in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> was deſigned to ſignify the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of dignity</hi> amongſt the things there ſpecified, which is
in queſtion, or onely this, that all the Apoſtles were foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
upon which the Church is built, which is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
till he manifeſt the former he can not pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

of dignity:</hi> for, it neither shows us which was the <hi>chief
corner ſtone,</hi> or that the chief corner-ſtone was higher,
bigger, or more precious then the reſt. So that, if the
bringing no poſitive ſigne of an higher poſition prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Superiority it prejudices <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo as much,
expreſſing noe peculiar eminency to the <hi>head corner-ſtone</hi>
at all more than to the reſt. Thirdly the <hi>corner-ſtone</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
ſome eminency of <hi>power</hi> as appears by our Saviour's
being call'd the <hi>head corner-ſtone,</hi> and this wall being-four-ſquare

conſequently three chiefs in power over the reſt of the

none of them is expreſt to be a <hi>Rock</hi> but <hi>S. Peter</hi> onely,
nor that the Church is built on any of them els as on a
<hi>Rock,</hi> ſtill he hath good title in all reaſon to bee in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
eminent notion a foundation-ſtone. For the notion of
a foundation-ſtone not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting in this that it riſe higher,
that it be longer vpwards or shorter, but that it bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,
and the ſtrongeſt bearer of the ſuperſtructu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re;
and, a <hi>Rock</hi> in the Scripture being expreſt to be the

that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was in a more eminent manner a <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-ſtone,</hi>
and that the Church had a particular firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and immoveablenes in being built upon him; yet the
Dr. can imagin noe diſtinction amongſt <hi>foundation-ſtones</hi>
under that notion, as long as they lye <hi>one by,</hi> not <hi>on the
top another.</hi> So wiſe an Architect is the good man that he
forgets, that to bee in a higher degree a <hi>foundation-ſtone</hi>
is to bee in a higher degree of firmnes, but in a lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of poſition. Thus Reader tho ſeeſt what advantage
Dr. H. would gain should I delight to quible with him in
his own, and onely way. But I am already weary of this
wordish ſtuffe.</p>
               <p>Next he undertakes to ſolve an argument which none
objects but himſelf, and 'tis this, that <hi>if S. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

firſt ſtone, and ſoe Superiour, then the next ſtone</hi> (that is
the ſecond) <hi>muſt needs be Superiour, to all the reſt,</hi> &amp;c.
Soe kinde an Adverſary have I that he leav's untouch't
the argumente, from <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> which he pretends in
this very place to anſwer; and, in ſtead of doing ſo, help's
me with an argument of his own coyning from the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe</hi>
not worth a ſtraw, ad then demolishes at pleaſure,
and very eaſily what his own ayrie fancy had built. But,
as I never made any ſuch argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as this which he thruſts
upon me, ſo in that which I made <hi>Schiſm Diſarm.</hi> p. 103.
from the <hi>Iaſper ſtone,</hi> I both expreſt my ſelf to do it <hi>for
the Doctor's ſake,</hi> and renounced all reliance upon it in
theſe words, that <hi>Catholicks who underſtand the Grounds

of the obſcureſt part of Scripture,</hi> Schiſm Diſarm.
p. 103.</p>
               <p>I objected, that his argument was <hi>negative,</hi> thus; <hi>no
distinction was put among the foundation-ſtones therefore
there was none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> He anſwers that <hi>his concluſion onely (not
his proof) was negative. Therefore the words tu es Petrus
neither give nor affirm more of him than is given and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of every of the other Apoſtles.</hi> Whereas, firſt he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made any ſuch concluſion, no not any concluſion at
all againſt the Text <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> as wee object it; nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

notice of any particularizing circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
place ſo full fraught with them; much leſſe concludes
againſt them. And, ſecondly his wiſe proof which inferrs
this worthy concluſion is no other than this, <hi>that</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>a Rock and foundation are the ſame.</hi> As if the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
could not be <hi>foundation-ſtones</hi> leſſ firm then a <hi>Rock,</hi> and
ſo leſſe worthy the notion and name of a <hi>foundation,</hi> or a
thing fit to build on which if there be, as common ſenſe
tells us, then the notion of a <hi>Rock</hi> ſuperadded to the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
notion of <hi>foundation,</hi> and that within the limits of
that common notion; that is, it ſignifies a thing in an
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:115675:230"/>
                  <hi>higher degree</hi> apt to ſuſtain the building, or, which is all
one, in a higher degree a <hi>foundation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, I objected that it was a moſt pittifull piece of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
to perſuade the Reader from a <hi>plurality</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>
twelve Apoſtles that all were <hi>equall,</hi> He Anſwers p.
72. that <hi>that was not his reaſoning, but the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
were foundation ſtones as well as Simon; and therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
that, that title of tu es Petrus was not proof of inequality</hi>
Thus the Dr. rowls the ſame ſtone ſtill: for, (to omit that
he impugns not the Text, <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> as found in it's
own place attended by a throng of manifeſtly particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
circumſtances, but the bare word <hi>Petrus</hi> onely,
nor that neither, according to it's particular efficacitie as
it ſignifies a <hi>Rok</hi>) either the words [<hi>as well as Simon</hi>] mean
that the other Apoſtles were foundations alſo, and then
he calumniates our <hi>tenet</hi> not impugns it, ſince, wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
deny'd but that each of them was ſuch; or els, [<hi>aſwell</hi>]
ſignifies <hi>equally,</hi> and then I would know whether he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it (that is the whole queſtion) <hi>gratis,</hi> or infer it? or
from what he can bee imagined to infer it there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but from
a <hi>plurality</hi> onely of the common appellation. Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther
could I wrong Dr. H's <hi>reaſoning faculty</hi> in thinking ſo,

               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly I objected that he had quite overthrown
his own cauſe; ſince, granting that a <hi>foundation ſtone,</hi>

                     </gap>, it follow'd on the Drs Grounds that he
onely, and in good reaſon more particularly should be

ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ange argument were it put into form.</hi> Next, (obſerve his
kindeneſſ) <hi>he will not trouble him ſelf with that;</hi> but
in ſtead of doing this, that is, in ſtead of showing my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
nothing worth, he recurr's to his owne confident
ſayings that <hi>t'is certain</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>are the ſame;</hi>
which I have shown to be <hi>certainly otherwiſe,</hi> and that
there may be <hi>foundation,</hi> and yet not a <hi>Rock</hi> neither.
Then, building upon his owne <hi>certain,</hi> he introduces his
ſo oft repeated concluſion, with a <hi>Sure,</hi> and then all is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
After this he puts a pretended parallell to my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thus. <hi>Tis as if I should ſay Man, and Enosh being the
ſame and onely the Sonne of Seth having the name of Enosh
it follows on theſe Grounds, that he onely, and, in good reaſon,
that he more particularly should be a man,</hi> And when he
hath done he findes out a way for S. W. to <hi>defend himſelf
from not being a man;</hi> not conſidering that if <hi>Enosh</hi> be the
<hi>onely man,</hi> it unmans Dr. H. as much as S. W. But, I
thanke him, I will none of his aſſiſtance; and as for his
pretended parallell I anſwer that when the ordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellative,
properly ſignifying the ſpeciall notion, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
prudently to ſome one thing or perſon, that
thing or perſon ought to bee eſteemed as participating in
a higher, and more eminent manner of that notion or
nature Now that <hi>Enosh</hi> properly ſignifies the <hi>species of
man</hi> I deny; the Hebrew Criticks aſſuring us that it ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies
<hi>man,</hi> not in his own nature, but as ſubject to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
and afflictions, in ſuch a manner as <hi>mortalis</hi> does
in Latine. Whereas the word <hi>Adam</hi> ſignifying man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his nature, denotes alſo that he in a particular
manner was a <hi>man,</hi> who had that name appropriated to
him by God, the whole <hi>ſpecies</hi> being ingroſt in him.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the common name of <hi>Filius hominis, Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of man,</hi> being appropriated <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to our Saviour,
and of <hi>Orator</hi> to <hi>Cicero,</hi> it argues that they had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
right to theſe titles; that is, were in a higher and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:115675:231"/>
eminent degree the thing which was ſignify'd by thoſe
words. Again the name <hi>Enosh</hi> might bee in a manner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
impoſed by his parents, and was his firſt name,
which therefore cannot be imagin'd to have any myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in it more then the bare conceit of his Parents; unles
wee ſuppoſe his parents to have bene propheticall, and
then it had an eſpeciall reaſon, whereas, this name of
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifying a <hi>Rock,</hi> was impoſed by our Saviour;
who in each action guided himſelf by the higheſt pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce;
and impoſed on <hi>S. Peter</hi> in particular, nay on him
having another proper appellation, ſufficient to call him
by, before; all which argued a particular myſtery, and
deſignes in order to that name; and denote him by the
Antonomaſticall appropriation of that common word,
to bee <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and eminently what it ſignify'd by it; to
wit, a <hi>Rock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence appear's with what reaſon I made my fourth
objection to Dr. H. that <hi>he would have all the Apoſtles
call'd Peter.</hi> For ſince it is not imaginable why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
should appropriate and particularize to <hi>S. Peter</hi> the
common appellative, <hi>Rock,</hi> without ſome propriety in
<hi>S. Peter</hi> fitting for that particular name; and that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Dr. H. <hi>each Apoſtle was equally</hi> (that is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
any propriety or peculiarity) <hi>ſuch,</hi> (for hee makes

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the ſelf-ſame) it follows that our Saviour
had equall reaſon to give to each of the reſt alſo the ſame
name of <hi>Peter;</hi> for, there ought to be noe particularizing
in any action, where there is a pure indifferency in the
reaſon of the action. Now then, ſince our Saviour go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
him ſelf ever by perfect reaſon, he ought to have
given to all the reſt, the name <hi>Peter,</hi> by the ſame reaſon
by which he gave it to one, the reaſon according to Dr.
H. being <hi>equall.</hi> But this man who pretends to <hi>evacuate</hi>
(as he call's it) our argument from <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> never
tells us why <hi>S. Peter</hi> had the name of a <hi>Rock</hi> in particular,

               <p>AFter this Profeſſour of Myſticall Architecture had

the next place he falls to deſcant upon the <hi>meaſuring a
wall</hi> in the ſame <hi>Apocalypſe;</hi> gravely objecting that I
<hi>make much game</hi> at his arguing thence. And truly, I ſtill
account it the moſt ridiculous method that ever a weak
reaſon ſtumbled on, to undertake to dogmatize, that is,
to build his faith and deſtroy his own interpretation of a
Myſticall part of Scripture, ſo beyond all controverſy
obſcure in the higheſt degree, that it ſeems to need ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:115675:232"/>
                  <hi>revelation</hi> to know the meaning of it, as great as that
which firſt inſpired it. And that 'tis the moſt openly-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
folly that can be imagin'd, firſt to tell his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that <hi>Schiſm</hi> is as great a ſin as <hi>Sacriledge, Idolatry,
Antichristianiſme,</hi> &amp;c. as he does (<hi>of Schiſm. c.</hi> 1.) and
then, in ſtead of bringing <hi>evident,</hi> convincing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative
reaſons, which onely can ſecure the Soul of
any conſciencious man, (eſpecially confeſſing that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
may be had, if he had ſtill remain'd with the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
party) to bring obſcure myſteries, which have puzz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
all the world hitherto; of which alſo his own head
muſt be the interpreter, and without manifeſting firſt,
nay doubting himſelf (as shall shortly be ſeen) whether
the place was mean't of our queſtion, or made for his
purpoſe. And yet after all this calling this piece of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night

                  </gap>ing there in viſion apparent,
that the wall of the City, id eſt of the Church, being meaſured
exactly, and found to be 144 id eſt (<hi>repeats the Dr.</hi>) twel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
times twelve cubits, 'tis evident that this menſuration aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
an equall proportion whether of power, or Province to
all and every of the Apoſtles <hi>the ſence of which he repeats
again here</hi> Anſw. <hi>p. 73. To show the ridiculouſnes of this
proof</hi> Schiſm Diſarm <hi>p. 102. ask't him,</hi> whether none of
thoſe precious ſtones, which equally made up this wall, be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
then the reſt? and why, if it were ſo, the inequality in
richnes, should not more argue an inequality in dignity and
Authority amonſt thoſe who were repreſented by them, than
the equall bulk can argue an equality, ſince the worth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity
&amp; value of precious ſtones is taken from their richnes
and not from their bulk. <hi>Next arguing againſt him in his
owne way I inferr'd, that</hi> ſince the firſt ſtone in this wall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
S. Peter, (<hi>as appeared by Dr. H's Grounds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
that Apoſtle a</hi> Primacy of order) and was there
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:115675:232"/>
expreſt to be a Iaſper, the ſame ſtone whoſe luſtre shined in
our Saviour Apoc. 4. 3. and alſo in his Church, Apoc. 21.
11. <hi>it would have bene priz'd for a rare argument by Dr.
H. were he in my caſe, (though ſleighted by me) that</hi>
S. Peter onely having the ſame luſtre with our Saviour, was
like him in repreſentation; and ſo, he onely reſembles him as
his Vicegerent, and Vicar. As alſo, that, being the ſame
ſtone the Church is made of and the firſt of all the reſt, that he
is conſequently the firſt part of the Church, that is, her head.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to thoſe firſt exceptions the Dr. ſayes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all; and ſo, is nothing punctuall in his promiſed
<hi>attendance</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; that is, he vindicates not his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be worth a rush; for, if the luſtre &amp; richnes be
more valuable, and worthy in it's ſelf, and ſo more apt
to expreſſe dignity than the bignes or bulk; then the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
of <hi>richnes</hi> is more ſignificative of inequality of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity
than the equality of <hi>bulk</hi> is of an equality under the
ſame notion of <hi>dignity:</hi> nay more, (as he was told) the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
being an equality in the bulk found amongſt them all,
if there be found beſides an inequality in richnes, as the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is amongſt thoſe ſtones, every Lapidary, and even
common ſence will inform us that an inequality in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is unavoidable. But the good Dr. who at firſt thought
his nice argument a rare buſines, ſeing it marr'd, and all
unravell'd, as eaſily happens to ſuch cobweb ſtuffe, ſees,
and acknowledges now that it was neither worth, nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of repairing and ſo grew wiſe and let it alone;
hoping that his Readers would eaſily be perswaded that
he had anſwered me perfectly and made good his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if he did but tell him in the end of the Section,
that <hi>he had attended me</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

anſwering to make two litle peda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tick Greek words, which
a man would think had nothing in them, ſtop ſuch great
holes.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to that which concern's the Iaſper ſtone, he
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:115675:233"/>
tells us firſt (if we will beleeve him) that <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is moſt proper
to ſignify the luſtre of zeal, and other gifts.</hi> But, why it
should be moſt properly ſignificative of thoſe he affords
not the leaſt attempt of any reaſon to oppoſe my contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
exceptions. Next, he tells me, that <hi>he can allow me (in
this ſence) to make my aduantage of it:</hi> And, ſeing wee muſt
have no other ſignification of that particular luſtre, nor
yet know any reaſon why, I shall take his <hi>allowance,</hi> and
make my <hi>advantage</hi> of it thus againſt him.</p>
               <p>His Grounds made the coming of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
perform,</hi> that is, <hi>actually give</hi> Authority to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
ſince then the Holy Ghoſt neither was nor can bee
any otherwiſe in the hearts of the Apoſtles than by his
<hi>gifts,</hi> the allowing an advantage to <hi>S. Peter</hi> above the
reſt in thoſe gifts, is the allowing him an advantage over
them in Authority, according to the ſame Grounds. Nor
can he deny but that I have gained <hi>S. Peter</hi> this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
if I make good my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions propos'd here by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
in which I shall finde no difficulty, they being both
tacitly granted already.</p>
               <p>The firſt condition is, that I muſt finde mean's to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
my ſelf that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was ſignify'd by that <hi>Iaſper-ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</hi>
Is not this a ſincere man, and a pretty diſcourſer, who

from his own words; for, the twelve foundation-ſtones

ſtead of replying to it, which was likely to coſt him no
leſſe than either the denying his own moſt expreſſe words,
or the moſt expreſſe words of Scripture, he onely tells

was ſignify'd by that Iaſper-ſtone;</hi> which he knew well
I had already <hi>found,</hi> nor were they ever <hi>loſt</hi> to me by any

Apoc.</hi> 4. 3. and alſo in his Church, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 11 In ſtead
of anſwering which, or giving any reaſon why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and his Church should bee repreſented by a <hi>leſſe lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous</hi>
ſtone than the reſt the ſincere man onely bids me
<hi>finde</hi> it again, whereas, it remains ſtill viſibly extant in
it's originall integrity and untouch't yet by Dr. H. and ſo
he knew well enough where to <hi>finde</hi> it himſelf without
my showing him it, did ever anſwerer ſo lazily attend his
Adverſary as Dr. H. does me? yet, if he ſtill deſire a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of me, I shall give him this: that, in all reaſon wee
should think (unles hee knows ſomething to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)
that our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> deſerved to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
by the moſt luſtrous and richeſt ſtone in the
Company. Wherefore, the luſtre of the <hi>Iaſper</hi> being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to them, we have noe reaſon to imagin the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
but rhat it had a more perfect and glorious luſtre than
the reſt.</p>
               <p>But this is not all I aim'd to induce hence <hi>ad hominem</hi>
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:115675:234"/>
againſt Dr. H. my pretence was ſufficiently intimated in

the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> to repreſent perſons of <hi>higher dignity and
Authority</hi> to wit, our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> and ſoe the

as his Vicar, or Vicegerent: to the <hi>Church,</hi> as being the

               <p>Laſtly, for an upeshot, himſelf knows not whether
this ſtil born argument from the equall menſuration of
the wall makes for him or againſt him; for, he infers
onely that <hi>it aſſignes an equall propoſition whether of power,
or Province to all, and every of the Apoſtles.</hi> So that, it
ſeems himſelf is in doubt whether it relates to an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>Province.</hi> Now then, this being ſo, and
equality in <hi>power</hi> being the onely queſtion between us,
unles he firſt can show that it hath regard to <hi>power,</hi> whihc
yet he no where ſo much as attempts, more than by
ſaying it does ſo, he is utterly incapable to pretend hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
that the power in all the Apoſtles was equall. Again
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:115675:234"/>
(to omit that his conceit of <hi>Apoſtolicall Provinces</hi> hath
been shown to be perfectly chimericall and Groundles)
what doth the <hi>equality</hi> of their particular <hi>Province</hi> preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
us? ſince with this it may well conſiſt, that one of
thoſe Governors though equall in his private charge,
may be either conſtituted by the Supreme, or agreed
upon by the reſt of thoſe twelve to be their chief, and him
to whom in extraordinary occaſions, and more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
affairs recourſe is to be had, as to a Superiour.</p>
               <p>Wherefore till Dr. H. afford me Evidence that this
Myſticall place hath reference to <hi>power,</hi> or indifferently
either to <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>Province</hi> (for though he bee in doubt
what it ſignifies yet he tells us (<hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 91.) <hi>t'is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
I shall take the liberty my nature allows me, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
vnto neither; but rather to think that it relates to
the different diſpoſition of Souls, onely known to God,
as his Myſticall Author before explicated himſelf in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occaſion; and, that the heavenly <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> shall
be made up of ſuch, ſome of them reſenting and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the Spirit that is the particular ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;
and affection of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> others thoſe of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi>
of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> &amp;c. which the Allwiſe orderer, and coorderer
of nature and Grace ſaw moſt fitly to be ſignified by ſuch,
and ſuch preſcious ſtones, for ſome qualites, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which he beſt ſaw by analogy, commonly agreeing to
both. Myſteries to be venerated by an humble admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not to be proudly preſum'd as with a literall, and
groſſe familiarity known or ſeen by our muddy and
flesh-veiled eyes; which they doe who pretend to dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize
&amp; bring rigorous <hi>evidence</hi> (the onely rationall
ground of faith) from ſuch depths of obſcurity; the moſt
pernicious and boldeſt irreverence that can bee offer'd
to be onely certain ground of faith (<hi>evidence</hi> of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity)

Firſt, that Wits &amp; Schollars, who are the flower of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
are deterr'd &amp; diſenvited from reading books, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Controverſies, if they grow to any exceſſive bulk:
And, to thoſe that should read ſuch, it would be in a
manner ungratefull, when nothing is to be ſeen but the
faults of a writer laid open, which was the reaſon, that,
to give ſome tincture of ſolidnes to my Reply, &amp; ſo to
take of the tediouſnes from knowing Readers, I have
taken occaſion to diſcuſſe ſome points (as thoſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> the Churches <hi>power to binde to beleef,</hi> the
<hi>certainty of Tradition,</hi> &amp;c.) more largely than I was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
out of any reſpect due to my Antagoniſt himſelf or
his ſleight way of writing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I have given unexpected ſatisfaction befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
hand to more knowing perſons, by laying Grounds
before my Reply, which come home to the life of the
queſtion, &amp; at leaſt endeavor to clear it rationally; which
therefore I conceive would be more gratefull &amp; profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to them; and on the other ſide (being ſupererogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the task of a Reſpondent) might deſerve to excuſe
ſome part of that which was ungratefull, &amp; to them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable;
nay, all of it, confes't by Dr. H. himſelf (as
shall be ſeen) to be unneceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I had acknowledg'd ſome beholdingnes to
the <hi>Catholike Gentleman's letter;</hi> &amp;, ſo, had drawn upon
my ſelf an engagement to vindicate it alſo againſt Dr. H's
Reply. By which mean's I had two books of his to refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
as far as I proceeded; to both which had I reply'd qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
through, it would have made too-large a volume.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the <hi>B. of Derry</hi> had, e're I had anſwer'd Dr.
H's firſt part, put out a refute to my <hi>Appendix to Schiſm
Diſarm'd;</hi> which oblig'd me to leave ſome room in my
already big book for him, and to beſtow on him ſome
part of that my defenſive task otherwiſe due &amp; intended
to Dr. H. and ſo I had not room enough to proſecute
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:115675:237"/>
all the leſſ neceſſary trifles of that my long winded Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the task it ſelf of anſwering ſuch kinde of
ſleight ſoul'd Writers was moſt tedious &amp; irkſom to any
one who pretends to &amp; ayms at Science; nay moſt irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
and ſenceles; conſiſting in this, that, rigorous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
&amp; the immediate &amp; evident connexion of terms
(that onely proper ſatisfaction to a reaſonable Soul)
being neglected, upon which our Tenor &amp; Rule of
faith, immediate Tradition, is, at leaſt, pretended to be
built; to leave this, I ſay, and to ſtand replying to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
odd end of a worm-eaten Record or teſtimony; which,
without the help of this Tradition can claim no originall
Authority at all, much leſſ againſt it; and, for the moſt
part, is falſify'd, unauthentick, ambiguous in terms, or
non-cluding if it hap to be true, &amp; truly-propoſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
many other weakneſſes invalidating it; which is to
neglect <hi>ſence</hi> for <hi>words;</hi> and, inſtead of reaſoning from
<hi>Grounds,</hi> fall to quibbling in <hi>Sounds</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, even in purſving this teſtimony way, I have
shown to the eye of the Reader, this Drs manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
ſo infinitely faulty &amp; weak, ſo full fraught with fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifications,
paralogiſms, perverting both words &amp; ſence
of Authors, omitting words moſt important for us, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
others moſt important for himſelf, ſuborning Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereticks
for true fathers, building upon Teſtimonies
fetch't from thoſe of his own ſide, alledging places as for
him, &amp; concealing the words found to be directly againſt
him, shuffling a way the true point, with a gentile ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
begging, or els miſtaking the queſtion all over; as
oft calumniating our <hi>tenets</hi> &amp; poſitions, runing diviſion
upon a dow-bak'd <hi>If</hi> a long way, without ever conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>if not;</hi> Talking voluntarily, to &amp; fro, upon his
own head in a preaching vein, blundering things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
moſt clear with needles diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; explications,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:115675:237"/>
which he uſes, againſt their nature, to involue &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found:
recurring to &amp; dilating himſelf much in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
terms, ſo to avoid coming to the particular point;
contradicting himſelf frequently, and in one point Nine
or ten times, flourishing all over with <hi>certainly, ſurely,
irrrefragably, infallibly, unqueſtionably, accordingly, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
manifeſtly, demonſtrably, undoubtedly, clearly, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we know, it is manifeſt, id eſt, perfectly, unavoidably,
evidently,</hi> &amp; innumerable ſuch other expreſſions, all
ſprung from his own fancy to give countenance to the
Teſtimonies, not from the Teſtimonies or any force of
reaſon to make good thoſe expreſſions: to which add his
ſober ſermon-phraſes ſo oft repeated, of <hi>no degree of
truth, no appearance of force; I did in the ſimplicity of my
heart verily beleeve; I shall not deem it neceſſary to deſcend</hi>
to any further proof: His playing the Pedant all over in
Greek to amuſe the good women &amp; ſilly children; thoſe,
I ſay, &amp; many other faults, follies &amp; weakneſſes, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
shown to any intelligent Readers eye ſo manifeſt &amp;
ſo frequent in him, that I could not conceive any imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
neceſſity of laying him open further; and that if
he have been convinc't to behave himſelf ſo weakly &amp;
inſincerely in that part of his book which himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
onely to have been <hi>fundamentall;</hi> the like might
iuſtly be expected (without showing it by detail) in the
reſt of his book, which he acknowledges to be <hi>leſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;</hi>
in caſe we may have ſo good an opinion of him as
to think he would treat more ſolidly &amp; ſincerely that
which more imports &amp; is ſubſtantiall to the queſtion of
Schiſm, and by conſequence moſt highly concerns mens
ſalvations, which depend there upon.</p>
                  <p>Seaventhly I was diſenvited by this, that, it is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
againſt my inclination &amp; temper (whatſoever <hi>Mr.
H</hi>'s &amp; his friends may conceive of mee) to ſtand mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting
the faultines of others, further then I can be
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:115675:238"/>
ſatisfy'd it is preciſely neceſſary; judging it the moſt illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
task that a Soul which longs after Science could
be put upon, to be employ'd in diſcovering the diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
&amp; weakneſſes of the wrongers of Truth; and, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
with all ſincerity, that I had rather candidly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ
&amp; acknowledge the virtues, &amp; advance the fame of
good Writers according to the degree I finde them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
than to reveal the vices &amp; shame of bad ones; as
my favourable expreſſions, on the by, concerning the
acutenes of the Lords, <hi>Faukland &amp; Digby,</hi> &amp; the witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of that Giant for fancy, <hi>Dr. Donne,</hi> in my <hi>Schiſm
Diſarm'd,</hi> clearly teſtify.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, I was much deterr'd even from endeavouring
any particular exactnes in this, much more from attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting
the reſt by reaſon of the dangers &amp; in a manner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſibility
to get my books printed here in <hi>England,</hi> and
the great charge &amp; hazard alſo I ſaw I was like to be at in
ſending them to <hi>France.</hi> It is very cheap &amp; eaſie for them
to brag of a quicker Reply, to whom the preſſe is free,
&amp; the book ſellers shop licenced, both to print &amp; vent
them openly with ſecurity &amp; advantage: whil'ſt thoſe
Authors, whoſe books, are prohibited printing in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
vnder great penalties &amp; forfeitures, after they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
paſt the chargeable &amp; tedious preſſ beyond ſea, may
not be ſold here but at the loſſ of forty shillings a book
if the buyer pleaſes to prove Knave, are not yet by their
ſillily-inſulting Adverſaries allow'd what in reaſon is due
for ſuch diſencouragements, hazards &amp; delayings.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, 'tis a farr more ſecure ſatisfaction to candid
Readers to ſee a main part of a book anſwer'd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pleatly
&amp; fully, than the whole ſlubberingly and imperfectly
(as I have, and shall show further, that Dr. H. hath
anſwer'd mine) for this latter method leaves a way open
to omit many things, amongſt which it may happen that
ſome are very important; whereas, the former manner
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:115675:238"/>
of proceeding debarrs that licentiouſnes, and all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of that excuſe; and ſo makes either the cauſe or the
Writer unavoidably fall under a juſt ſuſpect if it cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to
fall short of being ſatisfactory: But eſpecially if that part
of the book, which is thus fully reply'd to bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
by both ſides to bee ſolely important, a conciſer
and ſolider way of ſatisfaction cannot bee imagin'd.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if all thoſe former reaſons alledg'd will exuſe
me from performing a needles duty, <hi>Dr. H.</hi> himſelf shall
compleat my iuſt excuſe, &amp; confeſſ this was needles: who
in his book <hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 92. after he had finish't his ſleight
diſcourſe againſt <hi>S. Peters Supremacy</hi> (the part which I
have largly reply'd to) he adds that <hi>'tis very unneceſſary
to proceed to the other part of it,</hi> &amp;c. that this is in effect the
onely <hi>ground of the Romaniſts pretenſions,</hi> &amp;c. that he
<hi>thinks fit again to remind the Romaniſt, and peremptorily to
inſiſt on this exception againſt S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Paſtorship over all
the reſt of the Apoſtles,</hi> and p. 94. that <hi>what he should add
concerning the power of S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Succeſſor, as ſuch, would
be perfectly, ex abundanti, more then needs, and ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
it may be look't on by the Reader.</hi> The like he repeats
in his Anſwer to <hi>Schiſm Diſarm.</hi> p. 74. Saying that my
13th <hi>Section</hi> (which vindicated <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Supremacy)
was <hi>moſt important to our buſines in hand:</hi> that, <hi>the caſe of
our Schiſm fundamentally depends on that Supremacy,</hi> &amp;c.
Thus he. Now then, I have fully reply'd to &amp; vindicated
our <hi>tenet</hi> in all that he calls <hi>fundamentall, onely neceſſary,
our onely Ground,</hi> and which he profeſſes he <hi>peremptorily
inſiſts on,</hi> it follows that, had I done more, I had done a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines
<hi>not important,</hi> nor <hi>fundamentall,</hi> nor on which they
<hi>peremptorily inſiſt;</hi> and ſo, it being alſo unneceſſarily for
mee to vindicate a point, which he thinks <hi>very unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
to proſecute, my further endeavors had been confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
to no end, or frivolous, if taken alone; but, joyn'd
to my former reaſons, abſolutely vnwiſe &amp; temerarious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="458" facs="tcp:115675:239"/>
I omit that Dr. H. neglecting to anſwer almoſt all my
9th Section of the 2d part of <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd,</hi> which
prov'd the Proteſtants guilty of the materiall fact of
Schiſm; and all my 10th Section, which prov'd them
guilty of the formall part of it; that is, neglecting to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
all that part of my book in which I brought him to
terms of reaſon, and which did intrinſecally, fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
&amp; ſubſtantially concern our queſtion, and paſſing
them over ſleightly p. 224. after he pretended falſly that
I beg the queſtion, with telling the Reader that <hi>he will
leave me to Skirmish with my own shadow</hi> wheras it was
the hotteſt Schirmish in the book (as any ordinary eye
may diſcern) I conceive it gives mee iuſt occaſion to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
anſwering that in him, which himſelf confeſſes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſubſtantiall nor fundamentall.</p>
                  <p>I omit alſo that I was often blam'd by reſpected and
knowing friends, for loſing ſo much pretious time, in
ſuch a worthles foolery; which I might have employ'd
much better to mine own &amp; others advantage; they aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
me likewiſe that his <hi>Reply</hi> was not valued by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
and iudicious perſons; nor by all on his own
ſide but onely by a few; who were ſo irrationall (&amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
inconſiderable) that they never examin'd any thing,
but immediately took that to be in reality <hi>an Anſwer</hi>
which was call'd ſo: &amp; would iudge him alwaies to have
the beſt, who should ſpeak the laſt word, whether it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
ſence or no.</p>
                  <p>Thus much to show that I had no preciſe neceſſity nor
iuſt reaſon to vouchſafe Dr. H. a larger Reply. Yet,
though in doing this I ſpare the Drs credit, I muſt not
neglect to clear mine own, and add ſomething more in
vindication of my ſelf from his ſenceles aſperſions. But,
indeed, in nothing can I more diſcredit &amp; diſgrace him
than in rehearſing &amp; clearing what he objects in this Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.
For, by this the candid Reader ſeeing how inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:115675:239"/>
the worſt is he can ſay againſt mee, will diſcern that
he had an ingenious Adverſary, &amp; conclude thence that
it was the power of Truth, not any ſleight of tricks, which
thus baffled the Dr.</p>
                  <p>If then my greateſt faults be proved innocent, my
leſſer ones will (I conceive) be held ſo likewiſe; ſince it
is preſumable that no man will accuſe another of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
faul but upon a better ground. Now the greateſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a Writer are falſifications; for, what credit can ever
be rationally given to any Writer who is once convinc't
to have bely'd the Author he cites, &amp; to have falſify'd
wilfully. Faults of this ſort he objects to me onely in two
places, as far as I obſerve.</p>
                  <p>In examining which I crave the Readers exacteſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
&amp; decline not his moſt rigorous cenſure; nay, if
he can in reaſon iudge that I wilfully chang'd any thing,
that is, gain'd or endeavored to gain the leaſt poſſible
advantage by my miſtake, (which is the onely touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
as it is the ſole reaſon of falſifying) then I give
him free leave to brand me in his thoughts for infamous,
and shall in requitall pardon Dr. H. the long rowle of his
wilfull or manifeſtly advantageous ones.</p>

let the Reader ſee by the way how pittifull this Reply of
his is, how nothing to the point: this being to ſay over
again what we grant, and leaving untouch't what we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
ſince all this might have been done, whether thoſe
Conſtitutions had been originally his own or no; and,
will ſerve for an inſtance how weak this Dr. is in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
part of his book, were he duly call'd to account.
But, this concerns not my task at preſent; which is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this, to put down ſubſtantially the queſtion, his proof,
&amp; my Reply, that it may be thence iudged whether I
could poſſibly be ſaid to gain any advantage by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
I faultred in.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of thoſe circumſtances is that whereas his
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:115675:240"/>
words were <hi>Iuſtinians Conſtitutions de Epiſcopis, Clericis,
&amp; Sacris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> I tranſcribed <hi>de Epiſcopis, Clericis, Laicis.</hi>
Now, if he contend I tranſcribed one word wrong in anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering
his whole book, I grant it; and, I conceive, Dr.
H will not preſume himſelf exempt from the like fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings:
But, if he pretend that I falſify'd or did it volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
plain ſence will overthrow him quit me. No man
does a thing voluntarily but for ſome end; and the end
an inſincere Writer can be imagin'd to have in falſifying
is to gain ſome advantage to his cauſe. If then it be moſt
manifeſt that I neither did attempt nor could poſſibly
gain thence the leaſt advantage, nor that he himſelf at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to shew I gain'd any, no man of reaſon but will
acquit my ſincerity, &amp; accuſe mine Adverſary for a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then that I did not attempt any advantage thence
is clear both in my words which never put either the leaſt
force in the word <hi>Laicis,</hi> nor ſo much as mention'd it or
any thing to that ſence; nor, yet, in the omiſſion of
<hi>Sacris</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is yet more manifeſt in that mine Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
never goes about to show that I made the leaſt uſe
of this miſtake, which yet ſolely imported in ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
but rather on the contrary calls it <hi>a meannes,</hi>
ſaying that I <hi>am come to that meannes of changing his words</hi>
(and indeed it is a ſtrange <hi>meannes</hi> to change them to no
purpoſe) and alledges onely as the cauſe of that <hi>meannes</hi>
(forſooth) that I did it (not to gain any help to defend
my <hi>tenet</hi> by it) but <hi>to get ſome advantage of carping at
them.</hi> But, that even this is as falſly pretended as the
other, the Readers eye will inform him, if he pleaſe to
peruſe my Anſwer (<hi>Schiſm Diſarm.</hi> p. 167.) where he
will ſee that there is not a ſillable which ſounds like <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at his words,</hi> but a ſerious Anſwer to the point</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that I <hi>could</hi> reap no profit by ſuch a miſtake
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:115675:241"/>
appears by the very point it ſelf apply'd to my words:
for, ſince he denies not but I tranſcrib'd right, and grants
that he made laws <hi>de Epiſcopis &amp; Clericis; of Bishops and
Clergy men;</hi> to what end should I omit <hi>Sacris, ſacred Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
ſince he that could make laws concerning thoſe, who
were over <hi>Sacred Officies,</hi> could <hi>a fortiori</hi> make laws for
the <hi>Sacred Offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

p. 125. <hi>l.</hi> 18. 19.</p>
                  <p>And, laſtly, this objection is convinced to be moſt

haſt, cauſed by my impatience to ſtand triffling after that

leaving out the particle [&amp;] before [<hi>Sacris</hi>] (of
which I wonder the Dr. made not another falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
as well as in mis-writing that word. And, it
ſeems, the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> or oppoſition between <hi>Clericis,</hi> &amp;,
<hi>Laicis,</hi> very obvious to one's mind, not particularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive,
which ſeem'd warranted by my fore knowledge
that <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> (a ſecular Prince) made laws concerning
laymen alſo, made me not aware of my miſtake; and,
on the other ſide, there was nothing in ſo unconcerning
a change which could awaken in me an apprehenſion
that I had erred; which, had there been any force put
particularly in that word, I should have reflected on.
But I have ſaid too much in excuſing a materiall error,

after [<hi>name</hi>] he calls a falſification, inſincerity, &amp; alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
it is put in by me; whereas, 'tis moſt palpably mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
I uſed the word [<hi>alone</hi>] as my own word not the

or [<hi>alone</hi>] to reſtrain his extravagant interpretation, no

that I uſed the word [<hi>alone</hi>] as mine own not the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
I was ſo exact as to put it down in a different letter
from that in which I put [<hi>the name</hi>] pretended to be the

uſed to put mine own words throughout the whole book
as contradiſtinguish't fom the words of others (as is to

was not ſufficient to ſecure my ſincerity, nor ſtave of Dr.
H. from his needfull, &amp; now grown naturall inſincerity;
look <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 167. <hi>l</hi> 2 and you shall ſee he changes the
word [alone] in which he contends my falſification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts,
from the roman letter in which I writ it (and by
thus writing it, ownd it for mine) into the Italic or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
letter, which ſignifies that I pretended it the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil's
word and tranſlated it thence. And, when he hath
thus changed my word, thus diſtinctively put, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
my intention, and the import or application
of that particle, he calls his manifeſt falſification of my
words, my falſification of the Councils; and Grounds his
cavill &amp; calumny meerly upon his own inſincere carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge;
in which I muſt tell him plainly he has committed a
peece of moſt open knavery. Let the Dr. &amp; his friends
patdon me theſe plain expreſſions, till they show me why
he that accuſes another of falſifying (which is Knavery
in the height) and builds his uniuſt accuſation onely upon
the ſame fault committed by himſelf at the ſame time,
may not with juſtice &amp; modeſty both be branded with
that qualification, which he would thus vniuſtly affix
upon another.</p>
                  <p>My fourth falſification (<hi>Si Dijs placet</hi>) is found in
the ſame places as the former, <hi>Schiſm Diſarm.</hi> p. 1 5. I
cited the council that thoſe Metropolitanes (erected by
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:115675:243"/>
Kings) <hi>should enjoy onely the honour;</hi> and then alledged
<hi>Balſamon's</hi> words, that <hi>this honour mean't no more but that
that Bishoprick should be called a Metropolis.</hi> Now, Dr.
H. in his <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 167. <hi>l.</hi> 19. aſſures his Reader that [<hi>this
is another falſification</hi>] ſuch <hi>another</hi> as the former, you
may be ſure. But why good Dr.? Do you go about to
show that I put not down the Authors words aright, but
mangledly &amp; corruptly to my onely &amp; beſt advantage,
as your cuſtome is? Nothing leſſ; he pretends to show
no ſuch thing; though this be the very thing we uſe to
call a falſification. Strange! How comes this then to be
a falſification when not one word is shown to be falſify'd?
why thus. <hi>Balſamon</hi> (alledges the Dr.) <hi>Say's no more then
this that [ſome asked, or heard, or were told,</hi> &amp;c.] Good!
uſe thine eyes again, Reader, &amp; ſee whether, <hi>Schiſm
Diſarm.</hi> p. 145. <hi>l.</hi> 13. 14. &amp;c. in the very place to which
he relates, I did not put down minutely &amp; particularly
both in Greek and English thoſe very words as told us by
<hi>Balſamon,</hi> with which the Dr. here correc'ts me, and
ſlily intimates to the abuſed Reader, that I either diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
or omitted it. The teſtimony was this as ſet down by
me <hi>verbatim</hi> out of Balſamon: [<hi>Some deſired to know what
that honour mean't;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
that <hi>except onely that
this Bishoprick, was called a Metropolis, in all other things
it was ſubject to the former Metropolis.</hi>] Now I never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that <hi>Balſamon</hi> told us this as his own opinion, but
as the judgment of others, I quoted him as an Hiſtorian,
not as judge: nor can the very words put down by me
[<hi>Some deſired,</hi> &amp;c.] poſſibly permit ſuch a conceit. Nor,
had it been my advantage (could common ſence have
born it) to have pretended this as the ſentence of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamon;</hi>
for, I ever conceived it came from perſons of
greater Authority and ſuppoſed more knowing in thoſe
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:115675:243"/>
affairs, that is, from the council or ſome of the council,
at leaſt from perſons, who perfectly underſtood it's mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
For, of whom should we imagin in reaſon ſuch a
queſtion was ask't, but of ſuch perſons? or why should
we think that <hi>Balſamon,</hi> writing upon that council with
pretence to explicate it, should intend to put down a
frivolous queſtion &amp; an impertinent Anſwer, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a ſolemn queſtion propoſed by ſome concerned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
about the ſence of that council, and ſatisfy'd by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
iudicious perſons intimately acquainted with, or of
that council it ſelf, if not of the whole council; which is
moſt ſit, as it is moſt able, to interpret it's own mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
It had been then both impoſſible the words put
down by my ſelf should bear it, and alſo very diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to my cauſe to pretend <hi>Balſamon</hi> ſpoke this of
his own judgment: and conſequently the irrationall &amp;
perfectly groundles aſperſion of this Dr. ly all at his own
door, &amp; challenge him aloud of the inſincerity he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to others.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon he gives why this was a falſification (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth)
is introduced with another [<hi>beſides</hi>] and is ſtill aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
beſides the purpoſe as the former. <hi>Beſides this, I
ſay</hi> (marke the ſtrength of the Drs words) <hi>It is clear that
this of being onely called M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tropolitans, was the punishment
inflicted on them by the council, which as I ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. well
Dr. let the council mean what it pleaſe, or let my conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
hold well or ill, that is another queſtion; but, did
I omit any word of <hi>Balſamon</hi> in this preſent teſtimony
(which you pretend I falſify) which ſeem'd to oppoſe
my tenet? did I add or change any title in favour of it?
nay did I add, detract, or change the leaſt particle how
unconcerning ſoever, or do you goe about to show any
ſuch thing? how then, and with what face can you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
I <hi>falſify'd</hi> it? If all ill conſequences or deductions be
falſifications, then it is impoſſible, where men maintain
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:115675:244"/>
different opinions, but one ſide or other muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be <hi>falſifiers.</hi> Since then I neither pretended not could
pretend any more, but that <hi>Balſamon told us what honour
meant</hi> by relating the Anſwer given to thoſe demanders,
and this is <hi>verbatim</hi> avouched in thoſe words as put down
by me, nor is my putting them down reprehenſible by
my very Adverſary, it follows (what ever my conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
or arguing thence be) that I am acquitted of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity;
and that the groundles pretence that I <hi>falſify'd</hi>
is proved to be an undeniable evidence that Dr. H. moſt
willfully and weakly calumniated And, as for his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to invalidate my conſequence, layd out here in tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
pretty terms of, <hi>I ſay, it is clear; as I ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. were
time &amp; place proper to Anſwer it, I dare undertake to
show that theſe bold words are the beſt proof he brings
for it, what ever Gloſſes he makes from the abuſed
council.</p>
                  <p>And now, kinde Reader, I have acquitted my ſelf, &amp;
shown to thine eye, that the greateſt faults the moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating
Adverſary could pick out of my writings are
perfectly innocent: but, what worthy requitall for ſo
much iniuſtice can I offer to <hi>Dr. H.</hi> I could preſent thee,
Reader, with a long black Scrowl of egregious &amp; wilfull
falſifications from the reſt of his long book, which I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve

brood of moſt enormous ones in his very book of
Schiſm, which eſcap't my obſervation when I firſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

I could show thee, how not content to falſify thus groſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; wilfully onely in the ſame teſtimony, he doubles
or rather trebles my former fault &amp; shame; and that,
whereas the queſtion was whether the Emperor could do
it dependently on the Church and executing her orders,
which we grant; or independently, &amp; without her orders,
which we deny &amp; he pretends, the Dr. puts down onely
that the Emperor conſtituted this Arch-bishop <hi>should
have locum Apoſtolicae Sedis, the place of an</hi> (as he falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
it) <hi>Apoſtolicall Seat;</hi> but leaves out what follows

orders of the Pope; all expreſly againſt him &amp; for us,
and therefore both thoſe &amp; the former words being thus

by the Dr. it is impoſſible but his moſt partiall Admiter,
(if he have not abſolutely renounc't his reaſon &amp; reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the ſlender fading thing into the Drs Authority) muſt
ſee &amp; confeſſ he was wilfully fraudulent, &amp; intended to
breed in the Readers minde by the words thus maimedly
&amp; falſly put, another apprehenſion than the teſtimony
it ſelf, rightly dealt with, could have cauſed Yet, as long
as this Enemy to Truth &amp; true dealing, makes zealous
profeſſions of <hi>his entire deſire to ſpeak the full Truth of God,</hi>

ſuch kinde of falſifications, Reader, I could afford thee
variety were it neceſſary; but I have already done enough

                  <p>You ſee Dr. H. it will not do; no tricks can prevail againſt

what) your partiall fancy can imagin may be defended on
ſome ſleight fashion to be the meaning. See in the Index
what undeniable ſelf contradictions, weakneſſes abſurdities,
voluntary miſtakes, &amp; falſifications, your task of defending
Schiſm hath put you upon: Be true to your own beſt intereſt,
a ſincere conſcience; be true at leaſt to your own honour, and,
neglect, for the future, the defence of that cauſe, which muſt
inevitably throw you upon ſuch Rocks. The further you reply
the worſe it will ſtill fare with you. For, to clear your ſelf of
theſe falſifications &amp; other manifold faults ſatisfactorily, is
impoſſible; eye-ſight atteſting them; not to clear your ſelf of
them is doubly diſgracefull, fluttering up &amp; down (as your way
of writing is) entangles you more: Sit still, and you will be
ſafer. You cannot but ſee &amp; acknowledge that your poſition of
a probable faith leads directly to Atheiſm, if follow'd, and
that, ſince none has reaſon to aſſent further then he has rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that is, further then the reaſons given convince; and,
ſince no probability can poſſibly convince the thing is true,
or, that the Authority ſpeaks true, it is impoſſible any man
living can have any obligation in your Grounds to aſſent that
any point of faith is true, or any Authority to be beleeved;
nay, if he will not renounce his nature, he ought to ſuſpend
in both theſe; that is, embrace no faith at all. The neceſſity of
holding which <hi>tenet</hi> ſo fundamentally pernicious to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:115675:246"/>
ſo odious to all good Chriſtians, unavoidably follows
out of your principles of Schiſm, built upon the rejecting the
onely certain Rule of faith, immediate Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſnes
to your ſelf that your weak teſtimony-way reaches no
further than probability, enforces you to own it, and aym at
no higher a pitch of ſatisfaction, that is, none at all, for, how
can probability ſatisfy? Look behinde you then, &amp; ſee what a
great deal of induſtry &amp; time you have fruitleſly loſt in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
over promiſcuouſly multitudes of Authors, without firſt
ſtudying Grounds, that is, without firſt laying your thoughts in
order, with evident deduction from and connexion with firſt
Principles. This task, onely is called knowledge, the former
without this is more apt to lead to ignorance &amp; miſtake lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
onely a confuſion of motley incohere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thoughts in a mans
head, impoſſible to be orderly rank't in the poſture of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
unles regulated by fore layd Grounds. Look before you,
and you shall ſee many late wits, whoſe gallant ſelf-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Souls, own their nature, &amp; rationally ſcorn to ſubmit
to any aſſent but upon rigorous &amp; demonſtrative Evidence,
either of the thing it ſelf, in Science, or of the Authority, in
faith. Suffer your ſelf to be won to the imitation of theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvers
of knowledge; leave talking words, &amp; begin to ſpeak
Sence; leave of to diffuſe &amp; ſcatter abroad your fleeting
thoughts in a Sermonary &amp; Preaching way, and begin to
connect them into rigorous diſcourſe, that is, inſtead of aiery
talk, begin to iudge &amp; know, inſtead of empty florish, learn to
be ſolid. Ina word aym ſeriously to know, that is, to aſſent upon
Evidence, and then, I am confident, our underſtandings will
meet in a ioynt-aſſent, and (I hope) our wills in a conſent &amp;
ſubmiſſion to the Authority of that Church, whoſe Rule of
faith, immediate Tradition, is evidently demonſtrable. This,

ſecond Adverſary in ſubſtantiall and
fundamentall points, either in behalf,
of R. C. or S. W. if thoſe paſſages in
which I bring Dr. H. to Grounds bee
duly reflected on: ſince, neither can
my Lord of Derry deny but that there is now a <hi>breach</hi>
made between us in the points now controverted; nor
does hee pretend <hi>demonſtrative</hi> and <hi>rigorous Evidence</hi>
that the Pop'es Authority was an vſurpation, and ſo
their renouncing it no criminall breach but a lawfull ſelf-enfranchiſement:
Nor laſtly, does hee endeavour to shew
that leſſ, than ſuch <hi>rigorous Evidence</hi> (that is, that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi>
reaſons) are ſufficient ground to renounce, ſuch an
Authority; and ſoe ſtrongly ſupported by a long poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
an vniverſall delivery of immediate forefathers as

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:115675:248"/>
a Schiſm, &amp; conſequently their ſalavations upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
lottery of a <hi>probability.</hi> This was all which funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
concern'd this Controverſy; and this is wholly
omitted by his fellow Mr. H. aſwell as himſelf; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
till they ſpeak out directly to this point (to
do which they are ever very warily loath) they can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hope it from courteſy, not claim it from iuſtice, that
they are vouchſafed any anſwer at all; ſince, they who
will not bee drawn to ſpeak to the purpoſe, deſerve to
been neglected, and ſuffer'd to talk to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now, for ſatisfaction how little can bee ſaid to thoſe

left in a manner wholly unanſwer'd as yet by Mr.
H. and to my Grounds before the foregoing Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to the Title <hi>Down-Derry</hi> hee shows himſelf

Onely leſt hee should conceit ſome petty victorie in
having thus pos'd his Adverſary, hee may pleaſe to take
notice that it nothing concerns him; for the Bp: is behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

part of our charge; and preuaricates from anſwering any
title of the firſt, by cavilling groundlesly at unconcerning
toyes; giving us generall terms in ſtead of the particular
thing; falſifying openly the Council of Epheſus; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
common ſence; of controvertiſt turning Lawyer,
and impugning the Extent of the Pope's Authority, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the ſubſtance of it; wilfully misrepreſenting every
word of our Rule of faith, as put down by his Adverſary;
and, laſtly, by plainly confeſſing hee will not anſwer our
charge or Objection.</head>
                  <p>
                     <q>IT was objected that <hi>the crime of Schiſm would appear
to bee iuſtly charged upon his Church</hi> not onely with
colour, but with undeniable Evidence of fact; by the
very poſition of the caſe and the nature of his exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions.</q>
Meaning, that there was a manifeſt <hi>fact</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
and breaking from an Authority long acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
as of Chriſt's Inſtitution, upon <hi>Exceptions</hi> short
of Demonſtration; that is, short of power to convince
a rationall underſtanding; that is, Paſſion &amp; not thoſe
reaſons muſt move firſt the will, and by it the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to a conuiction; that is, the breach or Schiſm was
<hi>criminall.</hi> Now the good Bishop</p>
                  <p>Firſt leaves out the ſecond part of theſe words, [<hi>the
nature of his Exceptions</hi>] which concern'd himſelf; and
puts down onely the firſt part, to wit, <hi>the poſition of the
caſe.</hi> Whereas, wee charge them not with Schiſm upon
this ſingle account, that they broke from a formerly-acknowledg'd
Authority, which is the poſition of the
caſe; but, that they broke from it without hauing <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
&amp; demonſtratiue reaſons and <hi>Exceptions</hi> againſt it,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:115675:249"/>
but, at beſt, pretended <hi>probable</hi> ones onely; that is, ſuch
as are no waies either able to oblige the underſtanding
to aſſent upon them, nor ſufficient Grounds to renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
any Authority at all, much leſſ an Authority held <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi>
before, &amp; thus qualify'd. For, what a ſlack thing
would the world bee, if <hi>probable</hi> Exceptions of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
(I mean, ſuch as are held noe more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the ſubjects themſelves) should bee held ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ground to diſacknowledge their Governour's right,
and alter the preſent Government? Would any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the world remain on foot three years to an end,
if this method were allow'd and practiſed; unles, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
force preuaild over reaſon? The Bishop had good
reaſon then to omit that which concern'd <hi>the nature of
his own Exceptions:</hi> For, though himſelf and his friends
love extremely to talk prettily, yet they cannot endure
the reaſons which make up their Diſcourſe should bee
brought to the teſt, or their validity to convince the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
ſcann'd; that is, they love not to ſpeak out
whether they bee <hi>demonſtrative,</hi> or <hi>probable</hi> onely. They
dare not aſſert the former, conſcious that their beſt way
of diſcourſing is onely thetoricall, topicall, and for the
moſt part quibbling and blu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering in a wordish teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
whence no <hi>demonſtration,</hi> or (it's proper effect) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
is likely to bee expected. Nor yet dare they for
shame confeſſ the latter; knowing that a <hi>probability,</hi>
though never ſo ſtrong, ſtill leaves room for a <hi>may bee-otherwiſe;</hi>
and ſo can never conclude that the thing <hi>muſt-bee;</hi>
that is, can never, without iniury to a rationall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
claim it's <hi>aſſent</hi> that the thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>: for, how can any
man in reaſon <hi>aſſent</hi> that the thing <hi>is ſo</hi> upon that motive,
which very motive permits that <hi>it may not bee ſo?</hi> It was
not therefore dishoneſty in the Bishop, going about to
impugn his Adverſary, to omit one halfe of that which
hee grounded himſelf on; but a great deal of prudenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>

and warines, or indeed a kind of neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly proceeding upon this miſtake of his own,
hee wrangles with us, for calling this <hi>our chief objection
againſt them;</hi> as king us <hi>if ſtating the queſtion and objecting
bee all one?</hi> No ſure; if wee ſpeak rigorouſly: but a <hi>Charge</hi>
againſt one is often call'd, an <hi>Objection.</hi> Now ours againſt
you (which you here purpoſely mutilate) is this, that you
left a preacknowledg'd Eccleſiaſticall Authority, upon
fantaſtick Exceptions, that is, unpon <hi>uncertain</hi> Grounds:
Which objection (if verify'd) ſo euidently concludes you
wilfull Schiſmaticks, that it is impoſſible to bee cloak't
or evaded. Now the firſt part, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerns your <hi>actuall
reiecting</hi> that actuall Authority, is notorious to the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
world, and confeſt by your ſelves. The ſecond, that
you did it upon <hi>uncertain</hi> Grounds, your ſelf when you
are preſt to it will confeſſ alſo; for, I preſume, you dare
not pretend to rigorous demonſtration; Both, becauſe
your ſelf would bee the firſt Proteſtant that ever preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it; as alſo, becauſe your beſt Champions grant your
faith &amp; it's Grounds but <hi>probable.</hi> And, should you pitch
upon ſome one beſt reaſon or teſtimony pretended to
demonſtrate your point, wee should quickly make an
end of the Controverſy, by showing it short of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>evidently,</hi> as you well know: which makes you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
either diſclaime, or decline that pretence; never
pitching upon any one pretended conuincing or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative
reaſon which you dare ſtand to, but hudling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
many in a diffuſed Diſcourſe; hoping that an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation
of <hi>may-bee</hi> will perſuade vulgar and half wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
underſtandings that your <hi>tenet</hi> is certain, &amp; <hi>muſt bee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Bp. asks us <hi>who muſt put the caſe,</hi> or ſtate
the queſtion? telling us, that <hi>if a Proteſtant do it, it will
not bee ſo undeniably evident.</hi> I anſwer, let the leaſt child
put it; let the whole world put it; let themſelves put it:
Do not all theſe grant &amp; hold that K. H. deny'd the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:115675:250"/>
Pope's Supremacy? Does not all the world ſee that the
pretended <hi>Church of England</hi> ſtands now otherwiſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than it did in H. the 7ths
dayes? Does not the Bps. of Schiſm. c. 7. par. 2. fellow-fencer,
Dr. H. confeſſ in expreſſe terms, <hi>And firſt, for
the matter of fact, it is acknowledg'd that in the Reign of K.
H. the 8th, the Papall power in Eccleſiaſticall affairs, was,
both by Acts of Convocation of the Clergy, &amp; by ſtatutes or
Acts of Parliament, caſt out of this Kingdome?</hi> Was this
power it ſelf thus caſt out before? that is, was it not in
actuall force <hi>till</hi> and <hi>at</hi> this time? and is not this time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd
as that in which the Reformation in this point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan?
Wee beg then nothing <hi>gratis,</hi> but begin our proceſſ,
upon truth acknowledg'd by the whole world. Our caſe
puts nothing but this undeniable and evident matter of
<hi>fact:</hi> whence wee conclude them, criminally-Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
unles their <hi>Exceptions</hi> againſt this Authority's right
bee ſuch as, in their owne nature, oblige the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to aſſent that this Authority was vſurpt; onely
which can iuſtify ſuch a breach. So that the Bishop firſt
omits to mention the one half, of that on which wee
build our charge, (to wit, <hi>the nature of their Exceptions;</hi>)
and, when hee hath done, wilfully miſtakes, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
the other: perſuading the unwary Reader that
the caſe wee put is involu'd in ambiguities, and may bee
ſtated variouſly; whereas 'tis placed in as open a manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
as the ſun at noonday, and acknowledg'd uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally.
In neither of which the Bishop hath approved
himſelf too honeſt a man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now, let us ſee what hee anſwers to the caſe it ſelf.
It was put down,</hi> Schiſm Diſarm. <hi>p. 307. thus; that</hi> in
the beginning of H. the 8ths reign, the Church of England
agreed with that of Rome and all the reſt of her Communion,
in two points, which were then and are now the bonds of
vnity, betwixt all her Members. One concerning faith, the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:115675:250"/>
other Government. For faith, her Rule was, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
which had been inherited from their forefathers, as
the Legacies of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, were ſolely to bee
acknowledg'd for obligatory, and nothing in them to bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
For Government, her Principle was, that Chriſt had
made S. Peter firſt, or chief, or Prince of his Apoſtles;
who was to bee the firſt Mover under him in the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his departure out of this world, &amp;c. and, that the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops
of Rome, as ſucceſſours of S. Peter, inherited from him
this priuiledge in reſpect of the ſucceſſours of the reſt of the
Apoſtles; and actually exerciſed this power in all thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
which kept Communion with the Church of Rome, that
very year wherein this unhappy ſeparation began.</p>
                  <p>It is noe leſſe evident that, in the reigne of Ed the 6th Q.
Elizabeth and her ſucceſſours, neither the former Rule of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of faith, nor this ſecond of Vnity of Government (which
is held by the firſt) have had any power in that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the Proteſtants call the English Church. This is
our objection againſt you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is our <hi>caſe,</hi> ioyntly put by us and by the whole
world; which the Bp. calls an <hi>Engine,</hi> and pretends to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
a <hi>view</hi> of it. But, never did good man look ſoe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quint
upon a thing which hee was concern'd to <hi>view,</hi> as
my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of Deity does at the poſition of this plain caſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hee anſwers, that wee would <hi>obtrude upon them
the Church of Rome and it's dependents for the Catholike
Church.</hi> Whereas, wee neither urge any ſuch thing in that
place, nor ſo much as mention there the word <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik;</hi>
as is to bee ſeen in my words put down here by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
p. 3. but onely charge them, that the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
formerly agreed with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in theſe
two a foreſaid Principles, which afterwards they renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
In ſtead of anſwering poſitiuely to which, or replying
<hi>I</hi> or <hi>noe,</hi> the fearfull, Bishop ſtarts a ſide to this needles
diſgreſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="482" facs="tcp:115675:251"/>
Next, hee tells us what degree of <hi>reſpect they</hi> owe, now
to the <hi>Church of Rome:</hi> Whereas the queſtion is not what
they <hi>owe now,</hi> but what they <hi>did</hi> or <hi>acted then;</hi> that is,
whether or no they reiected thoſe two Principles of faith
and Government, in which formerly they conſented with
her. To this the wary Bp. ſaies nothing.</p>
                  <p>After theſe weak evaſions, hee tells us, that <hi>the Court
of Rome had excluded two third parts of the Catholick
Church from their Communion; that the world is greater
than the City:</hi> and ſo runs on with his own wiſe ſayings
of the ſame ſtrain, to the end of the parag. Whereas, the
preſent circumſtances inuite him onely to confeſſ or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
what <hi>they</hi> did; and whether <hi>they</hi> renounced thoſe two
Principles of Vnity, or no: not to ſtand railing thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably
upon his own head what <hi>our Church</hi> did; shee
shall clear herſelf when due circumſtances require ſuch a
diſcourſe. Again, whenas wee object that <hi>they thus broke
from all thoſe which held Communion with the Church of
Rome;</hi> hee falls to talk againſt the <hi>Court of Rome:</hi> as if
all thoſe particular <hi>Churches,</hi> which held Communion
with the ſee of <hi>Rome,</hi> had well approved of nor ever ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominated
their breach from thoſe two a foreſaid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
but the <hi>Court</hi> of Rome onely. Did ever man look
thus awry upon a point which hee aimed to reply to; or
did ever <hi>Hocus-pocus</hi> ſtrive with more nimble ſleights to
divert his ſpectatour's eyes from what hee was about:
than the Bp. does to draw of his Readers from the point
in hand? In a word, all that can bee gather'd from him
in order to this matter conſiſts in theſe words [<hi>this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſeparation:</hi>] by which hee ſeems to intimate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
of any ſeparation made in the a foreſaid Principles;
but it is ſo shameles and open an vntruth, that hee dares
not own it in expreſſ terms; nor yet, (ſuch is his shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling)
will hee confeſſ the contrary. I know his party ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes
endeavours to evade, by ſaying that our Church
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:115675:251"/>
cauſed the breach by excommunicating them: but, ask
whether they broke from and renounced that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(and ſo deſerved excommunication) ere they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
thus excommunicated by it; and, their own conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
with the whole world will anſwer, they did. It is that
former breach of theirs, then, and reiection of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which denominates them Schiſmaticks; till
they can render ſufficient, that is, <hi>evident</hi> Grounds why
they reiected it: for, otherwiſe, nothing is more weak,
than to imagine that Governours should not declare
themſelves publikely and ſolemnly againſt the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of their Authority; or, that a King should not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ame
for Rebells and incapable of any priuiledges from
the commonwealth, thoſe perſons who already had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledg'd
his Right, and obſtinately broken it's laws.
Either show us, then, that our Excommunication ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
you from your former <hi>tenets,</hi> to wit, from holding
thoſe a foreſaid Principles of Vnity in faith and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
or elſe gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that your ſelves actually ſeparated from
them both, that is, from our Church. This, my Lord,
is the ſeparation which uniuſtify'd, makes a criminall
Schiſm: Excommunication is onely the punishment due
to the antecedent crime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Order,</hi> which conſiſts in Government being eſſentiall
to a Church if intended to continue, it follows that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
Chriſt intended his Church should continue, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
the order of the Church, otherwiſe hee had not
conſtituted a Church, ſince a Church cannot bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that which is eſſentiall, to a Church. Wherefore, ſeing
that which Chriſt inſtituted is of faith, it follows that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Government is of faith, and ſo, muſt bee, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to us by the ſame Rule that other points of faith
are. Hence, ſpeaking of the two Principles, one of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in faith, the other of Vnity in Government, I affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that <hi>the truth of the latter is included in the former, and
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:115675:252"/>
hath it's Evidence from it.</hi> Muſt not hee now bee very
quarelſome, who can wrangle with ſuch an innocent and
plain truth?</p>
                  <p>The iealous Bishop firſt alledges, <hi>'tis done to gain the
more opportunity to shuffle the latter uſurpations of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe's,
into the ancient diſcipline of the Church.</hi> Not a iot,
my Lord: the ſtanding to this Rule, to wit, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
delivery of fathers to ſons atteſtation, renders it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for an <hi>uſurpation</hi> to enter; Nor can you, or any
elſe inſtance, that any uſurpation either in ſecular or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Government ever came in, prerending that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
or show that it ever could, as long as men adhered
to that method. It muſt bee either upon wit explications
of word in the laws, or of ambiguous peeces of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not upon this immediate delivery from hand to hand,
(in which wee place our Rule of faith) that <hi>encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
are built. Had wee, then, a mind to obtrude <hi>uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations</hi>
upon you, wee had recurr'd to teſtimony-proofs,
(the Proteſtants onely method;) where with hath a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
field to maintain a probability-skirmish of the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
poſitions imaginable: not to this Rule of ſoe vaſt a
multitude of eye-witneſſes of viſible things from age to
age; Which Rule is as impoſſible to bee crooked, as it is
for a world of fathers to conſpire to tell a world of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
this ly, that ten years ago they held and practiſed
what themſelves and all the world beſides knew they did
not.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond exception is far more groundleſly quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.
'Tis againſt my making <hi>two</hi> Principles; one in <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
the other in <hi>diſcipline:</hi> whereas, euery Child ſees
that <hi>doctrine</hi> &amp; <hi>diſcipline,</hi> or faith, and Government ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
manifeſtly two diſtinet ranks or Orders; the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
immediately to information of the underſtanding
or ſpeculative <hi>holding,</hi> the other to <hi>action.</hi> But his reaſons
why they should bee but one are pretty: becauſe, <hi>fruſtra
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:115675:252"/>
fit per plura quod fieri poteſt per pauciora, It is in vain to
make two rules where one will ſerve.</hi> By which <hi>maxim,</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
miſunderſtood, as 'tis by him, one may diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
againſt the making ſeverall laws, and ſeverall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
with the like Logick, and ſay, all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them with diſtinction is <hi>vain,</hi> becauſe this one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<hi>to do well, or, to do no ill,</hi> includes all the reſt.
Again, hee imagins, becauſe <hi>the truth of one depends on
the other,</hi> therefore they ought not to bee treated diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
as if it were vain or needles, to deduce conſequences,
or, as if Mathematicians ought not to conclude any
thing, but hover ſtill in the generall Principles of <hi>Euclid,</hi>
without making any progreſſe farther, becauſe the truth
of the conſequences depends on thoſe <hi>Principles.</hi> Are
theſe men fit to write Controverſies; who cannot, or will
not, write common ſence?</p>
                  <p>After hee had been thus frivolouſly backward, hee
adds, that hee <hi>readily admits both my firſt &amp; ſecond Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
reduced into one in this ſubſequent</hi> form: <hi>thoſe doctrines
and that diſcipline, which wee inherited from our forefathers
as the Legacy of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, ought ſolely to bee
acknowledg'd for obligatory, and nothing in them to bee
changed that is ſubſtantial or eſſentiall.</hi> See here, Reader,
the right Proteſtant method, which is, to bring the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
from a <hi>determinate</hi> ſtate, to <hi>indetermination</hi> and
<hi>confuſion;</hi> and, from the particular thing, to common
words. Wee point them out a determinate form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
to wit, that of one ſupreme Bishop in God's
Church: 'tis known what it means: 'tis known that the
acknowledgment of that Government is now, and was at
the time of the breach, the bond of Vnity between tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
Churches which held that Government, of which the
Church of <hi>England</hi> was one: 'tis known they renounced
this form of Government, that is, that, which was and
ſtill is, to the Church they formerly communicated with,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:115675:253"/>
a bond of Vnity in diſcipline. Again, 'tis known that wee
hold the voice of the Church, that is, the conſent of
Catholick fathers immediately atteſting that they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this doctrine from their forefathers, infallible; and,
that none cannot bee ignorant of what their fathers teach
them &amp; bring them up in: Which immediate receiving
it from fathers wee call, here, <hi>inheritance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, I ſay, are determinate points, manifeſting
themſelves in their known particularities Now, the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop,
inſtead of letting us know, <hi>I</hi> or <hi>noe,</hi> whether they
broke that Principle of Vnity in diſcipline (which 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they did, by renouncing the Pope's Authority) or
that Principle of Vnity in doctrine, to wit, Tradition,
delivery, or handing down by immediate forefathers,
(which 'tis evident they did, out of the very word, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
which they own &amp; extoll; Or, inſtead of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us what particular Rule of faith, what particular form
of Government, they have introduc't into God's Church
in room of the former; He refers us to <hi>Platonick Ideas</hi>
of both, to bee found in <hi>Concavo Lunae;</hi> wrapping them
up in ſuch generall terms, as hee may bee ſure they shall
never come to open light, leſt by ſpeaking out hee should
bring himſelf into inconveniences.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve his words. <hi>Thoſe doctrines &amp; that diſcipline
which wee inherited from our forefathers, as the Legacies of
Chriſt and his Apoſtles, ought ſolely to bee acknowledg'd for
obligatory; and nothing in them is to bee changed, which is
ſubſtantiall or eſſentiall.</hi> But, what and how many thoſe
<hi>doctrines</hi> are, what in particular that <hi>diſcipline</hi> is, what hee
means by <hi>In heriting,</hi> what by <hi>forefathers,</hi> what by <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall:</hi>
none muſt expect in reaſon to know: for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who is the relater, does not. Are thoſe doctrines their
39 Articles? Alas, noe: thoſe are not <hi>obligatory,</hi> their
beſt Champions reiect them at pleaſure. Are they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Creed onely? Hee will ſeem to ſay ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:115675:253"/>
upon ſome urgent occaſion: but then ask him, are
the proceſſions of the divine Perſons, the Sacraments
Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſm of children, Government of the Church, the
acknowledging there is ſuch a thing as God's written
word, or Scripture, &amp;c. <hi>obligatory?</hi> the good man is
gravelld. In fine, when you urge him home, his laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
will bee, that all which is in God's word is <hi>obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi>
and then hee thinks himſelf ſecure; knowing that
men may wrangle with wit coniectures an hundred yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
there, ere any <hi>Evidence,</hi> that is, conviction, bee
brought. Thus the Bishop is got into a wood, and leaves
you in another, and farther from knowing in particular
what <hi>doctrines</hi> thoſe are, than you were at firſt.</p>
                  <p>Again, ask him what in <hi>particular</hi> that <hi>diſcipline</hi> is,
own'd by Proteſtants to have come from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his
Apoſtles, as their <hi>Legacy,</hi> (for hee gives us no other
deſcription of it than thoſe generall terms onely;) and
hee is in as ſad a caſe as hee was before. Will hee ſay, 'tis
that of the ſecular power being Head of the Church, or
that of Bishops? Neither of theſe can bee: for, they ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge
the french Church for their ſiſter Proteſtant,
and yet shee owns no ſuch forms of Government to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
come from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but that of <hi>Preſbyters</hi> onely; which
they of <hi>England</hi> as much diſown to have been <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy.
It remains, then, that the Proteſtants have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't
into the Church, at or ſince the Reformation, in
ſtead of that they renounced, no <hi>particular</hi> form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that is, <hi>no one,</hi> that is, they have left <hi>none;</hi>
but onely pay their adherents with terms in generall, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them of with <hi>words</hi> for <hi>realities,</hi> and <hi>names</hi> for <hi>things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, ask him what hee means by <hi>inheriting:</hi> and
hee will tell us, if hee bee urged and preſt hard, (for, till
then, no Proteſtant ſpeaks out,) that hee means not the
ſucceſſion of it from <hi>immediate</hi> forefathers and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;
which is our Rule of faith and that which <hi>inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
                     <pb n="488" facs="tcp:115675:254"/>
properly ſignifies (this would cut the throat of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
at one blow; ſince, <hi>Reformation</hi> of any point,
and a former <hi>immediate delivery</hi> of it, are as inconſiſtent
as that the ſame thing can both <hi>bee</hi> and <hi>not bee</hi> at once.)
But, that which hee means by <hi>inheriting</hi> is, that your
title to ſuch a <hi>tenet</hi> is to bee look't for in Antiquity; that
is, in a vaſt Library of books filld with dead words, to
bee toſt and explicated by witts &amp; criticks: where hee
hopes his Proteſtant followers may not without ſome
difficulty, find convincing Evidence that his doctrine is
falſe; and that, rather than take ſo much pains, they
will bee content to beleeve him and his fellows.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſeeſt then, Reader, what thou art brought to:
namely, to relinquish a <hi>Rule,</hi> (that I may omit <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable)
open, known,</hi> and as <hi>eaſy</hi> to teach thee faith, as
children learne their A. B. C. (for, ſuch is immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of viſible and practicall points by forefathers;) to
embrace another method, ſoe full of <hi>perplexity, quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-ambiguity</hi>
and <hi>difficulty,</hi> that, without running over
&amp; examining thouſands of volumes, (that is, ſcarce in thy
whole life time) shalt thou ever bee able to find perfect
ſatisfaction in it, or to chuſe thy faith: that is, if thou
followſt their method of ſearching for faith, and purſveſt
it rationally, thou may'ſt ſpend thy whole life in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and, in all likelihood, dy, ere thou chuſeſt or pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt
upon any faith at all.</p>
                  <p>The like quibble is in the word <hi>forefathers,</hi> hee means
not by it <hi>immediate forefathers,</hi> as wee do, (that would
quite ſpoil their pretence of <hi>Reformation;</hi>) but, ancient
writers: and, ſo, hee hath pointed us out no determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
Rule at all, till it bee agreed on whom thoſe forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
muſt bee, and how their expreſſions are to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;
both which are controverted, and need a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But the chiefeſt peece of tergiverſation lies in thoſe laſt
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:115675:254"/>
words, that <hi>nothing is to bee changed in thoſe Legacies,</hi>
which <hi>is ſubstantiall or eſſentiall:</hi> That is, when ſoever
hee and his follows have a mind to change any point,
though never ſo ſacred, nay, though the Rules of faith
and diſcipline themſelves; 'tis but mincing the matter
and ſaying they are not <hi>ſubſtantiall</hi> or <hi>eſſentiall,</hi> and then
they are licenc't to reiect them. Wee urge; the two ſaid
Principles of Vnity in <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>diſcipline</hi> are <hi>ſubſtantiall</hi>
points &amp; <hi>eſſentiall</hi> to a Church, if Vnity it ſelf bee eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
to it: Theſe your firſt Reformers <hi>inherited</hi> from their
<hi>immediate forefathers</hi> as the Legacies of Chriſt and <hi>de
facto</hi> held them for ſuch; theſe youreiected and renounc't;
this fact, therefore, of thus renouncing them concludes
you abſolute Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, till you bring
demonſtrative Evidence that the former Government
was an uſurpation, the former Rule fallible; onely which
Evidence can iuſtify a fact of this nature.</p>
                  <p>It is worth the Readers pains to reflect once more on
my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Derry's</hi> former propoſition; and to obſerve,
that, though <hi>white</hi> and <hi>black</hi> are not more different than
hee and wee are in the ſence of it, yet hee would perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
his Readers hee holds the ſame with us: ſaying, that
<hi>hee readily admits both my firſt and ſecond Rule reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one, in this ſubſequent form,</hi> &amp;c. and then puts us down
generall terms which ſignify nothing; making account
that any ſleight connexion made of aire or words is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to ty Churches together, and make them one. Iuſt
as <hi>Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Rabbi</hi> of the late Iews, in
the cloſe of his petition, would make thoſe who profeſſ
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Iews,</hi> bee of one faith; by an aiery gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
expreſſion, parallell to the Bishops, here, that <hi>both
of them expect the glory of Iſraël to bee revealed.</hi> Thus, dear
Proteſtant, Reader, thou ſeeſt what thy beſt Drs would
bring thee to: to neglect <hi>ſence,</hi> and the ſubſtantiall ſolid
import of words; and, in ſtead thereof, to bee content
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:115675:255"/>
to embrace an empty cloud of <hi>generall terms,</hi> hovering
uncertainly in the air of their owne fancies. In a word
either the <hi>ſence</hi> of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted Rule is the ſame with
that of our dilated one, or not: If not, then you have
broke the Rule of faith held by the former Church,
(unles you will contend this Rule had no <hi>ſence</hi> in it but
non-ſignificant <hi>words</hi> onely) and by conſequence are flat
Schiſmaticks. But if you ſay 'tis the ſame, you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinc't
by the plain matter of fact, nay by the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
force of ſelf-evident terms: ſince no firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
can bee more clear than the leaving to hold what
your immediate forefathers held, was not to continue to
hold what was held by the ſame forefathers; and that to
diſclame their <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>diſcipline</hi> was not to <hi>inherit</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>After hee had told us that the Church of England and
the Church of Rome both maintaine this Rule of faith,
(that is, indeed a different thing, but the ſame words;)
hee immediately diſgraces the ſaid Rule, by adding, <hi>that
the queſtion onely is, who have changed that doctrine, or
this diſcipline; wee, or they? the one by ſubſtraction, the
other by addition.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Rule is noe Rule at all; or elſe that wee do not agree
in it, which yet hee immediately before pretended; for,
ſure, that Rule can bee no Rule to him that follows it
and yet is miſled, as one of us muſt neceſſarily bee, who
according to him, hold the ſame Rule and yet different
doctrines. Either then there is no Rule of faith at all; or,
if there bee, one of us muſt neceſſarily have receded
from that Rule and proceeded upon another; ere hee
could embrace'an errour, or differ from the other. It being
known, then, and acknowledg'd that wee hold now the
ſame Rule as wee did immediately before their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is, the <hi>Tradition of immediately forefathers;</hi> it
is evident out of the very word Reformation, that they
both renounced the ſaid Rule and wee continue in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="491" facs="tcp:115675:255"/>
Next, hee aſſures his Reader, that <hi>the caſe is clear;</hi> to
wit, that wee have changed that doctrine &amp; diſcipline by
addition. This hee proves, by the wildeſt Topick that
ever came from a rationall head: Becauſe <hi>the Apoſtles
contracted this doctrine into a ſummary, that is, the creed;
and the ancient Church forbad to exact any more of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
at his Baptiſmall profeſſion;</hi> whereas wee now exact
more. What a piece of wit is here? did ever Proteſtant
hold, that there is nothing of faith but the 12. Articles in
that creed? doe not they hold that the Proceſſion of the
Holy Ghoſt, the Baptiſm of Infants, the Sacraments,
&amp;c. are the Legacies of the Apoſtles, and ſo of <hi>faith:</hi>
yet, not found in that creed? Is it not <hi>of faith</hi> with them,
that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>God's words;</hi> though it bee
not in that creed? How then follows it, that they have
changed <hi>Chriſt's</hi> doctrine by addition, who hold more
points than are in that creed of the Apoſtles? may not
wee, by the ſame Logick, accuſe the Church at the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; who preſt the word <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall,</hi>
to diſtinguish <hi>Catholicks</hi> from <hi>Arians?</hi> nay,
may not wee, by the ſelf-ſame argument, charge his own
Church, for making &amp; preſſing the profeſſion of their
39. Articles, in which are many things (as hee wel knows)
not found nor pretended to bee found in the Apoſtles
creed? What an incomparable ſtrain of weaknes is it
then, to conclude us to have changed Chriſt's doctrine
<hi>by addition;</hi> from our obliging to more points than are
found in that creed: whereas, 'tis evident and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
that very many points were held anciently and
ever, which are not put there? And what a ſelf contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
abſurdity is it, to alledge for a reaſon againſt us,
that which makes much more againſt their own every
way overthrown Congregation?</p>
                  <p>It being then manifeſt that <hi>the Apoſtles creed</hi> contains
not all that is of faith; it follows, that it was not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:115675:256"/>
as ſuch, by them, or receiv'd, as ſuch, by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church. Let us ſee then to what end it ſerved, and
how it was uſed by them; the ignorance whereof puts the
Bp. upon all this abſurdity: which hee might partly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
corrected, had hee reflected on his owne words, [<hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſmall
profeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is prudence in a Church and in any Government
whatever, not to admit any to their Communion or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to live amongſt them, till they have ſufficient
cogniza<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that they are affected to them and not to their
Enemies party. Hence at their <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> (the ſolemnity
which admits perſons into the Church) they propoſed
to them ſome ſuch form of tenets (which they therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
call'd a <hi>ſymboll</hi> or <hi>badge</hi>) as might diſtinguish them
from all the other ſects, rife at that time, for ſome time,
the Apoſtles creed was ſufficient for that, and to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> from all others: becauſe, at the time
it was made, the reſt of the world was in a manner either
<hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Iews.</hi> Afterwards, when other Adverſaries of
the Church, that is, <hi>Hereticks,</hi> aroſe againſt points not
found in that creed; it was neceſſary, upon occaſion, to
enlarge that <hi>Profeſſion of faith</hi> or <hi>ſymboll,</hi> ſoe as to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
a deteſtation of, or an averſion from that hereſy. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then, the Bp. muſt ſay, that no new hereſy shall
or can ariſe, againſt any point not found in the creed;
and then the Anabaptiſt is iuſtify'd and made a member
of the Chimericall Geryon-Shap't Church of England:
or elſe hee muſt grant that the Church, when ſuch ariſe,
muſt make new <hi>Profeſſions</hi> or <hi>ſymbolls</hi> to diſtinguish
friends from thoſe foes; unles shee will admit promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly
into her Bowells, Adverſaries for friends; a thing
able to deſtroy any Commonwealth, either Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
or temporall. This is evident out of naturall pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce;
yet this is that which my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> D. carps at, that when
new up ſtart hereſies had riſen, the Church should or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:115675:256"/>
ſuch a <hi>Profeſſion of faith</hi> and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting of ſuch points,
as may ſtop the entrance of ſuch into the Church. As
then, if the reformed Congregation were to baptize one
now, at age, and ſo make him one of their company,
none can doubt but it were prudence in her (had shee
any Grounds to own herſelf to bee a Church) to ask
him ſuch queſtions firſt, as should manifeſt hee were not
a Socinian, Anabaptiſt, or Papiſt, but Proteſtant-like
affected, that is, propoſe to him a Profeſſion of faith,
<hi>larger</hi> than is that of the creed, (for each of thoſe ſects
admits this, and yet differs from the Proteſtant:) ſo, it
could not bee imprudent in our Church, when new he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
aroſe, who yet admitted the creed, to propoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<hi>larger</hi> form of <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> which might diſcover the
affection of the party; leſt perhaps shee might make a
free denizon of her community, an arrant Adverſary,
who came in cloakt and unexamind to work her all the
miſchief hee could. Yet, this due examination before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
the Bp. calls: <hi>changing of faith by addition;</hi> thus
perpetually goes common ſence to wrack, when Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Drs goe about to iuſtify their Schiſm; and, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
the non-ſence more pithy, hee calls this a <hi>clear caſe,</hi>
that wee have thus offended by <hi>addition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, hee tells us, to confirm this, that <hi>the Generall
Council of Epheſus did forbid all men to exact any more of a
Chriſtian at his Baptiſmall Profeſſion than the Apoſtles
creed.</hi> Which is, firſt, a very round falſification and an
open abuſe of the Council. For, as may bee ſeen, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
before the 7th Canon, <hi>Theodorus Mopſueſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
&amp; <hi>Cariſius</hi> had made <hi>a wicked creed,</hi> which was brought
and read before the Council. After this begins the 7th
Canon, <hi>thus; His igitur lectis, decreuit ſancta,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe
things being read, the holy ſynod decreed, that it should bee
lawfull for no man to compoſe, write, or produce [alteram
fidem] another faith; praeter eam quae definita fuit a ſanctis
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:115675:257"/>
Patribus apud Nicaeam Vrbem in Spiritu ſancto congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
beſides that which was defined by the holy fathers gather'd
in the Holy Ghoſt at the City of Nice.</hi> Where, wee ſee,
the intention of the Council was no other than this,
that they should avoid hereticall creeds and hold to the
Orthodoxe one; not to hinder an enlargment to their
Baptiſmall Profeſſion, as the Bishop would perſuade us.
Hence,</p>
                  <p>His firſt falſification is that hee would have the words
<hi>alteram fidem</hi> (which, taken by themſelves, and, moſt
evidently, as ſpoken in this occaſion, ſignify a <hi>different</hi>
or <hi>contrary</hi> faith) to mean a <hi>prohibition to exact any more
of a Chriſtian at his Baptiſmall profeſſion:</hi> So, by the
words, <hi>any more,</hi> which hee falſly impoſes to ſerve his
purpoſe; making the Council ſtrike directly at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largment
of ſuch Profeſſion. Very good!</p>
                  <p>His 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> is, that, to play Pope <hi>Pius</hi> a trick, hee aſſures
us, the Council <hi>forbids to exact any more of a Chriſtian at
his Baptiſmall Profeſſion;</hi> whereas, there is no news the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of <hi>exacting,</hi> (but, of <hi>producing, writing,</hi> or <hi>compoſing</hi>
falſe creeds) leſſe of <hi>Baptiſmall profeſſion.</hi> And, though
the Council forbide this to bee done, <hi>his qui volunt ad
cog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itionem veritatis conuerti, to thoſe who are willing to

                        </gap>ee converted to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> yet, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
following, extended alſo to Laymen, in thoſe
words, <hi>ſi vero Laici fuerint, anathematiz entur, if they</hi>
(the propoſers of another faith) <hi>bee Laym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

bee excommunicated,</hi> makes it impoſſible to relate to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm;</hi>
unles the Bishop will ſay that, in thoſe dayes,
Laymen were Miniſters of Baptiſm, or <hi>exacted,</hi> (as hee
phraſes it) <hi>Baptiſmall Profeſſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His third falſification is, that hee pretends the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
forbad <hi>to exact more than the Apoſtles creed:</hi> whereas,
the Council onely forbids <hi>creeds different from that</hi> which
was defin'd by the <hi>Council of Nice.</hi> So that, according to
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:115675:257"/>
the Bishop, the creed defined by the fathers in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles creed,</hi> are one and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
creed.</p>
                  <p>His fourth is, that hee pretends from the bare word
[<hi>fidem] a Baptiſmal profeſſion,</hi> for no other word is
found in the Council to that purpoſe. Now, the truth
is, that, upon occaſion of thoſe creeds containing falſe
doctrine, the Council onely prohibits the producing or
teaching any thing contrary to the doctrine anciently
eſtablish't; as appears more plainly from that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
concerning <hi>Cariſius, Pari modo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
if any either Bishops, Prieſts or Laymen bee taken,
(ſentientes aut docentes,) holding or teaching Cariſius his
doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. let them bee thus or thus punisht. Where
you ſee nothing in order to <hi>exacting Baptiſmall profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi>
or their enlargments, as the Bp. fancies; but of
abſtaining to teach falſe doctrines which thoſe Hereticks
had propoſed.</p>
                  <p>Ere wee leave this point, to do my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> D. right, let us
conſtrue the words of the Council according to the ſence
hee hath given it, and it ſtands thus; that the holy ſynod
decreed it unlawfull for any [<hi>proferre, ſcribere; aut com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere]
to exact, [alteram] any more, or a larger, [fidem]
Baptiſmall profeſſion, [praeter eam quae a ſanctis Patribus
apud Nicaeam Vrbem definita fuit] than the Apoſtles creed.</hi>
Well, go thy wayes brave Bp. if the next ſynod of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
doe not Canonize thee for an Interpreter of
Councils, they are falſe to their beſt intereſts: The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
cannot but ſtand, if manag'd by ſuch ſincerity, wit,
and learning; as long as women prejudic'd men and fools,
who examin nothing, are the greater part of Readers.</p>
                  <p>Having gain'd ſuch credit for his ſincerity, hee preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
now hee may bee truſted upon his bare word: and
then, without any either reaſon or Authority alledged,
or ſo much as pretended, but on his bare word onely,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:115675:258"/>
hee aſſures the Reader, if hee will beleeve him, that they
ſtill <hi>profeſſe the diſcipline of the ancient Church,</hi> and that
wee have <hi>changed it into a ſoveraignty of power above Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councells,</hi> &amp;c. Yet, the candid man, in his vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
durſt not affirm that this pretended power was of
faith with us, or held by all; but onely, p. 232. alledges,
firſt, that <hi>it is maintaind by many;</hi> that is, that it is an
opinion onely, and then 'tis not his proper task to diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
againſt it, our own Schools and Doctours can do that
faſt enough and afterwards p. 243. hee tells us, that <hi>theſe
who give ſuch exorbitant priviledges to Pope's do it with ſo
many cautions and reſervations, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y ſignify nothing.</hi> So
that the Bishop, grants that ſome onely and not all, add
this to the Pope's Authority; and that this which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>ſignifies nothing:</hi> and yet rails at it here in high terms,
as if it were a great matter deſerving Church-unity should
bee broken for it, and claps it upon the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>After this hee grants <hi>S. Peter</hi> to have been <hi>Prince of
the Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>firſt mover in the Church, in a right ſence,</hi>
as hee ſtyles it: yet tells us, for prevention ſake, that all
<hi>this extends but to a Primacy of order.</hi> Whereas all the
world, till my Ld D. came with his <hi>right ſence</hi> to correct
it, imagin'd, that <hi>to move</hi> did in a <hi>ſence right</hi> enough, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
<hi>to act;</hi> and ſo, <hi>the firſt mover</hi> meant the <hi>firſt Acter.</hi> Wee
thought likewiſe that, when God was call'd <hi>primum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
the firſt mover,</hi> thoſe words did, in a very <hi>right ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi>
import <hi>actiuity</hi> and influence; not a primacy of <hi>order</hi>
onely, as the acute Bp. aſſures us: But his meaning is
this, that though all the world hold that to <hi>move firſt,</hi> is
to <hi>act firſt;</hi> yet that ſence of theirs shall bee abſolutely
wrong, and this onely <hi>right,</hi> which he and his fellows are
pleaſed to fancie: who are ſo wonderfully acute, that,
according to them, hee that hath onely Authority to ſit
firſt in Council, or ſome things, (which is all they will
allow <hi>S. Peter</hi> and the Pope) shall, <hi>in a right ſence,</hi> bee
ſaid to <hi>move firſt</hi> or to bee <hi>firſt mover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="497" facs="tcp:115675:258"/>
I alledged, as a thing <hi>unqueſtionable even by underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that the Church of England actually agreed
with the Church of Rome at the time of the ſeparation, in

                  <p>It follows in my words put down by him, p. 6. that
<hi>the Bishops of Rome actually exerciſed this power</hi> (viz: of
<hi>firſt mover</hi> in the Church; S. Peter's priviledge) <hi>in all
thoſe countries which kept Communion with the Church of
Rome, that very year wherein this unhappy ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
Mee thanks, it is not poſſible to avoid being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
here. But, nothing is impoſſible to the Bp. hee
either will not ſpeak out at all, or, if hee does, it muſt
bee of no lower a ſtrain than flat contradiction Hee tells
us, firſt, that <hi>it cometh much short of the truth in one reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect:</hi>
                     <pb n="498" facs="tcp:115675:259"/>
and why? <hi>for the Pope</hi>'s (ſaith hee) <hi>exerciſed much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
power in thoſe countries which gave them leave, than ever
S. Peter pretended to.</hi> So that according to the Bp. hee
did not exerciſe <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s <hi>leſſer</hi> power, becauſe hee exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
a power far <hi>greater,</hi> that is hee did not exerciſe <hi>S.
Peter</hi>'s power, becauſe hee exerciſed <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s power,
and much more; which is as much as to ſay, <hi>Totum eſt
minus parte,</hi> and <hi>more</hi> does not contain <hi>leſſe</hi> A hopefull
diſputant, who chuſes rather to run upon ſuch rocks,
then to grant that the Pope actually govern'd as ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
in thoſe countries which were actually under him A
point which it is shamefull to deny, dangerous poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to confeſſ; and therefore neceſſary to bee thus blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee tells us, <hi>that it is much more short of that
univerſall Monarchy, which the Pope did then and doth
ſtill claim.</hi> And why? <hi>for</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>as I have already
ſaid</hi> (obſerve the ſtrength of his diſcourſe, his ſaying is
proving) <hi>two third parts of the Chriſtian world were not at
that time of his Communion;</hi> meaning the <hi>Greeks,</hi> Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
&amp;c. Are moderate expreſſions of shameleſnes
ſufficient to character this man, who in every line mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
himſelf in the higheſt degree deſerving them? Our
poſition as put down even by himſelf was this, that the
Pope's did actually, then exerciſe this power in thoſe
countries which <hi>kept Communion</hi> with the Church of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me;</hi>
and the Bps anſwer comes to this, that hee did not
exerciſe it in thoſe countries which <hi>kept not</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, to give the Reader a ſatisfactory anſwer even to
the Bps impertinences, I shall let him ſee that the Pope
exercis'd his power at that time even over thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
as much as it can bee expected any Governour
can or should do over revolters, whom hee cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
reduce. As, then, a Governour exerciſes his power

over obedient ſubjets, by cherising them and ordering
them and their affairs ſoe as may beſt conduce to their

the liberties and cuſtomes of whole nations,</hi> to <hi>depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
Princes of their Realms and abſolve their ſubjects from
their Allegiance,</hi> &amp;c. Was ever ſuch ſtuff brought by a
Controvertiſt? or was ever man ſoe frontles as to make
theſe the true ſtate of the queſtion between us; that is,
to prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that our Church holds theſe things as of faith?</p>
                  <p>To manifeſt more the shallownes of my Adverſary;
the Reader may pleaſe to take notice of the difference
between the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Pope's Authority, as held
by us, and the <hi>extent</hi> of it The <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it conſiſts in
this, that hee is <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> that is, firſt mover
in it, and that hee hath Authority to <hi>act</hi> in it after the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a <hi>firſt Governour.</hi> This is held with us to bee of
faith, and acknowledg'd unanimouſly by all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as come from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles; ſo that none
can bee of our Communion who deny it: nor is this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
at all between Catholike &amp; Catholike, but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween
Catholike and Heretike onely. Hence, this is held
by our Church as a <hi>Church;</hi> that is, as a multitude recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it upon their Rule of faith, <hi>univerſall Atteſtation of
immediate Anceſtours, as from theirs, and ſo upwards as
from Chriſt;</hi> and not upon criticall debates or diſputes of
learnedmen. The, <hi>extent</hi> of this Authority conſiſts in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
whether this power of thus acting reaches to
theſe and theſe particularities or no; the reſolution of
which is founded in the deductions of divines, Canon-Lawyers
and ſuch like learnedmen: and, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſome of thoſe points bee held as a common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the ſchoolmen, and (as ſuch) embraced by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Catholikes; yet, not by them as <hi>faithfull,</hi> that is,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:115675:261"/>
as relying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pon their Anceſtours, as from theirs, as from
<hi>Chriſt;</hi> but, as relying upon the learnedmen in Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law;
and; implicitely, upon the reaſons which they had
to judge ſo and the generality's accepting their reaſons
for valid: which is as much as to ſay, ſuch points are not
held by a Church as a <hi>Church,</hi> no more than it is that
there is an Element of fire <hi>in Concavo Lunae,</hi> or that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus</hi>
found out the Indies. The points, therefore, are
ſuch, that hee who holds or deems otherwiſe may ſtill
bee held one of the <hi>Church</hi> or of the Commonwealth of
the <hi>faithfull:</hi> nor bee blameable for holding otherwiſe, if
hee have better reaſons for his <hi>tenet</hi> than thoſe other lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
men had for theirs, as long as hee behaves himſelf
quietly in the ſaid Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps a parallel will clear the matter better. The
acknowledgment of the former Kings of <hi>England</hi> to bee
ſupreme Governours in their Dominions was heretofore
(as wee may ſay) a point of civill faith, nor could any
bee reputed a good ſubject who deny'd this; in the undif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
acknowledgment of which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſted the <hi>ſubſtance</hi>
of their Authority: But, whether they had power to rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
ship money, impoſe ſubſidies, &amp;c. alone and without
a Parliament, belong'd to the <hi>extent</hi> of their Authority,
was ſubject to diſpute, and the proper task of Lawyers;
nor conſequently did it make a man an Outlaw, or (as
wee may ſay) a civill Schiſmatick to diſacknowledge ſuch
<hi>extents</hi> of his Authority, ſo hee admitted the Authority
it ſelf: I concieve the parallell is ſoe plain, that it will
make it's owne application.</p>
                  <p>This being ſettled, as I hope it is; ſo let it ſtand a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
till wee make another conſideration.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Controverſy</hi> (in the ſence which our circumſtances
determine it) is a diſpute about <hi>faith;</hi> and ſo a <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſt,</hi>

bee held of faith according to it's <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and not held
of faith according to it's <hi>extent;</hi> hee ought to impugn it
according to the <hi>ſubstance</hi> of the ſaid Government, and

but, falſly ſuppoſing himſelf as it were one of that
company, and to hold all the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it's Authority,
hee ſides with one part of the true ſubjects and diſputes
againſt the other, in a point indifferent to faith, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his duty.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, Reader, obſerve with attention; and
then bee thine own judge, whether hee play not the
Mountebank with thee inſtead of the Controvertiſt,
who, in his former book, pretended to vindicate the
Church of <hi>England</hi> (which renounced the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of
this Authority) by impugning the <hi>extent</hi> of it onely:
and here, undertaking to correct his Refuter and ſtate
the queſtion rightly, firſt grants, in very plain but wrong
mean't terms, the whole queſtion, to wit that the Pope
hath <hi>Authority over the whole Church as ſucceſſour of S.
Peter;</hi> and then tells thee, that the true queſtion is about
the <hi>extent</hi> of it and <hi>what are the right limits and bounds of
this Authority,</hi> which kind of queſtions yet hee knows
well enough are debated by the obedient and true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that Commonwealth whence hee is Outlaw'd and
which hee pretends to impugn.</p>
                  <p>His 8th page preſents the Reader with a great miſtake

and ſtill <hi>do</hi> produce places of Scripture to prove that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Principle, to wit that Tradition is the Rule of faith,
as alſo to prove <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s higher power over the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les:
nor is it new that the ſucceſſion of Paſtours, <hi>till wee
all meet in the Vnity of Glory,</hi> should bee <hi>Chriſt's own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi>
and recorded there likewiſe: Nor can I deviſe
upon what Grounds hee and his fellow-Bishops of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,

maintain their Authority to bee <hi>iure divino,</hi> unles they

                  <p>But the pretended miſtake lies here, that whereas I ſaid

which totally concern'd a dangerous and fundamentall
point, as shall preſently bee ſeen; and ſo, it importing
him to neglect it, hee cull'd out and miſtakingly glanc't

till hee urge it farther; eſpecially being ſoe rawly put

                     </hi> without manifeſting what

priviledges;</hi> ſo, for any thing hee knows, it might ſtill
remain Superiour in Iuriſdiction; and, till hee evince
that priviledges in that place mean't <hi>Iuriſdiction,</hi> to which
the word will bee very loath, hee is far from bringing it

                  <p>
                     <hi>His next task is a very ſubſtantiall and important one,
ſtriking at the Rule and Root of all our faith: yet, by

quickly makes clear work with it. Hee was told, that</hi> wee

delivery, for thoſe points in which they differ
from her, but receded from that Rule; as the <hi>Apology
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:115675:263"/>
for Tradition</hi> hath manifeſted, indeed plain reaſon may
inform us: It being impoſſible and ſelf condemning,
where there was an Vnity before, for the beginners of a
Novelty to pretend their immediate fathers had taught
them that which the whole world ſees they did not. Now,
the Bp. talkes of <hi>Traditions of ſome particular perſons, or
ſome particular Churches:</hi> deſirous to make his Readers
believe wee rely on ſuch a Tradition and ſo defective as
hee expreſſes; that is, hee makes account our pretended
Tradition muſt not bee ſtyl'd univerſall, unles it take in
thoſe perſons and thoſe Churche alſo who have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
renounced and receded from this Rule of Tradition.
Which is as much as if hee had ſaid, a thing cannot bee
abſolutely white, unles it bee black too.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee ſpeake <hi>of believing,</hi> that is, of points
of <hi>faith:</hi> but, the Bp. talkes of <hi>opinions,</hi> and thoſe not
concerning ones neither, but (as hee ſtyles them) <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of an inferiour nature.</hi> And then, having, by this
ſleight, changed <hi>faith</hi> into <hi>opinion,</hi> hee runs giddily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
telling us fine things concerning <hi>queſtionable</hi> and
<hi>controverted</hi> points, of <hi>Opinions in the Schools,</hi> and how
hard a thing it is <hi>to know which opinion is moſt current,</hi> &amp;c.
Is not this ſincerely done and ſtrongly to the purpoſe?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee cants in theſe words [<hi>So neceſſary to bee
known.</hi>] I ask, are they <hi>neceſſary</hi> or no? If they bee not
<hi>neceſſary,</hi> why does hee ſeem to grant they are, by ſaying
onely that they are not <hi>ſo neceſſary?</hi> But, if they bee <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi>
then why does hee call them <hi>opinions</hi> onely, and
that too <hi>of an inferiour nature?</hi> Can that bee neceſſary to
bee held or known, which hath no neceſſary Grounds
to make it either held or known? Opinions have neither.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hee ſpeaks of points <hi>not ſo publike<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fifthly, hee ſpeaks of points <hi>not univerſally profeſſed:</hi>
that is, if any heretick, receding from immediate Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his fathers, shall ſtart a novelty, &amp; propagate
it to poſterity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Tradition and profeſſion of this point

and ſay, it was not univerſally profeſſed that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was

The like ſervice it would do an <hi>Arian</hi> or any other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,
to alledge (as the Bp. does) that the <hi>Chriſtian

for, as long as that Heretick has a mind to call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

ſo long hee may cheaply cavill againſt the Authority of

                  <p>The matter of fact being declared, that actually now
they of the Church of England had renounced both the
ſaid Principles; it was urged next, that, his onely way
to clear his Church from Schiſm is, either by diſproving
the former to bee the neceſſary Rule of Vnity in faith,
or the latter the neceſſary bond of Government? for, if
they: bee ſuch Principles of Vnity, it follows inevitably
that they, having broke them both, (as the matter of
fact evinces) are perfect Schiſmaticks; ſince a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

Hee clears it, by telling us wee are <hi>doubly miſtaken,</hi>

doth alone call him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But, why is hee, in theſe his endeavours to vindicate
his Church from Schiſm, ſo backwards to clear this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
point? Why? firſt, <hi>becauſe they are the perſons
accuſed:</hi> By which method, no Rebell ought to give any
reaſon why hee did ſo; <hi>becauſe hee is accuſed</hi> of Rebellion
by his lawfull Governour. Very learnedly. Now, the
truth is whereſoever there is a conteſt, each ſide <hi>accuſes
the other,</hi> and each ſide again <hi>defends</hi> it ſelf againſt the
the others accuſations: but, that party is properly call'd

that you could not with any face have pretended your
Reform, but you muſt firſt <hi>accuſe</hi> your former actuall
Governour of vſurpation, your former Rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of faith of

then wee never accuſed you of breaking from our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment
till you had broke from it; and, you could not
have broke from it, without firſt accuſing the ſay'd Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and objecting ſome reaſon againſt it, as the
motive of your breaking: You muſt therefore oppoſe,
and alledge thoſe reaſons, and show them ſufficient ones;
elſe, your very fact of renouncing that former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Next, hee tells us, that <hi>if the proof did reſt on their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,

ſwear in the Bps behalf that hee never ſpoke truer word

that communicated in it; and, therefore, that you
now reiecting it muſt either shew it to bee no neceſſary
bond of Vnity, or neceſſarily remain convinced of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
Vnity, that, of Schiſm. Mee thinks a man who
pretends to anſwer should either ſay I, or <hi>No;</hi> they are
uſvally the returns wee make to queſtions But <hi>S Auſtin's</hi>
ſaying is Oracle; no ſpeaking out, hee thanks you.
Hee knew well enough that either part of the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:115675:266"/>
which, by deſtroying all doubt in the caſe, would
have deſtroy'd his own and the Authority of all thoſe
who ſpeak againſt Evidence. Altum ſilentium is all you
can get from him; onely, in the hard ſtreight hee is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to of either ſaying nothing or nothing to the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,
hee tels you hee is not obliged to anſwer, becauſe hee
has not alter'd the diſcipline left by Chriſt to his Church
of England in K. H. the 8th's dayes, of which my obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
runs, 'tis falſe even to ridiculouſnes; for, I cannot
imagin hee fancies his Authority can ſo much over ſway
the ſimplicity of any Reader his book will meet with, as
to hope to make him beleeve the Church of England in
his Lops time had the ſame diſcipline she had in K. H's
dayes. If hee mean of the diſcipline left by Chriſt to the
Primtive times, 'tis no leſſ falſe and more impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

thence grounded a progreſſ to a <hi>deciſive</hi> diſcourſe, in
skipping aſide to a point mainly diſputable between us,
in ſtead of anſwering to that Evidence, and, which is ſtill
weaker, by thinking to carry that whole matter by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
ſaying it. And, if the Reader pleaſe now to review the
Bishops <hi>firſt Section</hi> with a narrower eye, I am confident
hee will percieve that (beſides that hee hath not ſaid a
word in anſwer to us) above three quarters of the ſaid Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is made up of this ſtuff: to wit, of reuolving and
repeating over his own tenets and the very queſtion, and
talking any thing upon his own Authority without a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
of proof; and, twice or thrice, where hee pretends
any, they are mere falſifications &amp; abuſes; as hath been
shown.</p>
                  <p>I muſt requeſt the Reader, whom the love of truth
may invite to ſeek ſatisfaction in peruſing a book of this
nature, to right himſelf the Bp. and mee, by giving a
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:115675:267"/>
glance back upon my words, p. 306. 307. where I affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that <hi>it would appear that Schiſm was iuſtly charged
upon his Church with undeniable Evidence of faith, by two
things,</hi> viz: out of the <hi>very poſition, of the caſe, and out of
the nature of his Exceptions.</hi> How hee hath reply'd to the
firſt, which is the poſition of the caſe, hath already been
shown: to wit, that hee would not ſpeak one poſitive
word, <hi>I</hi> or <hi>no</hi> to a plain matter of faith; nor bee willing
to ſtep forwards one ſtep by anſwering directly to any
thing which neerly concern'd the queſtion; but ſtood
continually capering and flickhering up and down in the
air, at the pleaſure of his own fancy. As for the ſecond
thing, to wit, that <hi>it would appear out of the nature of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
Exceptions;</hi> I show'd that hee, in reciting my charge, had
purpoſely omitted that as loath his Exceptions should
bee brought to the teſt of Reaſon, or have their ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
examin'd. And, to let thee ſee that hee did this
purpoſely, looke <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd</hi> p. 309. and thou shalt
ſee the whole paragraph, which concern'd that ſecond
point, omitted, without any <hi>Reply</hi> pretended. I shall
therefore repeat it again here, and leave it to the Bishop's
ſecond thoughts. <hi>They muſt remember how their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who began that which they call Reformation, were
themſelves of this profeſſion before their pretended Reform.
They ought to weigh what reaſons their Anceſtours should
have had to introduce ſuch an alteration. They muſt confeſſ
themſelves guilty in continuing the breach, unles they can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
cauſes ſufficient to have begun it, had the ſame ancient
Religion deſcended to theſe dayes. For, the conſtant beleef of
the Catholike world was, at the time of our diviſion, and
ſtill is, that theſe Principles are Chriſt's own ordination, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in Scripture, derived to us by the ſtrongeſt Evidences
that our nature is capable of to attain aſſurance what was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
in Antiquity: Evidences inviolable by any humane ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
poweror proof, except perfect and rigorous demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:115675:267"/>
to which our Adverſaries doe not ſo much as pretend;
and, therefore, without farther diſpute, remain unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
convicted of Schiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe I need not inform the Reader, what ſervice
it would have done to the Controverſy, and how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
it was for my Ld D. to tell us, whether his reaſons
were <hi>rigourouſly evidencing</hi> or <hi>demonſtrative;</hi> or elſe, that
leſſ than demonſtrative reaſons, that is, <hi>probable</hi> ones
would ſerve: This would quickly have decided the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
For, nothing is eaſier than to show, that a wrongly
pretended <hi>demonſtration</hi> does not conclude evidently or
convince that the thing is; nothing eaſier, than to show,
out of the very terms, that a <hi>probability</hi> cannot rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convince the underſtanding: But, the danger of this
diſadvantage and the fear of this quick deciſion is the
reaſon his Ld. will tell us neither.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Proteſtant Reader, thou ſeeſt how dextrouſly
thy Bp. hath behaved himſelf in anſwering both parts of
our charge againſt him; and which alone fundamental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern our queſtion: to wit, how hee hath, by shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
about, avoided to ſay a poſitive word to one; and
totally omitted ſo much as to mention the other. And
this, in the Bishops <hi>right ſence,</hi> is call'd <hi>vindicating</hi> the

as they cannot challenge any at all, ſo I ought not
to wrong my ſelf in giving them too large an Anſwer;

is more important.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place hee maintains, that, <hi>it many wayes

this plea; which equally acquits any Villain in the world,
who inſiſts in the ſteps of his forefather Villains. For, may
not hee argue againſt honeſt men by the ſame Logick,
and ſay, that they are acquitted; becauſe, not <hi>Villains,</hi>
but they who were <hi>honeſt</hi> men formerly, begun firſt the
Villany: It being equally infallible and neceſſary, that

did thoſe, who were friends in all other reſpects, <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily</hi>
oppoſe us in this, and out of a free and unbiaſſed
choice; as the Bp. muſt pretend, elſe hee does nothing.
Let us examin this then. Your own good friend, Dr. H.
shall give you ſatisfaction in that point (<hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 136)
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:115675:268"/>
where, ſpeaking of this Act of the Clergy in renouncing
the Authority of the Roman ſee, (the palpable truth
obliging him) hee hath theſe words, <hi>It is eaſy to beleeve,
that nothing but the apprehenſion of dangers, which hung
overthem by a premunire incurred by them, could probably
have inclined them to it.</hi> Thus hee. The, <hi>violent preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi>
then <hi>of our guilt,</hi> which you imagin concluded hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
is turn'd into a <hi>iuſt preſumption,</hi> or rather a confeſt
Evidence, of the King's <hi>violent cruelty</hi> and their fearfull
weaknes. Rare Grounds doubtles, to acquit you for being
led by their Authority, or following their example.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee tells us that, <hi>though it do not alwaies
excuſe a toto, from all guilt, yet it excuſes a tanto, and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens
the guilt; to bee misled by the examples and Authority
of others,</hi> &amp;c. Let us examin this, as apply'd to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.
How could they think <hi>their</hi> example to bee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
or <hi>their</hi> Authority to bee rely'd on, whom they
confeſſ to have done what they did out of <hi>fear,</hi> that is,
out of <hi>paſſion,</hi> and not out of the pure verdict of <hi>reaſon</hi>
&amp; conſcience? Again, if their example were to bee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
why do not they follow it rather in repenting of
their Schiſm, and renouncing it; as thoſe Bps did after
the King's death? ſince, the imminent fear, which aw'd
them at the time of their fall and during the King's life,
ioyn'd with their retraction after his death, of what they
had done, render it a thouſand times more manifeſt that
their conſcience took part with the obedient ſide, had
they had courage enough to ſtand to it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſometimes, the firſt beginners of a fault
may bee leſſ culpable then their followers; according to
the degrees of the provocations which preſſ upon their
weakneſſes. Theirs wee have ſeen to bee no leſſ than the
expectation of death and deſtruction; ſuch was the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the King's in humane cruelty, and their preſent
diſadvantageous caſe which expos'd them to it. Your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee aſſures us, that, in this caſe, <hi>it doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
them not onely a tanto, but, a toto, from the leaſt degree
of guilt; as long as they carefully ſeek after truth, and do
not violate the dictates of their own</hi> conſcience: and then
bids mee, <hi>if I will not beleeve him, beleeve S. Auſtin;
who ſayes, that they who defend not their falſe opinions with
pertinacity, but are ready to embrace truth and correct their
errours when they finde them, are not Hereticks.</hi> I Anſwer,
<hi>S. Auſtin</hi> ſayes well; onely obſtinacy makes an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick:
and ſo far wee beleive him. But, does <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> ſay
that Bp. <hi>Bramhall</hi> ad his fellows are not <hi>obſtinate,</hi> or that
they neglect not to ſeek, not refuſe not to embrace truth
found; and, by conſequence, are not <hi>Hereticks</hi> and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks?
The generall words of the father ſignify nothing
to your purpoſe; unles they bee apply'd to your party:
and who makes the application? The Bp. himſelf: and
upon what Grounds? upon his own bare word; and then
cries, <hi>They are totally acquited from Schiſm:</hi> That is, hee
makes an acquittance himſelf for himſelf; writes it with
his own hand, ſet his own ſeal to it, and ſubſcribes it
with his own name; and then brings it into the Court to
clear himſelf of the whole debt, and that by his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                  <p>Reader, truſt neither ſide as they barely teſtify of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
but, truſt what Evident reaſon and thine own
eyes tell thee. Reaſon tells thee, 'tis evident they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't
thoſe tenets which were the Principles of Vnity
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:115675:269"/>
to the former Church both in faith and Government:
Reaſon tells thee, that ſuch a fact is, in it's own nature,
ſchiſmaticall; unles they can produce ſufficient motives
to iuſtify it: Reaſon tells thee, that noe motives leſſ
than certain, that is, demonſtrative ones, can ſuffice to
alledge for ſuch a revolt; which yet they never pretend
to: Therefore, reaſon tells thee and any one who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
morality and nature, as evidently as that two and
three are five, that their revolt did not ſpring from the
pure light of reaſon; but, from an <hi>irrationall</hi> Principle,
that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from paſſion and vice: And, ſo, wee cannot but
judge them obſtinate and, conſequently, Schiſmaticks;
unles they can show us theſe <hi>ſufficient,</hi> that is, <hi>demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
reaſons to excuſe their, otherwiſe manifeſtly ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
fact: or, if wee do, wee muſt renounce the light
of our own reaſon to do them an undeſerved favour.</p>
                  <p>Thus much in generall. Now, as for this Bp. in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
Thou haſt ſeen him shuffle up and down when hee
should have anſwer'd to the charge objected: Thou haſt
ſeen him wilfully miſtake all over, to evade anſwering:
Thou haſt ſeen him totally omit ſo much as to mention
one half of the charge, and totally to <hi>avoid</hi> the whole
<hi>import,</hi> nay, every tittle of the other. There needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but thine own eyes, directed by any firſt <hi>Section,</hi>
to make all this evident to thee. 'Tis by theſe evident
teſtimonies of thine eyes, theſe undeniable verdicts of
thy reaſon, Reader, by which thou muſt judge of theſe
men, whether they bee carefully inquiſitive after &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
embrace the truth, or rather bee obſtinate Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
and not by the dark holes of their conſciences;
which they aſſert to bee ſincere by their bare ſayings oue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
obtrude them, thus weakly authoriz'd upon they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
credulity, and then tell thee thou muſt beleeve <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
that they are guiltles and acquitted from Schiſm.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, I glanced at the inconſequence of
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:115675:270"/>
his proof, that <hi>thoſe Bishops were not Proteſtants becauſe
they perſecuted Proteſtants;</hi> inſtancing in ſome ſects of
Proteſtants, which perſecuted others. Hee replies: <hi>what
then were Watham and Heath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all</hi> Proteſtants? Then,
My Ld (which is onely the queſtion between us) your
argument was naught: for, let them bee accidentally what
they will, you cannot conclude them <hi>no Proteſtants</hi> from
the perſecuting Proteſtants; as long as 'tis shown and
known, that thoſe who were Proteſtants did the ſame.
Secondly, if they were Proteſtants, hee demands, <hi>of
which ſect they were?</hi> I anſwer, that, as, between every
<hi>ſpecies of</hi> colour which wee have names for, there are
hundreds of middle degrees which have no names; or,
as, in a perpetuall motion, there are millions of unnam'd
proportions ſow'd all along in it's progreſſ, to whoſe
quantities wee can give no particular names: ſo, within
the latitude of the name <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Reformer</hi> and every
ſect of it, there are thouſands of others ſoe petite and
minute, that they have not deſerved a name from the
world. I ſee the Bp. miſtakes us and his own ſect; for hee
makes account the Proteſtant Profeſſion and it's ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
ſects are fixt things, which may bee defined: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas
Experience teaches us, that the fellow in the fable
might as eaſily have taken meaſure of the Moon, to fit
her right with a coat, as one can imagin one notion to
fit the word <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> 'Tis ever in motion, like the row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſea, and therefore hath ſuch an <hi>alloy</hi> of <hi>no ens</hi> in it,
that it admits noe poſitive definition; but, muſt bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
like a privation in order to the former <hi>habit. No-Papiſt</hi>
and <hi>a Reformer</hi> is the beſt character I can make of
it. Since, then, thoſe Bishops were Reformers and no-Papiſts,
(for they renounced the Pope's Authority which
gives this denomination, &amp; reformed in that point:) it
follows, that they were Proteſtants, though the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
thing was not as yet chriſtend with any other name
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:115675:270"/>
than that common one of <hi>Reformation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> But, my Ld. D.
makes account that none can bee a Proteſtant, unles hee
hold all which the now-Proteſtants doe: Whereas, 'tis
againſt nature and reaſon, to expect that the Proteſtants
could at firſt fall into all their preſent negative <hi>tenets; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
repentè fit turpiſſimus.</hi> The former faults muſt by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
get countenance, by growing vulgar &amp; quotidian,
an by little &amp; little digeſt their shamefulnes; ere the world
could bee prepared to receive or men's minds apt and
audacious enough to broach new ones. Firſt, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't
one point, then another, and ſo forwards, till
at lenghth they have arrived to <hi>Quakeriſm;</hi> which the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
is the full-grown fruit of the Reformation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas I told him, thoſe Bishops, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the Pope, <hi>held the moſt eſſentiall point of their
Reformation, and ſo had in them the quinteſſence of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant:</hi>
The Bp. firſt, calls this, <hi>our Reformation;</hi> as if
wee had not ever held them Schiſmaticks, that is, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from our Church, for doing ſo. Since, then, they
went out from us, by that fact; they left to bee <hi>of us:</hi>
and, if they were not <hi>of us,</hi> how was it <hi>our Reformation,</hi>
in any other ſence, than as the Rebellion of thoſe who
were true ſubjects before is to bee imputed to thoſe who
remain true ſubjects ſtill? was ever common ſence ſo
abus'd? Next, hee braggs, that, <hi>then</hi> (to wit, if renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Pope bee eſſentiall to a Proteſtant) <hi>the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church were all Proteſtants;</hi> which is onely ſayd, and
flatly falſe: that <hi>then, all the Greci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n, Ruſſian, Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,
Abyſſen Chriſtians are Proteſtants at this day;</hi> which
is <hi>onely ſaid,</hi> again, and partly true, partly falſe, and that
which is true onely ſteads him ſoe far, as to evince that
the Proteſtants are not the onely men but have fellow-Schiſmaticks:
And laſtly, that <hi>then, they want not ſtore
of Proteſtants even in the boſome</hi> of the Roman Church
it ſelf; which (to ſpeak moderately) is an impudent
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:115675:271"/>
falshood, and a plain impoſſibility. For, who ere renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the ſubſtance of the Pope's Authority and his being
Head of the Church, doth, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> renounce the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
of Vnity of Government in our Church, and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
the Rule of Vnity of faith, which Grounds
and aſſerts the former; that is, ſuch a man renounces
and breaks from all the Vnity of our Church, and, ſo,
becomes totally diſunited from our Church: Now, how
one, who is totally <hi>diſunited</hi> and ſeparated from the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
body of our Church, can bee intimately <hi>united</hi> to her
ſtill, no underſtanding but the BP<hi rend="sup">s</hi> can reach; which, as
<hi>Mithridates</hi> could uſe poiſon for his daily food, can,
without difficulty, digeſt contradictions, and findes them
more connatural and nutritive to his cauſe than the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
demonſtrations.</p>
                  <p>Now, if my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> D. bee not yet ſatisfy'd with my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
p. 311. that the renouncing the Pope is <hi>eſſentiall to
Proteſtantiſm;</hi> to which yet hee is pleaſed to give no anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer:
I ſend him to learn it of his friend, Dr. H. who (<hi>of
Schiſm</hi> p. 145. <hi>l.</hi> 5.) ſeems even to ſtrain ſence it felf to
expreſſ this; calling this diſclaiming the Pope's power <hi>tbe
Bottome upon which the foundation of Reformation was
laid,</hi> that is, the foundation of their foundation, their
fundamentall of fundamentalls. Now then, how thoſe
Bishops should not bee then <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who held the
fundamentall of fundamentalls of <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> paſſes
my skill to explicate, and, as I am perſuaded, my L<hi rend="sup">ds</hi>,

ſworn Enemies of all three; in caſe his circumſtances have
put him upon the task to lay ſuch perſons open and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
them. Hee appeals to any indifferent Chriſtian jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.
I decline not the Tribunal; nay more, I shall bee
willing to ſtand to the award of the moſt partiall Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
living, who hath but ſo much ſincerity as to ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge

                  <p>Firſt, hee goes about to acquit himſelf, by confeſſing
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:115675:272"/>
that hee ſayd <hi>no new law was made then;</hi> but denying that
hee ſaid <hi>no new</hi> ſtatute was made. Wee will not wrangle
with him about the words; onely, I ſay, if there were
ſomething <hi>new,</hi> it was <hi>new;</hi> and, a <hi>ſtatute,</hi> made and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the King and his Parliament, (as this was,)
wee Englishmen uſe to term a <hi>law:</hi> if then there were <hi>a
new statute</hi> made (as hee confeſſes,) I concieve I have
not wrong'd in the leaſt the common language of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
to call it <hi>a new law.</hi> But, his meaning is, that
King H. the 8th <hi>did noe new thing</hi> when hee renounced
the Pope's Authority, but what had been done former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and therefore.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee quotes <hi>Fitz-herbert</hi> and my <hi>Lord
Cook,</hi> who ſay, that <hi>this statute was not operative to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
a new law, but declarative to reſtore an ancient law:</hi> That
is, hee quotes two of his own party to prove hee ſayd
right; and two Proteſtants to ſpeak in behalf of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.
Convincing proofs, doubtles againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee promiſes to make it <hi>appear undeniably.</hi>
Whence, or from what Authority? from the <hi>very ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
it ſelf;</hi> which ſayes, <hi>That England is an Empire, and
that the King as Head of the body politick, conſiſting of the
Spirituality and temporality, hath plenary power to render fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
iuſtice for all matters.</hi> That is, hee quotes the ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
King himſelf and his ſchiſmaticall Parliament,
(who made this ſtatute,) to ſpeak in their own behalfs.
Does ſuch a trifler deſerve a Reply? who, in a diſpute
againſt us, cites the authorities of thoſe very perſons
againſt whom wee diſpute; nay, that very Act of theirs
which wee are challenging to have been ſchiſmaticall:
and relies upon them for <hi>undeniable</hi> Teſtimonies.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hee alledges another ſtatute, made in the
24. of King H. the 8th: the beſt hee could pick out,
you may bee ſure; yet, there is not a ſyllable in it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>ſpirituall Iuriſdiction;</hi> directly, that is, not a
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:115675:272"/>
ſyllable to his purpoſe. 'Tis this, <hi>The Crown of England
hath been ſo free at all times, that it hath been in no earthly
ſubjection; but immediately ſubjected to God in all things
touching it's Regality, and to no other; and ought not to bee
ſubmitted to the Pope.</hi> Wee are diſputing about <hi>ſpirituall</hi>
Iuriſdiction, and whether it were due to the Pope: and,
the Bp. brings a ſtatute which fpeaks of the <hi>Crown of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
it ſelf, as not to bee ſubmitted to the Pope, as
touching it's <hi>Regality;</hi> that is, a ſtatute which expreſly
ſpeaks of <hi>temporall</hi> Iuriſdiction. Hee tells us, that <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
greivances are mention'd in that ſtatute;</hi> but
ſleightly omits ſo much as to name them, much leſſ to
urge them; which were they worth it, wee may bee ſure
hee would have done with a triumph. And, beſides, hee
knows wee hold every good King is to take order to ſee
Eccleſiaſticall grievances remedy'd, and the Canons of
the Church obſerv'd: Nay, hee knows (if hee knows
any thing) our own Lawyers grant that Eccleſiaſticall
affairs ſometimes fall under temporall power <hi>indire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly;</hi>
as, on the other ſide, temporall affairs fall <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly</hi>
under the Eccleſiaſticall. Yet, that there is any
more than this, nay even ſo much in this ſtatute my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
D. hath not shown us; and, if wee will bee judged by the
words of the ſtatute which hee cites, they look quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. But, what matters it what this ſtatute ſayes?
being made two years after his unlawfull marriage with
<hi>Anna Bullon:</hi> which was the ſource of all his rebellion;
intended, in all Likelihood, when that match was made
up. As for his pretence that I conceal'd ſome of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
hee knows, I undertook no more than to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
the ſubſtance, and to show that ſuch kindes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities
were not worth alledging: as I did in this very
place, and shall do again preſently more amply.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, hee quarrells with mee for calling <hi>his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
meer Allegations,</hi> which hee tells us are <hi>authentick
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:115675:273"/>
Records,</hi> &amp;c. whereas my words were onely theſe, (p. 311.
<hi>l.</hi> 30.) that <hi>hee brought diverſe allegations, in which the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe</hi>'s
<hi>pretences were not admitted,</hi> &amp;c. Now, I concieve, a
<hi>Record</hi> or any other Authority <hi>alledged,</hi> is an <hi>Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
which was the word I vſed: the word [<hi>meer</hi>] was
meerly his own fiction, to gain an occaſion to cavill; as
the place now cited, where my words are found, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Readers eyes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſtraws being ſtept over, with which the learned
Bp. thought to block up our paſſage; Wee come to the
point it ſelf. Whether King H. the 8th did any <hi>more</hi> than
his Anceſtours. My L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of D. in his <hi>vindication;</hi> to show
hee did no more or made no new law, gathers up Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from our former laws and reiterates them here,
(though ſometimes hee uſes a phraſe louder than h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s
proofs) how the Pope's were curb'd or limited in their
pretences. Wee anſwer'd, that, <hi>to limit an Authority im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
an admittance of it, in caſes to which the reſtraints ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not:</hi> Hee replies, <hi>that this</hi> (meaning thoſe laws) <hi>was
not meerly to limit an Authority; but to deny it</hi> (p. 20. <hi>l.</hi> 20.)
yet, in the next page, hee denies not <hi>equivalent laws in
france, ſpain, Germany, Italy,</hi> and, in his (<hi>vindication</hi>
(p. 73. <hi>l.</hi> 7. 8. &amp;c.) hee <hi>affirms that the like laws may bee
found in Germany, Poland, france, ſpain, Italy, ſicily,
and, if wee will truſt Padre Paolo, in the Papacy it ſelf.</hi>
Theſe things being put, granted, and confeſt, from his
own words, I shall now appeal, even to the Bp<hi rend="sup">s</hi> beſt and
boſom-friend, whether impudence was not a moderate
character for that man's <hi>genius</hi> or humour, who should
go about to pretend that King H. the 8th did <hi>no more</hi> in
this particular, that is, renounced the Pope's Authority
no more than his Anceſtour Kings had done before him.
For.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this is oppoſite to the common notion and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
opinion of the whole world, both Catholicks,
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:115675:273"/>
Proteſtants, Puritans, and of what ever ſect or ſort: who
ever deem'd Henry the 8th to bee the firſt King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
who renounced the Pope's Supremacy and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
it to himſelf: Nor had they ever that conciet of
<hi>France, Spain, Italy,</hi> &amp;c. in which, notwithſtanding, the
Bp. grants <hi>equivalent laws</hi> to the former laws of England,
to which (according to him) K. H. ſuperadded nothing.
This particularity, I ſay, in K. H. the 8th all the world,
as far as I ere heard, always held in their free and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
thoughts: though, when they are put to it to defend
a deſperate cauſe, artifice wrongs nature and puts ſome
of their non-pluſt Controvertiſts to aſſert and maintain
the moſt open abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is, in particular, againſt the confeſſion
and profeſſion of his own party, the Proteſtants; who
ſing <hi>Halleluiahs</hi> inceſſantly to this happy time, in which
<hi>England</hi> was freed from the yoke of <hi>Rome:</hi> which is an
evident argument of their pretence, that, till now, they
groan'd under this yoke; that is, that, till now, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe's
Headship was acknowledg'd here; and, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that K. H. the 8th did more than his Anceſtours
did formerly, when hee shook it of.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this poſition contradicts in terms their <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
in this point of the Pope's Supremacy, which
yet rings in every man's ears and is confeſt by themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves:
for, it is impoſſible and contradictory there should
bee a Reformation in any thing which was not otherwiſe
before. It was, therfore, <hi>otherwiſe</hi> in England before K.
H. the 8th's time, notwithſtanding all theſe former po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer-limiting
laws alledged by the Bp. and conſequently,
'tis evident from the very terms, that K. H. ſuperadded
to theſe laws in renouncing the Pope's Authority; and
that the contrary poſition is moſt abſurd, impoſſible
and contradictory.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it being confeſt by themſelves, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:115675:274"/>
by Dr. H. (<hi>of Schiſm</hi> p. 132.) in theſe very words, <hi>For
the matter of fact, it is acknowledg'd that, in the reign of K.
H. the 8th, the Papall power in Eccleſiaſticall affairs was,
both by Acts of convocation of the Clergy and by ſtatutes or
Acts of Parliament, caſt out of this Kingdome.</hi> This, I
ſay, being confeſt; and it being alſo evident in terms,
that nothing can bee ſaid to bee <hi>caſt out of a place</hi> unles
before it were <hi>in it:</hi> 'tis likewiſe evident in terms, that
this power was <hi>in</hi> England before, notwithſtanding the
former laws, cited by my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> D. then in power in this
country: and, that thoſe ſtatutes and Acts of Parliament,
made by K. H. which <hi>caſt it out,</hi> did ſome <hi>new</hi> thing againſt
that Authority, that is, did create <hi>new laws,</hi> and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declare the old.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, ſince, according to him, theſe laws made by
H. the 8th did no more than the <hi>former laws,</hi> thoſe <hi>former
laws</hi> alſo muſt bee pretended to have caſt out the Pope's
Supremacy, and to have begun a <hi>Reformation:</hi> which
yet wee never heard pretended, and hee muſt show us
when and how this Authority of the Pope in England
twinklingly went <hi>out</hi> and <hi>in</hi> again; otherwiſe it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bee ſaid to bee <hi>caſt out</hi> a fresh in K. H's reign.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, this poſition of his is particularly oppoſite,
alſo, to the common conſent of all Catholike countries,
(in which notwithſtanding the Bp. affirms there are found
equivalent laws;) who all look't on K. H. the 8th, after
thoſe Pope renouncing Acts, as a Schiſmatick, and on
<hi>England,</hi> both then and ever ſince, as ſchiſmaticall. Now,
that they should eſteem and abhor <hi>England</hi> as ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,
for doing the ſame things themſelves alſo did, is
againſt common ſence and impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, ſince (<hi>iuſt vindication,</hi> p. 73. <hi>l.</hi> 8.) hee quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
<hi>Padre Paulo,</hi> that <hi>the like laws were to bee found in the
Papacy it ſelf:</hi> and 'tis perfect non-ſence to affirm that,
in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> of which the Pope is both ſpirituall and
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:115675:274"/>
temporall Governour, hee should not bee held for Head
of the Church: 'tis moſt manifeſt that the like laws in
other places, and in particular amongſt our Anceſtours
in England, did not take away from him that Headship
in Eccleſiaſticall matters; and, by conſequence, that K.
H. the 8th, who deny'd him that Headship, did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>new</hi> which his Anceſtours had not done, and, when
hee enacted this, <hi>created new law.</hi> 'Tis moſt manifeſt, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe,
that thoſe <hi>like laws</hi> in the Papacy are onely to
diſtinguish the Pope's ſpirituall power, there, from his
temporall, that is, to <hi>limit</hi> it's bounds, not to <hi>deny</hi> it:
and, conſequently, thoſe mutually-like laws in other
countries and in <hi>England</hi> formerly, did onely <hi>limit</hi> it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe:
Whence follows inevitably, that K. H's law, which
totally abolish't, renounc't, and <hi>deny'd</hi> it, was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
far different ſtrain, and <hi>new law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eightly, this poſition is demonſtratively convinc't of
falshood, by the evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and acknowledg'd effect: for, who
ſees not that, upon this <hi>new law</hi> made by K. H. <hi>England</hi>
ſtood at another diſtance from <hi>Rome</hi> than formerly? for,
formerly, notwithſtanding all their laws, they held ſtill
the Pope was Head of the univerſall Church, reverenced
him as ſuch, held this as of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this till the very
time of the breach: Whereas, after K. H's law, hee was
held, by the party which adhered to that law, no Head
of the univerſall Church, nor reverenc't as ſuch; &amp; (if
any thing) rather the contrary, that <hi>England</hi> was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
independent on him was held as of faith. Is not
this as evident, as that the ſun shines; and may it not,
with equall modeſty, bee den'yd that there ever was ſuch
a man as K. H. the 8th?</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, this very poſition takes away the whole que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
between us, and makes both us and all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertiſts
in England on both ſides talk in the aire;
wrangling, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> why K. H. caſt out the Pope's
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:115675:275"/>
Authority here: whenas, (according to this illuminated
Adverſary of mine) hee had actually noe Authority the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
at that time, to caſt out.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this poſition is ſo thriving an abſurdity, that,
from non-ſence and contradiction, it proſperouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to perfect madnes and fanaticknes; and comes to
this, that there neither is nor ever was a Papiſt country
in the world. For, ſince 'tis evident in terms, that the
King and his complices, who made that Pope diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Act, were not Papiſts or acknowledgers of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe's
Authority, after they had thus renounc't the Pope's
Authority: Again, ſince, according to the Bp. the <hi>ſame</hi>
laws were <hi>formerly</hi> made receiu'd, and executed in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi>
it follows, that our Anceſtours equally renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Pope's Authority alſo, and ſo could bee no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
neither: and, laſtly, ſince hee grants <hi>equivalent laws
infrance, Spain, Italy, Sicily, Germany, Poland,</hi> &amp;c. it
follows by the ſame reaſon, that thoſe countries are not
<hi>Papiſts</hi> neither, no, not the very Papacy it ſelf. And, ſo,
this miraculous blunderer hath totally deſtroy'd and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated
all the Papiſts in the world, with one ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
blaſt of his mouth.</p>
                  <p>And now, Chriſtian Reader, can I do any leſſ, if I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to breed a due apprehenſion in thee of the weaknes
of his cauſe and falshood of this man, than appeal to
thy judgment, whether any mad man, or born fool could
have ſtumbled upon ſuch a piece of non ſence? Dos't
not think my former words very moderate and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to character this man's way, when I ſaid, <hi>How ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
how impudent a manner of ſpeaking is this, to force
his Readers to renounce their eyes &amp; ears and all Evidence?</hi>
Could any man, without a viſard of braſſ on pretend to
ſecure men's Souls from Schiſm, (a ſin which of Schiſm
c. 1. themſelves acknowledge as great as Idolatry,) by
alledging ſuch ſublimated non-ſence for a ſufficient excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:115675:275"/>
or ground; when the acknowledg'd fact of ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
and renting God's Church, cries loudly againſt
them: nay more, (ſince leſſ motives and reaſons cannot
iuſtify ſuch a fact, nor a continuance of it) to bring ſuch
an heap of contradictions, for perfect Evidences and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations?</p>
                  <p>Pardon mee you, whoſe weaker or ſeldomer refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on the certainty of faith, and, by conſequence,
of the certainty of an eternall concernment in theſe kind
of Controverſies, make you think courteſy violated by
ſuch home-expreſſions; which may breed a ſmart refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion,
and ſtir up a more perfect conſideration in the
Readers mind's. Examin my harsheſt words in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
rigour, as apply'd to his Demerits; and, if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
hold mee for blamed; if not, then think, (as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
grants) that it is equally moderate, (but far more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary)
to call great and wilfull faults by their right na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of <hi>Coſenage, impudence,</hi> &amp;c. if they deſerve them;
as 'tis to call ſmaller lapſes by theirs of a <hi>miſtake</hi> or <hi>an
overſight.</hi> How can it ever bee hoped that Truth should
bee righted; as long as her Adverſaries may take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to act impudently againſt her, and her Defenders
muſt bee afraid to tell the world their faults and to <hi>ſay</hi>
what they do?</p>
                  <p>Again, were this shameles poſition of this Bp<hi rend="sup">s</hi> ſome
odd ſaying on the by, or ſome petty branch of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
it deſerv'd leſſ animadverſion: but, 'tis the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantialleſt
part of his <hi>vindication,</hi> where hee huddles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
many laws, which, <hi>de facto,</hi> conſiſted with the
acknowledgment of the Pope's Authority both in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
and other Catholike countries, to parallell K. H's
which were abſolutely inconſiſtent with it, and to show
that K. H. did <hi>no more than his Anceſtours and other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes</hi>
did. So that, hee alledges this as a chief ground
of their vindication, and wee shall ſee again afterwards an
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:115675:276"/>
whole Section built on this one particular ground. Now,
had hee grounded himſelf on a foundation of ſome <hi>ſandy</hi>
probability, it had been (though ſtill inſufficient, yet
more pardonable and (in compariſon of the other) ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable;
or, on an aiery fancy of ſome odd Crotchet
of his own head (as was Dr. H's conciet of the Apoſtles
<hi>Excluſive Provinces,</hi>) it had been to bee pittied, if ſprung
from weaknes, or laught at, if from wilfulnes: but, to
ground his vindication, that is, to build his and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
ſecurity from Schiſm and eternall damnation, on
the meer <hi>vacuum</hi> of non ſence and perfect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction,
confutable by the contrary <hi>tenet,</hi> acknowledgment and
ſight of the whole worlds eyes; is ſuch a piece of shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſnes
that it can admit no ſufficient character; as a <hi>non
ens</hi> is incapable of a definition.</p>
                  <p>As for his particularities entrenching or pretended to
entrench on the Pope's Authority, whether they were
lawfully done or no, how far they extended, in what cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
and caſes they held, in what not, how the
letter of thoſe laws are to bee underſtood, &amp;c. all which
the Bp. omits, though hee preſſ the bare words; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to Canon and ſecular Lawyers to ſcuffle about
them, not to mee: I hold my ſelf to the liſts of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and the limits of a Controvertiſt. And,</p>
                  <p>Whenas hee asks mee, <hi>what lawfull Iuriſdiction could
remain to the Pope in England,</hi> where ſuch and ſuch laws
<hi>had force?</hi> I anſwer, the ſame that remains ſtill to him in
<hi>france,</hi> where you confeſſ equivalent laws have force; the
ſame that remains to him ſtill in <hi>Spain, Italy, Sicily,</hi> &amp;c.
So that either you muſt ſpeak out according to the
Grounds, and ſay there it not <hi>a Papiſt country</hi> in the
world, that is, not a country that acknowledges the
Pope Head of the Church; which is to put out the eyes
of the whole world, for wee ſee <hi>de facto</hi> that hee is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledg'd
and exerciſes Iuriſdiction in Catholike count<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tries
<pb facs="tcp:115675:276"/>
or elſe confeſſ that they retain ſtill <hi>ſomething,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
thoſe equivalent laws, which you renounc't.
<hi>This ſomething,</hi> which they ſtill retain more than you doe,
is that which makes you Schiſmaticks for rejecting it;
and is ſo far from grounding your excuſe, (for which you
produce it,) that it enhances your guilt and Grounds a
moſt iuſt accuſation againſt you: that, Whereas ſuch and
ſo many ſtrong curbs were ſet by the former laws of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
(as are alſo in Catholike countries) to ſecure you
from the leaſt fear of any extravagant encroachme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts nay
by which you confeſſ here p. 36. they <hi>kept their priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
inviolated,</hi> yet, your deſperately-ſeditions humour

I ask't <hi>what this belong'd to us; unles it bee proved
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:115675:277"/>
that their practicks were an obliging precedent to us?</hi> To show
more the impertinency of this allegation; I deny'd, that
the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath any title from the Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Churches, otherwiſe than by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
who onely were our Anceſtours, and by whoſe
conqueſts and laws all that is in the Britannick world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
and is derived to us. The Bp. replies: <hi>yes, well
enough?</hi> and, why? <hi>firſt</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>Wales and Cornwall
have not onely a locall but a perſonall ſucceſſion;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>noe man can doubt of their right to the priviledges of
the Britannick Churches.</hi> Grant it: what is this to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?
how does this vindicate the Church of England or
take of my exception? For, let <hi>their</hi> ſucceſſion bee what
it will, it follows not that the <hi>body</hi> of England (of which
our Controverſy is) hath any ſuch priviledges by deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
from <hi>Cornwall</hi> or <hi>Wales.</hi> Again, 'tis evident that
for theſe many hundred years, they acknowledg'd the
Pop'es Authority as much as <hi>England.</hi> And laſtly, 'tis a
clear caſe, they were under thoſe which were under the
Pope. But, the wily Bp. being ask't an hard queſtion, to
wit, whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> had any title from
or dependence on the Britannick Churches, anſwers
quite another matter, and then tels us hee hath done
<hi>well enough.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee ſayes, that <hi>there is the ſame reaſon for
the Scots and Picts, who were no more ſubjected to forrain
Iuriſdiction than the Britans themſelves.</hi> I anſwer none of
the <hi>Picts</hi> are now extant but totally exterminated, &amp; ſo
no ſucceſſion from them: And, as for the <hi>Scots,</hi> what
doe they concern the Church of <hi>England's</hi> vindication,
our purpoſe, or my queſtion; unles hee can show, which
hee never pretends, that his Church of England receives
title to any thing by way of the ſcottish Churches? Again,
ſince they have been ſubmitted to the Pope, what avails
it if they had any exemption anciently: for, they could
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:115675:277"/>
never derive it to us, for want of continuation of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?
yet as long as hee tells us hee does <hi>well enough,</hi> all
is well.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly (hee should have ſaid <hi>firſt,</hi> for, the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
anſwer are nothing to the purpoſe,) hee tells us,
that, <hi>among the ſaxons themſelves, the great Kingdomes
of Mercia and Northumberland were converted by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Scots, and had their Religion and Ordination firſt from
them, afterwards among themſelves, without any forrain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance;
and ſo were as free as the Britons.</hi> where, all the
force lies in thoſe words, [<hi>without any forrain dependance</hi>]
which hee obtrudes upon us on his own credit onely,
without a word of proof: or, if there bee any shadow of
reaſon for it there, it muſt bee this, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hey were <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi>
by the ancient Scots, which himſelf tells us, two
pages after, is nothing at all to <hi>Iuriſdiction.</hi> But, that
which is of main importance is, that hee brings, here, no
proof, that the <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> had no forrain
dependance, ſave his own word onely: And, the trifles
hee brings afterwards are of leſſ credit than even his own
words; as will bee ſeen when they come to ſcanning.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hee aſſures us, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at, <hi>after the Conqueſt,

                        </gap>d of British Chriſtians
did ſtill live mixt with the ſaxons.</hi> And how proves hee,
this? <hi>becauſe otherwiſe the ſaxons had not been able to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the ſixth part of the Land.</hi> I ask, did hee meaſure the
Land, and number the ſaxons? If not, how does hee
know, or how can hee affirm this? Or how does hee
prove the Land muſt neceſſarily bee peopled, as fully as
before, immediately after a Conqueſt ſo univerſall and
cruell? Our hiſtorians tell us that, to avoid their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
cruelty which ſpared none, the ancient Britains re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
into <hi>Wales:</hi> yet hee would perſuade us, both wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
and againſt all hiſtory, that a <hi>world</hi> ſtayd behind;
and this, not becauſe the ſaxons ſtood in need of them
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:115675:278"/>
(as hee pretends,) who as 'tis known, brought their
whole families with them; but, indeed, becauſe the Bp.
ſtood in need of them, to make good his cauſe. But,
granting the likelihood, that ſome few of them remain'd
ſtill in their former homes, how can the Bp. make any
advantage of it? Thus: <hi>Who can deny</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>thoſe
poore conquer'd Chriſtians and their Chriſtian poſterity,
though mixed with ſaxons, the iuſt priviledges of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours?</hi>
A compaſſionate man! who ſpeaks a great deal
of tender-hearted <hi>non-ſence,</hi> rather than hee will ſeem
unmercifull, not to the ancient Britons (as hee pretends,)
but to his own cauſe; which hee shows to bee good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turd,
at leaſt, though it bee deſtitute of reaſon: for, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
hee can show,) which yet never was pretended by any
Proteſtant or man of common ſence) that thoſe who
remain'd had yet British Bishops amongſt them; or, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
hee can pretend that they remain'd not ſubject to the
Bishops of the ſaxons; it is a madnes to imagin thoſe few
lay people should inherit thoſe former ſuppoſed privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges:
For, ſince, all the world grants that they (if the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
were any ſuch) became ſubject to the Bishops of the
ſaxons, which were ſubject to the Pope; all pretence of
their exemption from that power to which their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
were ſubject is taken away: And the Bp<hi rend="sup">s</hi> mercifull
reaſon is all one, as if ſome few Englishmen by ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
remaining and ſettling in <hi>France,</hi> should pretend
an exemption from the french laws both Eccleſiaſticall
and temporall, and to enioy the priviledges they had whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
they were in <hi>England,</hi> that is, while they were under
another Government. But,</p>
                  <p>His laſt reaſon is to the purpoſe and a rare one; 'tis
this, that <hi>the ſaxon Conqueſt gave them as good title to the
priviledges, as to the Lands of the Britons.</hi> As if hee made
account, that Eccleſiaſtical Iuriſdiction is a thing of that
nature as to bee won by the ſword; or that the <hi>Saxons</hi>
                     <pb n="537" facs="tcp:115675:278"/>
could plunder the <hi>Britons</hi> of their ſpirituall priviledges
as well as of a bag of money. But, the ieſt is, hee would
have thoſe priviledges at once goe into <hi>Wales,</hi> with
the British Bishops, and ſtay at home in <hi>England:</hi> not
conſidering that Eccleſiaſticall priviledges are things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in men, that is, in the Eccleſiaſticall Governours,
as enioyers or elſe as conſervers and diſpenſers of them
to the people; and, in the Governed, as ſubiect to tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
Governours and laws; not, in ſtones, woods and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
as hee fancies. Again, whereas thoſe priviledges
originally belong to Eccleſiaſticall Governours and are
annex't unto them as ſuch, as they are ſuppoſed to doe
in the Bp<hi rend="sup">s</hi> caſe; they cannot bee tranſmitted to poſterity
but by a ſucceſſion into the Authority of the former
Governours: wherefore, let him either show that the
after Bps of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ever had ſucceſſion of
Authority from or were impower'd by the <hi>British</hi> Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops;
or elſe let him confeſſ that they could inherit no
priviledges from them; and, by conſequence, that his
pretence of it is groundles and impertinent.</p>
                  <p>What is ſaid hitherto was to show the inconſequence of
deriving thoſe priviledges from the British to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he English
Church, in caſe the British had any ſuch priviledge of
independency, as the Bishop contends: But,</p>
                  <p>My ſecond objection was, that <hi>this pretended exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the British Church was falſe.</hi> My reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the British Bishops admitted appellation to <hi>Rome</hi>
at the Council of <hi>Sardica.</hi> In anſwer</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hee tells mee, that, <hi>ere I can alledge the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Council of Sardica, I muſt renounce the divine
Inſtitution of the Papacy:</hi> and why? <hi>for</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>that
Canon ſubmitted it to the good pleaſure of the fathers, and
groundeth it upon the memory of S. Peter, not the Inſtitution
of Chriſt.</hi> Which is, firſt, flat falſification of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil:
there being not a word in it either concerning the
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:115675:279"/>
                     <hi>Papall power</hi> it ſelf, or it's <hi>Inſtitution;</hi> but concerning
<hi>Appeals</hi> onely. Next, ſince wee call that of <hi>divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
which Chriſt with his own mouth ordain'd; and
never any man made account or imagin'd that Chriſt
came from heaven to ſpeak to the after Pope's, and ſo
give them a Primacy; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee gave it by his own
mouth to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> whiles hee lived here on earth: This,
I ſay, being evidently our <hi>tenet;</hi> and the Council never
touching this point at all; what a weaknes is it to argue
thence againſt the diuine Inſtitution of the Papacy, and
to abuſe the Council, ſaying, that <hi>it ſubmitted this to the
good pleaſures of the fathers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee asks, <hi>how does it appear that the British
Bishops did aſſent to that Canon?</hi> which a little after hee
calls my <hi>preſumption:</hi> And truly, I shall ever think it a
moſt iuſt preſumption, that they, who confeſſedly ſate
in the Council, aſſented to what was ordain'd by the
Council in which they ſate (as was their duty) unles ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
objection bee alledged to the contrary; as the Bp
brings none.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee ſayes <hi>the Council of ſardica was no gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Council after all the Eaſtern Bishops were departed; as
they were before the making of that Canon.</hi> What means
hee by the <hi>Eaſtern Bishops?</hi> the Catholicks, or the
Arians? The Arian Bishops indeed fled away, fearing the
judgment of the Church, as Apol. 2. &amp; ep. ad ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios
<hi>S. Athanaſius</hi> witneſſes: but how shows hee that any
of the 76. Eaſtern Bishops, were gone, ere this Canon,
(which is the third in that Council) was made? So that,
my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of Derry is willing to maintain his cauſe, by clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to the <hi>Arians</hi> againſt <hi>S. Athanaſius</hi> and the then
Catholike Church (as hee does alſo in his foregoing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
p. 190. 191) denying, with them, this to have been
a generall Council, becauſe his good Brother Arians
had run away from it, fearing their own juſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mnation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="539" facs="tcp:115675:279"/>
Fourthly, hee ſays the Canons of this Council were
never received in England or incorporated into the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
laws. I ask, has hee read the British laws in thoſe
times? if not, for any thing hee knows, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
into them; and ſo, according to his former
Grounds, muſt deſcend down to the English. But, wee
are miſtaken in him: his meaning is onely that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages
and priuiledges should bee inherited from the
Britons, not their diſadvantages or ſubjection: So ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
a man hee is to his cauſe, though partiall to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>this Canon is contradicted by the great
generall Council of Chalcedon, which our Church recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi>
Yet it ſeems hee neitheir thought the words worth
citing, nor the Canon where the abrogation of the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica
Canon</hi> is found worth mentioning: which argues, it
is neither worth anſwering nor looking for I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
hee will not find any repealing of the <hi>Sardica Canon</hi>
expreſt there: It muſt therefore bee his own deduction,
on which hee relies; which, till hee puts it down, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee anſwerd. As for their Church receiving the
Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> the Council may thanke their ill
will to the Pope, not their good will to receive Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils:
For any Council, in which they can find any line to
blunder in miſtakingly againſt him, they receive with
open arms; But, thoſe Councils which are clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ
for him, though much ancienter (as this of <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
was) shall bee ſure to bee rejected and held of no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
and, when a better excuſe wants, the very run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away of the guilty <hi>Arians</hi> shall diſannul the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
and depriue it of all it's Authority.</p>
                  <p>Hee ſubjoyns, <hi>there appears not the leaſt footſtep of any
Papall Iuriſdiction exerciſed in England by Elentherius:</hi>
(I anſwer nor any certain footſtep of any thing elſe in
thoſe obſcure times:) <hi>but the contrary: for, hee referd the
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:115675:280"/>
legiſlative part to King Lucius, and the British Bishops.</hi>
Here you ſee my Ld D. poſitive and abſolute: But, look
into his <hi>Vindication,</hi> p. 105. and you shall ſee what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
hee relies on for this poſitive confidence; viz.
the Epiſtle of <hi>Eleutherius;</hi> which, himſelf, conſcious it
was nothing worth and candid to acknowledge it there,
graces with a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> in theſe words (<hi>If that Epiſtle
bee not counterfeit:</hi>) But, now wee have loſt the candid
conditionall [<hi>If,</hi>] and are grown <hi>abſolute.</hi> Whence wee
ſee, that the Bp. according as hee is put to it more and
more to maintain his cauſe, is forced ſtill to ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>te ſome
degree of his former little ſincerity: <hi>And</hi> thus, this <hi>if-not
counter feited</hi> teſtimony is become one of his demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,
to clear himſelf and his Church from Schiſm.</p>
                  <p>Now, though our faith relies on immediate Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for
it's onely and certain Rule, and not upon fragments of
old Authours: yet, to give ſome inſtances of the Pope's
Iuriſdiction anciently in England, I alledged <hi>S. Proſper,</hi>
that <hi>Pope Celeſtin [Vice ſua] in his own ſtead ſent S Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to free the Britons from Pelagianiſm, and converted
the ſcots by Palladius.</hi> My L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> anſwers, that <hi>converting</hi>
and <hi>ordaining,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are not acts of Iuriſdiction:</hi> yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſayes here, p. 193. that <hi>all other right of Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
doth follow the right of ordination.</hi> Now what theſe
words [<hi>all other</hi>] mean is evident by the words immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
foregoing, to wit, <hi>all other</hi> beſides <hi>Ordination</hi> and
<hi>Election;</hi> by which 'tis plain hee makes theſe two to bee
<hi>rights of Iuriſdiction.</hi> So neceſſary an attendant to errour
is ſelf contradiction and non-ſence. But the point is, hee
leaues out thoſe words I relied on [<hi>Vice ſua, in his own
ſtead,</hi>] which show'd, that it belong'd to his office to do
it. Theſe words omitted, hee tells us, that hee hath <hi>little
reaſon to beleeve either the one, or the other:</hi> that is, hee
refuſes to beleeve <hi>S. Proſper</hi> a famous and learned father,
who lived neer about the ſame time and was converſant
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:115675:280"/>
with the affairs of the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> and chuſes to relie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on an old obſcure Authour, whence no prudent
man can Ground a certainty of any thing, and which, if
hee would ſpeak out, himſelf would ſay hee thought to
bee counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>What follows in his 25. page is onely his own ſayings?
His folly in grounding the Pope's Supremacy on <hi>Phocas</hi>
his liberality hath been particularly anſwer'd by mee he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retofore,
<hi>Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. 1. Sect.</hi> 6. whether I refer him.</p>
                  <p>I found fault with him for <hi>leaving the Papall power and
ſpending his time in impugning the Patriarchal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>:</hi> And, I
concieve it ſtands with very good reaſon to reprehend
mine Adverſary, and call him back, when hee runs away
from the whole queſtion. Firſt, hee <hi>obſerves</hi> how <hi>readily
wee decline all manner of diſcourſe concerning the Pope's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall
power.</hi> When 'tis not the queſtion, wee do; as
any man, who underſtands what it is to diſpute, would:
But, does hee ever find that wee decline it when 'tis the
queſtion? I ſuppoſe, by this time, my largenes in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it in this foregoing treatiſe, <hi>Part. 1. Sect.</hi> 15. hath
corrected his wrong apprehenſion in that point. Next,
hee is puzzled to know the <hi>reaſon</hi> of this, but hee <hi>may
well conjecture</hi> (hee ſayes,) that <hi>'tis</hi> becauſe <hi>wee find that
our ſpirituall Monar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hy, and a Patriarchall dignity are
inconſiſtent in the ſame ſubject.</hi> What inſuperable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
the Bp's ſooth-ſaying fancy propoſes? As if it were
ſoe hard a matter for Bp. <hi>Vſcher</hi> to have beenat once Bp.
of <hi>Armagch,</hi> and yet Primate too of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and, as
ſuch, my Lord of <hi>Derry's</hi> Superiour: what greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
hee imagins, that a Primate and an higher, (that
is, a Papall) power should joyn in one perſon, than the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is that a Primacy, that is, the higheſt in that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
should bee thus linkt with an inferiour dignity in
the ſame continent, needs a revelation from the fancy
that firſt dream't it. Laſtly, hees is shrewdly peremptory,
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:115675:281"/>
and shuts up thus, <hi>And yet, a Patriarch the Pope was,
and ſo always acknowledg'd to bee, and they cannot deny it.</hi>
Is not this a pleaſant man to wanton it thus with a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
cruelty; who puts us upon the rack, and will make
us by force confeſſ a truth, which himſelf knows every
Catholike in the world ever granted, held, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd?
And, what weak-iudging Reader, ſeeing ſuch
confident expreſſions, would not remain aſtonisht at it
and admire the Bp. for a moſt terrible diſputant; who
over bears his Adverſary with ſuch an unreſiſtable career
of Authority, and all to beats with ſuch mighty ſtroaks
the hiſſing aire?</p>
                  <p>Amongſt other proofs of the British liberties, (as the
BP. tells us here,) hee produced the anſwer of <hi>Dinoth</hi>
to <hi>Auſtin;</hi> which hee deems ſoe choyce and rare a proof
that hee reiterates it, and with new vigour inſiſts on it
here: gleaning thoſe exceptions hee thought the eaſieſt,
from this treatiſe, my former againſt Dr. H. and partly
from the <hi>Appendix</hi> to the <hi>Manuall of Controverſy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My firſt exception, in this place, was, that the word
<hi>Pope</hi> was not then uſed alone to ſignify the Bp. of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me:
Hee quotes <hi>Bellarmin</hi> againſt mee, and (ſo wiſe a
man hee is) expects that Catholike Writers shall bee of
the ſame mind in all things, even in controvertible and
indifferent point, that is, hee makes account there are
neither Catholick Schools, nor that any difficulties oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in Hiſtorians; nor, to come neerer the point, that
Catholikes should diſagree even ſo much as in a Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm
about a word, as this is. As for the inſtance from
the Council of <hi>Chalcedon, Beatiſſimus &amp; Apoſtolicus vir
Papa, hoc nobis praecepit,</hi> I anſwer that, though there
bee neither <hi>Vrbis Romae</hi> or any ſuch like expreſſion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
conjoyn'd to the word <hi>Papa,</hi> yet, which is
equivalent, the comitant circumſtances ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ermin'd
and indigitated the perſon; nay, although the
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:115675:281"/>
word <hi>Papa</hi> had been totally omitted, yet the perſon had
been perfectly known: for, theſe words are down in the
Council as ſpoken by <hi>Boniface, ſedis Apoſtolicae vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
the Pope's vice gerent,</hi> in anſwer to a demand of the
Council what orders hee had received from Pope Leo.
So far then is the word <hi>Papa</hi> in that place from being
emphaticall or expreſſive of the BP. of <hi>Rome,</hi> taken ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly
and alone; that it was rather, rigorouſly ſpeaking, a
needles word as found in that place.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond exception againſt their being called Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops
of <hi>Caerleon,</hi> after the remouall of the ſeat to <hi>S. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi>
was not put by mee in this place nor urged againſt
him at all, but againſt Dr. H. But, <hi>conceptum ſermonem
retinere quis poteſt?</hi> though it concern'd not his Province
hee muſt ſtill needs bee doing. Hee had found by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
an odd teſtimony, (the beſt <hi>Minerva</hi> of a word ſtuff't
brain;) and hee was with child till hee had brought it to
light. Nor hath hee yet any thing to take of my exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
beſides one teſtimony of an hiſtorian, (for Sr
<hi>Henry's</hi> is either built on the <hi>welsh</hi> paper or on this ſame
Authour's words:) and, on the other ſide, himſelf muſt
confeſſ, that it is a paſſage unparallell'd in hiſtory, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ever ſince the beginning of the world, that a ſeat
should bee tranſlated from one place to another, as this
was from <hi>Caerleon</hi> to <hi>Menevia;</hi> and yet retain the title
of the ſeat whence it was tranſlated; and this during the
ſucceſſive Government of five and twenty Bishops, as
this teſtimony ſayes. Again, had the name <hi>Caerleon</hi> been
tranſlated likewiſe to <hi>Menevia,</hi> that is, had <hi>Menevia</hi>
changed it's name into <hi>Caerleon,</hi> it had been more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
or, had <hi>Caerleon's</hi> Arch Bishops, onely for ſome
conveniency, reſided at <hi>Menevia,</hi> and the right of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
belonged ſtill to <hi>Caerleon,</hi> it might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
bee conceived feiſible: but, that the ſeat it ſelf should
bee tranſlated, and <hi>Menevia</hi> bee made the lawfull Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:115675:282"/>
and yet not own her ſelf for ſuch, but let a cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hier'd
place ſo long keep the title due in right to her, is
highly improbable. But, the maine is, that it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in hiſtory, the Bp's of <hi>S. Davids</hi> or <hi>Menevia</hi> were
called <hi>Menevenſes,</hi> (as himſelf cannot but know, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

                        </gap>ſeus</hi>)
is <hi>Defenſorium Iuriſdictions ſedis Menevenſis:</hi> I conceive
all theſe Teſtimonies will eaſily outweigh the BP's ſingle
one: which yet is all that ſecures it from being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſt hiſtory; &amp; ſo, 'tis uterly undeſerving any
credit. Add, that, grant the name of <hi>Caerleon</hi> had been
retain'd by them, ſo that the Bishops of <hi>menevia</hi> were
call'd Bishops of <hi>Caerleon;</hi> yet they could not but very
unhandſomely bee, called BP's of <hi>Caerleon upon Vske.</hi>
This particular exactnes then in this expreſſing the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality
of his Bishoprick, which is found in the Abbot's
words, argue that the counterfeiter of this paper ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
this Bishop ſtill to have reſided neere <hi>Vske</hi> at <hi>Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,</hi>
after the locall tranſlation of the ſeat thence; and
ſo, ſtill it remains an argument of it's impoſture.</p>
                  <p>My third exception, as hee calls it, is ſuch that the
Bp. <hi>cannot,</hi> hee confeſſes, <hi>find the edge of it.</hi> Perhaps
the bluntnes lies in his apprehenſion, not in my exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
Let us ſee. I objected, that <hi>S. H. ſpilman found
no</hi> other Antiquity in that Welsh manuscript worth the
mentioning; and, that this shrewdly imply'd, it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
for this alone. Hee asks how <hi>I know S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H. found no
other Antiquities in it? and alledges, that there might bee
many more, and yet not proper for a Collection of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
Councils.</hi> Pray does S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H. neglect all paſſages which
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:115675:282"/>
are not of this grave nature? How came hee then to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
notice of this toy? was this ſingle Abbot either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to bee a Council, or theſe words of his ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
act of a Council? I conceive you will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it was; otherwiſe Dr H. would not have underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
it as <hi>inconſiderable,</hi> and a proof you could <hi>unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
and eaſily partwith</hi> as he does in his <hi>Appe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dix,</hi> p 168.
How then was it ſo proper for à Collection of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
Councils? whereas the Collection might have
been entire and perfect, though this had been omitted.
Since then Sr H. who adored any new reuived piece of
Antiquity, found nothing in this manuſcript worth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
but this; in all likelihood it was made for this
onely. Secondly, hee replies, <hi>in caſe there had been no
other Antiquity in it, would S. W. condemn his creed for a
counterfeit, becauſe it is not huddled together confuſedly with
ſome other Treatiſe in one Volume.</hi> No; my Ld: my creed
is ſufficiently authoriz'd to my hand, nor hath any iuſt
exceptions againſt it: This poor manuſcript hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all to aſſert it's Authority, and lies under many
and very ſuſpicious Exceptions. But, in caſe one, who
holds not his creed, should bee dealt with to beleeve it
onely upon theſe Grounds, that it was found in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
manuſcript newly brought to light by one who
holds the ſame creed; and this manuſcript not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd
by any teſtimony aſſerting it to have been writ by
the Apoſtles, but onely that it <hi>might bee</hi> it was; and againſt
this very <hi>might bee</hi> many exceptions brought, and
amongſt the reſt, that the ſtyle was very new and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
and ſo unlikely to have been the Apoſtles own
words; again, in caſe this manuſcript, whence onely this
creed is pretended to bee evinced, had nothing in it worth
note but this very creed: that man were very weak and
foolish, to beleeve his creed thus ſlenderly propoſed or
rather totally unauthoriz'd; nor can they bee iudg'd leſſ
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:115675:283"/>
weak who can think ſuch a manuſcript, abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authentick
and manifoldy excepted againſt, a fitt Ground
to build their aſſent upon to clear themſelves from
Schiſm, that is, to ſecure themſelves from, otherwiſe,
due damnation, as themſelves confeſſ. Will hee have
mee reckon up again the exceptions againſt it? To omit
then what hath been ſayd here,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is onely Sr H's coniecture, that M. <hi>Moſton's</hi>
manuſcript was tranſcribed out of an ancienter Copy:
now, if this meer conjecture happen to fail, the wiſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines
is at an end.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Sr H. who brought it to light, confeſſes, hee
knows not when and by whom that manuſcript was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed:
which is as much as to ſay, it hath nothing to
authorize it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, 'tis onely Sr H's conjecture, that thoſe words
were the anſwer of <hi>Dinoth</hi> to <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>4ly the ſame conjecture is all the Ground that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Dinoth</hi> was that Abbot.</p>
                  <p>5ly the English found, in an interlineary manner with
the <hi>Welsh,</hi> in that manuſcript, is evidently modern and
later than K. H. the 8th: which altogether diſgraces the
pretended Antiquity of that manuſcript, and Grounds
a iuſt preſumption of it's being forged to countenance
his or his ſucceſſours renouncing the Pope's Authority.</p>
                  <p>6ly the learned in Welsh affirm, that both the welsh
language is modern, and the ſpelling it is unlike to the
ancient manner; and doth manifeſtly and particularly
reſemble externs ſmattering, when they firſt learn or
write that language. Diuers inſtances of which are found
in few lines, which evidences a forgery.</p>
                  <p>7ly, the Proteſtants are challenged to have abus'd it
in the tranſlation; and yet (ſo brave a proof it is) they
are glad to add paraphraſes to make ſence of it.</p>

acknowledg'd by the common conſent of good and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

tacitly grants by waving to patronize it; who (in his

Pope, found in ſome Library in manuſcript, printed &amp;
put forth by ſome Proteſtant Authour, and ſuppoſed by
the partiall Antiquary, without the leaſt proof, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
out of ancienter copies, preſently there needs no
more to authorize it, ſoe it bee but againſt the Pope:
that <hi>Ballad</hi> shall bee confidently aſſerted to have been
ſung by the old British <hi>Bards,</hi> and to have ſignify'd the
ſence of the British Churches in thoſe days And thus,
Proteſtant Reader, thou ſeeſt what demonſtrations thy
BP's and Dr's bring thee, to ſecure thy Soul from the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
ſin of <hi>Schiſm;</hi> which yet (Dr. H. <hi>of Schiſm,</hi> c. 1.) they

                  <p>Laſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> put caſe all had been true, yet what had they
concluded; unles they had proved likewiſe that this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,
in ſaying ſo, had ſpoken the mind of the then Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
world? for, no man that hath any ſence in his head
will undertake to defend, that, in the ſpace of fifteen or
ſixteen hundred years, there cannot bee found ſome few
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:115675:284"/>
who, either out of diſguſt, ambition, intereſt or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
might ſpeak or act againſt the Pope's Authority
or againſt the moſt inuiolable right that can be imagined,
but 'tis clearly ſufficient to maintain that in ſo ſaying,
they pronounced not the ſence of the then Catholike
world. Have there been hereſies, againſt almoſt all other
points of faith ariſen in ſeverall ages; and shall wee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
noe poſſibility of oppoſition againſt that point which
concerns Government? Or, will it bee deem'd by any
indifferent man a competent proof againſt true faith, to
ſay, that ſuch and ſuch hereticks deny'd it? No more
ought it to bee held ſufficient, that ſuch or ſuch perſons
now and then deny'd that point which concerns Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nment;
unles ſuch a deniall can Ground an inference that
God's Church in that age held otherwiſe. If then the
Bp. will, firſt, clear his welsh copy book of all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
brought againſt it; next, aſſert and eſtablish it's
Authority; and laſtly, evince that this Abbot, in thus
ſaying, ſpoke the thoughts of the world at that time; hee
will conclude ſtrongly againſt us: and, till hee does this
hee does nothing; For, onely the beleef of a Church,
relying on immediate Tradition, pretended and evinced,
can bee poſſibly held able to counterpoiſe the <hi>tenet</hi> of a
Church which confeſſedly relies on immediate Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
poſſeſt.</p>
                  <p>As for what the Bp. addes concerning his <hi>corroborato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
proof</hi> from the British Synods, I muſt confeſſ indeed
that <hi>corroboratory</hi> is a very thumping and <hi>robuſt</hi> word;
but what does it <hi>corroborate?</hi> Does it prove that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of this welsh manuſcript was worth a ſtraw? Not a
iot. The chief ſtrentgh of this <hi>corrobototy proof</hi> lies in this,
that <hi>all the British Clergy did, in thoſe Synods, renounce
all obedience to the ſee of Rome:</hi> as hee tells us here, p. 29.
and urges mee to anſwer it. I shall; and reply, that 'tis
an arrant falſification at once of all Hiſtorians: for, if hee
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:115675:285"/>
means that they onely diſobey'd the Pope, in not con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forming
themſelves to his commands, I grant 'tis clear
in all hiſtory they did ſo; and ſo have many, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
Catholikes, done, who yet own the Pope's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
it ſelf: but, if it ſignifies, as his circumſtances and
words make it, that they <hi>renounced</hi> the Pope's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and deny'd his power to command or <hi>Supremacy,</hi> 't, is
abſolutely falſe; no ſuch thing being debated or deny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
in thoſe Synods. Yet, to <hi>corroborate</hi> this, this Bp. tells
us, (in his <hi>iuſt vindication</hi> p. 104.) <hi>That Auſtin, S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory's
Legate, propoſed three things to them; firſt, that they
should ſubmit to the Roman Bishop:</hi> 2ly <hi>that they should
conform to the Roman cuſtomes about the obſeruation of
Eaſter, and adminiſtration of Baptiſm; and Laſtly, that
they should ioyn with him in preaching to the ſaxons.</hi> All
which are prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to bee deny'd in thoſe Synods. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas,
again, the firſt pretended propoſall of <hi>S. Auſtin</hi>'s
is a very flat falſification of the Bp's; no ſuch thing being
there propoſed: The three propoſalls were concerning
<hi>Eaſter, Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>preaching to the English,</hi> as your
friend, Dr. H. (who happen'd here to bee more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous)
tells you expreſly out of <hi>Bede</hi> (Appendix p. 181.
l. 8. 9.) Yet the Bp. cites there for this propoſall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall,
<hi>Beda &amp; omnes alij,</hi> in the margent; that is, at on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
belies <hi>Bede</hi> and all our Hiſtorians: and, to compleat
the ieſt (in his vindication, p. 104. l. 1. 2.) hee brags
that <hi>this would strike the queſtion dead</hi> And truly ſoe it
hath: for, whereas the queſtion before depended moſt
upon the Bp's own words, and partly on his ſinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rity;
nothing is more queſtionles now than this, that hee is a
moſt unqueſtionable falſifier. Now, to <hi>falſify,</hi> wee are
told, ſignifies to <hi>corroborate, that Proteſtant cauſe;</hi> and ſo
is no shame, but a beautifull ſtain and an honorable ſcar.</p>
                  <p>Again, hee aſſures us here from his <hi>corroboratory proof,</hi>
that <hi>all the British Cler<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y, did r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nounce all obedience to
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:115675:285"/>
the Bp of Rome, of which all our Hiſtoriographers do bear
witnes.</hi> You ſee by his many [<hi>All's</hi>] what care hee hath
of ſincerity. Whereas the Right of their <hi>ſubjection</hi> never
came into play, much leſſ did they profeſſ a renouncing
<hi>all obedience,</hi> but onely in not conforming to the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of another Church. Nor shall hee find one Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer
who affirms that they deny'd <hi>all</hi> ſubjection
due, or diſacknowledg'd the Pope's Headship (though
in ſome things they diſobey'd him) except his welsh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and thoſe of his own ſide who preſume it upon their
own conjecture. And to confute his [<hi>All] Pitſeus</hi> tells
us onely, that <hi>neque in maiori tonſurâ, neque in ritu ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptismatis,
neque in celebratione Paſchatis ſe Romanae Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae
ullâ ratione conformare voluerunt.</hi> Which shows that
there was no talk there of the <hi>Pope's Authority,</hi> but of
<hi>conforming</hi> to <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>cuſtomes.</hi> Yet this the <hi>corroborating</hi>
Bp. there calls an <hi>evident demonſtration,</hi> that I but <hi>trifle</hi>
vainly againſt the teſtimony of <hi>Dionothus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, in caſe this British Clergy which made theſe laws
had renounced the Pope's Authority: Let us ſee what
cauſe hee had to brag of them. <hi>S. Bede, l. 2. c.</hi> 2. calls
them <hi>unfaithfull, naughty and deteſtable people.</hi> Their
own Country man, <hi>Gildas,</hi> ſayes they were <hi>wolues, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of truth, and friends to lies, enemies of God, and not
Prieſts, marchants of miſchief and not Bp's, impugners of
Chriſt and not his Miniſters, more worthy to bee drawn to
Priſon, than to Preiſthood.</hi> And the Bp's dear friend, <hi>Iohn
Fox,</hi> tell us, out of an old Chronicle, (<hi>Acts l. 2. p.</hi> 114.)
that <hi>all things, whether they pleaſed or diſpleaſed Cod, they
regarded alike; &amp;, not onely ſecular men did this, but their
Bishops and Teachers without diſtinction.</hi> Thus my Ld D.
hath again <hi>corroborated</hi> the Proteſtant cauſe by crying
<hi>Hail Brethren well met,</hi> to thoſe folks who have been
proved to bee deteſtable fellows and enemies of God,
that is, as good as Atheiſts: of which gang if this <hi>Dinoth</hi>
                     <pb n="552" facs="tcp:115675:286"/>
were one, wee shall neither wish the Pope ſuch friends,
nor enuy them to the Proteſtants. And this may ſerue
for another of the Bp's <hi>demonſtrations</hi> againſt the Pope,
to vindicate his Church from Schiſm, and ſecure his
Readers from damnation, (which hee acknowledges
due to that vice;) by their relying on ſuch proofs, and
adhering to ſuch good company.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant that there is a thing, call'd an <hi>Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>

Replies.</head>
                  <p>MY Lord of <hi>Derry</hi> undertook to prove three things
in his 6th Chapter: firſt, that the King &amp; Church
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:115675:286"/>
of England had <hi>ſufficient Authority</hi> to withdraw their
obedience from the <hi>Roman Patriarch.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, that they
had <hi>iuſt Grounds to do it;</hi> and 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, that they did it with
<hi>due moderation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I objected, that this was to shuffle away the whole
queſtion. For, whereas the queſtion is of the Priviledge
given by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and from him deſcended to
the Pope's his ſucceſſours; that is, whereas our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
is about a <hi>Papall</hi> Authority, or that of the Head
of God's Church, held by us and by themſelves former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bee of faith, and of divine Inſtitution; hee leaves
this to talk of a <hi>Patriarchall</hi> Authority, not held as from
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> but of humane Inſtitution. By which ſleight hee
tacitly intimates that the Authority actually in force in
England at the time of the Reformation, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
was onely Patriarchall, not Papall: which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
the main, if not the whole charge, and is plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to the whole world's eyes at that time.</p>
                  <p>Now, what excuſe brings the Bishop for this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
shuffling, importing no leſſ than the avoiding
the whole queſtion? Hee tells us here p. 30. that <hi>when</hi>
hee <hi>firſt undertook this ſubject hee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceived the great ſtrength
of the Roman ſampſon did lie in his Patriarchate.</hi> By which
words if the Bp. pretends that hee intended to expreſſ
himſelf <hi>finely,</hi> I shall grant it, but if hee ſayes that hee
intended to ſpeak <hi>truly,</hi> I have ſo good an opinion of
thoſe of his own party, that I am confident the moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
and ſimpleſt of them will bee too candid and too wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
to beleeve him. For, how can it bee imagin'd that a
Bp. and ſo well read a man as hee is accounted to bee
should bee ignorant that the Reformers renounc't a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall</hi>
Authority and higher than <hi>Patriarchall,</hi> and that a
<hi>Papall</hi> Authority, that is a Supremacy over the whole
Church in Eccleſiaſticall matters, was held immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before the Reformation or rejection of it. Who knows
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:115675:287"/>
not likewiſe that they ſtand accuſed by us of the fact of
renouncing an Authority far higher than <hi>Patriarchall?</hi>
yet this Bp. <hi>undertaking</hi> that ſubject (that is to <hi>vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>
his Church from Schiſm in renouncing that higher
Authority) pretends <hi>hee conceived that the great ſtrength
of the Roman ſampſon lay in his Patriarchate;</hi> though
hee knows the Patriarchate was held but of <hi>human,</hi> that
Papacy of <hi>divine</hi> Inſtitution; the <hi>Patriarchate</hi> limited to
ſome particular part within God's Church, the <hi>Papacy,</hi>
(which they actually renounced) held to bee univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extended and to have no other bounds or limits but
God's Church; the <hi>Papacy</hi> ſuperior, nay ſupreme; the
<hi>Patriarchate</hi> inferior and ſubordinate to the former. This
is the notion which both the former and preſent world
nay themſelves too had of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> at leaſt ere they
rejected it; which a man would think ſupperadds a great
and manifold increaſe of ſtrength above the other. But
the ſincere Bp. thinks otherwiſe <hi>now,</hi> though in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
book hee confeſſes the Pope had quitted the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall
power, that is, pretended none for theſe laſt
600. years, and here enlargeth it to a 1000. Which shows
that Dr. H. and hee are the <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levy</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
fraternity, and have the ſame fundamentall faults
common to both.</p>
                  <p>But now being taken tardy, and caught running away
from the queſtion, <hi>hee is well contented</hi> (hee ſayes) <hi>to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
over that ſubject,</hi> (to wit his diſgreſſion to the <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate</hi>)
but yet, not but upon <hi>two conditions;</hi> wiſe ones
you may bee ſure. Obſerve by the way, Reader, that
though other diſputants make account it is their duty
and abſolute obligation to ſpeak to the point in hand; in
the Bp. 'tis a courteſy and to bee condeſcended to condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
'tis againſt his nature and inclination to hold
to the queſtion, and therefore wee muſt bribe him to it

                     </gap>bſcribing to the bargain hee propoſes. The firſt
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:115675:287"/>
condition hee requires ere hee will leave of rambling to
a Patriarchate, and come home to the queſtion, is, that
<hi>wee muſt not preſume the Pope is a ſpirituall Monarch wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
proving it.</hi> What hee means by <hi>ſpirituall Monarch</hi>
I know not; 'Tis a word without ſence till it bee expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated:
For, either hee means by <hi>Monarch</hi> a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in whoſe breaſt all concernments of the ſubjects are
put, ſo that his will is a law to diſpoſe of them as hee liſts;
and then wee held not the Pope to bee ſuch a <hi>Monarch;</hi>
for this, however it bee call'd <hi>Monarch,</hi> is indeed flat
<hi>Tyranny:</hi> or elſe, hee means a <hi>Monarch</hi> is the ordinary
chief Governour, and ſuch wee hold the Pope to bee in
the Church, and shall ever preſume hee is ſo, till his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
who actually rebell'd againſt his Authority diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
it. Wee hold on the Governours ſide; your firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
were, before their ſeparation, actually his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
actually they deny'd their ſubjection, and roſe
againſt his Government: 'This actuall riſing againſt him,
this very fact, I ſay, proves you <hi>Rebells;</hi> his former long-enjoy'd
<hi>poſſeſſion</hi> ſtands a proof of his <hi>Right</hi> unles you
evidence and demonſtrate him an vſurper; or, though
none, yet that the Government ought to bee abolish't.
But the Bp. will not hold to the queſtion, unles wee will
grant that when a ſubject riſes againſt a former long poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
Governour, hee shall at pleaſure call the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to account, and oblige him to <hi>prove</hi> his title ere
hee will acknowledge him; and, on the other ſide, that
the ſubject muſt bee freed from all obligation to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his riſing againſt his Governour, or from being
bound to prove that the Authority hee rebell'd againſt
was an uſurpation and unjuſt. Good ſence, but hard law!</p>
                  <p>His ſecond condition ere hee will come to the queſtion
is, that <hi>wee muſt not attempt to make Patriarchall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
to bee Royall Prerogatives,</hi> what hee means by
<hi>Royal Prerogatives,</hi> I know not, there being no deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:115675:288"/>
certainty what <hi>Royalty</hi> is; the notion varying ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to diuerſe countries. But, hee underſtands per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
that a Patriarch shall not bee independe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the King
in Eccleſiaſticall affairs within his own Patriarchate, and
that this is the King's priviledge; to which condition hee
knows no Catholike will ever yeeld any more than to
the former; otherwiſe wee muſt grant that <hi>S. Peter</hi> could
not preach at <hi>Rome,</hi> if <hi>Nero</hi> were a King; not <hi>S. Iames</hi>
at <hi>Hiernſalem</hi> without unkinging <hi>Herod.</hi> Yet the Bp. will
bee even with mee; for, as I will not condeſcend to his
conditions, ſo, on the other ſide, hee neither hath he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retofore,
nor ever will hereafter bee brought to hold to
the queſtion or ſpeak directly to the point; as hath been
ſeen hitherto all along, and shall more particularly bee
ſeen hereafter. Nor will hee long defer his revenge, but
puts it in execution the very next thing hee does; being
aſſured to have demanded ſuch conditions, as should
never bee granted; for,</p>
                  <p>Whereas hee had remou'd the queſtion from a <hi>Papall</hi>
Authority, held of <hi>divine,</hi> to a <hi>Patriarchall</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
but of <hi>human</hi> Inſtitution; not to deſert our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
totally, and to give him fair law, I put the caſe that
the Papall Government had been onely of <hi>human</hi> Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
it ought not to have been rejected unles the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
had been irremediable. I urged that conſidering,
this Head was choſen, in that caſe, to preſerve Vnity in
Religion, and that eternall diſſentions would inevitably
follow upon it's rejection, and a ſeparation of the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
from the reſt of that common-wealth which ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledg'd
that Head, therefore far weightier cauſes muſt
bee expected, or greater abuſes committed, ere, not
onely the perſon, but this very Government should bee
abolish't. Now the matter of fact being evident, and
confeſt that the firſt Reformers conſented with all the
Churches in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:115675:288"/>
their ſubmitting to that Authority, till they began to
reject it; that they acknowledg'd it lawfull, ere they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to diſclame it as unlawfull; that they held none at
that time true Chriſtians but thoſe who agreed, conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and ſubmitted to that Authority; that the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
this Head then was, (as it ſtill is to us) the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Vnity in Government for all Chriſtianity, &amp; as
ſuch then held by them: Likewiſe, it being equally evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
&amp; confeſt that they have now actually renounced
that Authority thus held, acknowledg'd, and ſubmitted
to by all, whom they then deemed Chriſtians, as the
Rule and Ground of all Vnity in that commonwealth:
Theſe things, I ſay, being ſo, I had good reaſon to put
that ſuppoſition, not as our bare <hi>tenet,</hi> (as the Bp. ſeems
to imagin) but as the evident matter of fact, as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
ſtood then. One would think it were the Bp's task
now to show that, notwithſtanding all this, the firſt
Abolishers of this Authority had ſufficient reaſons to
diſannull it; and that the abuſes of the ſayd Authority
did outweigh the right uſe of it, ſo that it might and ought
have been rejected by one part of that Chriſtianity,
though once eſtablisht; or, (which is all one) long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by their common conſent, as this was <hi>de facto.</hi>
What does the Bp.? Hee tells us what hee and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<hi>now held</hi> concerning that point, putting (as it
were) his <hi>counter tenet</hi> to ours, ſayes the Pope is onely
as <hi>a Proclocutor in a Generall Aſſembly,</hi> was their <hi>ſteward,</hi>
that is, not their Governour, (all contrary to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact which my caſe is built on) that <hi>they nourish a
more Catholik-Communion than wee,</hi> and ſuch other ſtuff
all out of his own head, without a word of proof, &amp; then
thinks the deed is done. Was ever ſuch an Anſwer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triu'd?
the <hi>poak-full of plums</hi> was pertinent, if compar'd
to 'this. But ſtill the Bishop is innocent; twas my fault,
who would not accept of the two conditions hee propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:115675:289"/>
which should have been the guerdon of his returning
to the queſtion; that is, without the performance of
which hee thinks himſelf not bound to ſpeak a word to
the purpoſe; And ſo the Reader muſt look upon him
hereafter as on a man who hath got or took licence to
run aſtray.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Reader, in what a different manner the Bp.
&amp; I treat thee. I ſtill bring thee to evident and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
matter of fact, or ſuch ſuppoſitions which need
onely application, and another name to bee ſo, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the caſe ſtood at the time of the firſt breach;
Whereas, the Bp. brings thee his own ſayings, their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's
<hi>tenet</hi> for Grounds and proofs: things not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
but diſputable, nay diſputed in this preſent deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te;
that is, obſcure, as far as concerns this queſtion. And
this is his ſolemn manner all over this treatiſe; which
shows that hee hates the light, his unfriendly betrayer,
but truth's Glory; and, that the obſcurity of ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
is moſt proper and leaſt offenſive to his errour-dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
eyes.</p>
                  <p>I demanded of him whether <hi>hee would condeſcend to the
rejection of Monarchy, and to the extirpation of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for the miſgovernment of Princes, or abuſes of Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi>
Hee anſwers <hi>that never ſuch abuſes as theſe were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
either to Princes or Prelates in England.</hi> Not obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted?
that's ſtrange! Read the <hi>Court of K. Iames,</hi> and
the charge againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> in Weſtminſter Hall.
Did not the <hi>Scots</hi> and Puritans object Popery, intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pride, and overburthening weak conſciences to your
Brother Bp's. Can there bee greater abuſes objected than
theſe in your Grounds? or is not the deſign to bring in
Popery (which makes ſuch a noiſe in your book, as a
Pandera's box of all miſchiefs and inconveniences) as
horrid an accuſation againſt you, as the ſame inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
were againſt Popery when it ſtood on foot in K.
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:115675:289"/>
H's daies. I was told by a worthy grave perſon and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
candour I have no reaſon to ſuſpect, that in a priuate
diſcourſe hee had with the late Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
in his own garden concerning the point of Schiſm,
the Arch-Bishop confeſt, upon his urging the evident
matter of fact, that hee was in a Schiſm; upon which
free confeſſion of his, being preſt again by that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
how hee could in conſcience remain in a Schiſm and
ſeparated from God's Church, hee reply'd that it might
lawfully bee done if warranted by an intention to reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
by ſuch compliance a ſchiſmatizing Congregation to
the Body it broke from: citing to make good his plea, a
place from <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> in reference to ſome Catholike
Bishops complying with the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> for the ſame end.
Now, I ask, whether in caſe the Arch-Bishop had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to bring in Popery, Epiſcopacy (held to bee
of divine right) ought therefore to bee abolisht? If bee
anſwer; No, (as I ſuppoſe his intereſt will prevail above
his Grounds to make him) then I ask again why an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
actuall power, to wit, Epiſcopacy, should not bee
held to merit abolishing for Popery's ſake; and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it ſo fraught with inconveniences, which Popery,
(ſo full alas! of grievances) though held immediately
before equally of divine Inſtitution, and of far higher
Authority, deſerved to bee abolish't for it's own ſake,
as accompany'd with the ſayd grievances!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Bp. tells us that <hi>they ſeek not extirpation
of the Papacy, but the reducing it to the primitive conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
which is as good ſence, as to give a manabox on the
ear, and then tell him you intend not to ſtrike him.
They have already totally extirpated it in England, in
ſuch ſort as all the world ſees and acknowledges the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
hath not the leaſt influence upon the English Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
over which before hee had the greateſt; yet, they
hope to bee taken for moderate men, as long as they
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:115675:290"/>
ſpeak courteous non-ſence and tell us, <hi>they ſeek not to
extirpate it.</hi> Thus the Bp. wanders from the purpoſe; but
ſtill all is my fault who would not grant him his <hi>two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee tells us that <hi>Monarchy and Epiſcopacy
are of divine Inſtitution, ſo is not,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>a Papall
ſoueraignty of Iuriſdiction.</hi> That <hi>Monarchy</hi> should bee of
<hi>divine Inſtitution,</hi> I much wonder, ſurely the <hi>Venetians</hi>
and <hi>Hollanders</hi> are in a ſad caſe then, who thus continue
without relenting to break one of God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
eſpecially, their Brethren, the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who
renounced the Monarchicall Government of the King
of <hi>Spain.</hi> But the learned Bp. hath ſome text or other
in Scripture which hee interprets onely according to
Grammar and Dictionary-learning without ever loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
into Politicks, the ſcience which concerns ſuch
points &amp; paſſages; which would have taught him that
Government was inſtituted for the good of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and, that, ſince human affairs are ſubject to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
mutability and change, it happens that in ſome
countries and ſome circumſtances one form of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nment
is convenient, in others another, according as it
happens to bee beſt for the Governed: which comes to
this that no particular form of Government is of <hi>divine
Inſtitution,</hi> and conſtituted to endure ever, ſeing the
end to which all Government is directed, the good of
the Governed, is mutable and changeable.</p>
                  <p>As for the next part of his third excuſe that <hi>the Pope's</hi>
Authority or Headship in Iuriſdiction <hi>is not of divine
Inſtitution, as Epiſcopacy is;</hi> you ſee 'tis his old trick;
onely his own bare ſaying, and which is worſe, ſaying
over again the very point in diſpute between us. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas,
the point which wee urge here is a plain matter of
fact, that thoſe who firſt renounc't the Papall Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
held immediately before they renounc't it as firmly
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:115675:290"/>
that it was <hi>divine Inſtitution,</hi> as the Proteſtants do of
Epiſcopacy now; and therefore ought to have renounc't
it, upon the pretended preſſure of inconveniencies, no
more than Epiſcopacy ought to bee abolish't upon the
like inconveniences. Nay more, the firſt Reformers ere
they grew newfangled and chang'd their mind, held it
much more firmly; for they held it a point of faith, and
abhorr'd all them who renounc't it as Schiſmaticks and
Hereticks both; whereas the Proteſtants acknowledge
the <hi>Huguenots</hi> of <hi>France</hi> for Brothers, who yet deny Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,
which the Bp. tells us upon another occaſion is
<hi>of divine Inſtitution.</hi> But, 'tis all one with the Proteſtants
whether they renounce all <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Inſtitutions or no; if
they do but hate <hi>Rome;</hi> they are ſaints and Brothers.
The common faction againſt the Pope is more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to unite them, than the profeſſed and obſtinate reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<hi>Chriſt's</hi> ordinances, is to diſunite them. As for his
<hi>Bravado</hi> how rarely hee could iuſtify his Parliamentary
Prelacy, what weak performances it would afford were
it put to triall, may bee judged from his numerous and
enormous contradictions in this preſent treatiſe, bragg'd
on by the Proteſtants to bee his Maſter peece.</p>

HIs ſixth ſection pretends to vindicate his Grounds

violently importunate with the Reader bidding him <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

ſtuff throughout this whole Section.</p>
                  <p>It begins, <hi>we are now come to the Grounds of our ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

Which, if it bee not as foul and uncouth an one as errour
could hatch, and obſtinate Schiſm maintain, you shall
pay but pence a peece to ſee it, and ſay I have abus'd
you too.</p>
                  <p>The charge againſt the Proteſtants was this, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
by undeniable matter of <hi>fact;</hi> that they had rejected
the acknowledgment of <hi>S. Peters,</hi> and his ſucceſſours,
(the Pope's) Headhip over God's Church; and that
they had receded from this Rule of faith, that nothing
is to bee adhered to, as of faith, but what was inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
(that is <hi>immediately delivered</hi>) by their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as the doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles? That
they renounced the former is manifeſt by the whole
worlds and their own Confeſſion; That they renounced
the latter, is no leſſ manifeſt, by the ſame undeniable
atteſtation; and indeed out of the very word <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which ſignifies a <hi>not immediate delivery.</hi> It is no leſſ
evident that the acknowledgment of the former, both
was at the time of the Reformation, and now is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Vnity in Government to thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the ſee of <hi>Rome;</hi> that is, to all the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
they themſelves communicated with, or were uni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:115675:291"/>
to, before they broke; for, 'tis as viſible as the ſun
at nonday, that <hi>France, Spain, Portugal, Italy,</hi> &amp;c.
conſent and center in a ioynt acknowledgment of the
Pope's Headship, and are therefore held by Proteſtants,
Puritans, and all contrary ſects for Papiſt Countreys.
It is evident likewiſe that the acknowledgment of the
latter was, and is to the ſayd Churches the Principle of
Vnity in faith, for they ever held the living voice of the
Church, that is, the <hi>immediate Tradition</hi> or delivery of
Paſtours and forefathers an infallible Rule of faith; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore,
'it is unavoidably conſequent that the Proteſtants
diſſenting from, and diſagreeing in both the ſayd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
in which theſe then-fellow-<hi>Churches</hi> conſented
and agreed, were and are ſeparated from all thoſe <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
and all that belong to thoſe <hi>Churches:</hi> And this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the two ſayd Principles. Again, ſince nothing
can bee more eſſentiall to a <hi>Church</hi> than that which is the
Rule, and Root of Vnity both in faith and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it follows that the Proteſtants diſſenting in both
and acting accordingly, that is, having ſeparated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to both, ſeparated and broke from the former
<hi>Church,</hi> conſiſting of thoſe Churches thus united, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Eſſentialls and fundamentalls of a <hi>Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
Now then after all this, as evident as that two ad three
make five, to wave anſwering this true charge, that they
broke by this double diſſent from all thoſe <hi>Churches,</hi> and
to make as though they ſeparated from the <hi>Court of</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
onely and to defend themſelves as breaking onely
from that <hi>Court,</hi> is to ſay, that none hold thoſe two
Principles but onely the <hi>Court of Rome;</hi> which (to ſpeak
moderately (is perfect Impudence, the moſt proper and
characteriſticall expreſſion of this Bp's manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;

                     <pb n="564" facs="tcp:115675:292"/>
I shall deſire the Reader to conſider once again the
true charge, for otherwiſe it is impoſſible hee should
iudge of the ſufficiency or inſufficiency of their Grounds
for ſeparation; as likewiſe to reflect that, though hee
pretend here they had ſufficient Grounds, yet hee thinks
it not ſafe to ſpeak out to the point (as I urged him he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retofore)
nor tell us whether thoſe Grounds of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
bee demonſtrative, that is apt to infer with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſity, <hi>therefore the Authority was an vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not come from Chriſt;</hi> or, though come from
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet, for thoſe reaſons, <hi>to bee rejected:</hi> nor dares
hee confeſſ that they are onely probable, yet ſufficient:
For, if <hi>probable</hi> reaſons were ſufficient to abolish an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as an vſurpation, held, till thoſe reaſons appear'd,
to have been of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution; what Government
in the world could ſtand? Nor laſtly, that there is a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
ſort of proof between demonſtration and Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that is, above a <hi>may bee,</hi> yet below a <hi>muſt bee,</hi> which
can convince ſufficiently the underſtanding and oblige
it to an <hi>aſſent</hi> contrary to it's former faith. Theſe points
are of too hard digeſtion for verb <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ll ſouls, and come ſo
neer the firſt Principles, that they would quickly end
this and all Controverſies, should they come to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ſcann'd. Wherefore, as before hee totally omitted
to anſwer thoſe words of mine which preſt him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himſelf in that point; ſo, here, conſtant to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
hee abſolutely declines to inform us what kinde
of proofs they muſt bee; onely hee calls them <hi>Grounds,</hi>
&amp; ſayes they are <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>ſufficient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His pretended <hi>Grounds</hi> I reduce to three generall
Heads: ſome of them entrench upon Eternity &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:
ſome urge onely temporall inconveniences;
Laſtly, ſome are of a middle nature, and pretend to
more knowledge of <hi>Right.</hi>

and equally competent for any Heretick in the
world to object againſt the Church in a like occaſion;
that is, are no wayes proper or ſerviceable to his cauſe.
For, may not any Heretick voluntarily object that the
Church impos'd <hi>new Articles of faith</hi> upon him, when
hee had a mind to beleeve or hold nothing of faith, but
what agreed with his own fancy? Might not hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of <hi>new creeds</hi> impos'd, when the Church, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of new emergent hereſies, added to her publick
Profeſſions ſome points of faith (held ſo formerly) which
might diſtinguish her old friends from up ſtart foes?
Might not hee complain of Perill of Idolatry, as your
Brother Puritans did for ſurpliſſes, and your reform'd
Communion-table, when hee had a mind to deny that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> was more than a man as did the <hi>Arians,</hi> or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
any decent or rationall practice in God's Church;
might not hee pretend that all Hereticks and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
in the world were good Chriſtians, and that the
Church was tyrannicall in holding them for excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate?
Might not hee shuffle together faith with opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and alledge falſly, as you doe here, you were <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to approve the Pope's rebellion againſt generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
and <hi>taking Oaths to maintain vſurpation of the Pope;</hi>
whenas, you know and confeſſ your ſelf, one may bee
of our Church, and yet neither hold the Pope above the
Council nor accept of ſuch <hi>Oaths (Iuſt</hi> vindic. p. 200.)
Again, all theſe Exceptions you produce are the very
points you pretend to diſpute againſt us; wherefore it
depends upon the goodnes of your reaſons, whether tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
Articles pretended to bee new were indeed ſuch, and
endangering Idolatry, or no; in iudging which concer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning
points <hi>Fancy</hi> muſt bee allow'd to paſſ no verdict
onely rigour of <hi>reaſon,</hi> that is, <hi>demonſtration,</hi> can bee
preſumed ſufficient to render points, held formely by
themſelves, and their immediate forefathers as of faith,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:115675:293"/>
ſacred and <hi>Chriſt's</hi> doctrine, to bee obnoxious to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of new, falſe and Idolatrous. Yet nothing is
more evident than that you have no ſuch reaſons, for
our Drs have vindicated theſe very points againſt your
Reformers, in ſuch a manner, that (to ſpeak much wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hin
compaſſ) the unpaſſionate part of the world never
imagin'd you have carried the cauſe clearly, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
deciſively againſt us; which is an Evidence, that
you have not evidenced againſt us, nor demonſtrated
the counter Authority upon which you build your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<hi>tenet.</hi> To omit that the Evidence of our Churches
Authority hath been pretended by our late Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
and as yet unreply'd upon by your party; nay that
your own beſt writers confeſſ you have nothing but <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ability</hi>
wheron to Ground your faith. All which shows
the vanity of your pretended fear of Idolatry, and new
points of faith, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludes your breach temerarious and
irrationall. And as for your fear of ſeparating from the
Communion of three parts of that which you call <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome,</hi>
it shall bee shown hereafter (<hi>Sect.</hi> 10) from
your own ſide, that you had ten times more Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
even with that in materiall points, when you were
in our Church, than you can pretend to have had ſince.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond ſort of Grounds are thoſe which relate to
temporall inconveniences, and injuries to the civill ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
by reaſon of the Pope's pretended encroachments;
againſt all which hee hath told us before (p. 21.) that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Catholike countries have laws in force; that is,
that men may remain Catholiks without holding, nay
reſiſting thoſe pretended encroachments; and tells us
here p. 36. that <hi>al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> other Catholike countries maintain their
priviledges inviolated.</hi> Yet theſe pretended inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
hee huddles together in big terms, and puts them
for a ground of their ſeparation from our Church, in
which Church yet hee confeſſes they might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:115675:293"/>
ſtill in union, and have ſtood out againſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Now whether many of theſe were <hi>Abuſes</hi> or <hi>juſt Rights</hi>
hee knows is diſputable between cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and civil Lawyers;
of which kinde of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſy I neither think my ſelf nor
the Bp. a competent iudge, ſince this kind of learning
is not our proper profeſſion. Yet hee will needs have mee
engage into ſuch queſtions, nothing concerning our
preſent quarell, which is about a point of <hi>faith,</hi> not a
point of <hi>law.</hi> Our queſtion is whether theſe Exceptions
of his were ſufficient Grounds of renouncing the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
it ſelf, and ſeparating from the former Church. That
they were not, I show.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thoſe inconveniences hee reckons up, as <hi>extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
vſurpations of more than belong'd to them, cauſing
animoſities between the crown and the miter,</hi> &amp;c. though
they had been true, are evidently <hi>abuſes</hi> of the <hi>Officer</hi>
and argue no fault in the <hi>Office</hi> it ſelf of Head of the
Church, nor that the <hi>Right uſe</hi> of it ought therefore to
bee taken away.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſome of thoſe pretended <hi>Abuſes</hi> are his own
deductions onely; as that it is <hi>againſt the right ends of
Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction;</hi> which hee endeavours not to
show evidently out of the ſcience of Politicks, which is
proper to thoſe matters, nor any thing elſe of this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re;
but out of two or perhaps three matters of fact which
onely inferr'd that it happen'd ſo ſometimes; and then
by the ſame reaſon Epiſcopacy and all the Offices in
the world muſt bee abolish't and abrogated.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that ſome of thoſe pretended <hi>Abuſes</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſuch, and not rather juſt <hi>Rights.</hi> hee no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves;
for hee onely puts down that ſuch and ſuch things
were done, but whether rightfully or no I preſume hee
will not think himſelf ſuch a rare <hi>Iuris vtriuſque Doctor,</hi>
as to make a fit umpire to decide law quarrells of this
highe'ſt nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And, on the other ſide, none is ignorant
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:115675:294"/>
that either party had learned lawiers for them to avouch
their pretences. I omit that the Kings were worſted ſo
metimes and renounc't their pretence, as in that of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtitures.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the temporall laws hee cites, conclude not
evidently a <hi>Right;</hi> for, it is as eaſy for a Canon-lawier
to object that the temporall laws wrong the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
as it is for civill lawiers to ſay that the Eccleſiaſticall
wrong theirs; but with this diſadvantage to the latter
that reaſon gives more particular reſpect and charines
ought to bee uſed in diſannulling or retrenching Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
laws, than temporall, by how much they are
neerer ally'd to the Church, and by conſequence to the
order of mankinde to Beatitude.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, hee abuſes thoſe pretended Abuſes moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionably;
ſaying, that <hi>the Pope uſurp't moſt unjuſtly
all Right, civill, Eccleſiaſticall, ſacred, prophane, of all
orders of men, Kings, Nobles, Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. Which is
ſuch a loud-mouth'd calumnie; ſuch a far-ſtretching fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that it is as big as all Chriſtendome. For, by
this, no man in the Church was maſter or owner of his
own Kingdome, Eſtate, houſe, nay not of the very
bread hee eat, but by the Pope's good leave. Thus the
Bishop in a fury of Schiſm runs himſelf out of breath;
nor will any thing pacify him or bring him into temper
to ſpeak a word of truth or ſence, but my granting him
his two conditions, that is my denying my own <hi>tenet,</hi>
which I am defending.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, grant all thoſe Abuſes had been true; was the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
no other remedy but <hi>diviſion?</hi> Had not the ſecular
Governours the sword in their hand? did it not ly in their
power to chuſe whether they would admit or no things
deſtructive to their Rights? yes: for the Bp. tells us p.
36. that <hi>All other Catholike countries,</hi> (which hee knows
held the Pope's ſupremacy, as well as <hi>England) do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:115675:294"/>
their own Priviledges inviolated:</hi> And, as for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
hee tells us, in a ſlovenly phraſe, that <hi>our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
were not ſo ſtupid as to ſitt ſtill, and blow their noſes;</hi>
meaning that they did the ſame which other Catholike
countries did; ſo that, according to himſelf, there was
a <hi>remedy</hi> ſtill, and <hi>a means to keep their priviledges invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, put caſe, theſe temporall inconveniences
had not been otherwiſe remediable, I conceive there is
not a good Chriſtian in the world that underſtands what
a Church is, will ſay that Eccleſiaſticall Communion is
to bee broken for all the temporall concernments ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable:
For, firſt, that the well being and peace of a
Church cannot conſiſt without Vnity, is ſo evident, that
the very terms would convince him of a contradiction
who should deny it; ſince diſtraction and diſſention, (the
parents of diſſolution and ruine) muſt needs bee where
there is no <hi>Vnity.</hi> Secondly, not onely the well being of
a Church, but the very <hi>Being</hi> of it conſiſts in it's <hi>Vnity;</hi>
for what ſcholler knows not that things of this nature
have no other <hi>Vnity,</hi> (nor conſequently <hi>Entity</hi> or <hi>Being</hi>)
but that of order, that is of Superiority and ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Whence follows, that, if this <hi>Order</hi> bee broken,
which is done by diſacknowledging the former Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
chief Magiſtrate, the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the Church is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolu'd,
that is, her <hi>Entity</hi> is annihilated, that is, there is
<hi>no one</hi> Church, that is, there is <hi>no</hi> Church. This act
then of yours ſince it diſſolu'd that which was the chief
bond of <hi>Vnity</hi> in the former Church, was in it's own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
deſtructive, of a Church. A miſchief which out-weighs
the neceſſity of remedying the higheſt temporall
inconveniences imaginable. Thirdly, ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> came
from heaven to plant a Church, and the <hi>Being</hi> of a
Church conſiſt in <hi>Order,</hi> it follows that <hi>Chriſt</hi> inſtituted
the <hi>Order</hi> of the Church; otherwiſe hee had not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:115675:295"/>
a Church; that is, hee had not done what hee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to do: Wherefore that fact which breaks the <hi>Order</hi>
of the Church, and that in the higheſt manner by diſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledging
the higheſt Magiſtrate in the Church, is by
good conſequence in the higheſt manner againſt <hi>Chriſt's</hi>
Inſtitution and command, that is, in the higheſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>ſinfull</hi> and criminall; and ſo, no temporall inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
can bee a competent plea for ſuch a fact; ſince
no temporall inconvenience can bee a ſufficient reaſon
for a man to <hi>ſin.</hi> Fourthly, if the Communion of a
Church may bee broken for temporall miſcarriages it
follows that all the generall Councils were to no purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe;
ſince whenſoever the obſervation of theſe generall
Councils hapens to bee inconvenient to the temporall
ſtate, that is, ſute not with the humours of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but are likely to breed combuſtion, the remedying
the temporall ills (according to the Bp.) ought to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway.
The conſequence is evident; for general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
cannot bee more ſacred than the Communion of
the Church, ſince they are the effects of it; or rather,
indeed, they have their form and Eſſence from this
Communion. Since then this fact of theirs as appears
by the charge broke Church Communion, and by the
Bishop's plea, becauſe of temporall inconveniences, they
may for the ſame and with better reaſon break Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
too, and there's an end of all.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>faith,</hi> that is, the ſupernaturall knowledge
of God, is ſo eſſentially neceſſary for the ſalvation of
mankinde, that no worldly conſideration ought to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
it. Now then ſince faith, if <hi>not one</hi> is <hi>none;</hi> nor can
it bee preſeru'd <hi>one</hi> but by ſome certain <hi>Rule</hi> to keep it
<hi>one,</hi> it follows that no temporall miſchief can deſerve a
remedy accompany'd with the renouncing this certain
Rule of faith: Wherefore, temporall inconveniences
cannot with any face bee alledg'd by a Chriſtian who
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:115675:295"/>
held formerly no certain Rule of faith but the living voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of the preſent Church, that is immediate Tradition
(as did the firſt Reformers) for a plea for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the ſaid Rule of faith; which brings faith to an
<hi>uncertainty,</hi> that is, to a <hi>nullity,</hi> or no obligation of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any thing to bee of faith. Yet this former Rule of
faith, the firſt Reformers renounc't, when they renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Pope's Headship recommended by that Rule.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the matter of fact not onely charges you to
have rejected the Rules of Vnity in faith and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Church you left, and by conſequence (ſince
both then and now you acknowledge her a true Church)
broke Church Communion, but it is alſo equally evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that your Grounds ſince have left the Church no
Rule of either, but have ſubſtituted <hi>opinion</hi> in ſtead of
<hi>faith,</hi> or obſcurity of Grammaticall quibbling in ſtead
of <hi>Evidence of Authority,</hi> and <hi>Anarchy</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nment.</hi>
For, the Rule of faith if the former Church was
ſo eaſy and certain a method of coming to <hi>Chriſt's</hi> law
that none that had reaſon could bee either ignorant or
doubtfull of it; what eaſier than Children to beleeve as
they were taught, and practice as they were shownd.
What more impoſſible than for fathers to conſpire to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
errour or malice, in teaching their Children what
was moſt evident to them by daily practice of their who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
lives to have been their immediately foregoing fathers
doctrine, and was moſt important to their and their
Children's endles bliſſ or miſery? And, what more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
than that they who proceed upon this principle,
(as Catholikes do) will alwaies continue, and ever did
to deliver &amp; embrace what was held formerly; that is,
to conſerve true faith. Now in ſtead of this, though the
Proteſtants will tell us ſometimes upon occaſion that
they hold to Tradition and at preſent beleeve their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
forefathers, yet if wee goe backward to King H.
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:115675:296"/>
the 8th's time, their chain of <hi>immediate delivery</hi> is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and at an end, (the Reformation, which they
own, broke that, and shows their recourſe to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a falſe
hearted pretence) ours goes on ſtill: Whether run they
then finding themſelves at a loſſ here, for an eaſy, open,
and certain method of faith. Why, they turn your wits
a woolgathering into a wildernes of words in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
ask them for a certain method to know the true
ſence of it; they'l tell you, 'tis plain, or that you need
no more but a Grammar and a dictionary to find out a
faith; nay leſſ, and that common people, who neither
underſtand what Grammar nor dictionary means, may
find it there, though our eyes teſtify that all the world is
together by the ears about underſtanding the ſence of
it. Ask them for a certain interpreter; perhaps ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
they will anſwer you faintly that the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and fathers are one; that is, you muſt run over Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries
ere you can rationally embrace any faith at all;
and, if you bee ſo ſincere to your nature, reaſon, as to
look for certainty which books are legitimate <hi>fathers,</hi>
which not; which Councils generall, authentick, and to
bee beleeved, which not? you are engag'd again to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
all the School-diſputes, &amp; Controverſies which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
thoſe queſtions. And, if you repine at the endles la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriouſnes
of the task, the inſecurity of the method,
and the uncertainty of the iſſue, and urge them for ſome
other certainer, shorter, and plainer way of finding
faith; they will reply at length, and confeſſ, as their beſt
Champions, <hi>Chillingworth</hi> and <hi>Faulkland</hi> do very can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly,
that there is no <hi>certainty</hi> of faith, but <hi>probability</hi>
onely; which ſignifies that no man can rationally bee a
Chriſtian, or have any obligation to beleeve any thing;
ſince it is both moſt irrationall and impoſſible there
should bee any oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion to <hi>aſſent</hi> upon a <hi>probability.</hi>
And thus, Reader, thou ſe eſt what paſſ they bring <hi>faith</hi>
                     <pb n="573" facs="tcp:115675:296"/>
and it's <hi>Vnity</hi> to; to wit, to a perfect nullity and totall
ruin.</p>
                  <p>Next, as for <hi>Government,</hi> let us ſee whether they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
left any <hi>Vnity</hi> of that in God's Church! That which
was held for God's Church by them, while they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
with us were thoſe Churches onely in Communion
with the ſee of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Vnity of Government in this
Church was evident, and known to all in what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
to wit, in the common acknowledment of the
Bishop of Rome as it's Head. Since they left that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they have got new Brothers, and ſiſters, whom
before they accounted Baſtards and Aliens: ſo that,
God's Church now, according to them, is made up of
<hi>Greeks, Lutherans, Huguenots;</hi> perhaps <hi>Socinians, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſbyterians,
Adamites, Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. For they give no
Ground, nor have any certain Rule of faith to diſcern
which are of it, which not. But wee will pitch upon their
acknowledg'd favourites. Firſt the Church of <hi>England</hi>
holds the <hi>King</hi> the Head of their Church. Next the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> (whom they own for dear Brothers, and
part of God's Church) hold neither King, nor yet Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop,
but the Preſbyte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y onely: ſtrange Vnity which
ſtands in terms of contradiction! Thirdly, the Papiſts
are accounted by them, leſt they should ſpoil their own
Miſſion, part of God's Church too; and theſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
noe Head but the <hi>Pope.</hi> Fourthly, the <hi>Lutherans</hi>
are a part of their kind hearted Church; and, amongſt
them, for the moſt part, each parish-Miniſter is Head
of his Church or Parish, without any ſubordination to
any higher Eccleſiaſticall Governour. Laſtly the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church is held by them another part, and it acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
no Head but the <hi>Patriarch</hi> I omit thoſe ſects who
own no Government at all. (Is not this now a brave Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
where there are five diſparate forms of Government,
which ſtand aloof, and at arms end with one another,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:115675:297"/>
without any commonty to unite or connect them? Let
them not toy it now, as they uſe, and tell us of an
union of charity; our diſcourſe is about an Vnity of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
either then let him show that God's Church,
as caſt in this mold, has an <hi>Vnity</hi> within the limits and

to ſome one ſort of Government either acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
to have been inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or agreed on by

or elſe, let him confeſſ that this Church thus patch't up,
has no Vnity in Government at all. Wee will do the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop
a greater favour, and give him leave to ſet aſide the
french Church and the reſt, and onely reflect upon the
form of Government they ſubſtituted to that which they
rejected; to wit, that the <hi>King,</hi> or temporall power,
should bee <hi>ſupreme in Eccleſiaſticall Affairs.</hi> Bee it ſo
then, and that each particular pretended Church in the
world were thus govern'd, wee ſee that they of <hi>England</hi>
under their King, would make one Church; they of
<hi>Holland,</hi> under their <hi>Hogen Moghen</hi> Magiſtrates ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<hi>France</hi> under it's King a third, and ſo all the reſt
of the countries in the world. Many Churches wee ſee
here indeed in thoſe Grounds, and many diſtinct inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Governours; but where is there any Vnity of
Government for the <hi>whole?</hi> where is there any ſupreme
Governour, or Governours to whom all are bound to
ſubmit, and conform themſelves in the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of the Church? Or, without this, how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
there should bee any Vnity of Government or a
<hi>Church,</hi> that is, a thing connected, united, or made <hi>one</hi>
by <hi>Order,</hi> or by <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Government?</hi> The Church is
God's <hi>Family;</hi> can that bee calld a <hi>Family,</hi> where mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
independent perſons live in ſeverall rooms of the

or Miſtreſſ of the houſe, or ſome perſon, or perſons
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:115675:297"/>
higher than the reſt, by ſubordination to whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
united or made <hi>one.</hi> The Church is a <hi>City,</hi> whoſe
<hi>Vnity</hi> is in it ſelf: can that bee calld a <hi>City,</hi> where each

the notion of <hi>Governed;</hi> by which means thoſe many
otherwiſe <hi>wholes</hi> become now <hi>parts</hi> and make up one

<hi>Common-wealth;</hi> can there bee a Common-wealth which

Perhaps, the Bp. will reply, that a <hi>generall Council</hi> is
acknowledg'd by them as of obligatory Authority; and
that, therefore, there is yet a means left for Vnity of
Government in the whole Church. Vpon which anſwer
the good Proteſtant Reader thinks them humble and
reaſonable men. But this is indeed the greateſt mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that can bee invented. For, firſt, they give us no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rule to know which is a generall Council, which
not, that is who are to bee call'd to that Council, who
not; for once taking away a certain Rule of faith, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is no certainty who are Hereticks, that is, men not
to bee call'd to a Council as to ſit in it and vote; who
good Catholiks, that is, to bee call'd thither to ſit and
vote there. Next, generall Councils being onely call'd
upon extremities, if the Churche's Vnity in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
conſiſt onely in them, it follows that the Church
hath actually no Vnity of Government but juſt at that
pinch when a generall Council is to bee call'd; that is,
it is never a <hi>Church,</hi> but at that happy time onely, when
it is moſt unhappy. But, the greateſt piece of foolery is,
that, they having renounc't an actuall ſtanding Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
pretend (to show their goodnes,) a readines to
ſubmit to the Authority of a generall Council, which
themſelves will acknowledge with the next breath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to bee had; that is, they profeſſ themſelves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
humbly and heartily ready, though they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't
one Government, yet to ſubmit to another,
which can never bee, and ſo is never likely to trouble
or controll them. Is not this a piece of hollow hearted
humility. Yet that ſuch Councils as they will daign to
call <hi>generall</hi> are held by them impoſſible, Dr. H. tells
us <hi>Reply</hi> p. 30. in thoſe words, <hi>generall Councils are now
morally impoſſible to bee had, the Chriſtian world being
under ſo many Empires, and divided into ſo many Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
that it is not viſible to the eye of man, how they should

diſcourſe aſſerted; to wit, that God's Church, as they
have form'd it, is ſo divided into diſparate parts, that,
as there is no Vnity of Government in it now, (for if
there were, there would bee alſo a means to aſſemble a
generall Council) ſo it is impoſſible there should bee
any for the future according to their Grounds, till ſome
one temporall Governour come to Lord it ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
or greateſt part of the Chriſtian world, which in all
likelihood will bee never. Conſider again their candour,
they have renounc't the former notion of God's Church,
and his Authority whoſe proper office it was to call a
generall Council of that whole Church, as hee did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and then profeſſ a willingnes to ſubmit to ſuch a
Council, or a Repreſentative of their new notion'd
Church; but, with the next breath, lament (alas) that
ſuch a generall Council, or Repreſentative cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
bee had, (after themſelves had taken order to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all means of having it) and ſo they are free and need
obey no body. How much better and ſtronger were it
argued thus; that, ſince it is moſt irrationall and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming
God's Providence, that his Church should bee
deſtitute of a means to remedy her extremities, that is;
of means to gather a generall Council, and that there
was a means to doe this before you rejected the Pope's
Authority, and by your own Confeſſion no poſſibility
of it ſince; that therefore, you have renounced the right
notion of a <hi>Church,</hi> and the right <hi>Government</hi> of that
Church.</p>
                  <p>This then is our totall charge againſt you; that you
have broke the Vnity of the former <hi>Church,</hi> (and not
of the <hi>Court</hi> onely, as you trifle it) which you were in,
by renouncing thoſe Principles in which conſiſted her
<hi>Vnity</hi> both in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and to which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
the whole Church, you broke from, conſented.
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:115675:299"/>
Thus far the matter of fact evidences. Nor is it leſſ evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that you have ſubſtituted no <hi>certain Rule of faith,</hi>
nor any <hi>certain</hi> or <hi>particular form of Government;</hi> which
can ground an Vnity, to your new fashion'd Church in
either reſpect, but, that you have turn'd <hi>Evidence of
Authority</hi> (the onely certain Rule and Root of faith)
into a drowſy <hi>probability;</hi> and, by conſequence, <hi>faith</hi>
thus grounded, into <hi>Opinion;</hi> as, likewiſe, that you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
turn'd the former <hi>Government</hi> of the Church into a
perfect Anarchy; there being no colligation or Vnity of
the whole together, ty any by of Government; and that
(had not God's mercy been above your malice) you
had made the Church, our <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which is built as
a City at Vnity with it ſelf, (that is which hath an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Government) an <hi>heap of ſtones;</hi> without, conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion,
without <hi>order,</hi> and conſequently without <hi>being</hi>
which conſiſted in that <hi>Order.</hi> This is your crime, in this
lies your ſinfull guilt of Schiſm and hereſy, that your
<hi>fact</hi> and <hi>tenet</hi> is intrinſecally deſtructive to the very <hi>being</hi>
of God's Church, and that it tears and rents it peece-meal
all aſunder. A miſchief equally pernicious to man-kind's
attaining Beatitude, as the renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing the ſupreme
Government in a Kingdome or commonwealth would
bee in order to their ſafe enjoyment of their temporall
livelihoods; and, therefore, no waies to bee ballanced
or excuſed by alledging temporall inconveniences; ſince
it as far ouerpoiſes it's excuſe as Eternity of bliſſ does a
peece of earth; that is, infinitely.</p>
                  <p>His third ſort of Grounds, is <hi>the weaknes of the Pope's
pretences, and the exemption of the Britannick Churches
from forrain Iuriſdiction by the Council of Epheſus.</hi> For the
fitſt, the Bp. never ſo much as directly mentions that in
which wee place the ſtrength of the Pope's pretence, of
his ſupreme Authority, much leſſe impugnes it, ſave
onely a little on the by (as it were) in his ſleight way:
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:115675:299"/>
'tis this, that it was held and deliver'd by a world of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
fathers to ſons as from their fathers, &amp; ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
as from Chriſt, that this Authority was ſacred, of
Chriſt's Inſtitution, of faith, and recommended to us
by the ſame Rule that aſſured us <hi>Chriſt</hi> was God. Vpon
this tenure as ſtrongly ſupported as nature could bear,
held demonſtrably evident, and ſo shown by us; not yet
anſwer'd or pretended to bee anſwer'd by the Proteſtant
party, wee Ground this Doctrine of the Pope's Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
or the ſubſtance of his Authority: But, I fear, the
Bp. either underſtands not our tenure, (for, otherwiſe,
ſure hee would have nam'd it) or elſe hee is impugning
ſome Canon Lawier, and the <hi>extent</hi> of the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
in ſtead of impugning the Church, and the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
of the ſaid Authority As for his ſecond trifle; I
have already shown (<hi>Sect.</hi> 4.) that the <hi>Britannick</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
have no influence upon our Churches deſcended
from <hi>ſaxons;</hi> nor shall hee ever show a ſyllable in the
Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> exempting them from the Pope's
Iuriſdiction, as Head of the Church; however <hi>Cyprus</hi>
and ſome others are there exempted from a neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſuperiour falſly pretending a Iuriſdiction over them;
But of this more shall bee ſaid hereafter in this preſent
Section.</p>
                  <p>The Vnity of the Church being of ſuch importance,
and the fact breaking it, by conſequence ſo hainous, the
alledging the greateſt abuſes imaginable are abſolutely
concluded inſufficient excuſes for ſuch a fact; much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
unles it bee shown, there were no other poſſible
means to remedy them. Hereupon I alledged that <hi>it was
of little concernment to examine whether his complaints were
true or falſe, ſince hee does not show there was no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
but diviſion.</hi> Firſt, the Bishop replies sharply.
What? <hi>is it of little concernment to examin whether the
Grounds bee ſufficient or no?</hi> well leap't my Lord; I ſpeak
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:115675:300"/>

                     </gap>ections againſt the Abuſes
perhaps of all Governours in the world, and theſe alſo
<hi>true:</hi> but their <hi>truth</hi> does not infer their <hi>ſufficiency</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
that very Government as long as they are leſſ
conſiderable than good of the Government it ſelf, and
that there is another cure: This it that in which I show'd
your manner of arguing defective in the main, becauſe
you never prou'd nor ever shall, that there was <hi>no other
remedy except diviſion;</hi> for, unles you put in this (and
more too) your argument ſtands in this poſture, <hi>True
complaints againſt Governours, whether otherwiſe remedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or no, are ſufficient reaſons to abolish that very Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
At which poſition, if spoke out candidly, I hope
you will blush: though it bee perfectly your own, cloak't
a little in other, (but equivalent) terms. Next, hee tells
us it is a <hi>negative</hi> and <hi>ſo it belongs not to him to prove it.</hi>
Yes, my Ld, it belongs to your party, or any one who
riſes againſt an actuall Authority, either to show that
that Authority was <hi>none,</hi> or elſe that though it was a
lawfull one, yet there was <hi>no other remedy</hi> for it's Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
but a totall Abolishment of it. Otherwiſe, the very
maieſty which Government carries in it's notion, the
Vnity, peace, and a thouſand bleſſings and convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which ſpring from that Vnity, found in the common
acknowledment of that Authority, overſway the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
credit, or any other leſſ publike concerns, which the
diſobedient party can pretend to; and render's their fact
of riſing, irrationall and deſtructive to the common, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
them needleſly in a thouſand diſtractions, and by
conſequence, hazards of ruin which attend ſuch divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
Thirdly, hee would perſuade the Reader that a
<hi>negative</hi> is not <hi>capable of proof,</hi> or at leaſt not ſo eaſily
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:115675:300"/>
capable of it; for anſwer I refer him to any boy who
hath been two years at the Vniverſities, who will inform
him that negatives may witht <hi>equall evidence</hi> bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in <hi>Celarent</hi> &amp; <hi>Ferio</hi> as affirmatives may in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
and <hi>Darij.</hi> Laſtly, the proof which hee propoſes for
his negative to show <hi>no other remedy,</hi> (but dares not
much ſtick to them) are both equally competent to
<hi>France, Spain,</hi> &amp;c who yet (as hee tells us in the next
page in contradiction to himſelf, here) found other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
to preſerve their <hi>priviledges inviolated,</hi> and his
pretended proofs are ſuch pittifull ones, (though on
them is built the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of their motives) that they
evencry for mercy as ſoon as they show their faces. They
are theſe that <hi>the King of England could not call the Pope
and his ourt to a perſonall account,</hi> and that <hi>the Pope
would not eaſe them upon many Adreſſes made?</hi> what then?
Had not the King the ſword in his own hands? did it not
ly in his power to right himſelf as hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſted, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
thoſe pretended eneroachments onely ſo far as hee
thought iuſt and fitting? Nay do not your ſelf lay open
and repeat in many places that not onely Kings of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
but alſo thoſe of all other countries both <hi>could</hi> and
<hi>did</hi> do it often, and by doing ſo preſerve their priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
inviolated? How does this prove then that there was
<hi>ſufficient</hi> Grounds of dividing from the former Church,
ſince your ſelf confeſſ ſo often it could have been reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
otherwiſe? Or, how is it a ſufficient motive to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
an Authority for the Abuſes, which very pretended
Abuſes they had power to curb and keep within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſ
without dividing, and ſo that they should not <hi>viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
their priviledges?</hi> Not a word then hath the Bp. brought
to prove they had <hi>ſufficient</hi> Grounds of <hi>diviſion,</hi> that is,
that there was <hi>no other remedy:</hi> but, in ſtead thereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
told us the contrary, and manifoldly contradicted
himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="572" facs="tcp:115675:301"/>
I added. <hi>And much more, if the Authority bee of Chriſt's
Inſtitution no iuſt cauſe can poſſibly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ee given for it's abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishment.</hi>
The merry Bp. laughs at this, (as hee calls it)
<hi>Kind of arguing;</hi> which neither looks like an Argument,
nor was pretended by mee as ſuch; but as a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which much aggravates the charge and obliges in
all reaſon the renouncers of this Authority to look very
charily to the ſufficiency of the cauſes of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
For ſince it follows out of the terms, that, ere they
renounced it, and by thus renouncing it left to bee Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
they immediately before held it as Catholikes
do, that is, held it as a point of faith, and of Chriſt's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
and ſince it is evident that none ought to chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
his faith which hee and his Anceſtours immemorial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
embrac'd but upon evident Grounds; again, ſince it is
evident likewiſe and confeſt that temporall motives
ought not to make us break <hi>Chriſt's</hi> commands, which
is done by rejecting a Government which hee inſtituted:
Two things are conſequent hence to their diſadvantage;
one, that their motives ought to bee <hi>rigoro ſly evident</hi>
and <hi>demonſtrative</hi> for their renouncing it, ſince d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nger
of damnation enſves upon their miſcarriage, and this
even in their own thoughts as they were lay'd in their
minds when they firſt began to meditate a breach: The
other, that the pretended cauſes (eſpecially temporall
inconveniences) for the abolishing this Authority can
no waies iuſtify the firſt breakers who held it formerly a
point of faith, ſince no iuſt cauſes can bee given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
an Authority held to bee inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
As then it had been rationall to Reply to King H. the
8th remaining yet a Catholike, and beginning to have
thoughts to abolish this Authority, upon ſuch and ſuch
temporall inconveniences that his maieſty and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours
had held it of divine Inſtitution and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there could bee no iuſt cauſe to abolish it, ſo it is
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:115675:301"/>
equally ſeaſonable to Reply to my Lord of <hi>Derry,</hi> who
undertakes here to vindicate him by alledging the ſame
thing, that theſe cauſes nor any elſe were ſufficient to
make them begin to break, becauſe ere they begun the
breach, they held this Authority to bee of Chriſt's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
and therefore it is a folly for him to think to
iuſtify them by huddling together cauſes and motives,
and crying them up for <hi>ſufficient</hi> till hee can show they
had Evidence of the Truth of the oppoſite point, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the pretended Evidence of Authority, univerſall
Tradition, which they actually had for their former
<hi>tenet</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a cauſe bee ſufficient to produce an effect, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply'd 'tis manifeſt the ſame effect will follow. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
as an argument of the inſufficiency of their motives
of <hi>Diviſion,</hi> I alledged that <hi>all other Catholike countries
had the ſame exceptions, yet neither broke formerly, nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
your Example.</hi> Hee anſwers, firſt; <hi>Few or none have
ſuſtain'd ſo great oppreſſion;</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>I know not
well whether any have or no: or, for any thing I know, ſome
have;</hi> Nor does hee prove the contrary otherwiſe than
by a pleaſant ſaying of a certain Pope. Any thing will ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
him. Next hee tells us, <hi>all other countries have not
right to the Cyprian priviledges, as Brittain hath.</hi> And how
proves hee that this country had any by that Council?
Is <hi>England</hi> named in the Council of Epheſus, which
exempted <hi>Cyprus</hi> from the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioch?</hi> No.
Is <hi>Brittain</hi> at leaſt? No. How come wee then to bee
particularly priviledg'd by that Council. Why the Bp. of
Derry thinks ſo. His Grounds? Becauſe that Council
ordains, that <hi>no Bp. should occupy a Province, which was
not from, the beginning under his Predeceſſours.</hi> And how
proves hee the application, that <hi>England</hi> was never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
under the Pope as Head of the Church? from
<hi>Sr Henry Spelman's</hi> old-new manuſcript, and two or
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:115675:302"/>
three raggs of Hiſtory, or miſunderſtood Teſtimonies.
Are they demonſtrative or rigorous Evidences? Here
my Ld is wiſely ſilent. Will leſſ ſerve than ſuch proofs to
iuſtify ſuch a ſeparation? Hee is ſilent again. Were they
a thouſand times as many, are they of a weight compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to a world of witneſſes proceeding upon the
Grounds of immediate d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>livery from hand to hand,
which recommended and aſcertain'd the contrary? Alas!
hee never thinks of nor conſiders that at all; but very
wiſely puts his light grains in one end of the ſcales, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gl
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cting to put our pounds in the other; and then brags
that his thin grains are overweight.</p>
                  <p>The third particularizing motive is his own unprou'd
ſaying, and is concluded with a boaſt that hee is not the
onely ſchiſmatick in the world but hath Brothers. Is this
the way to argue againſt us! To call all thoſe Chriſtians
which profeſſ the name of Chriſt, and communicate with
himſelf in the ſame guilt, and then ſay hee hath fellows
in his ſchiſm? Hee knows wee grant them not to bee
truly-call'd Chriſtians, but in the name onely and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally,
as a painted man is ſtyld' a man; If hee will
show that any Congregation of truly-call'd Chriſtians
partakes with him in the ſeparation from <hi>Rome,</hi> let him
show that theſe pretended Chriſtians, for thoſe points
in which they differ from us, did not renounce the onely
certain Rule of faith, Tradition, or delivery of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
forefathers; or, that there is any certain and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Rule but that. Otherwiſe, they are cut of from the
Rule and Root of faith, and by conſequence not in a
true appellation to bee call'd faithfull or <hi>Chriſtians;</hi>
otherwiſe, they heard not the immediately foregoing
Church for thoſe points which they innovated, and ſo
are to us no properly call'd Chriſtians, but, according
to our ſaviours counſell as <hi>Heathens and publicans:</hi> I
mean thoſe who knowingly &amp; wilfully ſeparated. Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  <p>I alledged, in the next place, to show more their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſablenes

not miſtake you, but know very well you would bee
willing and glad too, the former Church should own
you for hers; I doubt not but you are apprehenſive
enough of what honour would accrue to you if wee
would account you true Catholikes; and what diſgrace
you get by being accounted Hereticks and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
by us. But yet your deſire of ſtaying in the Church
is conditionall, that you may bee permitted to remain
in her Communion, and yet have liberty ſtill to do and
hold what you liſt. Do you not think every Rebell,
that renounces both the former Government and laws,
loves not ſtill to bee held a good Commonwealths man,
and not to bee outlaw'd or punish't, but permitted to
enjoy the priviledge of the Commonwealth, whoſe Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hee hath broken, ſo hee may have his own intentions?
Had <hi>Iack Straw,</hi> or <hi>Wat Tiler,</hi> after they had rebell'd,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:115675:303"/>
a mind to bee thought Rebells, or to bee hang'd; or,
upon the Governours declaring them Outlaws and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable,
was it a competent plea for them to ſay <hi>they
deſir'd to remain in the peaceable Communion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
as far as the Court would give them leave?</hi> Your
fact, my Ld, of breaking the Vnity of the former Church
is much more evident than theirs, being viſible to the
eyes of the whole world; and infinitely more hainous,
ſince it concerns the order to Eternity. After this fact
ſo viſible, ſo enormous; 'tis no charity nor courteſy in
you, but a requeſt of an unreaſonable favour from us, to
admit you into Communion; and would bee moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
in Government, moſt contradictory in terms; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifying
thus much that they should bee ſtill held by us
for good ſubjects, who profeſſ and defend ſtill their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
againſt the former Church Government; and for
the right faithfull, who have no Rule of faith at all, nay
pretend themſelves to no more than an opinion-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or probability.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee tells us, our Anceſtours did not <hi>ſtupid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſit ſtill and blow their noſes, when they ſaw themſelves
thus abuſed?</hi> I anſwer whether they blew their noſes or
no it matters not; but, did they renounce the Pope's
Authority as Head of the Church? This is the thing I
deny'd of them, and charge upon the Bp. what ſaies hee
to this? Hee denies it too, after hee had shuffled about
a while; (for hee muſt have the liberty to take his swing)
that is, hee ſaies the ſame I do, and grants, what hee
pretend's to <hi>confute.</hi> For, after hee had reckon'd up
what things our Anceſtours had done againſt the Pope,
hee adds, as the top of the <hi>Climax,</hi> that <hi>they threatned
him further to make a wall of ſeparation between him and
them.</hi> Which shows that this is the <hi>moſt</hi> they did. For, if
they but <hi>threatned</hi> they <hi>did</hi> it <hi>not.</hi> But, 'tis evident that
you have <hi>done</hi> what they onely <hi>threatned</hi> to do, and in
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:115675:303"/>
excuſe of your doing it, you adde immediately, that you
<hi>have more Experience than your Anceſtours had.</hi> Thus the
Bp. ſomething candidly at preſent: Yet, wee have ſeen
him heretofore, in contradiction to himſelf here, both
affirm and maintain that K. H. the 8th when hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't
the Pope made <hi>no new law,</hi> but onely <hi>declar'd
the ancient law of England;</hi> which ſignifies that the wall
of ſeparation was not onely <hi>threaten'd</hi> but <hi>made</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for the former laws were actually <hi>in force</hi> before K.
H's time, nay in the very beginning of his Raign, as
himſelf confeſſes p. 2s. l. 7. 8. And wee shall ſee him he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter
bring an whole Chapter to make good the ſame
impudent aſſertion, which would put out the eyes and
blot out the acknowledg'd notions of the whole world.
An excellently bad cauſe needs an excellently good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
                  <p>Now then ſince you have at unawares acknowledg'd
ſo much truth as that they who had the ſame cauſes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
which you have, yet did not ſeparate as you do,
let us reflect a little upon the reaſon you give of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
'Tis this, that <hi>you have more experience than
your Anceſtours;</hi> but whence this greater experience
ſprings, or out of what Experiments which they had not,
you gather'd this experience, you have not one word.
Are you wiſer than they were in the Art of Governing
as to this point? Sure your ſelf do not beleeve it, nor
can ſay it with modeſty; ſince by profeſſing you made
<hi>no new law</hi> in this matter, (that is retain'd the old, which
you receiu'd from them) you confeſſ you know not how
to make better. Were they cowards and durſt not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
thoſe prouiſions they ſaw neceſſary for the common
good! Neither. They actually <hi>did</hi> (ſay you) <hi>exclude the
Pope's Supremacy out of England as far as they judged it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the tranquillity of the Kingdome.</hi> Well then, if
they did as much as they judged neceſſary, and knew as
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:115675:304"/>
well what was neceſſary as you, why did you do more,
<hi>Becauſe,</hi> forſooth, <hi>you had more experience.</hi> But does this
<hi>experience,</hi> furnish you with a reaſon ſufficient to iuſtify
your ſeparation! If it do, produce it; if not, why do you
alledge this <hi>more experience?</hi> And, indeed, how come
you to pretend to it! For, ſince experience of neceſſity
ſuppoſes an Experiment whence 'tis deriu'd, either ſome
<hi>new thing</hi> happen'd by which this great neceſſity of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
which your Anceſtors were ignorant of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to bee diſcover'd to you, or elſe you had no more
experience than they. Therefore, good my Ld, tell us
what this new Experime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was: But, it ſeems you thought
it either not handſom to bee owned, or not worth the
owning that aſſigne us none at all, telling us onely in
generall terms you <hi>have more experience than your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
had,</hi> &amp;c. that is, in ſtead of producing ſome <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe</hi>
of ſeparating which might vindicate your Church
from Schiſm, to aſſigne an effect without a cauſe; and
defend it with the ſame plea as a man would do his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
who riſing againſt his actuall Governours, and
upon that ſcore ſtanding accuſed of Treaſon, should go
about to maintain it was therefore lawfull for him to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
becauſe hee was <hi>wiſer</hi> than the former ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ects; and
then tell that troubleſome Adverſary who should preſſ
him to prove this greater Wiſedome, that hee has <hi>more
experience,</hi> and that hee is ſo.</p>
                  <p>However, ſince you are reſolu'd to make a ſecret of
this rare Experiment, and that, by conſequence, wee are
not to expect from you any Grounds of your <hi>greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi>
let us ſee at leaſt what it is you pretend to have
<hi>more enperience</hi> of. 'Tis this, that <hi>their Anceſtors remedies
were not ſoueraign or ſufficient enough,</hi> &amp;c. Now theſe <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi>
of theirs being their <hi>rationall laws,</hi> (as hee inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
preſently after) do but obſerve how, like a ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Dutchman making indentures with his legs, the
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:115675:304"/>
Bp's diſcourſe ſtaggers now to the one, now to the other
far diſtant ſide of the contradiction. Hee tells us here
that the remedies, that is, laws of our Anceſtours were
not ſufficient enough; yet maintains ſtoutly before that
in the ſeparation <hi>no new law</hi> was made, that is, that the
<hi>ſame</hi> laws or remedies were formerly as then, but were
not formerly ſufficient; that is, that the <hi>ſame</hi> thing <hi>is not</hi>
as ſufficient as it is. And this ſignifies for the Bp. to have
<hi>more experience</hi> than his Anceſtors. Again, it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
here that the former laws were <hi>inſufficient,</hi> and
acknowledg'd the page before that <hi>all other Catholike
countries do maintain their priviledges inviolate,</hi> by means
of their laws (as I conceive and hee intimates) which
laws hee ſayes, p. 21. are equivalent to thoſe of England
which hee pretends here not to bee ſufficient; it follows
that the laws of other countries were equivalent to thoſe
of England, but thoſe of England not <hi>equivalent</hi> to them;
or, that, though equivalent to one another, that is, <hi>of
equall force,</hi> yet the one was ſufficient, the others not,
that is, <hi>of leſſ force:</hi> And, thirdly, that <hi>all Catholike coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
did maintain their priviledges inviolate</hi> by means
which did not maintain them, or by laws which were
<hi>not ſufficient</hi> to do it. Laſtly, hee tells us, p. 20. that the
<hi>former laws deny'd</hi> the Pope any Authority in England,
and p. 21. l. 9. that <hi>thoſe laws were in force</hi> before the
breach, that is, did actually leave him no Authority in
England; and here, that thoſe <hi>nationall laws were not
ſufficient remedies;</hi> Whence 'tis manifeſtly conſequent,
according to him, that thoſe laws which <hi>deny'd</hi> the Pope
all Authority, and were actually <hi>in force,</hi> that is, actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
left him none, <hi>were not ſufficient remedies</hi> againſt the
Abuſes of that Authority, which they had quite taken
a way. And this plenty of contradictions the Bp's book
is admirably ſtor'd with; which are his demonſtrations
to vindicate his Church from Schiſm; onely hee chriſtens
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:115675:305"/>
the monſtrous things with a finer name, and calls them
their <hi>greater experience.</hi> Whereas, indeed, as for <hi>more
experience</hi> hee brags of, God know (poor men) 'tis one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that which Eve got by eating the Apple, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of <hi>evill</hi> added to that which they had formerly
of <hi>good.</hi> Their Anceſtors experienc't an happy Vnity,
Vnanimity, Vniformity and conſtancy in the ſame faith
while they remain'd united to the former Church; and
they ſince their breach have experienc't nothing but the
contrary; to wit, diſtractions, diſſentions, Vnconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
with a perpetually-fleeting Changeablenes of their
<hi>tenet;</hi> and, at laſt, an utter diſſolution and diſapparition
of their Mock Church, built onely in the Air of phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick
probabilities.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place I alledged, that <hi>the pretences upon which
the Schiſm was originally made were far different from thoſe
hee now takes up to defend it.</hi> For, it is well known that
had the Pope conſented that K. H. might put away his
wife and marry another, there had been no thoughts of
renouncing his Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hority. Which shows that at moſt,
the ſcales were but equally ballanc't before, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
not ſufficient to make them break, till this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
caſt them. A great prejudice to the ſufficiency
of the other reaſons you alledge, which you grant, in
the next page, <hi>were moſt certainly then obſeru'd or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part of them.</hi> For ſince they were obſerved then, that
is, ſince the ſame cauſes were apply'd then, apt to work
upon men's minds, thoſe ſame cauſes had been alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
efficacious, that is, had <hi>formerly</hi> produc't the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of ſeparating as well as <hi>now,</hi> had there not been <hi>now</hi>
ſome particular diſpoſition in the <hi>patient;</hi> and what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
diſpoſition can bee shown at the inſtant of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
ſave the King's luſt, which was moſt manifeſt and
evident, I confeſſ I cannot imagin, nor (as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
(the Bp. himſelf; at leaſt hee tells us none, but

onely in generall terms ſayes <hi>they had more experience
than their Anceſtours.</hi>

L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of Derry in ſix peeces of non-ſence and contradiction;
with an utter ruin of all Order and Government. His
pretended undeniable Principles very eaſily and rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny'd. His Churche's inward charity, and the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

His Moderation in calling thoſe tenets Weeds, which
hee cannot digeſt; and indifferent Opinions, which
hee will not bee obliged to hold. That according to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Grounds 'tis impoſſible to know any Catholike
Church, or which ſects are of it.</head>
                  <p>HIs next Head is the <hi>due Moderation</hi> of the Church
of England in their reformation. This I called <hi>a
pleaſant Topick;</hi> Hee anſwers ſo were <hi>the ſaddeſt ſubjects
to Democritus,</hi> I Reply, the ſubject is indeed very <hi>ſad</hi>
for never was a <hi>ſadder</hi> peece of Logick produced by a
non-pluſt Sophiſter, yet withall ſo mirthfull, as it would
move laughter even in <hi>Heraclitus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt point of their <hi>Moderation,</hi> is this, that <hi>they
deny not the true being to other Churches, nor ſeparate from
the Churches but from their accidentall errors.</hi> Now, the
matter of fact hath evidenced undeniably that they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from thoſe points which were the Principles of
vnitie both in faith &amp; Governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the former Church
with which they communicated, and conſequently from
all the perſons which held thoſe Principles; and, had
their ſeparation been expreſt in theſe plain terms and true
language, nothing had ſounded more intolerable and
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:115675:306"/>
immoderate: wherefore my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> took order to uſe his own
bare Authority, to <hi>moderate</hi> and reform the <hi>truth</hi> of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
points into pretended <hi>erroneouſnes,</hi> and the concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningnes
or <hi>fundamentalnes</hi> of them into an onely <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentalnes,</hi>
and then all is well, and hee is preſently (if
wee will beleeve his word againſt our owne eyes) a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
man;</hi> and ſo are the Proteſtans too who partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
his <hi>Moderation.</hi> But, if wee demand what could be
<hi>Eſſentiall</hi> to the former Church if theſe too Principles
(renounced by them) which grounded all that was good
in her, were accidentall onely? or how he can iuſtly hold
her a <hi>true Church</hi> whoſe fund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mentall of fundamentalls,
the Root &amp; Rule of all her faith, was, as he ſaies here,
an <hi>error;</hi> his candid anſwer would shew us what common
ſence already informs us that nothing could be either
Eſſentiall or fundamentall to that Church. And ſo, this
pretended <hi>Moderation</hi> would vanish on one ſide into
plain non-ſence, in thinking any thing could be more
Eſſentiall to a Church then Vni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y of faith, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
on the other ſide into meer folly and indeed
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction in holding her a <hi>true Church,</hi> whoſe Grounds
of both (that is of all which should make her a <hi>true
Church</hi>) are <hi>Errors &amp; Lies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Church of England defines, <hi>Art.</hi> 19. that our
Church <hi>erres in matters of faith; Art.</hi> 22. that four points
of our faith are <hi>vain fictions &amp; contradictory to God's word.</hi>
The like character is given of another point <hi>Art.</hi> 28.
Our higheſt act of deuotion, (<hi>Art.</hi> 31. is ſtyled <hi>a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
fiction &amp; pernicious impoſture;</hi> and (<hi>Art.</hi> 33.) that
<hi>thoſe who are cut of from the Church publikely</hi> (I conceive
they mean Catholikes or at leaſt include them, whom
they uſed to excommunicate publikely in their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies)
<hi>should be held as Heathens and Publicans.</hi> Again,
nothing was more uncontrollably, nay more laudably
common in the mouths of their Preachers, then to call
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:115675:306"/>
the Pope, <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>whore
of Babylon, Idolatrous, Superſtitious, Blaſphemous,</hi> &amp;c.
And, to make up the meaſure of his fore fathers ſins the
Bp. calls here thoſe two Principles of Vnity both in faith
&amp; Government, without which she neither hath nor
can have any thing of Church in her (as hath been
shown in the foregoing Section) both <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoods.</hi>
Now, theſe expreſſions, if taken as falling from
their mouths &amp; pens, I conceive ſound not over much
of <hi>Moderation.</hi> All the <hi>Moderation</hi> conſiſts here, that my
Ld of <hi>Derry</hi> had a mind to break a good ieſt, and aſſure
us very Sadly p. 39. l. 7. that (notwithſtanding all this)
<hi>they forbear to cenſure us;</hi> which ſignifies, firſt, that they
do not cenſure <hi>at all</hi> whom they have already cenſured
in the <hi>height</hi> (as is manifeſt by their former expreſſions;)
next, that though they beleeve thoſe former expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to be true, and that wee are indeed ſuch, that is
though they <hi>hold</hi> us for ſuch, yet they do not <hi>cenſure</hi>
us for ſuch: Awitty contradiction! And laſtly that though
our Church <hi>erre in credendis, contradict Scripture blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
&amp; perniciouſly in her doctrine,</hi> nay though her all
grounding Principles be flatt <hi>Errors,</hi> and that she perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly
&amp; unrelentingly perſiſt in thoſe doctrines (as
she does) nor is ever likely to change or retract them,
yet for all this she is not to be held as <hi>hereticall</hi> (though
this be the very definition of <hi>Hereſie</hi>) but as a <hi>true Church</hi>
ſtill, nor is to be <hi>cenſured</hi> to be otherwiſe. Good chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
non-ſence!</p>
                  <p>Hee tells me, firſt, that hee ſpeakes of <hi>forbearing to
cenſure other Churches, but I anſwer of communicating with
them,</hi> and that therefore I <hi>err from the purpoſe.</hi> Yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſix lines before (ſo forgetfull he is) quotes <hi>S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
for <hi>removing no man from our Communion,</hi> &amp;c. And
how they should refuſe to <hi>communicate</hi> with any, unles
they firſt iudge him &amp; <hi>cenſure</hi> him to deſerve to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:115675:307"/>
that is, naught, I muſt confeſſ I know not.</p>
                  <p>Next, hee tells us <hi>one may in ſome caſes very lawfully
communicate with materiall Idolaters, Hereticks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In
pious offices, though not in their Idolatry, Hereſie,</hi> &amp;c.
Thus we have loſt the queſtion. Who for bids them to
go to viſit the ſick with them, or ſuch like religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
The queſtion is whether they may communicate
with them in any publike ſolemne act, performable by
Catholikes, as they are ſubjects of ſuch a common
wealth, from which the other is out law'd, or performa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by thoſe others, as belonging to a diſtinct ſect?
Again this poſition of <hi>Moderation</hi> deſtroies all order &amp;
Government both of Church &amp; ſtate; for, by this, out
law'd perſons may be traffick'r &amp; treated with ſo we
joyn not with them in their rebellion; and all the whole
world (<hi>heathens too</hi>) may be of one Communion; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who all agree in ſome common
Principle of Chriſtianity with the reſt. The Bishop's
<hi>Proviſo</hi> makes all the world Brothers &amp; friends, though
one part should remain moſt obſtinate enemies both to
God &amp; his Church; for ſtill, as long as this Principle
holds of communicating with them in all things but their
Errors, God's Church shall become a courteous galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mafry
of all the filth Hell &amp; Error could compound to
deform her, and wear in her externall face a motley mask
of as many colours as there are ſects in the world: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Heathens too muſt make up a part of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
provided we abſtain onely to communicate
with them in their <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Thus they who want Grounds
to give nerves to their Government, are forced to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
a counterfeit Kind-heartednes; and under that
plauſible vizard vent much refined perniciouſnes as is
able at once to ruin all ſence, reaſon, order, diſcipline,
Government, common wealth, Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly he tells us that <hi>the Orthodox Chriſtians did ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:115675:307"/>
communicate with the hereticall Arians.</hi> By which
you ſee he is a kind diſpoſition to admit even thoſe to
his Communion who deny Chriſt's divinitie. The Arians
were known to cloak themſelves ſo craftily in words,
that they could not for a long time be certainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd;
nor is it any wonder that for a while Hereticks be
tolerated, untill they be both heard and a time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
be preſcribed them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he tells us <hi>he hath shown how the Primitive
Catholikes communicated with the Schiſmaticall Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
in the ſame publike divine offices.</hi> But he is ſo reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as not to direct us where he hath shown this; nor
could an ordinary inquiry finde it out; and in his p. 282.
which place ſeems moſt proper for that diſcourſe, he
onely names the word [<hi>Novatians</hi>] without proving
any thing concerning them. Now the <hi>Novatians</hi> were
ſimply Schiſmaticks, and tranſported onely by a too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
zeal to a diſobedience to the Church in a former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received practice; with ſuch as theſe it is lawfull to
communicate, till, upon their contumacy, the Church
shall excommunicate them. Again, as long as Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
&amp; thoſe who are erroneous in faith, are onely <hi>in
via</hi> (as we may ſay) and not <hi>in termino,</hi> and hardned
into an obſtinacy, there is a prudentiall latitude allow'd
by the Church, delaying her cenſures as long as shee
can poſſibly without wronging her Government, as was
de facto practiſed in England till the 10th of <hi>Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth:</hi>
But this is not enough to prove they were <hi>admitted
into Communion,</hi> becauſe they were <hi>tolerated</hi> for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
time while there was hope they would not be obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
but would return, the Apoſtle himſelf preſcribing
a time of triall, before they are to be avoided upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie.
But, can my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Derry</hi> show a parallell to our
caſe, that any renounc't the former Rule of faith, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Tradition of Anceſtors, the former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:115675:308"/>
and many other points recommendedy that
Rule, and obſtinately perſiſted to diſavow both, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
writing againſt, excommunicating, nay perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with loſſ of Eſtates, and often times of life the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of the thus renounced faith &amp; Government; can
he show, I ſay, that ſuch were ever admitted by the
Church into Communion? unles he can show this, he
beats the Air, for this onely comes to our point. <hi>S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian's</hi>
caſe reaches not hither; he had no reaſon to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
any from his Communion,</hi> ſince he was in the wrong;
nor could hee poſſibly ſee with evidence that the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Tradition of all thoſe Churches with whom hee
communicated did avouch his tenet, for hee was the man
that brought in the <hi>noveltie;</hi> your renouncing the former
Rule of faith, immediate delivery of fore fathers, and
the former Government, with many other points re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
by that Rule, is moſt evident, nay confeſt,
avouched, &amp; ſtill maintain'd by your own obſtinate
ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, hee told us that <hi>the Catholikes call'd the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts
their brethren.</hi> I anſwer, ſo are Catholikes bound
to call the Proteſtants now; nay Turks, Heathens, and
in generall all men who are yet in a capacite to attain
beatitude, that is, all but the damned in hell, who are
eternally hardned in enmitie againſt God. <hi>S. Peter (Art.</hi>
3. <hi>v.</hi> 17.) call'd the Iews who crucyfy'd <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
yet never meant by that appellation that they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
good Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, he objects that <hi>the Donatiſts proceeding upon
my Principle would not acknowledge the Catholikes their
Brethren.</hi> And what is this Principle of mine? 'Tis this,
as put down here by himſelf; that <hi>a man cannot ſay his
own religion is true but he muſt ſay the oppoſite is falſe; nor
hold his own certain without cenſuring another man's.</hi> Good
Reader, reflect a little upon this propoſition he cavills
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:115675:308"/>
at, and then take, if thou canſt, the juſt dimenſions of
the unmeaſurable weaknes of error and it's Abettors.
Do not <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> involve eſſentially in their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
an oppoſitenes and contrarietie to <hi>falshood</hi> &amp; <hi>error?</hi>
Does not <hi>true</hi> ſignifie <hi>not-falſe?</hi> How is it poſſible then
a man indued with the common light of reaſon can hold
a thing <hi>true</hi> and yet not hold it's oppoſite <hi>falſe?</hi> yet this
plain ſelf evident propoſition, in other terms the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
with this, that a thing cannot both <hi>be</hi> &amp; <hi>not be</hi> at
once, is denied by the Bp. nay accounted diſgracefull to
hold it. Whereas, indeed, it is not mine nor the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
onely, but the common Principle of nature, which
the ſillieſt old wife and leaſt boy come to the uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
cannot but know. Error preſt home cannot burſt
out at length into leſſ abſurdities than denying the firſt
Principles.</p>
                  <p>The Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> having shown us how well skill'd
he is in <hi>Principles</hi> by renouncing that firſt Nature-taught
one, proceeds immediately to eſtablish ſome Principles
of his own, which he calls <hi>evident</hi> &amp; <hi>undeniable,</hi> ſo to
confute the former. The firſt is, that particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
may fall into error: where, if by <hi>Errors,</hi> he means
<hi>opinions</hi> onely; 'tis true: if points of faith, 'tis not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
as he thinks; in caſe that particular Church ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
firmly to her Rule of faith, immediate Tradition,
for that point already there ſetled; that is, if shee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
as a <hi>Church.</hi> If he wonder at this, I shall increaſe
his admiration by letting him know my minde, that I
ſee it not poſſible how even the pretended Proteſtants
Church of <hi>England</hi> (could it without ſelf condemnation
have owned the <hi>immediate delivery</hi> of fore fathers, and
onely proceeded &amp; ſtuck cloſe to that Rule) should
ever come to vary from the former Proteſtant Beleef;
for, as long as the now fathers taught their Children
what was held now, and the Children (without looking
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:115675:309"/>
farther) beleeved their fathers and taught their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as they beleeved, and ſo ſucceſſively, it followes
in terms that the poſterity remote a thouſand genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
would ſtill beleeve as their fathers do now. But, as
their religion, built on <hi>Reformation,</hi> that is, <hi>not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Tradition,</hi> will not let them own immediate Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for their Rule of faith, ſo neither, did they own
it, could their certainty arrive to that of our Churches,
ſtrengthen'd by ſo many ſuper-added aſſiſtances.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Principle is, that <hi>all errors are not Eſſentiall or
fundamentall.</hi> I anſwer that if by <hi>Errors</hi> he means onely
<hi>opinions,</hi> as he ſeems to ſay in the next paragraph, then
none at all are <hi>Eſſentiall;</hi> but what is this to my propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which ſpoke of <hi>Religion</hi> not of <hi>opinions;</hi> unles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
(which is moſt likely &amp; conſonant to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Grounds) the Bishop makes account that <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>opinion</hi> are all one. But, if he means <hi>Error</hi> in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of faith, then every <hi>ſuch error</hi> is fundamentall and (to
anſwer this <hi>third Principle</hi> with the ſame labour) <hi>deſtroies
the being of a Church.</hi> For, ſince a Church muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
have a Rule of faith, otherwiſe she were no Church,
and that 'tis impoſſible to conceive how man's nature
should let her proceed ſo quite contrary to her Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as to hold a thing as a matter of faith, not procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon her onely Rule of faith, this being a flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
Again, ſince the Rule of faith muſt be both
certain and plain (without which properties 'tis no Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le)
it follows that an <hi>error</hi> in a matter of faith argues an
erroneouſnes in the <hi>Rule of faith,</hi> which eſſentially and
fundamentally concerns the being of a Church.</p>
                  <p>His fourth Principle is that <hi>every one is bound, according
to the juſt extent of his power, to free himſelf from thoſe not
eſſentiall errors.</hi> Why ſo, my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>? if thoſe errors be not
eſſentiall, they leave according to your own Grounds,
ſufficient means of Salvation, and the true being of a
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:115675:309"/>
Church: How prove you then that you ought to break
Church Communion which is eſſentially deſtructive to
the being of a Church to remedy this, or hazard your
Salvation) as you know well Schiſm does) when you
might have reſted ſecure? Is it an <hi>evident</hi> and <hi>undeniable
Principle</hi> that you ought to break that in which conſiſts
the being of a Church to remedy that which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ
can conſiſt with the being of a Church? or, is it an
<hi>undeniable Principle</hi> that you ought to endanger your
ſoul where you grant there is no neceſſity? Say not I
ſuppoſe things <hi>gratis,</hi> your friend Dr. H. tells you out
of the fathers how horrid a crime Schiſm is, how vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unexcuſable; the undeniable evidence of fact mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
you to have broke Church Communion, that is to
have Schiſmatized from the former Church, which you
muſt be forced to grant unles you can show us that you
ſtill maintain the former Principles of Vnity both in faith
and Government. Theſe are the points which you vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
broke and rejected; show either that theſe were
not fundamentally concerning the <hi>Vnity</hi> and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Entity</hi> of the former Church, or elſe confeſſ that
you had no juſt cauſe of renouncing them, and ſo that
you are plainly both Schiſmatick &amp; Heretick. But 'tis
ſufficient for your Lp's pretence of <hi>Moderation</hi> without
ſo much as mentioning them in particular to ſay here in
generall terms that the points you renounc'd were <hi>not
eſſentiall,</hi> were <hi>accidentall,</hi> were <hi>errors, vlcers, opinions,
hay</hi> &amp; <hi>ſtubble,</hi> the <hi>plague, weeds,</hi> &amp;c. And thus ends the
firſt part of your wiſely maintained <hi>Moderation,</hi> as full
of contradictions &amp; abſurdities as of words.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond proof of their <hi>Moderation</hi> is their <hi>inward
charity.</hi> I love to ſee charity appearing <hi>out-wardly:</hi> me
thinks hanging and perſecution diſguize her very much,
and your ſtill clamorous noiſes againſt us, envying us
even that poore happines that we are able with very
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:115675:310"/>
much a doe to keep our heads above water and not ſink
utterly. He proves this <hi>in ward</hi> charity by their <hi>externall
works,</hi> as he calls them their prayers for us; He should
have ſaid, <hi>words,</hi> the former were their <hi>works,</hi> and prou'd
nothing but their <hi>malice.</hi> But let us examin their <hi>prayers:</hi>
they pray for us he ſayes <hi>daily;</hi> and we do the ſame for
them; nay more, many of ours hazard their lives <hi>daily</hi>
to do good to the ſouls even of themſelves, our enemies;
and to free them, as much as in us lies, from a beleeved
danger. Which shows now the greater charity? But their
<hi>ſpeciall externall work,</hi> as he calls it, is their <hi>ſolemn an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary
prayer for our converſion every good friday.</hi> And
this he thinks is a <hi>ſpeciall</hi> peece of charity in their
Church; being ignorant (good man) that this very
thing is the ſolemn cuſtome of our Church every good
friday, as is to be ſeen in our Miſſall, and borrowed
thence by their book of common prayer, among many
other things; But let us ſee whether the Proteſtants, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Grounds, can be ſayd to pray for us at
all in particular on <hi>Good friday,</hi> or for our converſion,
as he, forget-full of his own tenet, affirms. Their prayer
is this, <hi>Mercifull god, who haſt made all men, and hateſt
nothing that thou haſt made, nor wouldeſt the death of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but rather that he should be converted and live; have
mercy upon all Iews, Turks, Infidells, and Hereticks,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Fetch them home to thy flock, that they may be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c.
I ask, now, under which of theſe heads does he place
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> when he pretends their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſion is here pray'd
for in particular? Vnder that of <hi>Hereticks?</hi> How can this
ſtand with his Principles, who acknowledges ours a <hi>true
Church,</hi> that is, <hi>not hereticall?</hi> and, lately told us, as a
point of his Churches <hi>Moderation,</hi> that she forbears to
cenſure others. Again, they grant us to be <hi>of Chriſt's
flock,</hi> already, &amp; in a capacy to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> whereas thoſe
they pray for here are ſuppoſed <hi>reducible</hi> to Chriſt's
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:115675:310"/>
flock, (that is, not yet of it) and by being thus <hi>reduced,</hi>
capable of Salvation; that is, incapable of it before they
be thus <hi>reduced;</hi> none of theſe therefore are competent
to us, nor are we prayed for there, as Hereticks, if his
own Grounds &amp; his own pretended <hi>Moderation</hi> are to
be held to by himſelf. Much leſſ will he ſay we are pray'd
for there under the notion of <hi>Iews, Turcks,</hi> or <hi>Infidels,</hi>
for this were to cenſure us worſe, nor was ever pretended
by Proteſtants. It follows then that our converſion in
particular is not there pray'd for at all, but that there is
ſuch a pittifull diſſonancy between the pretended Church
of England's doctrine &amp; her practice, that her greateſt
Bp's &amp; Doctors cannot make ſence of one related to the
other. Nay more, ſince hee culls out this Good friday,
prayer for the <hi>ſpeciall externall work</hi> of their charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, and that this cannot concern us at all (without
a ſelf contradiction) it follows that their other externall
works argue no charity at all towards us. And this is the
great inward charity the Bp. brags of, as a proof of their
<hi>due Moderation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He adds, that we excommunicate them once a year,
that is <hi>the day before Good-friday.</hi> I reply, that to expect
a Church should not excommunicate thoſe whom she
holds to be Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, is at once to be
ignorant of the Churches conſtant practice, and the
common Principles of Government. It being equally
evident, that the Church in all ages tooke this courſe with
obſtinate Adverſaries of faith, as it is, that Society in
the world can ſubſiſt without putting a diſtinction and
ſeparating avowed enemies and Rebels from true ſubjets
&amp; friends. If then they hold us Hereticks, (and unles
they hold us ſuch, they do not pray for us in particular
as is pretended) they ought in all reaſon to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate;
as indeed ſometimes they did ſome particular
Catholikes in their Churches; though not all our
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:115675:311"/>
Church in generall, their new ſtarted congregation was
conſcious to herſelf, that she had no ſuch Authority;
which made her alſo inſtead of thoſe words in our Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friday
prayer, <hi>ad ſanctam Matrem Eccleſiam Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam
atque Apoſtolicam revocare digneris, recall them to
our holy Mother the Catholike &amp; Apoſtolike Church,</hi>
vary the grave and too authoritative phraſe, (too loud
(alas) for her as taken in contra diſtinction to us) into
that dwindling, puling puritanicall expreſſions of <hi>one
flock, the rem nant of the true Iſraelites, one fold, under one
Shepheard,</hi> &amp;c. equally pretendable (if taken alone)
by Quakers, as by them, ſince they include no viſible
Marks in their notion, which can ſatisfy us of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
between the one &amp; the other.</p>
                  <p>The third proof of their <hi>Moderation</hi> is, that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
nothing but took away onely from the former do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Church, which he expreſſes by ſaying they
<hi>pluck up the weeds, but retain all the plants of ſaving truths.</hi>
I anſwer'd that to take away goodnes is the greateſt evill,
&amp;c. He replies that he <hi>ſpake of taking away errors.</hi> No
my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, this was not the intent of your diſcourſe there;
both becauſe you pretended there to prove ſomething
whereas I conceive to rely on onely the cheap ſaying
that all is erroneous you tooke away, proves nothing,
but is a meere ſelf ſuppoſition, as alſo becauſe it is not a
proof of <hi>Moderation</hi> to take away <hi>errors,</hi> but a rigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
requiſite act of <hi>Iuſtice.</hi> Your intent then was to show
the Moderation in your method of proceeding, which
you pretended all the way long, to have been that you
<hi>added no new thing</hi> but onely <hi>took away ſomething of the
old.</hi> This I glanc't at as a fond and idle pretence; ſince
till you prove evidently and demonſtrably from your
new Rule of faith, that the former of immediate Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
which aſſerted thoſe points denied by you did the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in erre, the preſumption ſtands againſt you that it was
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:115675:311"/>
Chriſt's doctrine which you maimed by thus detracting
from it; or, if you ſuppoſe <hi>gratis</hi> that 'twas not Chriſt's
doctrine, but <hi>errors</hi> &amp; <hi>falshoods,</hi> then it is not proper to
call it <hi>Moderation,</hi> but rather an act of <hi>neceſſary charity</hi>
to root it out: I know it is an eaſy matter to call all <hi>weeds</hi>
which your nice ſtomachs cannot digeſt; but if that point
of immediate Tradition renounced by you, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
could aſcertain us that there was any ſuch thing as
Chriſt or God's word, be a weed, I wonder what can
deſerve to be called a <hi>flower.</hi> What he vapours of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
what the primitive fathers iudged neceſſary and
now Catholike Church does, is an emptie brag &amp; vanis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes
into ſmoak by it ſelf, ſince (as shall shortly bee
shown) their Grounds can never determin what is the
Catholike or univerſall Church.</p>
                  <p>In order to the ſame proof of his <hi>Moderation,</hi> I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
anſwered that he who poſitively denies ever adds
the contrary, to what he takes away; and that he who
makes it an Article that there is no Purgatory, no maſſ,
no prayer to Saints, has as many Articles as he who
holds the contrary. He replies that he <hi>knows the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi>
inſtancing that they <hi>neither hold it an Article of faith
that there is a Purgatory, nor that there is none.</hi> I ask, what
kinde of things are their thirty nine Articles? Are they
of faith, or opinions onely? I conceive his Lp. will not
ſay they are meere <hi>opinions,</hi> but contra-diſtinctive of the
Proteſtant faith from ours; at leaſt the good ſimple Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
were made beleeve ſo when they ſwore to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them, and unles they had certainty as ſtrongly
grounded as <hi>divine beleef</hi> for thoſe points or Articles;
how could they in reaſon reject the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary tenets which
they held by <hi>divine beleef.</hi> Now the 22. Article defines
the negative to Purgatory &amp; three other points of our
doctrine; yet this ill-tutour'd Child tells his old craſy
mother, the Church of England, that she lies &amp; that
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:115675:312"/>
he knows the contrary. Now his reaſon is better then
his poſition; 'tis this becauſe <hi>a negative cannot be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of faith.</hi> So that he would not have held it of faith
againſt the <hi>Manichees,</hi> that <hi>there are not two God's;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the propoſition is <hi>negative;</hi> nor that <hi>the Divells
shall not be ſaved, nor the Saints in Heaven damn'd,</hi> nor
that <hi>there is no Salvation but through Ieſus-Chriſt;</hi> all the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
by the Bishop's Logick muſt ceaſe to be Articles of
faith, and become indifferent and unconcerning opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
becauſe they are all <hi>negatives.</hi> After this he talks
ramblingly again as his cuſtome is, of <hi>Theologicall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
indifferent opinions,</hi> &amp;c. and then on his own kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
word aſſures us that theſe points are ſuch, and ſo wipes
his hands of them.</p>
                  <p>His laſt proof of their <hi>Moderation,</hi> is their <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of minde to beleeve &amp; practice what ever the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
Church even of this preſent age doth univerſally beleeve
&amp; practice.</hi> Proofs should be viſible &amp; known; and he
brings us here for a proof a thing hid in the dark hole of
their own breaſts, nor ever likely to come to light but
by their own ſayings onely; all other Symptoms ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in oppoſition to it. But the greateſt foolery is, that,
as I told him, they firſt ſay there is no univerſall Church;
or, if any, indeterminate, ſo that no body can tell which
it is, and then make a hollow-hearted profeſſion of a
readines to beleeve it, and conclude themſelves <hi>modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>
Reformers. My Ld replies that <hi>then they have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
their creed the badge of their Chriſtianitie.</hi> I anſwer, we
doubt not but they have; and that, as they hold onely
the word Church and not the <hi>thing,</hi> ſo they hold onely
the word, <hi>the creed,</hi> and not the <hi>ſence</hi> of it both in that
and what other Articles their fancie pleaſes. Is it not
then wiſely argued, to think to confute us by bringing
us to this abſurditie (as he imagins) that <hi>then they have
renounced their creed;</hi> whereas 'tis our known tenet, which
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:115675:312"/>
we hold as undoubtedly as we do that they are out of
the Church. The next abſurditie he brings me to upon
this account, is, that <hi>then they have renounc't their reaſon
alſo.</hi> As little can we doubt of this as of the former, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſeen lately how you deny'd the firſt Principles and
common ſenſe almoſt in every particular of this diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe;
and, even this preſent maner of arguing teſtifies how
little reaſon your bad cauſe will allow you the uſe of.
But how proves he that then they muſt have <hi>loſt their
reaſon?</hi> Thus; <hi>for, if there be many particular Churches
wherefore not one univerſall Church, whereof Chriſt is the
Head and King.</hi> Very good, my Ld, but if you give us
no certain Rule to know what congregations are to be
truly accounted Churches and which not ſuch, but he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall,
and show us no ſome common ty of ordinary
Government in the Church, how will you make up of
them one univerſall Church, which may bee known for
ſuch? This is the thing we object (as you well know) that
you give us no ſuch Rule to know a true Church by;
This is the reaſon why we affirm you deny an univerſall
Church, becauſe you deny all Grounds which can eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
ſuch a Church.</p>
                  <p>As for what I alledged that if they ſay there is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Church 'tis indetermin'd, that is none knows
which it is; He anſwers, firſt, that <hi>then 'tis all one as if
it were not.</hi> Very true, for if there be no determinate one,
there is none at leaſt to us. Next, that this is a <hi>calumny,</hi>
to ſay they know not determinately which this Church
is. Let us examine whether it be or no.</p>
                  <p>Two things are requiſite to the notion of an <hi>univerſall</hi>
or <hi>Catholike Church.</hi> One, that the particular companies,
which compound it, be indeed <hi>true Churches;</hi> that is,
conſiſting of <hi>true beleevers,</hi> and not hereticall Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations;
without certain knowledge of which none can
poſſibly know which is the univerſall Church, made up
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:115675:313"/>
of them; The other that theſe particular Congregations
of true beleevers cling together, by mean's of <hi>order,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one entire company, to be called, when thus united,
<hi>one univerſall Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt, I appeal to any candid &amp; learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
whether he ever in his life knew any of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
who gives us a poſitive Catalogue of which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Congregations are to he held for true Churches
and a part of the univerſall; which no, but to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from it as hereticall: or whether himſelf can ſtand
to it poſitively upon Grounds given &amp; agreed upon by
them, that ſuch &amp; ſuch a Congregation is without the
verge of the univerſall Church, ſuch with in it. My ſelf
have lived in circumſtances to be aſwell acquainted with
their doctrine as moſt men are; and I profeſſ ſincerely
were my life at ſtake &amp; onely redeemable by the reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this queſtion, I could not determin abſolutely upon
any Grounds conſtantly acknowledg'd by them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Preſbyterians, Anabaptiſts, or Quakers are to be
excluded from the univerſall Church, or no. And if we
cannot determin of ſects ſo neer at hand, though preſt
to it by our converſation &amp; carriage to declare &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ
our ſelves diſtinctively, much leſſe can we expect it
in order to the <hi>Armenians, Ethiopians, Iacobites,</hi> with
whoſe cuſtomes and tenets we are ſo litle acquainted</p>
                  <p>But alas! how vain is it to expect from Proteſtants ſuch
a diſtinctivenes of true beleevers from falſe, who have
no Grounds to make ſuch a diſtinction. For what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
have they to character a <hi>true beleever?</hi> Is it to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the letter of the Scripture ſufficient? All
Hereticks in the world almoſt own this; <hi>Arians</hi> &amp; <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi>
who deny Chriſt's divinity moſt of all. Is it the
true ſence of it? how shall they agree in this without ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
certain mean's or Rule to interpret it &amp; make them
agree. Muſt the common doctrine of the univerſall
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:115675:313"/>
Church interpret it? This is the very thing we are in
queſt of, and (till wee know what particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are to bee held true Churches) know not yet which
it is. Muſt conſent of fathers? They have no Authority
but from the Church in which they lived, and as decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of her doctrine; unles therefore we have ſome Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
to conclude antecedently, that the Church whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
they taught was the true Church, we are ſtill igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
whether they be true fathers and to be beleeved, or
no. Is it the private Spirit? The moſt frantick Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts
then have an equall pretence? Is it private reaſon?
In ſteps the <hi>Socinian,</hi> and indeed all hereſies in the
world, for every one hath a private reaſon of his own,
and can uſe it to his power in interpreting Scripture. But
my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Derry</hi> ſeems to drive another way, affirming
here p. 43. that <hi>he knows no other neceſſary Articles of faith
but the Apoſtles creed,</hi> though other Proteſtant Authors
affirm more. This then according to him muſt be the
fundamentall Rule of faith and the Touch ſtone to try
who are true beleevers, who not. The <hi>Puritans</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
who deny'd one of thoſe Articles, to wit Ghriſts deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
into Hell, muſt be excluded quite from the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
Church; yet we ſee Proteſtants communicate with
them aſwell nay more than with Anabaptiſts, nor are
they look't upon with a different eye from the other
ſects, or as more ſeparated from the Church than the
reſt. Again, as <hi>Puritans</hi> are excluded by this Principle,
ſo all that reject any thing but theſe twelve Articles are
admitted by it, as part of God's Church. Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that though any ſect deny the Government of the
Church by King, by Bishops, by Pope, by Patriarch,
by Lay-elders, by private Miniſters, nay all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Proceſſion of the holy Ghoſt, all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
nay all the whole Scripture, except what inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres
with thoſe twelve points, are members of God's
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:115675:314"/>
Church. Reader, canſt thou imagin a greater blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?
Again, when he ſays the <hi>Apoſtle's creed is onely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
and fundamentall, he either mean's the <hi>words</hi> of
the Apoſtles creed onely, or the <hi>ſence</hi> &amp; meaning of it.
If the former, the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> hold it, whom
yet I conceive he thinks no part of God's Church. If
the latter, either the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> or we muſt be excluded
(contrary to his tenet) from the univerſall Church; for
ſince points of faith are <hi>ſence,</hi> and we take two Articles,
to wit, that of <hi>Chriſt's deſcending into Hell</hi> &amp; that of the
<hi>Catholike Church,</hi> in a different ſence, it follows that we
have different points of our creed, or different creeds;
and therefore either we or they muſt fundamentally err
and be none of the univerſall Church. Where then is
this determinate univerſall Church, or how shall we
finde it by the Proteſtants Principles, no certain mean's
being left to determin which Congregations are worthy
to be call'd <hi>particular</hi> Churches and ſo fit to compound
that <hi>univerſall;</hi> which not, &amp; to be excluded from her.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond point; in caſe there were many <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
Churches, yet an <hi>univerſall</hi> ſignifies <hi>one univerſall,</hi>
every univerſality involving an Vnity; and ſo, they muſt
have ſome ty to vnite them, according to the natures of
thoſe particulars: Now thoſe particulars conſiſt of men
governable according to Chriſt's law; and ſo the whole
muſt be a body united by order and Government, for
things of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kinde cannot be otherwiſe
exteriorly united. But I have already shown (in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regoing
Section) that the Proteſtants Grounds have left
no ſuch order &amp; ſubordination of univerſall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in God's Church; therefore no univerſall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Common-wealth, that is, no univerſall Church.</p>
                  <p>To show then this <hi>determinate univerſall Church</hi> being
the proper anſwer for the Bishop let me ſee how he be
haves himſelf in this point. Firſt, he toyes it childishly,
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:115675:314"/>
telling us that <hi>the Proteſtants acknowledge not indeed a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Church, that is one man who is as infallible as the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Church.</hi> I anſwer nor wee neither: Ere he calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niates
the Church with any ſuch pretended tenets, let
him show out of her decrees they were hers, otherwiſe
if he will diſpute againſt private men, let him quote his
Authors &amp; fall to work. Secondly, he tells us they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
a <hi>Repreſentative Church,</hi> that is a <hi>generall</hi>
Councill: with ſignifies nothing, unles they firſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
certainly who are good Chriſtians and fitt to vote
there, who Hereticks &amp; ſo vnfit; that is, till they show
what Congregations are truly to be called <hi>Churches;</hi> and
what Church, made up of ſuch and ſuch, is to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>univerſall;</hi> otherwiſe, how can a <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of
the univerſall Church, which is a relative word, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
to be ſuch, unles it be firſt known which is the
univerſall Church it ought to repreſent. Thirdly, he tells
us they acknowledge an <hi>Eſſentiall Church.</hi> I marry, now
we come to the point. Expect now, Reader, a <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
univerſall Church,</hi> ſo particularly character'd that
thou canſt not fail to acknowledge it. <hi>The Eſſentiall
Church, that is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the multitude or multitudes of
beleevers.</hi> His [<hi>that is</hi>] ſeem'd to promiſe us ſome <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate</hi>
mark of this Church; and he onely varies the
phraſe into [<hi>beleevers</hi>] a word equally obſcure as the
former, equally queſtionable, nay the ſelf ſame que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
For 'tis all one to ask which is a Congregation of
right beleevers, as to ask which is a true Church. But
this is his vſuall and even thrid bare trick, with which
Mountebanklike he deludes his Readers, and is too
much inveterate in his manner of writing ever to hope to
wean him of it. They can do no more than shuffle about
in Generall terms &amp; hold ſtill to indeterminate, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
&amp; <hi>univerſall expreſſions,</hi> who have no Grounds to
carry home to <hi>particular things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="600" facs="tcp:115675:315"/>
He concludes with telling his Reader that we are <hi>in five
or ſix ſeverall opinions what Catholike Church is into which
we make the laſt reſolution of our faith.</hi> Whither away my
Lord? The queſtion at preſent is not about the <hi>reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of faith,</hi> nor about the formall definition of a Church.
but about what viſible materiall perſons &amp; countries ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
up the Church. That you cannot pitch upon theſe in
particular I have already shown; that we can, is as viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as the ſun at noon day; to wit thoſe countries in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe and no other are
to us parts of the uniuerſall Church. Every ordinary fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of your or our ſide can tell you what theſe are; 'tis
as eaſie to do it, as to know which is a Papiſt-Country
(as you call it) which not: And, even in thoſe places
where they live mixt with others, as in <hi>England,</hi> they
are diſtingvishable from others by moſt viſible Marks.
Our Rule to diſtinguish our flock from Stragglers, is
the acknowledgment of immediate Tradition for the
Rule &amp; Root of faith; and of the preſent Government
of our Church under <hi>S. Peter's</hi> ſucceſſor; who ſo ever
renounced this Government, or differ'd from us in any
other point recommended by that Rule, at the ſame ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
and in the ſame act, renounced the ſaid ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
certain Rule (and, by renouncing it, their being
of the <hi>Church;</hi>) as did your ſelves confeſſedly in the reign
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th and the Greeks with all out caſts
for thoſe points in which they differ from us. To this all
Catholikes agree, what ever ſchool men diſpute about
the Reſolution of faith. Show us a Church thus pointed
out viſibly, and ſuch evident &amp; manifeſt Grounds why
juſt ſo many and more can be of it, or els confeſſ you
have loſt the notion of an univerſall Church, nor hold
or know any.</p>

the whole buſines, though it ſeeme to ſpeak coyly
&amp; mincingly. Did they ever make laws to renounce and
abrogate the Popes Authority, and define abſolutely
againſt eſſentiall right? Did they ever erect an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
Superior (as you did the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>)
and pretend that he was in no manner of way ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordinate
to the Pope, but vtterly independent on him?
Did any of them ever ſeparate from the Church by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledging
his Head ship, and by conſequence the
Rule of faith, immediate Tradition, which aſſerted it?
Not one: Did not your ſelf in your vindication p. 184.
after your had put down the parallell acts of <hi>Henry the

that <hi>Henry the 8th abolished the Iuriſdiction of the

(with whom you run along with your parallel in other

you put downe a gradation of the oppoſitions of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Kings to the Pope tell us onely, as the higheſt
ſtep of it, that <hi>they threaned him further to make a Wall
of ſeparation between him &amp; them.</hi> If then they but <hi>threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
to do what K. H. (as appears by this law which vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
renounces the Pope) <hi>did,</hi> it follows plainly that
they <hi>did nothing,</hi> and King Henry <hi>did all,</hi> as farr as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
our Controverſy; which is not about extent of his
Authority, or in what caſes he may be check't from
exerciſing particular Acts of that Authority, but about
the denying the very <hi>Right</hi> it ſelf, and (which is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent)
by denying joyintly the Rule of faith, and by
thoſe denialls ſeparating from the Body of the former
Church, which held both. The ſignification then of this
iuggling phraſe <hi>in effect</hi> (as apply'd to our purpoſe) by
his own interpretation, is this; that other Catholike
countries did juſt <hi>nothing,</hi> and King Henry the 8th did
<hi>all.</hi> To no imaginable purpoſe then ſave onely to show
his diligence in nothing the politicall wranglings between
Kings and Popes, are all the inſtances produced by the
Bishop that Catholike Kings in ſuch &amp; ſuch particular
caſes permitted not the Pope to execute what he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
unles he can deny his own words and prove that
they <hi>did</hi> as much as K. Henry and not <hi>threaned</hi> onely.</p>
                  <p>But my Ld of <hi>Derry</hi> having taken a great deal of pains
to gather together theſe notes, which (the way being
new) he made account would come of bravely, grows
much perplex't to ſee them all defeated at once by sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
plainly that they are nothing to the purpoſe, and
therefore both heretofore and eſpecially at preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
much that we anſwer them not in particular, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Reader, that would our cauſe have born it, we
had done ſo. Was ever man ſo ignorant of the common
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:115675:316"/>
laws of diſputing? Needs any mory anſwer be given to
particulars which one yeelds to, than to ſay he grants
them? We grant therefore all his particular inſtances of
theſe conteſſ between Kings &amp; Popes, and yeeld willin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly
that ſuch &amp; ſuch materiall facts happen'd &amp; many
more; not entring into that diſpute how far they were
done iuſtly, how far un iuſtly, which is little to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
ſince the Authority it ſelf was ſtill acknowledg'd
on both ſides. What need we anſwer each in particular,
by ſaying, firſt I grant this, next I grant the other. Now
the uſe or application he makes of them, that is, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
thence that they did as much as King Henry the
8th, ſo to iuſtify him, is a <hi>particular</hi> point and, <hi>one;</hi> and
to this I have anſwer'd particularly, both here and alſo
in my third Section, where I have demonſtrated it to be
the moſt shameles &amp; manifoldly contradictory abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that ever bid defiance to the univerſall acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and ey-verdict of the whole word.</p>
                  <p>Vpon occaſion of his alledging that <hi>all Catholike coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
do the ſame in effect againſt the Pope as the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
I raiſed an exception of his incoherent manner of
writing; To which he thus replies p. 45. <hi>But what is the
Ground of his exception? nothing but a contradiction.</hi> As
if he made account that a <hi>contradiction</hi> is a matter of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor worth excepting againſt. His contradiction
is this, that our doctrine concerning the Pope is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to Princes &amp; prejudices their crowns, and yet that
we hold &amp; do the ſame againſt the Pope in effect as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
do. He would ſalve the contradiction, firſt, by
alledging that <hi>Papiſts may be injurious to Princes in one
reſpect &amp; one time, and do them right in another reſpect and
another time.</hi> Well, my Lord; but, ſince the doctrine of
the Papiſts concerning the ſubſtance of the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is ever conſtantly the ſame (for none can be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
longer then they hold it) it knows no varitie of
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:115675:317"/>
reſpectt not times, and ſo if it be prejudiciall in it ſelf
once 'tis prejudiciall alwayes. The extent of it varies upon
occaſions: this conſiſts in an indiviſible &amp; cannot alter.
This <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of his Authority, is the point which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to you to impugn, if you go to work conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſince you are onely accuſed of Schiſm for rejecting
this, not for hindring him from acting in particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Either grant then that this tenet is not pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>udiciall
to Princes, being like yours, and then you contradict
your former pretence, that it was; or ſay that yours is
prejudiciall to Princes alſo, being <hi>the ſame in effect</hi> with
it; and then you have evaded indeed a contradiction, but
by as great an abſurdity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to show his former anſwer was nothing
worth, he alledges that I have <hi>changed the ſubject of the
Propoſition,</hi> and that <hi>he ſpoke not of Papiſts, but of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
&amp; Court of Rome;</hi> No Ld, but I would not let you
change the ſubject of the whole queſtion. 'Tis a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from all the <hi>Churches</hi> in Communion with <hi>Rome</hi>
that you ſtand accuſed of; the undeniable fact evidences
that you have broke from all thoſe Churches by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
thoſe two ſaid Principles of Vnity in which
they agree. This is our accuſation againſt you, and ſo
your excuſes muſt be apply'd to this or elſe they are no
excuſes at all. Now one of your excuſes is that <hi>the Pope's
Authority is prejudiciall to Princes;</hi> and it muſt be mean't
of the Pope's Authority as held univerſally by all thoſe
Churches, elſe why did you ſeparate from all thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
upon that pretence. But thoſe Churches univerſally
(as you ſay) <hi>hold the ſame in effect with the Proteſtants</hi>
(for you ſay you ſeparated from the <hi>Court</hi> onely:) what
needed them excuſes from you to them, unles there had
been a contradiction in the buſines. Had you oppoſed
onely ſome attempts of <hi>the Court of Rome</hi> by your te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
you might have remain'd ſtill united with <hi>France,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:115675:317"/>
Spain,</hi> &amp;c who did (as you confeſſ) <hi>the ſame in effect;</hi>
but now you remain diſunited from Catholike countries
and their Churches in the very tenet of the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
held by them as our eyes teſtify, therefore 'tis
evident 'twas the doctrine of all thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> you leſt,
and would vindicate your ſelf for leaving by pretending
that doctrine <hi>injurious to Princes,</hi> and by conſequence
you contradict your ſelf.</p>
                  <p>In order to the ſame point, and to let him ſee that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
<hi>reſtrictions</hi> of the Pope's Authority avouched by the
laws &amp; practice of Catholike countries concern'd not
faith as the Proteſtants renouncind the Authority it ſelf
did, I told him (<hi>Schiſm Diſarm.</hi> p. 321.) that <q>the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe's
did not caſt out of Communion thoſe Catholike
divines which oppoſed them; and that this argues that
it is not the Roman Religion nor any publike tenet in
their Church which binds any to theſe rigorous aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which the Proteſtants condemn.</q> He replies firſt
thus, I <hi>know it is not the Roman Religion, their Religion &amp;
&amp; ours is the ſame.</hi> So you ſay, my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to honour your
ſelves which ſuch good company; but, anſwer ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
are not the Roman Religion &amp; yours different in
this very point of the Pope's Supremacy, which is the
thing in hands? and do not the Romaniſts excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
you and think you of another Religion becauſe
you hold it? True it is you may account them of your
Religion becauſe you have no bounds but voluntary,
and ſo can take in &amp; put out whom you pleaſe; but they
who are bound to a certaine Rule of Religion, cannot
do ſo; becauſe your new fashion'd tenets ſtand not with
their Rule: To what end then is this show of condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to shuffle away the point? Again, if theſe rigorous
aſſertions which you impugn be not their Religion, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
other more moderate tenet concerning the Pope's
Authoritz is their Religion; for 'tis evident that all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:115675:318"/>
Doctors defet ſomething to the Pope as a point
of their Religion, or as received upon their Rule of faith;
why did you then reject the more moderate tenet which
belongd to their Religion, becauſe ſome men attribute
more to him by their more rigorous tenets, which you
acknowledge belong not to their Religion? or how do
you hope to excuſe your ſelf for rejecting the more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
tenet of the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Pope's Authority, by
alledging that others held the <hi>extent</hi> of it too rigorouſly?
Is this a ſufficient Plea for your breaking God's Church?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he confeſſes that thoſe rigorous aſſertions
extending thus the Pope's Authority <hi>are not the generall
tenet of</hi> our <hi>Church.</hi> Whom do you impugn then? or to
what end do you huddle together thoſe pretended extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies
for your vindication? muſt you neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the ſubſtance of the Popes Authority which was
generally held by all, and ſo break the vnitie of the
Church, becauſe there was a <hi>tenet</hi> attributing too much
to him, which you confeſſ to have been not generally
held, nay generally reſiſted? what Logick can conclude
ſuch an Act pardonable by ſuch a Plea?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee affirms that the Pope's many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
Princes, Doctors and whole Nations,
for reſiſting ſuch rigorous pretences. True, he excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
them, as pretending them diſobedient, or
infringing ſome Eccleſiaſticall right, as he might have
done, for violently and unjuſtly putting to death ſome
Eccleſiaſticall perſon, and in an hundred like caſes: and
no wonder, becauſe as a Prelate he has no other Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
to obtain his right when it is deny'd him. But did
he ever excommunicate them as directly infringing the
Rule of faith, or did the Catholike world ever looke
upon them as on Hereticks when thus excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as they look't upon you renouncing in terms the
very Authority it ſelf? Nay did not the Pope's when
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:115675:318"/>
their Paſſion heated by the preſent conteſt, was over,
admit them into Communion again, though ſtill perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
in their unretracted oppoſition? what weaker then
than to think they were ſeparated from the Church for
oppoſiting thoſe more rigorous pretences? or that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
came down recommended by that Rule of faith, as
did the Authority it ſelf which you rejected, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
it be came held by all the Churches of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
for Schiſmaticks &amp; Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to let us ſee that hee will not ſtand to his
former Anſwer hee tells us that <hi>the Pope &amp; his Court had
ſomething elſe to do than to enquire after the tenets of priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
Doctors.</hi> That is, after himſelf had taken a great deal
of pains to prove that <hi>all Catholike Kings,</hi> abetted by
their Doctors and Caſuiſts, had thus reſiſted the Pope
in theſe particular caſes that is, that it was <hi>Publikely</hi> done
all over the whole Church, hee alledges in the next pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
that onely <hi>private.</hi> Doctors held it. So fruitfull is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of contradictions.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, hee alledges, that <hi>perhaps thoſe Doctors lived
about the time of the Councells of conſtance &amp; Baſile,</hi> and
then the Popes durſt not meddle with them. Yet many,
if not moſt of the inſtances produced by him are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
ſome of them, as that of <hi>Portugall,</hi> in our dayes,
and not paſt ſeaven years ago, another of the <hi>Venetians</hi>
in this very laſt age; which no [<hi>perhaps</hi>] can make <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the time of thoſe Councells.</hi> Score up another ſelf
contradiction. What hee means by their <hi>living perhaps
out of the Pope's reach,</hi> none can tell. The Pope's Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Iuriſdiction, by which hee acts ſuch things, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates,
reachers as far as thoſe Churches in
Communion with <hi>Rome,</hi> as all men know, and if our
Bishop ſpeak of thoſe who lived in other places, hee
changes the ſubject of the queſtion, for wee ſpeake of
Doctors abetting Roman <hi>Catholike</hi> Kings &amp; Kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
in ſuch oppoſition.</p>

                     <pb n="608" facs="tcp:115675:319"/>
Sixthly, hee asks <hi>what did the Sorbon Doctors of old
value the Court of Rome</hi> S. Trifle not my Ld; they ever
valued the tenet of the Popes Supremacy as a point of
faith; what they thought of the <hi>Court</hi> concerns not you,
nor our Queſtion; nor are you accuſed or out of the
Church for not over valving or not juſtly valuing the
<hi>Court,</hi> but for under-valuing the very ſubſtance of the
Pope's Authority, and calling that an <hi>Error</hi> which the
Rule of faith delivered us as a <hi>point of faith.</hi> In a word all
your proceſſ here is convinced to be perfectly frivolous
&amp; to no purpoſe; ſince none of theſe things you alledge
as done by Catholike countries are thoſe for which you
are excommunicate, caſt out of the Church, &amp; accuſed
for Schiſmaticks &amp; Hereticks by us: but another far
greater, not at all touched by you; towit, the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
&amp; diſacknowledging the very inward Right of the
Pope. Which shows that all your allegations are nothing
but laborious cobwebs, ſigns of a fruitles induſtries, but
vtterly unable to ſupport Truth.</p>
                  <p>I upbraided them upon occaſion, for their bloody laws
and bloodier execution. Hee referrs me for Anſwer, to
his Reply to the Bishop of Chalcedon. Where hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
a long-law preamble no wayes appliable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
caſe; which even by his own Confeſſion is this,
whether (though treaſonable acts be punishable) acts
of Religion ought for any reaſon be made treaſon, and
the exerciſers of them punish't as Traitors meerly upon
this Score becauſe they performed ſuch acts. That this
was the caſe, is evidenced moſt manifeſtly out of the
laws themſelves every where extant; which make it trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and death to hear a Confeſſion, or to offer up the
unbloody Sacrifice of our Saviours Body, &amp;c. and out
of their own remitting this ſtrange treaſon at the very
laſt gasp, nay rewarding the perſons oſten, if they would
renounce their tenets &amp; accompany them to their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:115675:319"/>
Theſe are our manifeſt and undeniable proofs: what
arguments does hee hring to blinde the Evidences? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but obſcure conceits to be look't for in mens
breaſts, pretended fears &amp; ielouſies that all who exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſuch acts of Religion were Traitors, &amp; meant to kill
and ſlay the Governors, or at moſt ſome particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps
of private perſons, either true or counterfeited; if
ſome were true, it was, no wonder that ſuch hert bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
&amp; paſſions should happen, where people were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
forced to renounce the faith they had ſo zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
embraced &amp; were bred &amp; brought up in; and per ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
no Proteſtant party living under Catholikes
but have had the ſame or greater examples of the like
attempts. Yet I excuſe not thoſe who attempted any thing
againſt Government, nor accuſe the Governors for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them as they deſerved: onely that the faults of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
should be ſo unreaſonably reflected upon all, nay
upon Religion it ſelf, as to make the formality of guilt
conſiſt in the performing ſuch acts of Religion, was moſt
ſenceles, malicious, nay ſelf condemning, ſince their
own Profeſſion admits the hearning a Confeſſion to be
a lawfull act of Religion, and you would yet willingly
hear them, if the people were not wiſer then to go to ſuch
ſleightly authoriz'd Ghoſtly fathers. Nor do I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that you would think your ſelves very well dealt
with if the preſent Government becauſe of ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of ſome of your party againſt them, which they know
to have been back't, promoted, &amp; fomented by ſome
of your Lay Clergy, should there upon preſently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
laws to hang as Traitors every one of the ſaid Clergy,
whom they found either hearning a Confeſſion or ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Church Government by Bishops; a point
as much condemn'd by the preſent Government as any
of our tenets was by Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> If then you would
think this very hard dealing, acknowledge others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:115675:320"/>
moderate, and your ſelves to have been moſt
unreaſonably cruell.</p>
                  <p>In his p. 48. if hee mean as hee ſayes, hee clears our
<hi>Religion</hi> from deſtroying <hi>ſubjection to Princes,</hi> I ſubſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me;
But, the Supremacy of the Pope is to us a point of
faith, that is a point of Religion, therefore the holding
the ſaid Supremacy, is according to him (if hee means
honeſtly, that is, as hee ſpeaks) no wayes injurious to
Princes. If any extent of this power, pretended to bee
beyond it's juſt limits, hath been introduced by Canon-Lawyers
or others, let him wrangle with them about it;
our Religion and Rule of faith owns no ſuch things, as
is evident by the univerſality of Catholike Doctors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
in particular caſes againſt the Pope, when it is
neceſſary, as the Lawyers in <hi>England</hi> did againſt the
King, without prejudice to their Allegiance; which I
hope characters thoſe Doctors in his eye to bee good
ſujects to their Governors. Yet he is ſorry to have done
us this favour, or to ſtand to his own words, even when
they ſignify onely Courteſy. Hee alledges therefore that
<hi>theſe inſtances cited by him</hi> (of Catholikes diſobeying the
Pope in behalf of Kings,) <hi>were before theſe poyſonous
opinions were hatched,</hi> and ſo they do not prove that all
Roman Catholikes <hi>at this time</hi> are loyall ſubjets. Yet
himſelf in his vindication p. 194. (ſo naturall is ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to him) told us of as violent acts done againſt
the Pope in Cardinall <hi>Richlieu's</hi> dayes; in <hi>Portugall</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
lately, and in a maner the other day, in which alſo
the Portugeſes were abetted by a Synod of <hi>French</hi> Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops
in the year one thouſand ſix hundred fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ty one, who
were poſitive &amp; very round with the Pope in their behalf.
Theſe were ſome of his inſtances in this very ſeventh
Chapter; which now (a badd memory and ſelf contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
is ever a certain curſe to falshood) hee tells us
<hi>were before our ſeditions, opinions were hatched.</hi> Now what
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:115675:320"/>
                     <hi>ſeditious opinions</hi> have been hatched or can bee preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to have been hatched within this five years, I dare
ſay hee is ignorant: And, leſt you should think I wrong
him, you shall hear him contradict himſelf yet once-more
(ſo fully does hee ſatisfy his Reader on all ſides)
&amp; affirm here p. 49. that <hi>hee hopes that thoſe ſeditio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s
doctrines at this day are almoſt buried.</hi> So that ſpell the
Bishop's words together, and they ſound thus much,
that thoſe pretended ſeditious doctrines had their birth
&amp; buriall both at once, and were entomb'd in their shell;
that is, were never hatch't at all: So cruelly if you but
confront the two faces of the ſame <hi>Ianus</hi> does hee fall
together by the ears with himſelf, baffle &amp; break his ſelf
divided head, &amp; with one ſplay leg trip up the other.</p>
                  <p>After this, hee preſents the Reader with a plat from of
the Church fancied by mee, as hee ſayes; for which gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
fault he reprehends mee ironically, telling mee that
<hi>'tis pitty I had not been one of Chriſt's Councellors when hee
form'd his Church;</hi> that <hi>I am ſawcy with Chriſt,</hi> what not?
Now I never apprehended <hi>Chriſt</hi> had any Councellors
at all when he firſt form'd his Church, till the Bishop
told mee hee had, &amp; wish't I had been one of them; or
fancied any thing at all, unles hee will ſay that what Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
received from their forefathers and what with
their eyes wee ſee left in the Church ſtill, is onely the
work of my fancy: which is non-ſence; for I onely took
what was delivered, as of faith, by immediate Tradition,
to wit that S. Peter was conſtituted by Chriſt Prince of
his Apoſtles, and that the Pope was his Succeſſor into
that Office; and then show'd the admirable convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
the moderation, the neceſſity of that form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
how innocent if taken in it's due limits (as
held out to us by the Rule of faith) to temporall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
nay how beneficiall to the ſame, how abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary for and perfectly concerning the Vnity
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:115675:321"/>
in the Church; how impoſſible the ſaid Vnity is without
it, &amp;c. which, if it bee <hi>Saucines,</hi> hee may with the ſame
reaſon accuſe all divinity of <hi>Saucines</hi> which takes what
faith hath delivered, for example that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
&amp; thence proceeds to show the conveniency, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
&amp;c. of the Incarnation; But the poor Bp. who
has buſied all his life in not in quaint concieted ſtories
&amp; odd ends of Teſtimonies, never had leiſure to reflect,
that this is the method which Science takes when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<hi>a poſteriori;</hi> firſt building upon what it finds to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
been done, by experience or other Grounds, and
thence proceeding to finde out the cauſes why or by
which ſuch things were done.</p>
                  <p>In Anſwer, the Bishop pretends firſt that hee will <hi>take
my frame in peeces;</hi> whereas hee not ſo much as handles
it, or looks upon it; formine concern'd a <hi>Viſible</hi> ty of
Church Vnity, his diſcourſe reckons up out of <hi>S. Paul</hi>
ſeven particulars, all which (except onely the common
Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm</hi>) are <hi>inviſible</hi> &amp; latent, &amp; ſome
of them no wayes proper to a Church.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>one Body.</hi> Well leap't again, my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, you
are to prove firſt we are <hi>one Body,</hi> if the Vnity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(conſeru'd by all thoſe who acknowledge the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes

this, and then ask what can be more prodigious then
for the members of the ſame Body to war with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
wee were inded once <hi>one Body,</hi> and as long as the
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers remain'd worthy of that Body there was no warr
between them: But, as when ſome member becomes
corrupted, the reſt of the members if they do wiſely, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke

incurable: nay when you would needs be no longer of

the onely paſſage for divine beleef (that is certainty

tokens, that is, by common exterior ties, that you are
<hi>one Body</hi> with us ſtill, not to ſuppoſe it, and talk a line
or two ſleightly upon that groundles ſuppoſition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>one Spirit; that is the Holy Ghoſt</hi> which hee
rightly ſtyles, <hi>the common ſoul of the Church.</hi> But his
Lp muſt prove firſt that they are of the <hi>Body</hi> of the
Church, ere they can claim to be informed by the <hi>Soul</hi>
of it. It is not enough to talk of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> which is latent
&amp; inviſible; &amp; Quaker or Adamite can pretend that at
pleaſure; but you muſt show us viſible Marks that you
are of that <hi>Body,</hi> and ſo capable to have the ſame Spirit
or <hi>Soul;</hi> otherwiſe how will you convince to the world
that you have right to that <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>one hope of our calling.</hi> This token is both
inviſible again; and beſides makes all to be of one
Church; Iews &amp; all, if they but ſay tthey <hi>hope</hi> to go to
Heaven; &amp; who will ſtick to ſay that?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>one Lord;</hi> in order to which hee tells us wee
muſt be friends, becauſe <hi>wee ſerve the ſame Lord</hi> Dark
again! How shall wee know they ſerve the ſame Lord?
Becauſe they cry <hi>Lord, Lord?</hi> or becauſe they call him
<hi>Lord?</hi> Their viſible acts muſt decide that. If then wee
ſee with our eyes that they have broke in peeces his
Church, &amp; renounced the only-certain Grounds of his
law, they muſt eithers how us better Symptoms of their

ſervice and reſtore both to their former integrity by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledging
them; elſe wee can not account them
fellow ſervants to this Lord, but Rebells &amp; enemies
againſt this Lord &amp; his Church.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly <hi>one faith.</hi> But how they should have one faith
with us, who differ from us in the onely certain, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in the onely Rule of faith; as alſo in the ſence, that is,
in the <hi>thing</hi> or <hi>tenet</hi> of ſome Articles in the <hi>creed;</hi> or, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
how they can have <hi>faith</hi> at all but <hi>opinion</hi> onely,
whoſe beſt Authors &amp; writers confeſſ they have no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; ſo ſayes nothing; and therefore is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeu'd
for barely ſaying wee have <hi>one faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>one Baptiſm.</hi> As if Hereticks who are out of
the Church could not all be baptiſed But hee tells us
that <hi>by Baptiſm wee fight vnder the ſame Standard.</hi> That
wee should do ſo becauſe of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> I grant indeed; But,
as hee who wears the colours of his Generall, &amp; yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
his Army &amp; fights againſt it, will find his colours
or Badgeſo far from excuſing him, that they render him
more liable to the rigour of Martiall law &amp; treatable as
a greater enemy; ſo the badge of Chriſtianity received
in Baptiſm, is ſo far from being a plea for them who are
out of the Church or for making them eſteemed one of
Chriſt's and hers, if they run away from her &amp; take par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
againſt her, that it much more hainouſly enhances
their accuſation, and condemns you whom the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
matter of fact joyn'd with your acknowledgment
of ours for a true Church manifeſts moſt evidently to
have done both.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>one God who is father of all,</hi> &amp;c. By which if it
be mean't that God is a father by <hi>Creation</hi> or ordinary
<hi>Providence,</hi> them Iews, Pagans, &amp; Atheiſts are of God's
Church too; if in the ſence as God is fathers of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
you muſt firſt prove that you have his Church on
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:115675:322"/>
earth for your <hi>Mother,</hi> ere you can claim God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for your <hi>father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, to shew how weak a writer this Bp. is let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
peruſe here my p. 324. &amp; 326. and hee shall ſee our
charges is that without this Government, they have no
common ty under that notion to vnite them into one
Chriſtian common wealth; and therefore, that having
rejected that Government, unles they can show us what
other viſible ty they have ſubſtituted to that, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be shown to be Chriſtians or of Chriſt's flock, but
ſeparates &amp; Aliens from it. Wee deny them to be truly-nam'd
Chriſtians for want of ſuch a viſible ty; now the
Bishop, inſtead of showing us this, ſuppoſes all hee was
to prove; towit that they are of Chriſt's Church, and
reckons up ſome inviſible motives propoſed by <hi>S. Paul,</hi>
to Chriſtians already acknowledg'd for ſuch, to vnite
them, not into <hi>one Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> (for that was preſuppoſed)
but into <hi>one harmony of affections.</hi> There is no doubt then,
but all the ſeven points alledged are ſtrong motives to
vnite Chriſtians in <hi>Wills;</hi> but it is as undoubted on the
other ſide that none of them onely pretended, (and
being inviſible they can be but pretended) is a ſufficient
Mark to know who is a true Chriſtian, who not: nor
was this <hi>S. Paul's</hi> intent as appears by the quality of the
perſons hee writes to, who were all <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Now <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
being ſuch becauſe of their <hi>faith,</hi> it followes that
the Vnity in <hi>faith</hi> is the property to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as ſuch,
and conſequently in <hi>Government</hi> (which, by reaſon of
it's concernment, ought in all reaſon to bee a point of
<hi>faith</hi>) &amp; not in <hi>charity</hi> onely, for this extends it ſelf to
Infidells &amp; all the world. Since then, the Bp. goes not
about to show viſibly their Ground for vnity of <hi>faith,</hi>
that is, a common Rule of faith to his fellows and the
reſt, nor yet a common Government which may show
them viſibly, &amp; to us, to be of the Church, and on the
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:115675:323"/>
other ſide ſtands indited by undeniable matter of fact to
have rejected thoſe points which were &amp; are viſibly ſuch
to the Church they broke from, 'tis no leſſe evident that
hee hath not ſaid a word to the purpoſe but ſtole it away
(as his cuſtome is) from the open field of the plain char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
to inviſible holes. In a word thoſe propoſalls of <hi>S.
Paul</hi> are motives why Chriſtians should be united in
Wills, and alſo why thoſe who are not Chriſtians should
be of the Church, and Chriſtian common wealth, not
the proper ties which make them of it; for theſe muſt
be viſible, remarkable &amp; known, as are <hi>de facto,</hi> our
form of Government, our Rule of faith. The frame
then of the Church, as put by me, was thus viſible; the
joynts of it recounted by the Bp. out of <hi>S. Paul</hi> inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
yet the ſincere man pretends here when hee brings
theſe inviſible points to take my frame in peeces; &amp; to
look upon it in parcells. Which is to prevaricate from
the whole Queſtion, and, inſtead of anſwering, to abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
&amp; wrong his Adverſary.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee ſayes <hi>hee will not diſpute whether Chriſt
did give S. Peter a Principality among the Apoſtles, ſo wee
will be content with a Principality of order;</hi> and hee wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes
I <hi>had expreſt my ſelf more clearly whether I bee for a
beginning of order &amp; Vnity,</hi> or <hi>for a ſingle Head of power
&amp; Iuriſdiction.</hi> I anſwer, I contende for no ſuch ſingular
Head ship of power, that no Bishop in the Church hath
power but hee; for this is known to bee the Hereſy which
<hi>S. Gregory</hi> did ſo ſtoutly impugn when hee writ againſt
<hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> A Principality or <hi>Primacy of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
I like well; provided this <hi>order</hi> ſignify not, as the
Bp. would have it a <hi>dry order</hi> which can do nothing; but
ſuch an <hi>order</hi> as can <hi>act</hi> &amp; <hi>do</hi> ſomething, according to it's
degree &amp; rank; as the word <hi>order</hi> imports, if taken in
the Eccleſiaſticall ſence; and as it is taken when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to bee the proper ſence of it in our Controverſy, it being

ſubordination to whom all the faithfull remain united in
the notion of Governed; If this bee neceſſary, as plain
reaſon avouches, then wee ask where you have leſt this
<hi>ſtanding ordinary</hi> Principality of power, ſince you have
renounc't the Pope's Supremacy?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly I added, <hi>and conſequently to his Succeſſors.</hi> This
conſequence expreſt in <hi>generall</hi> terms, hee tells us, hee
<hi>likes well enough,</hi> and that <hi>ſuch an head-shippe ought to
continue in the Church;</hi> but hee cannot digeſt it that ſuch
an Head ship should bee devolued to the Bp. of <hi>Rome:</hi>
yet, what other Succeſſor <hi>S. Peter</hi> had that could bee
properly call'd ſuch, (that is ſuch a one who ſucceeded
him dying) except the Bp. of <hi>Rome,</hi> himſelf will never
attempt to show us. This conſequence then of ours, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
in the Principality of <hi>S. Peter's</hi> to the Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi>) which hee calls a rope of ſand) hangs together
thus, that whenſoever Chriſt conferrs any power to any
ſingle perſon to be continued for the future good of the
Church, and has taken no further order for it's conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
hee is deem'd likewiſe to have conferd it upon
thoſe to whom according to the order of nature it is to
come. Now the naturall order requires that offices &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnities
should be devolu'd to thoſe who ſucceed thoſe
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:115675:324"/>
perſons dying who were veſted with them, in caſe there
bee no other ordinary &amp; convenient mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> inſtituted to
elect or transfer it to another. That Chriſt leſt any ſuch
inſtitute that his Church should continue this dignity by
<hi>election,</hi> or traverſe the common method of ſucceſſion,
wee never read; but on the contrary wee fide <hi>de facto</hi> that
the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Primitive Church enjoy'd a
Principality by ſucceſſion, &amp; not by nomination of the
Catholike Church; nor is it convenient but extremely
preter naturall, that this Principality being of perpetuall
neceſſity (as hee grants) the Church should remain
without it at the death of every Pope, till all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in <hi>Iapan, China, India,</hi> or where ever remotely
diſperſt in all parts of the habitable world, should bee
ask't &amp; give their conſent whether the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
should ſtill continue with this Principality, or no. No
other means then being layd or leſt to croſſ this way of
ſucceſſion, as appears by common ſence and the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of the Church, it follows that this naturall order muſt
take place, and ſo the particular dignity of <hi>S. Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to thoſe who ſucceeded him dying in his ſee of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</hi>
His Argument then which hee pretends parallell to
mine, that <hi>ſuch a Bishop of ſuch a ſee died Lord C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of England, therefore all ſucceeding Bishops of the ſame
ſee muſt ſucceed him likewiſe in the Chancellor ship of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
comes nothing home to my caſe; for here is a
ſupreme ſtanding Magiſtrate, to elect another &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
ſucceſſion; the transfering that charge is eaſily &amp;
conveniently performable; here are poſitive laws &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes
made known &amp; accepted that a King should do
this; But, put caſe that there were none of all theſe
means of electing a new perſon, on foot in the world,
and that the Chancellor ship were to be perpetuated,
there would bee no doubt in that caſe but the naturall
order would take place there alſo, and the Succeſſors of
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:115675:324"/>
that Bishop would ſucceed alſo into the Chancellor ship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt left</hi> (hee tells us) <hi>the cheif managing of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his ſpouſe, that is, the Church.</hi> Pretty ſence! ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
thus much that the <hi>Church</hi> or univerſality of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

muſt govern themſelves, &amp; have no cheif Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
at all; Is it not rare that the Bishop should think
<hi>Chriſt's family,</hi> and his <hi>Spouſe</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> are two diſtinct
things! What hee adds, that hee leſt it not to any ſingle
ſervant further then as ſubſervient to his ſpouſe; is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true; and all Governours in the world are or ought to
bee ſubſervient to the common good of the governed,
as even the Angells are <hi>Spiritus adminiſtratorij,</hi> yet no
more can the ſubjects command their Governours, than
wee can command Angells. And ſo the <hi>chief Church,</hi> &amp;
her Bishop the chief Governour of Chriſt's family are
<hi>for the good</hi> of the Church, thouh <hi>over</hi> the Church; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wever
my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> who looks into the ſounds of words &amp; not
the meaning of them, enflames the expreſſions, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
them to flanting &amp; proud ſence.</p>
                  <p>Hee tells us that <hi>Rome may bee deſtroyed with an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake;</hi>
I anſwer it muſt be an unheard of Earthquake
which can ſwallow up the whole Dioceſe; for, if the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
onely run that hazard, the Clergy of the Roman Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe
yet remain who can elect to themſelves a new Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop;
And no harm will ſucced to our cauſe. Next, hee
ſayes, <hi>it may become hereticall or Mahumetan?</hi> True, ſo
may the whole Church if it had pleaſed God ſo to order
cauſes. But that it pleaſes him not wee have this ſtrong
preſumption, that the good of his Church, ſo much
concern'd in the perpetuity of this ſucceſſion (as hath
been shown) will crave his perpetuall aſſiſtance to that
ſee. Wee have alſo for pledge of this perpetuity the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of his gratious conſervation of it for ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, &amp; the eſtablishment of it at preſent, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us the leaſt Ground to think it's ruine likely. If his
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:115675:325"/>
Lp do, and that this trouble him, at leaſt let him yeeld
his obedience till that happens, and then preach liberty
from <hi>Rome's</hi> Iuriſdiction to thoſe that shall live in that
age. What hee addes concerning the <hi>Churches diſpoſing
of her offices</hi> is meer folly: Himſelf granted in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
page that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf (&amp; not the Church) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
this Principality; let him them show firſt that
the Church hath Authority to change Chriſt's Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
ere he thus frankly preſume it left to the Churches
diſpoſall.</p>
                  <p>Next, hee tells us that <hi>betweene Tyranny &amp; Anarchy
there is Ariſtocracy which was the ancient regiment of the
Chriſtian Church.</hi> Wee blame them not for renouncing
any <hi>one</hi> ſort of Government but <hi>all</hi> Government in the
Church; and alledge that there is no Kinde of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which actually vnite? God's Church in <hi>one</hi> but this
of the Pope's Headship. An Ariſtocracy ſignifies a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by ſome cheif perſons, who ſitt either conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or elſe often, &amp; eaſily meet that the difficulties occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in the ordinary Government of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth
may bee ſettled by them. Was this the ordinary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Primitive Church? Had they any generall
Council (which the Bishop means by <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> as
appears by his p. 56. l. vlt. till <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> time? Nay
have wee had any this ſix handred years or indeed eight

Farewell Church Government, and many thanks
to my good L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Derry</hi> &amp; D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. H<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. But I moſt wonder
that a man of his Principles could finde no middle ſort
of Government between Tyranny &amp; Anarchy but <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy;</hi>
Is <hi>Monarchy</hi> with him none at all, or none of
the beſt, which even now hee told us was of divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution?
You good people who depend ſo zealouſly of
this new Prelacy, obſerve how your Dooctrs have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a very short memory to inform you right, or a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtrong will to cheat you into the wrong.</p>
                  <p>Heed adds, that <hi>a Primacy of order is more ſufficient in
this caſe to prevent dangers and procure advantages to the
Church than a Supremacy of power.</hi> Which ſignifies thus
much directly in other terms, that hee who hath <hi>no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>
to <hi>act</hi> at all in order to the univerſall Church or as a
<hi>firſt,</hi> hath <hi>power</hi> to procure her more good, &amp; prevent
more harms towards her, that is, hath power to <hi>act bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
for that Church, than hee, who has <hi>power</hi> to <hi>act,</hi>
hath. And thus my friend here feaſts his Readers with
<hi>contradictions,</hi> his whole diſcourſe being ſuch in it's ſelf
&amp; wants onely to bee put into ſomething more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
terms of the ſame ſignification.</p>
                  <p>After I had put down the neceſſity &amp; yet moderatenes
of the Pope's Authority as held of faith by us, I added,
<q>that this was the bridle our Saviour put in the mouth
of his Church, to wield it ſweetly which way hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</q>
My Bp. replies that I <hi>make the Church to bee the Beaſt
and the Pope's office to ride upon the Church.</hi> No, my Lord,
I ſtyl'd the Pope's <hi>office,</hi> the <hi>Bridle;</hi> do bridles uſe to <hi>ride</hi>
upon horſes? or did your Lp ever meet a bridle on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back?
I ſee the Bishop is a better <hi>Bowler</hi> then hee is an
<hi>Hors-man.</hi> Next, hee tells us that <hi>our Saviour put his
bridle not into the mouth but hand of his Church.</hi> Good my
L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> inform us (for you chop your Logick ſo ſnall &amp; are
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:115675:326"/>
grown ſo myſteriouſly acute that without a revelation
none can underſtand you) when the Church holds the
bridle <hi>in her hand,</hi> as you ſay, whom does she govern
by that bridle? Do the whole multitude of beleevers
hold the bridle &amp; govern themſelves? Then there are
no Governors at all, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>at leaſt none diſtinct from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
which is all one. Or, do ſome Governors one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold the bridle &amp; weild by it the multitude of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?
then returns his Lp's cavill &amp; buffets himſelf, that
<hi>then the Church is the Beaſt</hi> (as hee irreverently wantons
it) and <hi>thoſe Governors ride upon the Beaſt,</hi> and the brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
gets into the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the Church again, for as <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors</hi>
are ſaid to hold the reins or bridle, ſo, if wee will
proſecute the metaphor into an Allegory, the <hi>Governed</hi>
muſt be ſaid to have it in their <hi>Mouths,</hi> that is to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
&amp; guided by it. So unfortunate is his Lp that hee
can neither approve himſelf a good Controvertiſt, nor
a tolerable guibbler; but, while hee pretends to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
in the former, he ſtill runs into contradictions; when
witty in the latter hee rambles into abſurdities; and, in
either performance, his own both Arguments &amp; Quips
light upon his own head.</p>
                  <p>I repreſented the advantages &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>veniences this Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
brought to the world when duly obſerved by good
Pope's. Hee replies that I <hi>write dreaming as Plato did,
and look upon men not as they are but as they ought to bee.</hi>
This miſtake is of the ſame ſtrain, onely ſomething mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
voluntary. I look not my Lord upon <hi>men</hi> at all in this
place, but ſpeak of the <hi>Office</hi> it ſelf; how admirabily
convenient it is if rightly performed. What <hi>men</hi> do, or
how they execute it, whether well or ill concerns not a
Controvertiſt no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> mee; the point or <hi>tenet</hi> concerns mee.
The perſonall managing this office is not of faith, and
belongs not to mee but to Hiſtorians &amp; Lawyers to talk
of; the <hi>Office</hi> it ſelf is of faith, fals under the ſphere of
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:115675:326"/>
Controverſy &amp; is my task to defendit. What ſay you to
the <hi>Office</hi> it ſelf, as put down here by mee. Return my
L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> whence you ſtray'd; and tell us, is not the <hi>Office</hi> it
ſelf thus moderately yet ſubſtantially expreſt naturally
conducing to the peace, Vnity, Faith, Diſcipline, &amp;
other univerſall conveniencies of Chriſtendome? or is
it, though thus advantageous to the whole Church, to
be rejected becauſe of the abuſes of particular perſons?
Theſe are the points between us; what ſay you to theſe?
why, in the next parag. hee would have us look upon
the caſe <hi>without an if</hi> or <hi>as a Pope should bee;</hi> no my
Lord, I ought not in reaſon to quit that method; you
&amp; I are not diſputing about mens lives, but the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<hi>tenet</hi> and whether the very <hi>tenet</hi> bee advantageous
to the Church or not. If wee leave this wee leave the
whole Queſtion. Yet wee muſt leave the Queſtion, elſe
my Lord will not proceed nor diſpute; telling us that <hi>if
wee look upon the caſe without an if,</hi> or, <hi>as the Pope should
bee</hi> (that is indeed if wee look <hi>not</hi> upon the caſe) <hi>then
wee shall finde the Papacy as it is ſettled or would have been</hi>
(ſayes hee) <hi>the cauſe of Schiſms, Eccleſiaſticall diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
war amongſt Princes,</hi> &amp;c. Where firſt, if nothing
follows out of my words but this diſiunctive (<hi>as it is ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
or would have been</hi>) then it remains for any thing
hee expreſſes, that, <hi>as it is ſettled,</hi> it is not apt to cauſe
any of theſe inconveniences; but onely <hi>would have been,</hi>
in caſe ſome vicious attemptors had had the power to
corrupt that which was actually well in the Church.
Next, if hee ſpeak of the Papacy, <hi>as it is ſettled,</hi> hee muſt
look upon it as held by the Rule of faith and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
by all Romane Catholikes; otherwiſe if hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
it according to what is diſputable &amp; wrangled
about between Catholike &amp; Catholike, hee conſiders
it not as ſettled, for this is to bee <hi>not ſetled:</hi> nor indeed
is this to ſpeak of the <hi>Papacy</hi> it ſelf (about which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:115675:327"/>
have no debates) but of the <hi>extent</hi> of it. Now,
let him either evince that Papacy as <hi>ſettled</hi> or held uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
by all Catholikes, is in it's own nature the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
of Schiſms, diſſentions, Warrs, &amp;c. Or grant that
'tis not ſuch, but the contrary; as hee does here tacitly,
by yeelding that if it were as <hi>it should bee</hi> it would bee
faultles, and preſently doubting whether it bee right ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
(that is, as it should bee) or no.</p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of the Pope's Authority being ſtated,
I show'd all the Bishop's arrows falling on his own head;
becauſe, not with ſtanding ſuch diſputes, it is evident
<q>that the nature and notion of <hi>one</hi> Church is intirely
conſerved; the Papacy ſtanding firm in thoſe very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
countries, which reſiſted the Pope, and thoſe
countries governing themſelves in an Vnity of faith &amp;
Sacraments, &amp; correſpondence like one Body, as is
viſible; whereas their Reform or renouncing the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
has cut of England from all this Communication
or correſpondence, and made it no part of one Church
greater then it ſelf, but an headles Synagogue without
Brother hood or order.</q> Hee replies; <hi>Neither ſo, nor ſo.</hi>
How then, my Lord? why hee tells us firſt that <hi>the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
Southern &amp; Northern Churches admit none higher
then the cheifeſt Patriarch.</hi> Well, my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, are you and they
both joyntly under the Government of thoſe Patriarchs,
or any other common Government? If not, how are
you then of one community or Brotherhood as <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</hi>
Next, hee alledges that <hi>agreat part of the Weſterne
Churches have shaken of the Roman Yoke.</hi> Grant it were
ſo, and that thoſe <hi>Congregations</hi> were in reality <hi>Churches,</hi>
(which wee deny) yet are you united with thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
under ſome common Chriſtian Government, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
you &amp; them into one Chriſtian Commonwealth?
If not (as your eyes witnes 'tis not) then how are you
their <hi>Brothers</hi> or of their community? Show us this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:115675:327"/>
ty of order uniting you together; To ſay you are
<hi>one</hi> or united to them, without showing us this extern ty,
is very eaſy, but convinces nothing. Thirdly, hee tells
us that <hi>the reſt of the Weſtern world which acknowledge the
Papacy, do it with very many reſervations, cautions, and
reſtrictions.</hi> Very good, my Lord! if they onely <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd,</hi>
they reſtrain'd <hi>ſomething</hi> which they <hi>admitted,</hi>
as thus reſtrain'd; to wit, the ſubſtance of the Pope's
Authority. Are you at leaſt united with them? Alas no:
you are diſunited from them, by totally <hi>renouncing</hi> (and
not <hi>reſtraining</hi> onely) that Authority which viſibly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them. Where then is your <hi>Brother hood?</hi> where is
your <hi>order?</hi> Fourthly, hee anſwers, that for <hi>order,</hi> they
<hi>are for it as much as wee.</hi> That you are <hi>for it</hi> &amp; deſire it
(if your Grounds would let you (wee doubt not: But
<hi>have</hi> you any ſuch <hi>order</hi> uniting you viſibly to the reſt
of the Chriſtian world? To ſay you <hi>are for it,</hi> when the
Queſtion is whether you <hi>have</hi> it no, without ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to show us this viſible <hi>order,</hi> ſignifies you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have any nor can show any; or, that you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a feeble wish for it, but not efficacious enough to
make you uſe means to obtain it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, hee tells us, that <hi>for Chriſtian Brother hood</hi>
they <hi>maintain it three times larger then wee;</hi> But he never
goes about to show us any viſible ty of Government,
uniting them into one Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth or Brother hood.
'Tis a ſufficient proof with him to ſay they <hi>maintain</hi> it;
that is, they <hi>call</hi> more Brothers then wee do; but, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are ſo <hi>indeed</hi> or no 'tis ſo evident with him
(though hee knows his own fellows ſay the contrary, as
may bee ſeen in <hi>Roſſe's view of Religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi>) that it needs no
proof though it bee all the Queſtion; Sixthly, as for
their being <hi>an headles Synagogue,</hi> hee replies that <hi>they
want no head who have Chriſt a ſpirituall Head.</hi> Wee are
demanding a <hi>viſible</hi> common Head or cheif Governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:115675:328"/>
of the whole Church common to <hi>England</hi> with the reſt,
and hee relates us to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Heaven. Such an Head is
God Amighty to all mankind, muſt they therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of this <hi>inviſible</hi> relation become one <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monvealth.</hi>
Again, this latter, towit, whether Chriſt bee their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Head or no, is inviſible &amp; unknown, and is to bee
judged by the other thus; that, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> have leſt any
Vnity of Goverment in his Church and commanded it
to bee kept, and they have taken a courſe to leave no
ſuch Vnity, 'tis evident that they have rebell'd againſt
<hi>Chriſt</hi> as well as his Church, and ſo falsly pretend to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
him for their <hi>ſpirituall Head.</hi> Next, hee tells us that
they have <hi>a generall Council for an Eccleſiaſticall Head.</hi>
Which is to confeſſ that there is no <hi>ordinary</hi> Vnity of
Government in God's Church, but <hi>extraordinary</hi> onely,
when a Council ſits, that is, there is none <hi>de facto</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
nay <hi>morally impoſſible there should bee any</hi> (as Dr.
H. ſayes <hi>Reply</hi> p. 39.) and 'tis a great chance when there
is any, <hi>perhaps towards the end of the world,</hi> as the ſame
Dr. imaginarily gheſſes; which you muſt conceive will
bee in Antichriſt's time, who (according to their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples)
will bee the <hi>Head of the Church.</hi> And, laſtly, that
they have <hi>a gracious Prince for a politicall Head.</hi> Whoſe
inward right if it bee loſt by long preſcription as the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
world grants it many, it follows that they can in that
caſe pretend to no Head at all in caſe the ſucceſſour hap
to bee no Proteſtant. But I wonder the Bishop is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous
to his own tenet, that whereas they ever held
the King to bee <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> or <hi>cheif</hi> in <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall</hi>
matters, hee should now deny it and put him to
bee onely <hi>a politicall Head,</hi> as contradiſtinguish't from
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall;</hi> that is, give him no more then <hi>France,

viſible Head or Government, but how they are
<hi>one</hi> with the reſt of the Chriſtian world, though having
that pretended Head? Is there any orderly common ty
of Government obliging <hi>this Head</hi> to correſpend with
the <hi>other Head?</hi> If not, where is the Vnity or common
Headship of the whole, Church? or how is England vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
united to it, vnder this notion? If there bee, why
should the Bp envy us the happy ſight of this rarity
which (&amp; onely which) would ſatisfy the point, clear
his credit, &amp; vindicate his Church.</p>
                  <p>His cavill that <hi>ſometimes wee have two or three Heads,
ſometimes never an Head,</hi> is falſe &amp; groundles; ſince the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
can bee but one true or rightly-choſen Pope, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
there may bee more pretended ones; and, till hee
who is choſen bee known &amp; euidenced to bee ſuch, the
Headship or cheif Government is in the cheif Clergy of
the chief ſee, whom wee call <hi>Cardinalls;</hi> unles a generall
Council actually ſit. As ſecure a method for the peace

power, as mans wit can invent; though (as in all huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

of miſcarriages, ſidings &amp; animoſities.</p>
                  <p>Hee promiſes us (to shew the Vnity of Proteſtant
Churches amongſt themſelves) that <hi>the Harmony of
Confeſſions will demonſtrata to the world, that their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
are not ſo many, nor of ſo great moment as imagining.</hi>
I anſwer, that truly I am ſo far from imagining any thing
concerning their differences, that I know not even what
the word <hi>Contreverſy</hi> means; till they give us ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rule to ſettle Controverſies, &amp; to tell us which
<hi>Controverſies</hi> are of <hi>faith,</hi> which of <hi>opinion</hi> onely: But
does <hi>the Harmony of Confeſſions</hi> show us (not in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
expreſſions of the <hi>word,</hi> but) in the particularity
of the <hi>thing,</hi> that they have one common certain Rule
of faith, infallibly ſecuring then that ſuch points &amp; no
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:115675:329"/>
other were taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſort of Government, obliging them to an Vnity
under the notion of <hi>Governed,</hi> as a common ty? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingleſſ;
that is, it does leſſ than nothing: and leaves my
other objection good, that otherwiſe they have no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Vnity then a body compoſed of Turks, Iews, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and Chriſtians; Nor does the Bp. diſprove it
otherwiſe than by reckoning up again the former moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
to Vnity in <hi>affections</hi> out of <hi>S. Paul:</hi> Six of which are
inviſible; and ſome of them equally pretendable nay
actually pretended by Turks, Hereticks, &amp;c. As de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
to them by him; nor can they be in reaſon refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them, till hee gives us ſome certain Rule of faith,
obligingly &amp; ſatisfactorily convincing that ſuch ſects in
particular are to be admitted, ſuch to bee abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
which hee will never do without entangling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
worſe than formerly. And, as for <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th
motive; 'tis out of doubt amongſt all the world,
that Hereticks may have true <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> though the Bp.
here forgets himſelf, &amp; ſays the contrary. At leaſt the
Turks <hi>Ianiſaries</hi> who are children of Chriſtians, &amp; ſo
<hi>Baptiſed,</hi> cannot bee refuſed according to his Grounds
to bee his Brother-Proteſtants; this being the onely vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ty the Proteſtants have with the <hi>three parts of the

                  <p>
                     <q>Laſtly, I alledged, that their pretended faith conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in <hi>vnknown fundamentalls,</hi> which is a meere Shiſt
untill they exhibit a liſt of ſuch points &amp; prove them
ſatisfactorily, that they, &amp; onely they, are eſſentiall
to Chriſtian Communion.</q> Hee replies, they <hi>need not
do it.</hi> Why? mee thinks the point ſeems very needfull;
yes, but <hi>the Apoſtles have done it</hi> (hee ſayes) <hi>to their
hands in the creed.</hi> And how proves hee that the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
intended this creed as <hi>a liſt of all fundamentalls?</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(for hee put neither before, nor yet here any other
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:115675:329"/>
proof) in that <hi>the Primitive Church</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
that no more should bee exacted of any, of Turks, or
Iews in point of faith, when they were converted from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm
or Iewiſm to Chriſtianity.</hi> And, how proves hee
the Primitive Church <hi>exacted no more?</hi> out of his own
manifold falſification of the Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> already
manifeſted (Sect. 1.) And this is the whole Ground of
his certainty, that thoſe points are <hi>onely fundamentall,</hi>
or that they have any liſt of fundamentalls, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that there is any Grounds of Vnity in materiall
points amongſt the Proteſtant Churches, or that they
are of the Church, ſince the Church hath in her ſelf
Grounds of Vnity. I omit that the learned Bp. makes
account <hi>Turks</hi> are <hi>Pagans,</hi> or <hi>to bee converted from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm;</hi>
whereas, 'tis known they acknowledge a God:
and affirms that <hi>the Primitive Church in the Council of
Epheſus</hi> (for to this hee relates as appears p. 5.) held in
the year 430. <hi>order'd</hi> any thing concerning <hi>Turks,</hi> which
ſect ſprang not till the year 630. that is 200. years after.
Both good ſport, did not the Bp. cloy us with ſuch ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of mirth.</p>
                  <p>Again, when hee ſaies <hi>the Apoſtles creed is a liſt of all
fundamentalls;</hi> either hee means the <hi>letter</hi> of the creed,
and then hee grants <hi>Socinians</hi> &amp; <hi>Arians</hi> to bee <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi>
both which admit the letter of the creed, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
their own way; and excludes the <hi>Puritans</hi> from
all hopes of Salvation for denying a fundamentall, towit,
<hi>Chriſts deſcent into Hell.</hi> Or elſe, hee means the <hi>ſence</hi> of
the creed; and then hee excludes the Roman Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
whom yet in other circumſtances hee acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to bee of the Church; for they hold ſome Articles
found there, in <hi>another ſence</hi> than do the Proteſtants.
Let him then prove evidently that no points of faith
were held formerly as neceſſary ſave thoſe Articles in the
Apoſtles creed; next tell us whether hee means the <hi>letter</hi>
                     <pb n="630" facs="tcp:115675:330"/>
onely or the ſence of the creed; then show us ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily
which is the onely true ſence of it; and, laſtly,
apply that piece of doctrine to particulars, and ſo show
us which ſects are of the Church, which excluded, &amp;
wee shall remain very much edifyd.</p>

alſo out of common ſence that wee take it in this latter

that is not as underſtood by us but by himſelf, and then
impugns his own miſtake citing <hi>S. Bernard</hi> who exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> to humility, bids him conſider that
<hi>the Roman Church, Eccleſiarum Matrem eſſe non Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,
is the Mother not Lady of all Churches.</hi> And this
is another attempt of his <hi>needles fortifying.</hi> My L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of
<hi>Derry</hi> may pleaſe then to underſtand that when wee ſay
that <hi>the Roman Church</hi> is <hi>Mother</hi> &amp; <hi>Miſtreſſ</hi> of other
Churches; wee take the word [<hi>Mother</hi>] as relating to
her <hi>Government,</hi> or power of <hi>governing,</hi> whoſe correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is a ſweet ſubjection, not a hard or rigorous ſlavery:
and the word [<hi>Miſtreſſ</hi>] as expreſſing her power of <hi>tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</hi>
Or, if the Bp. bee loath to grant the word [<hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſ</hi>]
taken in our ſence, (which yet hee never goes
about to impugn or diſprove) let him but allow &amp; ſtand
to what the teſtimony himſelf brings here avouches, to
wit that <hi>shee is Mother of other Churches,</hi> and that shee
hath right to rule and teach her children as a <hi>Mother</hi>
should do, &amp; 'tis as much as wee deſire.</p>
                  <p>Now, let us apply this &amp; ſee how rarely the Bishop hath
cleared himſelf of Schiſm &amp; layd it at our do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e: Hee hath
brought a teſtimony which aſſerts the <hi>Church of Rome to
bee the Mother of other Churches,</hi> and ſo of the Church

this place deny her that title, but ſeems to grant it; But
it is manifeſt <hi>de facto</hi> and by their ſolemn ordinances &amp;

                     <pb n="632" facs="tcp:115675:331"/>
but a ſleeveles manner of <hi>fortifying.</hi> Again, Schiſm
involves in it's notion <hi>diſobedience,</hi> and the Bishop in this
chapter pretends to show her <hi>Schiſmaticall,</hi> that is <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient;</hi>
to do which hee brings us a teſtimony which
aſſerts our Church to bee <hi>Mother of other Churches;</hi> and
then concludes the <hi>Mother</hi> Schiſmaticall, becauſe shee
is <hi>diſobedient</hi> to her <hi>Daughter:</hi> Pithy non-ſence! or, if
made ſence, flatly accuſing their Church of Schiſm for
diſobeying her <hi>Mother;</hi> and this deducible cleerly from
that very teſtimony hee brought to prove the contrary,
which kind of arguing is in the Bp<hi rend="sup">s</hi> phraſe call'd <hi>needles
fortifying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His pretence of a <hi>new creed</hi> (which was his ſecond ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to prove us Schiſmaticall) made by <hi>Pope Pius
the fourth,</hi> is already shown (Sect. 1.) to bee a calumny:
To which I add, that our <hi>creed</hi> is the points of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef
or faith: ſince then 'tis known that each point in
that <hi>Profeſſion of faith</hi> put out by him, was held as of
faith by the former Church, ere hee thus collected them,
'tis a contradiction to pretend that hee made a <hi>new creed</hi>
till it be shown that any of thoſe points there contained
was not formerly of faith, and prove ſatisfactorily that
the Apoſtles containes all neceſſary points of faith, which
will bee manifeſted at the Greek calends.</p>
                  <p>His third argument was becauſe <hi>wee maintain the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
in a rebellion againſt a generall Council.</hi> To this hee ſayes
I anſwer not a word. Let us ſee whether it deſerves a
word of Anſwer. The difference between a <hi>Controvertiſt</hi>
and a <hi>Schoolman</hi> is the ſame as is between a <hi>Church</hi> &amp; a
<hi>School Controvertiſts</hi> therefore of ſeverall Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
thoſe points &amp; impugn the contrary ones, which
are held by thoſe Churches as <hi>Churches,</hi> that is, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
relying upon their <hi>Rule of faith.</hi> Either then
let him show that our Church holds as of <hi>faith,</hi> or as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
upon her <hi>Rule of faith</hi> the Pope's Supremacy to a
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:115675:331"/>
generall Council, elſe in impugning that point hee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
prevaricates from the office of a Controvertiſt, hath
done nothing which was his duty, and ſo merits no anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
ſave onely this, that <hi>if hee will diſpute againſt priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
opinions, hee muſt cite his Authors, &amp; argue againſt them
not the Church; whoſe beleef is contained in the decrees of
Councils, and univerſall conſent of fathers &amp; Doctors.</hi>
Which anſwer I then gave him expreſly, <hi>Schiſm Diſarm.</hi>
p. 327<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, to show the vanity of this third argument, let
him either manifeſt that our Church preſt upon them
this point of holding the Pope above Councils, ſo as to
excommunicate them upon their contrary <hi>tenet;</hi> elſe all
pretence of our cauſing the Schiſm is avoided; for, in
caſe it were not thus preſt, his argument ſtands thus; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many Schoolmen &amp; a great party among them held
that <hi>opinion,</hi> where upon wee left their Church; <hi>ergo,</hi>
they are moſt guilty of the Schiſm. Which is as ſenceles
a paralogiſm as a ſleepy brain could have ſtumbled on.
For, why should any break Church-Communion as
long as hee can keep it with conſcience? or, how is my
conſcience concern'd in other men's <hi>opinions</hi> as long as
they permit mee to hold the contrary: Now, that our
Church permits the contrary <hi>tenet,</hi> and denies none
Communion for it, himſelf teſtifies vindication p. 200.
where hee puts down as one of the <hi>tenets</hi> of the <hi>now-french
Church,</hi> that <hi>generall Councils are above the Pope,
and may depoſe him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Bishop was conſcious that hee had neglected the
office of a Controvertiſt by impugning Schoolmen,
Lawyers, &amp; Courtiers inſtead of our <hi>Church;</hi> and an <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
held by <hi>many,</hi> inſtead of a point of <hi>faith</hi> held by <hi>all.</hi>
To delude the Reader, &amp; in reality to oppoſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
which belonged not to him, yet ſeem to ſtrike at
the latter, as hee ought, hee joyns both, however in
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:115675:332"/>
conſiſtent, into one; and, being to wrangle againſt the
Pope's Headship, propoſes it firſt under this Chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
notion, <hi>The Papacy (Quà talis,</hi> or, <hi>as ſuch) as it is
maintained by many.</hi> And this hee calls <hi>laying the Axe
to the root of Shiſm,</hi> though it bee as directly leuell'd a
ſtroak at his own legs, and inflicting as deep a wound on
the ſupports of his cauſe as a <hi>contradiction</hi> can give to
pretended ſence. For ſince all Papiſts as ſuch hold a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi>
or the Pope's Headship of Iuriſdiction over the
whole Church, and differ in this point from Proteſtants,
it is evident that <hi>the Papacy of ſuch,</hi> is that which is held
by <hi>all;</hi> for none can be <hi>Papiſts</hi> longer then they hold it.
Now then to ſay <hi>the Papacy as ſuch, as it is now held by
many;</hi> is the ſame as to ſay, the Papacy <hi>as held by all, as
held by many onely:</hi> which is in other language to legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
an <hi>Hircoceruus,</hi> and to clap together <hi>non ens</hi> and
<hi>ens</hi> into the ſame notion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But, how does hee clear himſelf of this shuffling non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?
why firſt hee asks,</hi> do not ſome Roman Catholikes
ſubject the Pope to a generall Council; and others, nay the
greater part of them, <hi>&amp;c</hi> ſubject a generall Council to the
Pope? <hi>What is this to the Queſtion whether theſe words</hi>
[the Papacy as ſuch, as it is now maintain'd by many]
<hi>cohere in ſence or no?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee asks <hi>whether hee might not then well ſay
[the Papacy quà talis,</hi> &amp;c.] No, my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, for, it being
evident that all Roman Catholikes hold the <hi>Papacy</hi> in
ſome ſence, if you call it <hi>the Papacy as ſuch as it is held
by many,</hi> pray how will you ſtile it as held by all? <hi>as not
ſuch?</hi> or the Papacy with ſuper additions? or can <hi>all</hi> hold
what <hi>ſome</hi> do <hi>not</hi> hold?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee ſaies, <hi>his concluſion was not againſt the
Church of Rome in generall, but againſt the Pope &amp; Court
of Rome, that they were guilty of the Schiſm.</hi> For what?
for maintaining the ſubſtance of the Pope's Authority
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:115675:332"/>
held by <hi>all?</hi> then you accuſe the Church of Rome in
generall of Schiſm, for the Church in generall holds
what <hi>all</hi> in her hold. Or was it for this <hi>opinion</hi> of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
above the Council, and others of this ſtrain? How
were they guilty of Schiſm for this, unles they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
you Communion for holding the contrary, or preſt
upon you an unconſcientious approbation of it, which
you know they did not Fool not your Readers my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>;
'twas not for this <hi>tenet</hi> which you impute to the <hi>Court of
Rome,</hi> but for that of the Pope's Headship or Spirituall
Iuriſdiction over all God's Church, held by all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
and by that whole Church equally then as it is
now, for which you are excommunicated: and ſo, ought
either to ſubmit to that whole Church again in that point,
as formerly; or elſe (if you would deal candidly) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn
that whole Church (and not the Court onely) thus
oppoſite to you in that mainly-concerning point.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as hee ſaies <hi>although, aliquando bonus dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat
Homerus,</hi> that is, <hi>ſometimes honeſt Homer takes a
nodd,</hi> and <hi>though hee had ſtol'n a napp it had been neither
felony nor treaſon, yet to let us ſee hee did not ſleep, he will
put his argument into form without a [quâ talis</hi>] which is
to affect a ſleepines ſtill, or (as our English Proverb
ſaies) <hi>to ſleep fox ſleep.</hi> Hee is accus'd of a contradiction
&amp; non-ſence, and to clear himſelf hee tells us hee will
now lay aſide one part of the contradiction, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make good ſence of the other. Now his firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is that the Court of Rome is guilty of Schiſm
for preferring the Pope before a generall Council, to
which I have already anſwer'd. His ſecond, is that ours
are thus guilty for <hi>making all Apoſtolicall ſucceſſion &amp;
Epiſcopall Iuriſdiction come from Rome onely.</hi> By which,
if hee means our Church as a Church holds it; (as hee
ought if hee ſpeak like a Controvertiſt) 'tis a moſt groſſ
&amp; falſe imputation, as I told him: If of <hi>the Court of Rome</hi>
                     <pb n="636" facs="tcp:115675:333"/>
onely, then, ſince they neither preſt it as of <hi>faith</hi> nor
deny'd you Communion for theſe points, but for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
held by <hi>all</hi> (as I lately show'd) they cannot hence
be concluded guilty nor you guiltles of Schiſm. This
argument paſt over, hee confeſſes this <hi>tenet</hi> is not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
amongſt us; I add, but points of <hi>faith</hi> are generally
held, therefore this <hi>tenet</hi> is but an <hi>opinion;</hi> and being <hi>not
generall</hi> (as hee grants) it follows that it is onely a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
or private opinion; as I call'd it, &amp; his own words
evince it.</p>
                  <p>Yet hee is loath theſe should be call'd private opinions
becauſe they are <hi>moſt common &amp; moſt current:</hi> Whereas,
unles they come down recommended by our Rule of
faith, immediate Tradition or the voice of the Church,
&amp; ſo become perfectly common, generall, univerſall,
&amp; undoubtedly current, our Church looks upon them
onely as deductions of private men's reaſons, nor shall
I own them for other.</p>
                  <p>That the former is a <hi>common tenet</hi> hee brings Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> to ſay that <hi>it is almoſt de fide,</hi> or <hi>a point
of faith,</hi> which the good Bp. ſees not that it ſignifies <hi>it
was almoſt reveald,</hi> or that the revelation fell an inch or
two short of reaching our knowledge; or, that God has
not <hi>indeed</hi> reveald it, but yet that twas twenty to one but
hee had done it. Next that <hi>the Council of Florence ſeem'd
to have defin'd it:</hi> now the word [<hi>ſeems</hi>] ſignifies I know
not that ever it defin'd it at all; or, if it defin'd it ſo, 'tis
more than I know. Thirdly, that <hi>the Council of Lateran</hi>
(I ſuppoſe hee means not the generall Council there
held) <hi>defin'd it moſt expreſly</hi> Yet the Bp, here deſcanting
upon the words of that Council, ſayes onely that <hi>they
ſeem to import no leſſ;</hi> that is, it may bee they mean <hi>no
ſuch thing,</hi> or it may bee they mean <hi>much leſſ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the latter <hi>opinion</hi> (as hee candidly here calls it) hee
tells us <hi>Bellarmine declares it to bee moſt true, that hee ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

been the opinion of the old Schoolmen;</hi> ſpeaking highly
(at leaſt <hi>ſeemingly</hi>) of the Pope's Authority. So that all
is <hi>ſeeming,</hi> all <hi>opinion</hi> and uncertainty. Now the uſe the
Bp. makes of this gear is this; The Court of Rome &amp;
many with it, held an over weening <hi>opinion</hi> of their own
Authority, though they permitted us &amp; whole Churches
to hold the contrary, therefore wee very innocently
broke God's Church; or, therefore wee quite renounc't
the Principles of Vnity in both faith &amp; Government (as
the fact witneſſes you did) becauſe they held an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<hi>op nion</hi> too much extending the latter. In a word
let <hi>Bellarmine</hi> &amp; the Bp. wrangle about the opinionative

                  <p>HEe pretended that <hi>the Proteſtants held Communion
with thrice as many Chriſtians as wee do.</hi> I reply'd
that if by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> hea means thoſe who lay claim to

<pb n="638" facs="tcp:115675:334"/>
Carpocratians, Arians, Neſtorians, Eutychians, and
others without number, do all uſurp the honour of this
title. I added that I did not think hee had any ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to refuſe Communion to the worſt of them. Now,
the Bp'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> task is evidently this to give us this <hi>ſolid reaſon</hi> &amp;

prove any thing; Talking is his &amp; an angry woman's

but deals us largeſſ of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt hee falls into rhetoricall exclamations againſt our
<hi>prejudice, partiality,</hi> want of <hi>truth, charity, candour,</hi> &amp;

all thoſe other ſects are ſuch alſo; otherwiſe his excl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which ſound ſo high in Rhetorick, are very-flat
noted and ſignify juſt nothing in Controverſy, where
the concernment of the ſubject renders all proofs infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to rigorous &amp; convincing diſcourſe, &amp; dull &amp; toyish.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee asks, wherein <hi>can I or all the world
charge the Church of England, of Greece, or any of the
Eaſtern, Southern, or Northern Chriſtians, with any of
theſe Hereſies,</hi> and then reckons up afterwards the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
points held by the <hi>Manichees, Gnoſticks,</hi> &amp;c. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
I could not; are there no other hereſies in the world
but theſe old ones, or is it impoſſible that a new hereſy
should ariſe! It was not for holding thoſe very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
points that I accuſed the Church of <hi>England</hi> or the
Bp. as hee purpoſely miſrepreſents mee; but this, that
having no determinate certain Rule of faith, they had
no Grounds to reject any from their Communion who
held ſome common points of Chriſtianity with them
though differing in others. Again, ſince the Rule of faith
Proteſtants pretend to is the Scripture, and all thoſe
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:115675:334"/>
Hereticks recurr'd ſtill &amp; rely'd upon the ſame (nay
even the <hi>Manichees</hi> upon the new Teſtament) it follows
that theſe are all of the Proteſtants Communion becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
they have the ſame Grounds &amp; Rule of their faith; if
the Bp. reply that the <hi>letter</hi> of the Scripture is not the
Rule of faith but the ſence, hee muſt either show us ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
determinate certain way to arrive to the true ſence
of it, or elſe confeſſ that this Rule is indeterminate &amp;
uncertain, that is (as far as it concerns us) none at all.
Now, though indeed the Proteſtants hapt not to light
into all the ſame materiall errors as did the <hi>Manichees,
Arians,</hi> &amp;c. Yet they agree with them in the ſource of
all error; that is, in having deny'd and renounc't the
onely Ground of faiths certainty, Tradition of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
forefathers, which alone could bring down to us
ſecurity that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was God or that there was ſuch a
thing as God's word: and ſo, the deniall of this is in it's
conſequences equally nay more peſtilentiall then is the
denying the materiall point it ſelf of Chriſt's divinity,
or the aſſerting any other held by the worſt of thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;
They agree with them all therefore in the root
of all errors, though the branches chance (and they but
chance) to be diverſe; as may bee ſeen if you do but
conſider what varieties of ſects are ſprung in <hi>England,</hi>
ſince your ſtrong hand which truly did forbid the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of interpreting Scripture is taken from you; whereof
ſome be as learned as yourſelves, witnes the books of
the Socinians; for 'tis an eaſy matter out of affection
to turn Scripture to variety of errors, as was cleerly ſeen
in <hi>Luther;</hi> who becauſe <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> had publish't the
abſence of Chriſt's Body from the Bleſſed Sacrament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
himſelf, found the middle <hi>tenet</hi> of <hi>compreſence</hi> of
both Body &amp; Bread; and ſo, by that baſe affection, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a great part of the world, through God's Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
from a wickeder error.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="640" facs="tcp:115675:335"/>
Thirdly, hee tells us that <hi>ſome few Eaſtern Chriſtians
are called Neſtorians, others ſuſpected of Eutychianiſm, but
moſt wrongfully.</hi> Though indeed nothing is more right
full then to call them ſo, as even Proteſtants confeſſ.
But you ſee nature works in deſpite of Deſign, and that
hee hath a mind to cling in very brotherly and lovin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly
with the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> &amp; <hi>Eutychians,</hi> though hee
ſaies hee will not; and thoſe <hi>tenets</hi> of theirs which in the

hereſies when <hi>expreſt</hi> were not <hi>expreſſions,</hi> and alſo very
<hi>unvſuall</hi> &amp; new to faith &amp; the faithfull Now their <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſuall
expreſſions</hi> were onely theſe, that <hi>Chriſt had two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
perſons,</hi> and <hi>no distinct natures;</hi> which are nothing
in the Bp'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> mind; had they deny'd <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be God too,
it had been alſo an <hi>unvſuall expreſſion:</hi> but, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ,
a very ſcurry and peſtiferous one, as were the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
But our favourable Bishop thimking it neceſſary to

what hee knows not in excuſe of thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
though it be contrary to the publike and beſt
intelligence wee have from thoſe remote countries.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hee is very piouſly rhetoricall &amp; tells us,
that <hi>the beſt is, they are either wheat or chaff of the Lord's
floar, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as abſurd as the former. That it is <hi>beſt</hi> for them to be

(as hee ſays) that they are <hi>either wheat or chaff,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ
I am at a loſſ to conceive. <hi>Chaffe</hi> Pſ. 1. v. 5. ſignifies
the <hi>vngodly,</hi> and Mat. 3. v. 12. (the very place which

                     </gap>ether hee intends to speak finely or ſolidly. Our
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:115675:335"/>
tongues indeed shall not winnow them, as hee ſays, nor
do we pretend, to do ſo by our tongues, or voluntary
talking (that were to vſurp the method of diſcourſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to himſelf onely) but our <hi>reaſon</hi> will <hi>winnow</hi> them
unles wee turn Beaſts &amp; uſe it not; our proofs, if they
be evident, as our charge of their Schiſmaticall breach
is, <hi>will winnow</hi> them; the Rule of faith (the voice of the
Church or immediate Tradition) will <hi>winnow,</hi> or rather
Chriſt hath <hi>winnow'd</hi> them by it, having already told
them that <hi>if they hear not the Church they are to be eſteemed
no better than Heathens &amp; Publicans.</hi> Since then 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
out of the terms that you heard not the Church for

upon the voice of the Church, nay according to your
Grounds have left no Church, nor common ſuprem
Government in the Church, to <hi>hear,</hi> it follows that you
have indeed <hi>winnow</hi>'d your ſelves from amongſt the
<hi>wheat</hi> of Chriſtians and are as perfect chaff (I mean tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
who have voluntarily broken Church Communion)
as Publicans &amp; Heathens. Now, to show how empty a
brag it is that they hold Communion with thrice as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Chriſtians as wee, to omit their no Communion in
Government already ſpoken of <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. let us ſee what
Communion they have with the Greek Church in <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi>
(by the numeroſity of which they hope for great
advantages) and whether the Proteſtants or wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
nearer them in more points held equally by both.
I will collect therefore out of one of their own ſide, <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander
Roſſ,</hi> the tenets of the preſent Greek Church, in
which they agree with us, though in his manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
our <hi>tenet,</hi> hee ſometimes wrongs us both. <hi>The
Greeks place</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>much of their deuotion in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Virgin Mary, and of painted Images; in the
interceſſion, prayers, help and merits of the ſaints, which they
invocate in their Temples. They place Iuſtification, not in
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:115675:336"/>
faith, but in works. The ſacrifice of the Maſſ is uſed for
the quick and the dead. They beleeve there is a third place
between that of the bleſſed and the damned, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
who deferr'd repentance till the end of their life; If
this place bee not Purgatory</hi> (adds <hi>Roſſ) I know not what
it is nor what the ſouls do there. (View of all Religions</hi> p.
489.) And, afterwards p. 490. <hi>They beleeve that the ſouls
of the dead are better'd by the prayers of the living. They are
no leſſ for the Churches Authority and Traditions than Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholikes bee when the Sacrament is carried through
the Temple the People by bowing themſelves adore it, and
falling on their knees kiſſ the earth.</hi> In all theſe main points
(if candidly repreſented) they agree with us and differ
from Proteſtants. Other things hee mentions indeed in
which they differ from us both, as in <hi>denying the Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Holy Ghoſt, not uſing Confirmation, obſerving
the Iewish Sabbath with the L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> day,</hi> &amp;c. As alſo, ſome
practiſes, not touching faith, in which they hold with
the Proteſtants, not with us; as <hi>in adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
in both kinds, uſing leauened bread in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Prieſts marriage,</hi> there is no one point, produced
by him, which our Church looks upon as a point of
faith in which they diſſent from us and conſent with the
Proteſtants except that one of <hi>denying the Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy;</hi>
for their onely <hi>not uſing Extreme-Vnction,</hi> which
hee intimates ſignifies not that they hold it unlawfull,
or deny it. Iudge then candid Proteſtant Reader, of they
Bp'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> ſincerity, who brags of his <hi>holding Communion with
thrice as many Chriſtians as wee do;</hi> whereas, if wee come
to examin particulars, they neither communicate in one
common <hi>Government,</hi> one common <hi>Rule of faith,</hi> if wee
may truſt this Authour of their own ſide (ſince if the
Greeks <hi>hold the Authority of the Church and Traditions as
much as Catholikes do,</hi> as hee ſayes, they muſt hold it as
their <hi>Rule of faith,</hi> for ſo Catholikes hold it) nor yet in
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:115675:336"/>
any one materiall point in oppoſition to us, ſave onely
in denying the Pope's Supremacy. And how more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
they are even in this than the greateſt part of, if
not all Proteſtants, may bee learned from the Bp'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
teſtimony, at the end of this Section, as alſo from
<hi>Nilus</hi> an avowed writer of theirs for the Greek Church
againſt the Latine, and one of the graveſt Bp'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
of that party, who shuts up his book concerning
the Pope's Primacy, in theſe words. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.
<hi>The ſumme is this; As long as the
Pope preſerves order, and ſtands with truth, hee is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the firſt and his proper Principality, and hee is
the Head of the Church, and chief Bishop, and the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
of Peter and of the reſt of the Apoſtles, and it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
all men to obey him, and there is nothing which can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from the honour due to him; but if, when hee hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
ſtrayed from the Truth, hee will not return to it, hee will
bee liable to the punishment of the damned.</hi> Where, the
Reader will eaſily judge whether the former words ſound
more incliningly to the Catholike or the Proteſtant <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net;</hi>
and, as for the latter words, <hi>But if,</hi> &amp;c. There is
no Catholike but will ſay the ſame. Thus much then for
my <hi>L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of Derry's</hi> Communion with the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church.
And as for his <hi>Communion with the Southern, Northern,
&amp; Weſtern Churches,</hi> which hee thunders out ſo boldly
as if all the world were on his ſide and of his Religion, if
examin'd 'tis no better than the former; ſence his ſide
denies immediate Tradition of forefathers or the living
voice of the preſent Church to bee the Rule of faith,
which is to the Roman Church the fundamentall of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls.
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:115675:337"/>
Nor has hee any other Rule of faith, that
is, a plain and certain method of interpreting Scripture
common to him and his weakly rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ted Brethren; ſo
that if they hit ſometimes in ſome points, 'tis but as the
Planets, whichare ever wandring, hap now and then to
have conjunctions, which hold not long, but purſving
their unconſtant courſe, decline and vary from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by degrees, and are at length croſt by diacentricall
oppoſitions.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of this paragraph inſiſts again upon his often
anſwer'd ſaying that <hi>the creed contains all neceſſary points,</hi>
which is grounded onely upon his falſifying the Council
of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as hath been shown heretofore. To my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
former replies vnto this pretence I add onely this, that
either it is <hi>a neceſſary point</hi> to believe there is ſuch a thing
as God's written word (or the Scripture) or not: If not,
then why do the Proteſtants challenge it for their Rule
of faith? Is not the Ground of all faith <hi>a neceſſary point?</hi>
But if it bee <hi>a neceſſary point,</hi> then all neceſſary points
are not in the <hi>Apoſtles creed;</hi> for there is no news there of
the Scripture: nor is it known how much thereof was
written when the Apoſtles made their <hi>creed,</hi> what hee
adds of our having <hi>cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged from our Ancestors in opinions;</hi>
either hee means by opinions, points of faith held ſo by
us, and then 'tis calumny, and is to be ſolidly proued not
barely ſaid; But, if hee mean School opinions, what
hurt is done that thoſe things should be changed which
are in their own nature changeable? Hee imagins that
Dr. <hi>Field</hi> hath prou'd ſome thing againſt us in this point,
and in anſwer shall imagin that thoſe of ours who have
reply'd to his toyes have diſproved what hee is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to have proved: nor am I further concern'd, unles
the Bp. had produced ſome weighty particular out of
him which yet wanted anſwering, as hee brings none
at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="645" facs="tcp:115675:337"/>
After this hee will needs prove the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
not to have been a Generall one. His exceptions that
<hi>the ſummons were not generall,</hi> that <hi>the foure Protopatriarchs
were not preſent by themſelves nor their deputies;</hi> that <hi>the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
were not ſome preſent from the greater parts of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Provinces,</hi> are already shown to bee frivolous &amp;
impertinent, till hee gives us ſome certain determinate
notion of Church, and ſome certain Rule to know what
ſects in particular are of it, what excluded, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
manifeſted his Ground could give none. For, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
thoſe who are excluded from or are not of the
Church have no right to be <hi>Summon'd</hi> thither (unles to
bee call'd to the Barr as Delinquents) nor to <hi>ſit</hi> there,
nor are to be accounted <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and ſo the ſummons
may bee <hi>Generall,</hi> all may bee there that <hi>should</hi> be the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
and ſome may bee preſent from the greater part of
all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Provinces, notwithſtanding the neglect
or abſence of theſe <hi>aliens.</hi> Hee ought then firſt put
Grounds who are good Chriſtians, &amp; ought to bee call'd,
who not; ere hee can alledge their not being call'd as a
prejudice to the Council. Our Grounds why it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
are theſe. The onely certain Rule of faith and (by
conſequence) root of Chriſtianity, which can ſecure us
of God's word or any thing elſe is the immediate delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or Tradition of forefathers; Thoſe therefore &amp; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe who adhere to this root are to bee held truly
Chriſtians of the Church; thoſe who broke from it
any time (as did the Proteſtants profeſſedly, the Greeks
&amp; the reſt as evidently when they began to differ from
us in any point) are not properly Chriſtians, nor of the
Church; therefore a repreſentative of the Church or
Council is intire, univerſall &amp; <hi>Generall,</hi> though thoſe
latter (who are not of the Church) bee neither <hi>call'd,
Summon'd</hi> nor <hi>preſent,</hi> provided thoſe others who adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
to this root of faith and ſo are indeed <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:115675:338"/>
adherers to Chriſt's law, be Summon'd &amp; admitted:
But ſuch was our Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> therefore it was <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</hi>
Now, to diſprove this Council to bee <hi>Generall,</hi>
if hee would go to work ſolidly, the Bp. should firſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that it was not a ſufficient repreſentative of the
<hi>whole Church,</hi> which muſt bee done by manifeſting defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
and ſatisfactorily, who in particular are of the
Church, who not: nor can this bee performed otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
than by showing ſome <hi>Rule</hi> &amp; root of faith &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
better qualify'd to bee ſuch, that is, more <hi>certain</hi>
&amp; more <hi>plain</hi> than this, which may diſtinguish thoſe
who are of the Church from thoſe who are not of it; or
elſe to convince that the <hi>Greeks, Proteſtants,</hi> Lutherans,
&amp;c. When they began to differ from the <hi>Roman,</hi> inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
not, but were found adhering to that immediate
delivery: otherwiſe they muſt confeſſ that all were Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
that ought to have been Summon'd, all were the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
or might have been there who ought to have been
there, and ſo the Council was <hi>Generall.</hi> Till this bee do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
all his big worded pretences of the abſence of the
whole Provinces, of the greater part of Chriſtendome,
want of due ſummons, fewnes of the members preſent,
that the Greeks are not known Rebells, &amp;c. are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't
to bee but voluntary talk as is indeed almoſt all
this Treatiſe, this being his peculiar manner of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
more fit for old wives &amp; Goſſips at their frivolous
meetings, then for a Bp. and Controvertiſt handling
matters of faith. Hee ſayes <hi>that the Greeks though Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
should have been lawfully heard &amp; condemned in a
generall Council.</hi> What needed <hi>hearing,</hi> when themſelves
in the face of the whole world publikely confeſſed, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
&amp; avowed their imputed fault: <hi>Condemned</hi> they
were by generall Councils heretofore, though the Bp's
particular faculty of ſaying what hee liſts without a word
of proof will not allow them to bee ſuch, nor yet give us
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:115675:338"/>
ſome certain way to know which Councils are ſuch. Or,
had it been an acknowledg'd generall Council and they
<hi>heard</hi> &amp; <hi>condemned</hi> there, ſtill the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. had an evaſion
in lavender; hee laid up in ſtore this reſerve of words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
that <hi>they were never heard, or tried or condemned
of hereſy by any Council or perſon that had Iuriſdiction over
them;</hi> and then hee is ſecure by talking boldy &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing.</p>
                  <p>His ſaying that <hi>though they were Hereticks yet they of
all others ought eſpecially to have been Summon'd:</hi> ſignifies
thus much, that it is more neceſſary to a generall Council
that <hi>Hereticks</hi> bee call'd thither, than that <hi>Orthodox fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
bee ſo. A ſubſtantiall peece of ſence &amp; worthy
conſideration!</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I brought a ſimilitude of a Parliament that known
and condemned Rebells need not bee call'd,</q> hee will
needs have it run on four feet &amp; proſecutes it terribly:
ſome of his beſt trifles I shall reckon up.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hee ſaies <hi>the Pope hath not that Authority over
a generall Council as a King hath over a Parliament.</hi> I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer;
I am ſo plain a man that I underſtand not what the
Authority of <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Parliament</hi> either taken ſingly or
one in order to the other ſignifies: ſome Kings have <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
ſome <hi>leſſ</hi> Authority; ſo have Parliaments; witneſſ
thoſe of <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>France.</hi> To expect then I should
know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow great the Authority of <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Parliament</hi> is
by naming onely the common words is to expect that
one should know how <hi>long a country</hi> is by naming it a
<hi>country,</hi> or how <hi>big</hi> a <hi>mountain</hi> is by barely calling it a
<hi>mountain.</hi> That theſe have ſome great bignes and thoſe
ſome great Authority I know by their common names;
but <hi>how great</hi> I know not. Words, my Ld, may ſerve
you to give, whoſe cauſe will not bear ſence, but they
muſt not ſerve mee to take.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that <hi>the Greek Patriarchs are not known &amp;
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:115675:339"/>
condemned Rebells.</hi> Anſwer, this is onely ſaid again, not
prou'd, and ſo 'tis ſufficient to reply that they who call'd
the Council &amp; all in the Council held them ſo. Again,
the errors which they publikely maintain'd have been
condemned by Councils, &amp; for the moſt part ſome of
their own party being preſent. Now, why thoſe who pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blikly
profeſſ thoſe Errours should need a further cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to triall, or why they are not known Rebells is the
B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> task to inform us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he ſayes, that <hi>the leaſt Parliament in England
had more members then the Council of Trent.</hi> They were
therefore graver and more choice perſons. The Church
ſummons not <hi>parish-prieſts</hi> out of every great town, as
the common wealth doth two Burgeſſes out of every
corporation. Again, what was, it matters not; but <hi>might
not</hi> there bee a Parliament of <hi>England</hi> without having
the fifth part of the members found in that Council, and
yet bee a lawfull one too? Rub up your memory, my
L<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> (you pretend to bee a piece of a Lawyer) and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
you will finde an English law that Sixty members
is a ſufficient number to make a lawfull Parliament; and
before that law was made common conſent &amp; cuſtome
(which is either equivalent or perhaps above law) gave
the ſame for granted.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he excepts againſt the ſuper proportion'd
multitude of members <hi>out of one Province,</hi> which hee
ſayes <hi>never lawfull Parliament had.</hi> I ask, if other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
would neither ſend a fit number nor they had a
minde to come, by what law, by what reaſon should it
render illegitimate either Parliament or Council? Now,
'tis certain and not deny'd by any, but that Bishop's had
as free liberty to come out of other Provinces as out of
<hi>Italy</hi> had they pleaſed. Again, the principall buſines
being to teſtify the Tradition of former ages, &amp; a ſmall
number of Bishops ſerving for that; and the collaterall
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:115675:339"/>
or ſecundary buſines being to examin the difficulties tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
Hereticks, which were the occaſion of the Council,
produced, that they might be confuted fully, &amp; out of
their own mouthes, which is a thing to bee performed
by committees, in which learned men that were not Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops
might ſit, it little inferred the want of Bishops.
Wherefore, if there were any error in the ſupernumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines
of Bishops out of ſome one Province, it was for
ſome other end than for the condemnation of Hereſies,
&amp; ſo is nothing to our purpoſe; unles perhaps my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> will
pretend that had thoſe Catholike B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> out of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
been there, they would have voted againſt their
fellow Catholikes in behalf of <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin.</hi> which
were a wiſe Anſwer indeed.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly hee excepts that <hi>the Council of Trent is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in France in point of Diſcipline.</hi> What then? why, by
his parallell to a Parliament hee concludes hence twas no
lawfull Council. Which is to abuſe the eyes of the whole
world, who all ſee that <hi>France,</hi> who denies the admiſſion
of thoſe points of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> acknowledges it not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
a generall &amp; lawfull Council, and receives it in
all determinations belonging to <hi>faith,</hi> which are ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
to it as it were diſacknowledg'd, were they deny'd;
though not in matters of <hi>fact,</hi> which are accidentall to it's
Authority, nay allow'd by the Church it ſelf (however
made &amp; expreſt generally) to binde particular countries
onely in due circumſtances &amp; according to their conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, hee alledges that <hi>they were not allow'd to speak
freely in the Council of Trent.</hi> Which is a flat calumny; and
though moſt important to his cauſe could hee prove it,
yet after his bold cuſtome, 'tis onely aſſerted by his own
bare ſaying, by <hi>Sleidan</hi> a notoriouſly lying Author of
their own ſide, and by a paſſage or two in the <hi>Hiſtory of
the Council of Trent,</hi> whereof the firſt is onely a ieering
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:115675:340"/>
expreſſion (any thing will ſerve the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>.) the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Pope's creating new Bp's nothing at all to
his purpoſe; ſince both theſe new &amp; the other old B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi>
were all of one Religion &amp; Catholikes; &amp; ſo not likely
to diſſent in vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing Doctrines; which kind of votes are
eſſentiall to a Council &amp; pertinent to our diſcourſe, which
is about <hi>Doctrines</hi> not about Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>After this hee puts down <hi>three ſolutions</hi> (as hee calls
them) <hi>to our plea of the Patriarchall Authority.</hi> Firſt, that
<hi>Britain was no part of the Roman Patriarchate.</hi> And this
hee calls his <hi>firſt ſolution.</hi> Secondly that <hi>though it had
been, yet the Popes have both quitted &amp; forfeited their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall
power; and, though they had not, yet it is lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
transferred</hi> And this is his <hi>ſecond ſolution.</hi> The <hi>third</hi>
is, that <hi>the difference between them and us is not concerning
any Patriarchall Authority.</hi> And this is his <hi>third ſolution;</hi>
which is a very really good one, &amp; shows that the other
need no reply: our charge againſt them being for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the ſupreme Eccleſiaſticall Authority of <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>
Inſtitution; not a Patriarchate onely, of <hi>humane</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
If further anſwer bee demanded, firſt, the Greek
Schiſmaticks, our enemies, confeſſ that <hi>England</hi> was a
part of the Pope's Patriarchate if it bee truly called a We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
Church; ſee <hi>Barlaam Monachus</hi> de Papae Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patu,
c. 11 and Part. 1. Sect. 15. of the adjoyning Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.
Next, it is falſely pretended that the Pope's have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quitted or forfeited their Patriarchall Authority; and
may with equall reaſon bee concluded, that a Bishop
quits Epiſcopall Authority if hee is alſo a Patriarch; or
that a perſon muſt leave of to be Maſter of his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
becauſe hee is made King and his Authority uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
extended to all <hi>England.</hi> Which laſt inſtance may
alſo ſerve againſt the pretended inconſiſtency of the
Papall and Patriarchall power, if it need any more anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
than what hath formerly been given <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="651" facs="tcp:115675:340"/>
I omit his calumnies againſt the Papall Authority cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractering
it falſly as a meere unbridled tyranny. And his
thrice repeated <hi>non-ſence;</hi> when hee joyns in one notion
<hi>Patriarchall Authority:</hi> a <hi>Patriarchy</hi> being a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by <hi>one,</hi> an <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> by <hi>many.</hi> Nor is his other
calumniating expreſſion much better when hee calls the
Papall Authority, a <hi>Soveraign Monarchicall Royalty:</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
it was never pretended by Catholikes that the Pope is
the <hi>King of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The notion of <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> being relative, the
failing of the one deſtroyes the other: ſince then the
Proteſtants have no <hi>Sacrifice</hi> they are convinced to have
no <hi>Prieſts.</hi> This point in particular hee never touch't, but
talk't a little in obſcure terms of matter &amp; form of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
as if it were not an eaſy thing to ſay what words
they pleaſed, and do what actions they pleaſed. To this
the Bishop onely replies that hee over did and <hi>ſet down
the point of Sacrifice over diſtinctly.</hi> Next, hee tells us their
Regiſters are <hi>publike offices, whether any man may repair
at pleaſure.</hi> whereas, our queſtion is not of the <hi>Regiſters</hi>
in generall, but of that <hi>one</hi> particular pretended <hi>Regiſter</hi>
of the right ordination of Proteſtant Bishops, kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
from the free peruſall of Catholikes though the
circumſtances (to wit their alledging the unlawfulnes of
the Proteſtant Bishops ordination) requir'd it should
bee shown.</p>
                  <p>His next paragraph concerning their <hi>uncharitablenes</hi>
needs not bee repeated unles it could be mended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>My expedient to procure peace &amp; Vnity, which was
to receive the root of Chriſtianity, a practicall infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in the Church,</q> hee ſeems willing to admit of. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hee adds that <hi>the greater difficulty will bee what this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Church is;</hi> and indeed to his party 'tis an inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableone;
though to us moſt facil, as I have shown for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
<hi>Sect.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="652" facs="tcp:115675:341"/>
Hee call'd the Bishops of Italy, <hi>the Pope's paraſiticall
pentioners;</hi> I reply'd, <hi>it ſeem'd his Lordship Kept a good
table and had great revenews independent on any.</hi> Hee anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
hee <hi>was not in paſſion,</hi> and that hee <hi>Spoke onely
againſt meer Epiſcopelles;</hi> which is to show that his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is nothing abated yet; by adding ſuch unſavory
Phraſes to his former calumny. Next, hee ſays that,
<hi>as for his ſelf,</hi> hee <hi>never raiſed himſelf by any inſinuations.</hi>
I know, my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, you are a <hi>Saint:</hi> but the point is can
you clear your ſelf from calumny and prove that thoſe
Bishops (whom otherwiſe you calumniate) ever uſed
ſuch <hi>inſinuations.</hi> Hee <hi>was never</hi> (hee ſaies) <hi>paraſiticall
pentioner to any man, nor much frequented any man's table.</hi>
You are ſtill more Saint then formerly, my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>: But, can
you prove that thoſe Bishops (whom otherwiſe you ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate)
are <hi>paraſites,</hi> or was it ever heard of or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that they ſit at the Pope's table? Hee adds, that,
<hi>if his own table bee not ſo good as it hath been yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
&amp; a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt.</hi> Much
good may it do you, my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>; fall to, and eat heartily;
cannot you fare well &amp; hold your tongue, but you muſt
amongſt your dainties ſlander your Neighbours, men
better then your ſelf, by calling them <hi>paraſites, Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles,
the Pope's creatures, hungry,</hi> &amp;c. Or if you do, can
you expect leſſ but that it shall be laid in your dish, to
ſauce your dainties? But the point is how hee proves the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
worthy perſons to bee <hi>hungry paraſiticall pentioners,</hi>
which unles hee does hee yeelds himſelf to bee a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
calumniator. Now, his proof of it is contained in
thoſe words, whether thoſe Bishops were not his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
paraſiticall pentioners <hi>they knew beſt, who know moſt.</hi>
Well argued my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>; theres none can overthrow ſuch a
proof, becauſe it is impoſſible to know where to take
hold of it. Or, if any can bee taken, 'tis this that the Bp.
of <hi>Derry</hi> knows better then all the world beſides. As for
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:115675:341"/>
his pretence of his good conſcience, and to free himſelf
from being a Paraſite, I would entreat his Lordship to
examin his conſcience truly, whether hee does not get
his living by preaching that doctrine which hee puts in
his books, the which how many notorious falſities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
&amp; tergiverſations they have in them may bee
judged by this preſent work. Now, if hee does, let him
conſider whether any like paraſitiſm can bee found as to
hazard to carry men to damnation by taking away the
higheſt principle that can correct them and bring all
faith and Ground of faith to uncertainty &amp; diſpute,
meerly to get his own bread; for your other actions my
L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> I neither know what you do, nor think it handſom
to enquire.</p>
                  <p>In the cloſe hee pretends to ſatisfy an exception of
mine found in <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd.</hi> 
                     <q>'Twas this, that hee
quoted a teſtimony from <hi>Gerſon</hi> againſt himſelf, which
showed that the Greeks acknowledg'd the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
by their departing from the then Pope (as
<hi>Gerſon</hi> ſayes)</q> with theſe words, <hi>wee acknowledge thy
power, wee cannot ſatisfy your covetouſnes, live by your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves.</hi>
Hee replies &amp; endeavours to show that by [<hi>Power</hi>]
in that place is mean't not <hi>Authority,</hi> nor <hi>iuſt power,</hi> but
<hi>might.</hi> Whereas.</p>
                  <p>Firſt the very oppoſition of [<hi>Power acknowledged</hi>] to
(<hi>covetouſnes which they could not ſatisfy</hi>) argues that their
ſullen departure proceeded from their ſticking at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
not the former, which was there acknowledg'd: Now
if [<hi>might</hi>] were ſignify'd by the word [<hi>Power</hi>] in that
place, the ſence of the whole would ſtand thus; <hi>wee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
not for want of acknowledging thy might, but for
want of power to ſatisfy thy covetouſnes,</hi> which is as good as
non-ſence. For, if hee had <hi>might</hi> to force them, what
ſence is there to ſay, <hi>wee depart becauſe wee cannot ſatisfy
your avarice,</hi> when <hi>departing</hi> could not ſave them? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas,
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:115675:342"/>
in the other ſence it runs very currently; <hi>wee ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
not for de fault of acknowledging thy Authority or iuſt
power, but, becauſe</hi> (however this be iuſt, yet) <hi>it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
wee should ſatisfy your covetouſnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, what, <hi>might</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> except that of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Iuriſdiction, the Pope can bee pretended to have
then had over the Greeks, appears not: It was mean't
therefore of no ſuch <hi>might,</hi> but of a rightfulnes of
power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, whereas hee ſayes that</hi> Gerſon apprehended
the words in his ſence, <hi>&amp; cites the context for it, the very
proof hee brings for him is againſt him.</hi> Gerſons <hi>poſition
(according to the Bp.) is this, that</hi> men ought not general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be bound to the poſitive determinations of Pope's to hold
&amp; beleeve one &amp; the ſame form of Government in things
that do not immediately concern the truth of our faith and
the Goſpell. <hi>After which teſtimony the Bp. addes theſe
words:</hi> From thence hee proceedeth to ſet down ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
cuſtomes of the Greek &amp; Latin Churches, both which
hee doth iuſtify, citing S. Auſtin to prove that in all ſuch
things the cuſtome of the country is to bee obſerved. And
amongſt the reſt of the differences this was one that the Creek
Church paid not ſuch ſubſidies &amp; duties as the Gallican
Church did. <hi>Thus far the Bishop. Where it is manifeſt
that the lawfulnes of reſiſting the Pope's determinations
being in order to the not paying</hi> undue ſubſidies <hi>&amp; Taxes,
the diſcourſe there relates to the no obligation of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
covetouſnes, and touches not at all the point of</hi>
power <hi>or</hi> might, <hi>as hee will have it. Let us take then</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<hi>ſence in the former, and mine of</hi> iuſt power <hi>in the
latter, and the diſcourſe ſtands thus, that</hi> though men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the rightfull power of Pope's, yet they ought not
generally be bound to their poſitive determinations in things
not of faith, but belonging onely to the ſeverall forms of
Government &amp; cuſtomes in ſeverall countries, as paying
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:115675:342"/>
ſubſidies, duties, <hi>&amp;c. And pertinently to the ſame ſence,
the Greeks might bee imagined, as indeed they did, to
anſwer.</hi> Wee acknowledge thy power, or cannot deny your
rightfull Authority, but eſteem not our ſelves bound to obey
your determinations importing ſuch covetous demands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the cuſtome and Priviledges of our Church; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee think our ſelves excuſed not to meddle with you
at all.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Bp. ſayes that <hi>it ſeems the Pope would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
exacted thoſe ſubſidies &amp; duties of the Grecians, and
that there upon they ſeparated from him.</hi> Which counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
all I ſaid formerly, &amp; implies more ſtrongly my
ſence; towit, that it was <hi>there upon</hi> (as the Bp. confeſſes)
that is, upon their <hi>denying ſubſidies,</hi> not upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the <hi>rightfulnes of his power</hi> as coming under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
&amp; a cheaper notion, that they ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the very demanding ſubſidies, had there not
been ſome preacknowledg'd <hi>power</hi> to Ground &amp; counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
ſuch a demand, ſeems incredibile, &amp; had requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a more poſitive Anſwer, then (<hi>wee cannot ſatisfy your
covetouſnes</hi>) and rather this, <hi>you have nothing at all to do
with us,</hi> nor <hi>the leaſt Superiority to Ground the pretence of
paying you any thing at all.</hi> Whereas this anſwer rather
ſayes, wee ow you indeed <hi>ſubjection,</hi> but not <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
as engages us to ſatisfy your encroaching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, hee ſayes <hi>Gerſon</hi> hence <hi>concludes</hi> that <hi>upon this
conſideration they might proceed to the reformation of the
french Churches and the Liberties thereof, notwithſtanding
the contradiction which perhaps ſome of the Court of Rome
would make,</hi> which more &amp; more evidences that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of the Popes <hi>iuſt power</hi> was retained by
the Greeks, and encroachments upon their Liberties
onely deny'd, which the French Church intended to
imitate; Now, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> cannot bee pretended with any shame
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:115675:343"/>
that <hi>Gerſon</hi> and the french Church mean't to diſacknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Pope's <hi>iuſt power,</hi> as Head of the Church, nor
will <hi>Gerſons</hi> words even now cited let it bee pretended;
for then without any (perhaps) not onely <hi>ſome</hi> (as hee
doubts) but <hi>all</hi> in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would <hi>moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
have contradicted it. Their conſideration then being
parallell to that of the Greeks, as the Bp. grants, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
that they acknowledg'd the Pope's Authority
though they paſſively remain'd ſeparate rather than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
a demand which they deem'd irrationall.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Bishop firſt cited a teſtimony againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as was shown in <hi>Schiſm Diſarm'd;</hi> and would excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe

plainly ſumm'd up in theſe few Aphoriſms.</head>
                     <p>1. <hi>THat</hi> (whatſoever the Extent of the Pope's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
bee or bee not, <hi>yet) 'tis cl ar that all Roman-Catholikes,
that is, all Communicants with the Church of
Rome or Papists</hi> (as they call them) <hi>hold the ſubſtance of
the Pope's Authority; that is, hold the Pope to bee Supreme
Eccleſiaſticall Governour in God's Church.</hi> This is euident
out of the very terms, ſince to acknowledge the Papall
Authority is to bee a Papiſt or a Communicant with the
Church of Rome.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>The holding or acknowledging this Authority is to all
that hold it, that is to the whole Church of Rome, or to all
thoſe particular Churches united with Rome, a Principle of
Vnity of Government.</hi> This is plain likewiſe out of the
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:115675:343"/>
terms; ſince an acknowledgment of one Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
either in Secular, or Spirituall affairs is the
Ground which eſtablishes thoſe acknowledgers in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to that one Government; that is, 'tis to them <hi>a
Principle of Vnity in Government.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis euident and acknowledg'd that (<hi>whateuer ſome

Churches in Communion with the Churches of Rome hold

Children to have been recieued from their immediate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, is to bee undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
held as indeed taught by them, that is, is to bee held
as a point of faith; and that the voice of the preſent Church
thus deliuering is infallible, that is, that this deliuery from
immediate forefathers as from theirs, as from Chriſt, is an
infallible and certain Rule of faith, that is, is a Principle
of Vnity in faith. <hi>This to bee the</hi> tenet <hi>of all theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in Communion with</hi> Rome <hi>both ſides acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
and is Evident hence that the Body made up of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
Churches ever caſt out from themſelves all that did
innouate againſt this tenure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. 'Tis manifeſt that all the Churches in Communion with
Rome equally held at the time of the Proteſtant Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in K. Henry's dayes theſe two Principles as they do
now, that is, the ſubſtance of the Pope's Authority or that
hee is Supreme in God's Church, and that the living voice
of the preſent Church delivering as aboue ſaid is the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Rule of faith <hi>This is manifeſted by our Aduerſaries
impugning the former Churches as holding Tradition
and the Pope's Headship; nor was it ever pretended by
Friend or Foe that either thoſe Churches held not thoſe</hi>
tenets <hi>then, or that they have renounc't them ſince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. The Church of England immediately before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:115675:344"/>
was one of thoſe Churches which held Communion
with Rome, (<hi>as all the world grants</hi>) and conſequently
held with the reſt theſe two former tenets prou'd to have been
the Principles of Vnity both in faith and Government.</p>
                     <p>6. That Body of Chriſtians or that Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
conſiſting of the then-Church of England and other
Churches in Communion with Rome, holding Chriſt's law
upon the ſayd tenure of immediate Tradition and ſubmitting
to the Eccleſiaſticall Supremacy of the Pope, was a true and
reall Church. <hi>This is manifeſt by our very Adverſaries
acknowledgment, who grant the now Church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
even without their Church, to bee a true and reall
one, though holding the ſame Principles of Vnity both
in faith and Government.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. <hi>That Body conſiſting of the then Church of England
and her other fellow communicants with Rome, was united
or made one by means of theſe two Principles of Vnity.</hi> For
the undoubted acknowledgment of one common Rule
of faith to bee certain is in it's own nature apt to unite
thoſe acknowledger's in faith, that is, to unite them as
faithfull and conſequently in all other actions ſpringing
from faith And the undoubted acknowledgment of one
Supreme Eccleſiaſticall Governour gave theſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgers
an Eccleſiaſticall Vnity or Church-communion
under the notion of Governed or ſubjects of an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
Commonwealth. Now nothing can more neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touch a Church, than the Rules of faith and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
eſpecially if the Government bee of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved
upon it's Rule. Seeing then theſe principles gave
them ſome Vnity, and Communion as <hi>Faithfull,</hi> and as
belonging to an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Commonwealth, it muſt
neceſſarily bee Church Vnity, and Comunion which it
gave them.</p>
                     <p>8. <hi>The Proteſtant Reformers renoun'ct both theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
This is undeniably evident ſince they left of to
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:115675:344"/>
hold the Popes Supreme power to act in Eccleſiaſticall
affairs, and alſo to hold diverſe points, which the former
Church immediately before the breach, had recieved
from immediate Paſtours &amp; fathers, as from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>9. <hi>Hence follows unavoidably, that thoſe Reformers in
renouncing thoſe two Principles did the fact of breaking
Church Communion, or Schiſmatizing.</hi> This is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrably
conſequent from the two laſt Paragraphs, where
'tis proved that thoſe two Principles made Church
Communion, that is, cauſed Vnity in that Body which
themſelves acknowledge a true Church; as alſo that they
renounced or broke thoſe Principles; therefore they
broke that which united the Church, therefore they
broke the Vnity of the Church or Schiſmatiz'd.</p>
                     <p>10. This renouncing thoſe two Principles of Eccleſiaſticall
Communion, prou'd to have been an actuall breach of
Church Vnity, was antecedent to the Pope's excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Proteſtants, and his commanding Catholikes to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from their Communion. <hi>This is known, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
by all the world; nor till they were Proteſtants by
renouncing thoſe Principles could they bee excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
as Proteſtants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. This actuall breach of Church Vnity in K. Henry's,
E<hi rend="sup">d</hi> the 6th's and the beginning of Q. Elizabeth's reign, could
not bee imputable to the ſubſequent Excommunication, as
to it's cauſe. <hi>'Tis plain, ſince the effect cannot bee befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the cauſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. <hi>Thoſe ſubſequent Excommunications, cauſed not the
actuall breach or Schiſm between us.</hi> For the antecedent
renouncing thoſe two points, shown to have been the
Principles of Eccleſiaſticall Vnity, had already cauſed
the breach, diſvnion or diuiſion between us; But, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
between whom an actuall diuiſion is made are not ſtill
diuiſible, that is, they who are already diuided are not
now to bee diuided: Whefore, however it may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:115675:345"/>
that thoſe Excommunications made thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
who were antecedently thus diuided, ſtand at
farther diſtance from one another; yet 'tis moſt ſenceles
and unworthy a man of reaſon to affirm that they diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thoſe who were already diuided ere thoſe Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
came. Eſpecially, ſince the Rule of faith,
and the ſubſtance of the Pope's Authority conſiſt in
an indiuiſible, and are points of that nature, that the
renouncing theſe is a Principle of renouncing all faith
and Government: For, who ſo renounces a y Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
may, nay ought, if hee go to work conſequently,
renounce all hee holds upon that Rule, whether points
of faith, or of Government, nay even the letter of God's
written word it ſelf; that is, all that Chriſt left us, or that
can concern a Church.</p>
                     <p>13. The renouncing thoſe two Principles of the former
Church Vnity, as it evidently diſv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ited mens minds in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to faith and Government; ſo, if reduced into practice,
it muſt neceſſarily diſvnite or diuide them likewiſe in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Church carriage. <hi>This is clear, ſince our</hi> tenets <hi>are the
Principles of our actions, and ſo contrary</hi> tenets <hi>of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
carriage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. <hi>Thoſe tenets contrary to the two Principles of Church
Vnity were de facto put in practice, by the Reforming party;
and conſequently, they diuided the Church, both internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and externally.</hi> This is moſt undeniably evident; ſince
they preach't, writ and acted againſt the Tradition, or
delivery of the immediately foregoing Church as erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
in many points, which shee deliver'd to them as
from immediate. fathers and ſo upwards as from Chriſt;
and proceeded now to interpret Scripture, by another
Rule than by the tenets, and practice of the immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
foregoing faithfull. And, as for the former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they abſolutely renounc't it's influence in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
preach't, and writ againſt it: Nay kept Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:115675:345"/>
apart before they had the power in their hands;
and, after they had the power in their hands, punish't
and put to death (and that vpon the ſcore of Religion)
many of the maintainers of thoſe two Principles of
Church Vnity.</p>
                     <p>15. <hi>Hence follows that the Proteſtants breach was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and compleat fact of Schiſm.</hi> For, it diuided the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Eccleſiaſticall Body both internally and externally,
and that, as it was an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Body, ſince thoſe two
ſaid Principles concern'd <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Vnity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. <hi>The ſubſequent Excommunication, of our Church was
therefore due, fitting and neceſſary. Due;</hi> for it is as <hi>due</hi>
a carriage towards thoſe who have actually renounced
the Principles of Vnity both in faith and Government,
and ſo broken Church Vnity, to bee excommunicated
by that Body from which thoſe Renouncers thus broke,
as it is towards rebells, who have renounc't both Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Government and fundamentall laws of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and ſo, diuided the Temporall Body, to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
and proclaimed Rebells by the ſame Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
<hi>Fitting,</hi> ſince the effect of it they moſt reſent,
which was to keep the true faithfull apart in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
actions from them, ſignify'd no more than this, that
they who had broken both internally and externally
from the former Body should not bee treated with, in
Eccleſiaſticall carriages, as ſtill of it, nor bee owned for
parts of that Commonwealth of which already they had
made, themſelves no parts. Laſtly, <hi>neceſſary;</hi> all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and good order going to wrack if oppoſite
parties bee allow'd to treat together commonly in ſuch
actions in which their oppoſition muſt neceſſarily,
and frequently burſt out and diſcover it ſelf; which will
ineuitably diſguſt the more prudent ſort, hazzard to
peruert the weaker, and breed diſquiet on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>Thus far to evidence demonſtrably that the Extern
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:115675:346"/>
Fact of Schiſm was truly theirs; Which done, though it
bee needleſſ to adde any more to prove them formall
Schiſmaticks, themſelves confeſſing that ſuch a fact can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee iuſtifiable, by any reaſons or motives whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<hi>of Schiſm,</hi> c. 1. Yet I shall not build upon their ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their own words, knowing how eaſy a thing it
is, for men who talk looſely and not with ſtrict rigour of
Diſcourſe to shuffle of their own ſayings; I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proſecute mine own intended method, and alledge
that,</p>
                     <p>17. <hi>The very doing an Extern fact, of ſo hainous a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as is breaking Church Vnity concludes a guilt in the
Acters, unles they render reaſons truly ſufficient to excuſe
their fact.</hi> This is evident, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> by parallelling this
to facts of far more inferiour malice. For, who ſo riſes
againſt a long ſettled, and acknowledg'd Temporall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
is concluded by that very fact of riſing to bee a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
unles hee render ſufficient reaſons, why hee roſe.
Otherwiſe, till thoſe reaſons appear, the Good of Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
ſettlement, order and Vnity, which hee evidently
violates by his riſing conclude him moſt irrationall, that
is, ſinfull, who shall go about to deſtroy them. The like
wee experience, to bee granted by all Mankind in caſe a
ſon diſobey or diſacknowledge one for his father, who
was held ſo formerly, nay if a ſchoolboy diſobey a petty
ſchoolmaſter; for, unles they give ſufficient reaſons of
this diſobedience, the order of the world, which conſiſts
in ſuch ſubmiſſion of inferiours, to formerly-acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
Superiours gives them for faulty for having bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and inverted that order. How much more then the
fact of breaking Church Vnity, ſince this entrenches
upon an order infinitely higher, to wit Mankind's order
to Beatitude, and in it's own nature diſſolves, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes
Chriſt's Church by deſtroying it's Vnity; and,
by conſequence, his law too; ſince there remaining no
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:115675:346"/>
means to make particular Churches interpret Scripture
the ſame way, each of them would follow the fancy of
ſome man it eſteems learned, and ſo there would bee as
many faiths as particular Congregations; as wee ſee pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic't
in Luther's pretended Reformation, and this laſt
amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>18. <hi>No reaſons can bee ſufficient to excuſe ſuch a fact, but
ſuch as are able to conuince that 'twas better to do that fact,
than not to do it.</hi> This is moſt Evident; ſince, as when
reaſon convinces mee 'tis <hi>worſe,</hi> to do ſuch a thing I am
beyond all excuſe irrationall, that is, faulty in doing it;
ſo, if I bee conuinc't that 'tis, <hi>onely-equally good,</hi> I can
have no reaſon to go about it; for, in regard I cannot
act in this caſe without making choice of the one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
before the other, and in this ſuppoſed caſe there,
is no reaſon of making ſuch a choice, ſince I am convinc't
of the equality of their Goodneſſes, 'tis clear my action
in this caſe cannot ſpring from reaſon. 'Tis left then that
none can act rationally nor by conſequence excuſably,
unles convinc't that the fact is <hi>better to bee done,</hi> than not
to bee done.</p>
                     <p>19. <hi>In this caſe, where the point is demonſtrable, and of
higheſt concern, no reaſon meerly probable, how ſtrongly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it bee ſuch, can convince the underſtanding, that the
Contrary was better to bee done, but onely a manifeſt, and
rigorous demonſtration.</hi> For, though in the commoner
ſort of humane actions an high Probability, that the
thing is in it ſelf better, bee ſufficient for action, yet there
are ſome things of a nature, ſo manifeſt to all Mankind
to bee univerſally good, that nothing, but rigorous Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
can bee pretended a Ground ſufficient to oppoſe
them. For example, that <hi>Parents are to bee honored, that
Government is to bee in the world,</hi> that <hi>Vnity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to bee kept up in God's Church,</hi> that <hi>there ought to
bee certain Grounds for faith,</hi> and ſuch like. Which, ſince
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:115675:347"/>
on the one ſide they are ſuch as are in their own nature
demonſtrable, and indeed ſelf evident; on the other ſo
univerſally beneficiall, and conſequently an univerſall
harm, or rather a deluge of inconveniences, and miſchief
break in if the Acter againſt theſe should hap to bee in
the wrong; hee is, therefore, bound in theſe caſes not
to act till hee ſees the utmoſt that is to bee ſeen concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſuch affairs; but affairs of this nature are demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable,
or rather ſelf evident (as is ſaid) on the one ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
therefore hee ought not to act, unles hee could ſee
perfect demonſtration, that 'tis better to do the other:
Wherefore, it being evidenced moſt manifeſtly in the
6th Section of this, <hi>Vindication of my Appendix,</hi> that
this fact of theirs left neither, <hi>Certain Ground of faith,</hi>
nor <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Government</hi> in God's Church, nothing but
a <hi>perfect and rigorous demonſtration,</hi> could bee able to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi>
the underſtanding that 'twas <hi>better</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ct.</p>
                     <p>20. <hi>The Proteſtants produce no ſuch demonſtration, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>was better to act in this caſe.</hi> For, they never clos'd with
ſevere demonſtration, in any of their writings I have yet
ſeen to Evidence rigorouſly either, that the Rule of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
delivery was not <hi>certain,</hi> or that the Pope had
<hi>no</hi> Supreme <hi>Authority</hi> in Eccleſiaſticall affairs, or, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that, though hee were ſuch, yet the Authority was
to bee abolish't for the <hi>Abuſes</hi> ſake; Which were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to bee done ere they could demonſtrate it better to
break Church Vnity. Nor, indeed, does their manner
of writing bear the ſlendereſt reſemblance, of rigorous
demonſtration: ſince demonſtration, is not a connecting
of Ayre and words, but of Notions and ſence, and this
from ſelf evident Principles even to the very intended
concluſion. Whereas their way of writing is onely to
find out the ſence of words by a Dictionary kind of
manner; which ſort of Diſcourſe, is the moſt fallible,
moſt ſleight and moſt ſubject to Equivocation, that can
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:115675:347"/>
bee imagin'd. To omit that rigorous demonſtration, is
pretended by our party for our Rule of faith, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Tradition, which they renounc't; and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
for whatſoever was recieved upon it (as was the
Pope's Authority) as yet unanſwer'd by their ſide. Nay
their own ſide ſometimes acknowledge, our ſaid Rule of
faith infallible. See <hi>Schiſm Diſpatch't.</hi> p. 104. &amp; p. 123.</p>
                     <p>21. <hi>'Tis the moſt abſurd, and impious folly imaginable to
bring for their excuſe, that they were fully perſuaded the
thing was to bee done or is to bee continued.</hi> For, ſince a
<hi>full perſuaſion,</hi> can ſpring from Paſſion or Vice aſwell,
as from reaſon and virtue (as all the world ſees, and
grants) it ſignifies nothing in order to an excuſe to ſay
one was fully perſuaded hee was to do ſuch a thing till
hee show whence hee became thus perſuaded; otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
his perſuaſion, might bee a fault it ſelf, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his other fault in thus acting. 'Tis not therefore
his perſuaſion, but the Ground of his perſuaſion, which
is to bee alledged and look't into. Which, if it were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
whence hee became thus perſuaded, and that hee
knew how hee came to bee perſuaded (without knowing
which 'twas irrational to bee perſuaded at all) then hee
can render us this reaſon, which perſuaded him; and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
telling us evidently that no reaſon, leſſ than demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
is in our caſe able to breed full perſuaſion, or
conviction, that it was, <hi>better to act</hi> (as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Aph. 19.) it follows they muſt give us a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
reaſon, why 'twas better to bee done, otherwiſe they
can never iuſtify that perſuaſion, much leſſ the fact
which iſſued from it: But, the fact being evidently enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
and againſt a preſent order of higheſt concern,
and no truly Evident reaſon appearing, why 'twas bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to do that fact, 'tis from it ſelf convinc't, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
irrationall, precipitate and vicious. If they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of this doctrine, as too rigorous in leaving no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:115675:348"/>
for weak, and ignorant perſons who act out of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity;
I reply: Either their firſt Reformers, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the continuers of the Breach, thought themſelves
ignorant in thoſe things they went about to reform, or
no. If they thought themſelves ignorant, and yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to make themſelves iudges, 'tis a plain ſelf-Condemnation,
and irrationall. If they were ignorant,
or in ſome degree ignorant and yet either thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
not ignorant, or in ſome degree leſſ ignorant, then
I ask what made them think themſelves wiſer than they
were except their own Pride: So that which way ſoever
they turn, their fault and guilt purſve them. But, if they
were indeed knowing in thoſe things, then 'tis apparent
there are no truly ſufficient, convincing or demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
reaſons to bee given why they acted, ſince they were
never able to produce any ſuch, though urged and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
there unto by the higheſt motives imaginable. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
they remain ſtill criminall as in the former caſes, and
indeed much more, leaving it manifeſt, that neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion,
nor their fact which was originiz'd from it,
ſprung from reaſon in their underſtanding, but from
Paſſion and Affection in their Wills.</p>
                     <p>THEREFORE THE PROTESTANTS ARE

reply in a rigorouſly demonſtrative
way, which, as it onely is concluſive,
ſo none but it can avail them to iuſtify a
Fact of this nature, they shall have a
fair return, from their Diſarmer. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
if they reſolve to purſve their old
method of talking preachingly, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
and quibblingly, hee can bee
content to leave them to the Applauſe
of weak and half-witted Readers, and
