            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Conteſt between Mr. <hi>Danſon</hi> and my ſelf, will I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, appear ſo ſurprizing and unexpected; that as it happens in ſudden Frays, the firſt Quere generally ſtarted is like to be, <hi>How fell you out?</hi> To ſatisfie which, I muſt diſpence with the Vanity of telling the World; that (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Fools</hi> thinks, or <hi>Knaves</hi> Report) our Weekly Intelligence is not publiſht ſolely to <hi>Get Money,</hi> (though that be an Ingredient which inſinuates in moſt undertakings) nor meerly to Entertain the <hi>Idle</hi> with Stories, and furniſh <hi>Coffee-Houſes</hi> with <hi>Chat,</hi> (though for <hi>that</hi> ſome ungrateful <hi>Dons</hi> are not a little oblig'd, for without ſuch Innocent Diverſions, 'tis a thouſand to one but their <hi>Tongues</hi> would be imploy'd to the <hi>Hazard</hi> of their <hi>Ears.</hi>) But beſides theſe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther main uſe of that <hi>Sheet,</hi> is for <hi>Extravagants</hi> to do <hi>Pennance</hi> in: To Expoſe Vice and <hi>Ill Nature</hi> to deſerv'd contempt, and if poſſible Laugh <hi>Foppery</hi> out of Countenance and Practice.

            <p>I confeſs I have often with much ſatisfaction over-heard grave <hi>Coxcombs</hi> relate; that as <hi>many</hi> Authors Club to an Intelligence as there go Taylors to a <hi>Man</hi>; that we tug at the <hi>Pen</hi> like Slaves at the Oar a whole Bank together, and write in the poſture that the <hi>Sweeds</hi> give fire in, over one anothers heads; Nay ſome have been ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to pretend intimate acquaintance with half a dozen of the Fraternity of <hi>Robin-Writers.</hi> But that any of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> had any Finger in the Pye is a ſlander, that none but the Devils <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue-maker</hi> would ſuggeſt; for in truth the <hi>Ground</hi> of his <hi>belief</hi> (as well in this as greater matters) is like to prove nothing but <hi>Fancy,</hi> or rather <hi>Malice,</hi> which cares not what it reports, ſo he may caſt an <hi>Odium</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>; If I ſhould ſay I have <hi>good ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>; Mr. <hi>Danſon</hi> addicted to <hi>Gaming, Bowls, Nine pins,</hi> &amp;c.

No doubt he would cry out <hi>calumny</hi> and Slander; and yet I can ſhew where he was charged therewith in <hi>Print</hi> ſome Years ſince, and which he never diſprov'd that I know of; A far better ground for believing it, than any he can produce in this caſe; For I do <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly</hi> declare (and know no reaſon but my unbias'd <hi>Teſtimony</hi> may be Credited before his Envious <hi>Surmiſes</hi>) That the ſaid Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But now behold! The <hi>Man of Sylogiſmes</hi> comes furiouſly to Attaque our Divertiſement, and gravely Confound it with a <hi>Firſt, Second, Third,</hi> and <hi>Fourth—ly</hi>; Beloved;—</p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It was not <hi>Well Witted</hi>; Though few that know Mr. <hi>Danſon</hi> can admit him for a Competent Judge; Yet let's hear his reaſon; <hi>The Monkey,</hi> (he ſays) <hi>muſt needs be Satan</hi>: &amp;c.
