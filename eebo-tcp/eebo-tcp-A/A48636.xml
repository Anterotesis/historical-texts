            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>SO soon as some indispencible occasions would permit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
did at your instance, strictly peruse the <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> called
<hi>The present Interest of</hi> England <hi>stated;</hi> as also, the <hi>Letter</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to Sir <hi>Thomas Osborne</hi> in answer to it, and at your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
shall now give you my sense of <hi>both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I find no Cause by the scope of the <hi>Letter,</hi> to believe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of the <hi>Author,</hi> then according to his own Professions,
that he really designs the <hi>Honour, Greatness,</hi> and <hi>Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I understand the <hi>Letter,</hi> to agree fully with the <hi>Pamphlet</hi>
in all its Maxims, relating to our <hi>domestick Interest,</hi> not differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neither from our <hi>Forrein</hi> in anything, save what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to <hi>Holland,</hi> and therein likewise, not in <hi>all,</hi> but only
in <hi>some</hi> particulars, but in <hi>several</hi> of them; I observe also the

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>For the studying of their Interests, and loving of them,

                  <p>And Thirdly, <hi>That their Parsimonie is no good Reason for
dislike of them,</hi> (Page 6.) As if all these were Arguments
made use of by express words in that <hi>Book,</hi> when I do not find
any expressions relating to any of these particulars, that do
either in words <hi>say</hi> so much, or will in the least <hi>admit</hi> of
any such Inferences or Conclusions; (although as to this
<hi>Third,</hi> if there were any word to that purpose, it might be
defended) For all the <hi>Arguments</hi> made use of by the <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,</hi>
against the destroying of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> are either
upon the account of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Righteousness, (which establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a Nation)</hi> or clearly in reference to the <hi>safety</hi> and <hi>utility</hi>
of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and not in the least,
upon any <hi>particular affection</hi> to the <hi>people</hi> of that <hi>Countrey,</hi> as
the <hi>Letter</hi> doth insinuate the <hi>Pamphlet;</hi> being no otherwise
concerned for them, then as it is, for preserving the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of <hi>Christendome,</hi> in opposition of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I find the <hi>Pamphlets</hi> commendning the <hi>Dutch</hi> for their <hi>Morals,</hi>
(compared with the <hi>French,</hi> &amp;c.) to be answered by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting,
that if the <hi>Author</hi> had lain but one night in any <hi>Inn</hi>
of <hi>theirs,</hi> he would have been convinced of the contrary,
which implyeth, that he had never done it, or at least ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57801:3"/>
told the world he had, and yet the <hi>Book</hi> justifies his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>them</hi> in affirming his experience, from having travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>their Countries; (Interest of England</hi> Page 30.) and truly
by his general knowledge of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> he may well
be supposed to have throughly done it, and granting so
much, it consequently follows, that he must then have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
their <hi>Inns,</hi> but if from <hi>Cousening,</hi> and <hi>Cheating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the whole for a part; for I can my self by experience, so
far joyn with the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> in justifying of it, as to aver,
That I never trevelled in all my life, in any <hi>Countrey</hi> so
cheap as in <hi>theirs,</hi> and that no private person doth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
but either <hi>voluntarily,</hi> by being profuse, or <hi>carelesly</hi> in
spending more then he needeth, in not keeping to his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
but living at large; for their <hi>Rates</hi> by <hi>Land</hi> or <hi>Water,</hi>
are so certain, that none can pay one more then another,
and the like is in <hi>their Inns,</hi> for <hi>Ordinaries</hi> and <hi>Lodgings;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that I have often wondered their great <hi>Trade</hi> and
<hi>Populousness</hi> (which in all other places makes things dear)
considered, I found living there so cheap as I did. But
as no number or society of men, can be said to be <hi>perfectly
good,</hi> or <hi>altogether evil;</hi> so the most just and certain Rule for
applauding, or condemning any <hi>Countrey,</hi> is not from <hi>a few
Instances</hi> of a small part of it, but by way of <hi>Comparison</hi> with
other <hi>Countries,</hi> and by that <hi>Standard, Holland</hi> cannot be
found by much, so bad as <hi>Popish Countries,</hi> where the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi>
of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> (which hath more or less an influence
upon most of their <hi>Religion</hi>) of <hi>good Intentions, Probability,</hi>
and <hi>Necessity,</hi> &amp;c. and of their whole Church, of <hi>keeping no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57801:4"/>
faith with Heriticks,</hi> &amp;c. is inconsistant with honest Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
rendering them unfit, even for one anothers Society,
there being no fence against such Principles.</p>
                  <p>The Cruelty at <hi>Amboina,</hi> is (I confess] to be had by all
in abhorrence; but since it was <hi>before</hi> we were born, that it
was acted but by <hi>a few,</hi> and disowned, and not justified <hi>at
home.</hi> That <hi>King James</hi> of happy memory, and his wise
and excellent Council, and Favourites, thought therefore
not fit to <hi>revenge</hi> it; and that it hath since, by several trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
been buried, and put in Oblivion; I question whether
we ought still to <hi>remember</hi> it; but provided, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Trade that the <hi>Popish Nations</hi> have (in all ages down to
our times) driven in <hi>Massakres,</hi> and <hi>Cruel Torterings,</hi> and that
with the applause, and approbation of their chief <hi>Bishop</hi>
and <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Italy, Savoy, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
may be remembered; I can be well pleased,
that that single Act at <hi>Amboina,</hi> committed by a <hi>few
Protestants</hi> condemned by the rest, and which is abhorred
by the <hi>Principles of their Religion,</hi> may not be forgotten;
and thereupon the whole designs of the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> and <hi>Letter,</hi>
each severally considered, I cannot observe, that they
differ in any <hi>Material</hi> Circumstance, but that both aim at the
same end, the <hi>Honour, Greatness, Prosperity</hi> and <hi>safety</hi> of this
<hi>Nation,</hi> unless the <hi>first</hi> is too straight laced in the Rules of
Honesty and Justice; believing (that though Interest right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood or mistaken, governs all the world yet)
that that precept of <hi>doing to others, as we would have them to
do to us,</hi> gives no latitude to any <hi>Countrey</hi> to destroy <hi>another,</hi>
to the end to increase their own <hi>Trade,</hi> or <hi>greatness;</hi> for
were it otherwise, nothing could be more for our security
against <hi>Invasions,</hi> and the profit of <hi>England,</hi> then to destroy
in time the <hi>French</hi> in their Shipping, and thereby in their
<hi>Maritine Commerce,</hi> before they are overgrown in <hi>strength</hi>
and <hi>Trade,</hi> in both, which from young <hi>Interlopers,</hi> they are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57801:4"/>
in a short time too much increased, especially in our <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland
Fishery,</hi> where they have almost eaten us out, to
the unspeakable prejudice of the <hi>Western Parts!</hi> though
<hi>that Trade</hi> was once our <hi>greatest Nursery</hi> for <hi>Seamen,</hi> and
might have been much more <hi>improved,</hi> and is of such a
<hi>Nature,</hi> as the <hi>Dutch</hi> were not capable of doing us much
prejudice in, or at least as they never <hi>attempted</hi> to do us any.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Letter</hi> reproves the <hi>Pamphlets inviting all Princes into
the triple League,</hi> scoffing at it, as absurd; <hi>the League being
now determined,</hi> and to evince the error, gives this account
of the League: <hi>That the</hi> French King <hi>being entered</hi> Flanders,
<hi>with a very powerful Army, the</hi> Kings of England, Sweden,
<hi>and the</hi> States of Holland, <hi>entered into a confederacy, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to force the</hi> French <hi>to make peace upon such Tearms as should
be proposed by them,</hi> (and therein wisely to prevent the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
greatness of <hi>France) and at the same time the</hi> Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
<hi>made</hi> Articles <hi>amongst themselves, to help one another, in
Case any of them should be invaded for having made this League)
either by the</hi> French King, <hi>the</hi> King of Spain, <hi>or any of their
Allies, and upon the acceptance of the Articles proposed, the</hi>
Confederates <hi>became their</hi> Guarranty <hi>or</hi> Sureties; <hi>for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of them on both sides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, this being the state of the Case, where the Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
or Bull lies, in making no distinction between the <hi>Triple
League,</hi> and the <hi>Guarranty</hi> of the Peace, is beyond my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
for the <hi>League,</hi> as is confessed being made to induce (that
is to force) the <hi>French King</hi> to a Peace, (the <hi>King of Spain,</hi> who
was Invaded, standing in no need of Compulsion) and the
Confederacy continuing for wartanting of the said agreement
(which in effect is no less then an honest and prudent <hi>League,</hi>
for keeping the <hi>French,</hi> within tollerable bounds and limits)
and for the assistance of each other against any that should
endeavour to revenge this consederacy; the <hi>Triple League</hi>
seems to me (as it is confessed by the <hi>Letter</hi> it self, at the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57801:5"/>
lower end of <hi>Page 15.</hi>) to be still in being, and the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be as properly used, as that of <hi>Guarranty,</hi> as being one
and the same thing; for the <hi>Guarranty,</hi> aiming at the same
end the <hi>League</hi> doth, and being one Article of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
the <hi>Triple League</hi> must be still in being, as well as the
<hi>Guarranty,</hi> And surely, it was the last <hi>Session of Parliament.</hi>
thought so to be, when Money was desired for maintaining
of it; but this, <hi>Sir,</hi> is not worth contending about; for the
matter being clearly laid down by the <hi>Letter,</hi> the judgment
of it is left to your self.</p>
                  <p>As I am no <hi>Statist,</hi> nor pretender to it, so it concerns not
me to inquire further into the Articles agreed on by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
with the <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> then is made publick, nor
in the least to attempt the Censuring any Action of <hi>State;</hi>
(for that shall always be Forreign to me) but yet I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
I may without offence say, it doth not appear to me,
as it doth to the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> that the <hi>Emperor</hi> and
<hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> could not have been taken into the <hi>Triple
League</hi> by the <hi>Confederates,</hi> without ingaging to assist them
upon occasion against the <hi>Turk;</hi> for as we find that it hath
been ordinary for <hi>Princes</hi> to limit and proportion their
<hi>Leagues,</hi> according to their <hi>Interests,</hi> so it is irrational to do
otherwise; And it doth not follow, that because it is the
<hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> to enter
into a <hi>League</hi> with other <hi>Princes,</hi> for keeping the <hi>French
King</hi> from unjustly incroaching upon his <hi>Neighbours,</hi> that
therefore those <hi>Princes,</hi> contrary to their manifest
should enter into a <hi>League</hi> with them against the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> but
I Honour the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> for the care he expresseth
to have for the prevention of <hi>War</hi> to this <hi>Nation,</hi> and for the
rest and quiet of the poor people of <hi>England,</hi> (Page <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The <hi>Pamphlet</hi> not being concerned in the complaint

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> in his treating of the <hi>Interest</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> hath several <hi>Observations,</hi> and <hi>Notions,</hi> deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
consideration, which I shall reduce to these six heads
following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That our increase in power, since the time of <hi>Queen
Elizabeth,</hi> (of famous memory) is not proportionable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> (Page 12.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Dutch,</hi> being so powerful at Sea as they
now are, may by ioyning with the <hi>French,</hi> (whenever they will
agree upon it) endanger the Conquest of <hi>England;</hi> and keeping
to themselves the most confiderable parts in it for Trade, being
Masters at Sea, provide for their own security against the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>France,</hi> (Page 12.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is not wisdom for any Nation to have its
safety depend upon the prudence of another, as in relying upon
its being against the <hi>Interest of Holland</hi> to Invade
<hi>England,</hi> because they may mistake their Interest,
<hi>(Page 12.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That a Conquest of <hi>England</hi> being made, the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Government being more easie and indulging Trade, then
the Arbitrary and severe Regiment of <hi>France,</hi> as also their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
concurring more with ours, then that of <hi>France,</hi> the Trading
Party of <hi>England</hi> would be likelier to close with the first then the
latter, and for the like Reason should <hi>Holland</hi> be ever in danger
of a Conquest by the Conjunction of <hi>England</hi> with <hi>France,</hi> they
would rather choose to become part of the <hi>English</hi> Government,
then submit to the power of <hi>France:</hi> For that their joyning with
us, and therein making it, as much our Interest to promote their
Trade, as the Trade of any other Nation, may answer that Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>That their fear of our obstructing their Trade, will
make them averse to us,</hi> (Page 13.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57801:6"/>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That it is not probable, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> will ever
agree to put themselves under the Dominion of the <hi>French,</hi> who
will not trust them without such advantages as may compel them to
observe their promises, as the other will never give them such a
power, least they should make a corrupt use of it, <hi>(Page 14.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That considering the Situation and Constitutions of
<hi>England,</hi> a Coalition with us would prove more acceptable and
advantagious to them, then any tearms they can expect from the
<hi>French,</hi> and that should we get no more then the <hi>Maritine Towns,</hi>
and the <hi>French</hi> all the rest of the <hi>States Dominions,</hi> we should
have no cause to repent our Bargain, <hi>(Page 14.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Notions</hi> contain the substance of that part of the
<hi>Letter,</hi> which treats of the <hi>Interest of England;</hi> the <hi>first</hi> of
which I must not at present deny, because the <hi>Auxiliary</hi>
assistance which we have received from <hi>France,</hi> seems to
make it good; yet the <hi>Story</hi> of 88. acquaints us, that the
<hi>States</hi> in thosetimes with 35. <hi>Men of War,</hi> Blocked up <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi>
and the <hi>Duke of Parma's Navy</hi> in it, to the great service
of <hi>England;</hi> but it is certain, that all <hi>Nations</hi> will increase,
or decline more or less, according as their <hi>Interest</hi> is pursued,
and their Government suted to it, which happily is the
Cause why none can be said to have out-done the States of
<hi>Holland</hi> (their low beginnings considered) in increase in
<hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Riches;</hi> but if augmentation in Territories, and
power be a Crime, it is one that <hi>France</hi> is more guilty of
then the <hi>United Netherlands,</hi> and ought therefore to be
looked upon with a more jealous Eye? for the natural ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
that we have of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Situation of our
<hi>Countrey,</hi> and the greatness of it; in the goodness and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of our <hi>Havens</hi> and <hi>Ports,</hi> to breed <hi>Seamen,</hi> and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<hi>Ships,</hi> are such, as appears to me to render it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them, ever to become our superiours at Sea (<hi>as is
suggested by the Letter,</hi> Page 11.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57801:6"/>As to the <hi>second</hi> assertion, or head, I must in that crave
leave to dissent, without granting the question (which is
begged) that <hi>Holland,</hi> whilst in liberty, might be under
a likelyhood of agreeing with <hi>France</hi> for the Conquest of
<hi>England,</hi> the thing seeming to me to be morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> From their want of <hi>people,</hi> especially fit for <hi>War,</hi>
their <hi>Dominions</hi> being small, and furnished much with
<hi>strangers,</hi> and altogether with <hi>Traders,</hi> Circumstances
which no <hi>Countrey</hi> must be under, that designs Forrein Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
or Invasions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the Nature of their <hi>Government,</hi> in its
being no more then an <hi>Vnion</hi> of several <hi>absolute Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
for common defence and preservation, which is a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
not fit for acquisitions, in that the difficulty in satisfying
every concern upon the good success of their Arms, and the
many occasions that would arise from thence of differences
amongst them, renders it impracticable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the impossibility of the <hi>French,</hi> and their
<hi>agreement upon the Division of England;</hi> for that it is not to
be imagined, but each of them would be jealous of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<hi>increase in Territories and Power,</hi> and that the States
would have no more cause to presume upon their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witting
the <hi>French,</hi> in getting to themselves the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
places in it for <hi>Trade,</hi> (as is supposed by the <hi>Letter</hi>
Page 12.) then the <hi>French</hi> in over-reaching <hi>them,</hi> who have
always been wise enough in <hi>Treaties;</hi> For that an increase
in the <hi>French Monarchy</hi> would be more dangerous to the
<hi>States,</hi> then the like in the <hi>States</hi> would be to <hi>them,</hi> who are
already the others overmatch, and it cannot with reason
but be supposed, that in the <hi>Division of England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
would on the one hand have an Eye at supplying themselves
with that they only want, for making them uncontrollable
in the world, <hi>good Havens</hi> and <hi>Ports,</hi> and also on the other
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57801:7"/>
hand, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> would never yield unto that, that
would <hi>destroy them.</hi> But if <hi>England</hi> had reason to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Hollands</hi> Conjunction, in order to the
Conquest of it: (as the Letter suggests) I fear with the same
reason <hi>France</hi> will be jealous of <hi>Englands</hi> impatronizing
<hi>Holland,</hi> as being as well unwilling to have the <hi>Dominion
of the Seae</hi> so much <hi>undivided</hi> in the hands of any <hi>one</hi> Lord,
as all the <hi>rest</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> cannot check it, as <hi>we</hi> are to have
the <hi>Dominion of the Land</hi> in the like kind under any other
Lord or Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Third</hi> ascertion, I have not any thing to object in
opposition, nothing being more ordinary in the world then
<hi>gross mistakes</hi> in the <hi>Interest</hi> of Countries, proceeding often
from <hi>passion, revenge,</hi> and <hi>disordered affections;</hi> yet <hi>this</hi> may
be said in the Case, that the <hi>States</hi> were such great Masters
in the knowledge of their civil Interests, that <hi>none</hi> might
have been <hi>safelier</hi> trusted upon that account then <hi>they.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Fourth head</hi> or assertion, I have only this to answer,
that as it is natural for all Rational Creatures, of <hi>two</hi> evils to
choose the <hi>least,</hi> so supposing, that the <hi>States</hi> being reduced
to a necessity of parting with their own Government, <hi>will
have the Election</hi> of their <hi>new</hi> Lords in their own <hi>power;</hi> and
taking it for granted, that they are men of some <hi>Conscience</hi>
and <hi>Religion,</hi> (though some <hi>deny</hi> them to be so) I do fully
agree with the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> in his opinion, that they
will in such Case choose rather the <hi>English,</hi> then the severe
Government of the <hi>French,</hi> unless the consideration (in their
partial opinion) of who is best able to protect their Country,
do not prevail with them, to <hi>trust</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King in point of
<hi>Religion;</hi> but I very much question, whether it is not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to suppose, that any Nation being attacked by <hi>two</hi> great
<hi>Monarchs, will have</hi> the <hi>choice</hi> of their own Masters left to
<hi>themselves,</hi> by a <hi>mutual agreement</hi> betwixt those Monarchs,
without which it cannot be; but I highly esteem the <hi>Author</hi> of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57801:7"/>
the <hi>Letter,</hi> for the true sense he expresseth to have of the
<hi>French</hi> Government, from which the <hi>Lord in Mercy deliver
all other Countries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> assertion, is a supposition that the <hi>Dutch</hi> will
have it in their <hi>choice,</hi> to trust the <hi>French</hi> or not, and in <hi>such</hi>
Case I am of opinion with the <hi>Letter,</hi> that they will never
do it, <hi>Spain, Lorrain,</hi> and the <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> being
a sufficient <hi>warning</hi> to them; but as Affairs now stand, I very
much fear they will not have the <hi>Election</hi> of it in their own
hands.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> assertion, though as most <hi>Weighty,</hi> deserveth
most <hi>Consideration;</hi> yet for the <hi>first</hi> part of it, whether
<hi>England</hi> admitting the <hi>Dutch</hi> to a <hi>Coalition,</hi> would be of
more advantage to them then any tearms they can expect
from the <hi>French.</hi> I will not dispute, but am much of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that the <hi>French</hi> Councils, considering that they want
nothing to facilitate their <hi>universal</hi> design more then an
Interest in the <hi>Northern</hi> Seas, where they might Harbour, and
form an <hi>Navy,</hi> nourish and breed <hi>Seamen,</hi> and likewise consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
that the Maritine Towns of <hi>Holland, Zealand</hi> and
<hi>Friezland,</hi> would signifie nothing without <hi>Trade;</hi> but in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being swallowed up by the <hi>Sea,</hi> for want of ability to
maintain the <hi>Banks</hi> against it, nor <hi>Trade</hi> signifie any thing
without liberty, they would soon find it necessary as to
their Interest, to wave the <hi>French</hi> Principles for <hi>arbitrary</hi>
Government, and to leave the <hi>Dutch</hi> in a great measure of
<hi>freedom,</hi> relying only upon <hi>Cittadels,</hi> for keeping them
dependant upon them, and forcing them upon occasion to
be useful to them, as judging <hi>that</hi> the best way to serve
themselves of them, least otherwise by <hi>severity,</hi> they
should provoke the <hi>dispersing</hi> the Inhabitants to <hi>Emden,
Bremen, Hambourg, Lubeck</hi> and <hi>Dantzic,</hi> &amp;c. the four first
being <hi>Imperial Free</hi> Cities, and the latter the <hi>same</hi> under
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57801:8"/>
                     <hi>Poland;</hi> for <hi>arbitrary</hi> Government, (that must be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Sword) and the idle Callings and rude man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of <hi>Souldiers,</hi> which are altogether inconsistant with,
and <hi>Enemies</hi> to <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce,</hi> will always cause
Traders to change <hi>bondage</hi> for <hi>liberty,</hi> or at least in hopes of
better entertainment one <hi>Countrey</hi> for another, as did the
subversion of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Government in <hi>that</hi> Countrey;
and as they were preparing to do the like in <hi>Holland,</hi> when
they feared the late <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Oreng's</hi> over-turning <hi>that</hi> State,
for the <hi>Antipathy</hi> betwixt <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> is such,
that all Monarchs of <hi>Trading</hi> Countries have ever held it
their Interest, to keep their great <hi>Trading Towns</hi> free from
a <hi>Mercinary Militia,</hi> and it is exceeding difficult, if not
Morally impossible for a Prince to advance <hi>Trade</hi> to any
great <hi>height,</hi> where the people are under the awe of a
standing <hi>Military</hi> power; and the <hi>French King</hi> seems to own
the <hi>truth of this,</hi> in that finding the benefit of Commerce,
he is even in <hi>France</hi> content that his <hi>Trading</hi> Cities should
be freed from <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and more gently used then the
<hi>rest</hi> of his Countrey; for so far as the Nature of his <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
Government will permit, he studieth all manner of
wayes to advance <hi>Trade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>first,</hi> by totally prohibiting such <hi>Forrein Commodities,</hi>
and <hi>Manufactures,</hi> as his people are capable of <hi>making,</hi>
sufficient to serve his Countrey, as <hi>Train-Oyl,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> By burthening <hi>others</hi> with high <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi>
to the end to incourage his <hi>own</hi> Artisans and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
thereby making the Trade of <hi>England</hi> thither very
prejudicial to us, our <hi>Transportations</hi> hence being inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
to our <hi>Importations</hi> thence, and as they <hi>improve</hi> in
any faculty, so they either <hi>prohibit</hi> or <hi>increase</hi> their impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
upon the Importation of the Forrein-made Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of that faculty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57801:8"/>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> as an incouragement to Trade, the <hi>French</hi>
King hath lately declared the exercise of Commerce in a
<hi>Gentleman,</hi> to be no prejudice to his <hi>quality,</hi> having also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
an <hi>Academy</hi> for breeding his <hi>Nobility</hi> to <hi>Sea</hi> Affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and teaching them the Art of <hi>Navigation,</hi> &amp;c. All which
may well Alarm <hi>England</hi> to <hi>a jealousie</hi> of their designs as most
dangerous to it, and to look upon the <hi>French,</hi> as those
Rivals, whom (if hatred be <hi>lawful,</hi> as the <hi>Letter</hi> in this
Case seems to make it) we ought most to hate; for should
they once come to <hi>Vie</hi> with us in <hi>Trade</hi> or <hi>Naval</hi> strength, we
should find them to exceed all that ever went before them,
in <hi>insolency, injustice,</hi> and <hi>selfishness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whether the second part of this Notion hath a good
<hi>foundation,</hi> which asserts, <hi>That should</hi> England <hi>get but the</hi>
Sea Towns <hi>alone, leaving the</hi> rest <hi>of the</hi> States Dominions, <hi>to
the</hi> French, <hi>we should have no cause to repent our Bargain.</hi>
I will not presume to <hi>judge,</hi> yet <hi>this</hi> I think <hi>considerable</hi> in
the Case, that should the <hi>Inlands</hi> of the <hi>Vnited Provinces,</hi>
and with them all the <hi>Conquered places</hi> fall to the share of
the <hi>French,</hi> as by the late published <hi>Proposals</hi> in <hi>Dutch</hi> (if
true) they seem to pretend unto the <hi>Latter;</hi> then having
thereby the command of the Rivers of <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Mase,</hi> &amp;c.
together with <hi>Sluce,</hi> and the other Garrisons which shuts
up the Trade of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> they will have it in
their power to render all the parts of the Seventeen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
which will remain to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>
of no more <hi>use</hi> to them, then they please to <hi>allow</hi> of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Because the <hi>Sea Towns</hi> of the <hi>Vnited Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
cannot be divided from the <hi>Inlands,</hi> from which
they receive their <hi>nourishment,</hi> nor deprived of the use of
their <hi>Rivers,</hi> by which they drive their <hi>Trades</hi> without
utter <hi>ruine</hi> to them, and making them thereby an intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>burthen</hi> to their <hi>Masters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because the <hi>Spanish Netherlands</hi> will thereby be
so invironed, or rather be leagured by the <hi>French</hi> Garrisons
and Forces on all sides, as well towards <hi>Germany, Holland,</hi>
and <hi>Zealand,</hi> &amp;c. as towards <hi>France,</hi> that having no means
left them, for forming or maintaining an Army, (as any
that know those Countries must confess) they will always
be in the <hi>French Kings</hi> devotion, and when assaulted by him,
without possibility of contributing any considerable
assistance to their own <hi>deliverance,</hi> or to make the <hi>Triple
League</hi> of any use to them,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because such will be the enervated condition
of the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated,
as not being able to <hi>maintain</hi> them longer then the
<hi>French</hi> will <hi>permit</hi> him, either to quit them voluntarily, or
(if he can obtain so much <hi>favour</hi>) to make an exchange or
sale of them to the <hi>French</hi> King, who then having <hi>Flanders</hi>
and <hi>Brab<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt,</hi> (which he hath so long thirsted after) and all
the <hi>Rivers</hi> belonging to them in his own hands, will assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the advantage of <hi>himselfe,</hi> and his <hi>own Countries</hi> even
in times of <hi>peace,</hi> so <hi>obstruct</hi> and <hi>hinder</hi> the Trade of the
Maritine Towns of <hi>Holland, Zealand</hi> and <hi>Friezland,</hi> (if in the
possession of any but himself) and in times of <hi>War</hi> totally
<hi>shut</hi> them up by Land) as will restore <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant</hi>
to their <hi>ancient</hi> Trade, and make a new <hi>Holland</hi> of them,
which being in the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> will probably prove
abundantly worse to <hi>England</hi> then the old, if large <hi>experience</hi>
of injuries and injustices, committed in Trade by them against
this Nation, may warrant a Conclusion, as by the Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
under the Lord Ambassador <hi>Hollis</hi> his hand, (which I
send you here inclosed) given upon an order of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Privy Council, Dated the 17. <hi>April</hi> 1667. in the Case
of Sir <hi>Francis Toppe,</hi> and Company, doth for one instance
sufficiently appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57801:9"/>Nay, such is the <hi>envious</hi> care of the <hi>French,</hi> that no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should <hi>get</hi> or <hi>thrive</hi> by <hi>them,</hi> that (as Mr. <hi>Samuel Fortrey,</hi>
one of the Gentlemen of his Majesties <hi>Privy Chamber,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
in his Book Printed 1663. and Dedicated to <hi>King
Charles the second)</hi> not many years ago, they suspecting
(through mistakes) that <hi>England</hi> had an advantage of
them in their Trade for <hi>France,</hi> they were upon Counsels
for <hi>prohibiting</hi> all Trade with <hi>England,</hi> until upon a strict
examination, they found, that whereas <hi>England</hi> vented of
their Commodities into <hi>France,</hi> not to above the value
of <hi>Ten hundred thousand Pounds per annum; France</hi> vented
of theirs to the <hi>English Six and twenty hundred thousand
pounds;</hi> and then finding that they had <hi>Sixteen hundred
thousand Pounds</hi> advantage in the Ballance, they soon let
fall their design, though yet not without <hi>burthening English</hi>
Manufactures with <hi>New Impositions,</hi> in such manner, as
might much hinder the vent of them in their Countrey.
And Mr. <hi>Fortrey</hi> in the aforementioned <hi>Book,</hi> doth not only
recite the very <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi> it self, which he affirms was
presented to the <hi>French</hi> King, to shew the advantage they
have in their Trade with <hi>England;</hi> but also <hi>adds</hi> further,
that hereby it may appear, how insensibly our <hi>Treasure</hi>
will be <hi>exhausted,</hi> and the Nation <hi>beggered,</hi> whilst <hi>we</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
neglect our own Interest, and <hi>strangers abroad</hi> are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to make their advantage by us.</p>
                  <p>And it is of no <hi>little</hi> consideration, that the <hi>French</hi> should
so far <hi>overvalue</hi> themselves, as to increase their Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon <hi>Dutch</hi> Commodities, to a degree of <hi>prohibiting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
them, and deny to the <hi>Dutch</hi> the like power by <hi>theirs,</hi>
as if they had a right to deal as they please towards <hi>other
Nations,</hi> and yet none to do towards them (by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talliation)
any more then <hi>they</hi> shall think fit to give them
<hi>leave</hi> to do, an over weening opinion of their own <hi>greatness,</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57801:10"/>
which all <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> ought to be <hi>jealous</hi> of, as not
knowing where their ambition will end.</p>
                  <p>And besides <hi>these</hi> things thus instanced in, we have great
cause to take notice, that as the effect of the implacable
<hi>hatred</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> to our Nation, they cannot forbear in
their <hi>writings</hi> to express their <hi>inveterate malice</hi> against us, as
that Book called <hi>le Politique de France,</hi> writ in the year
1669<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Dedicated to the <hi>French</hi> King, is a pregnant
Testimony, where no <hi>better Epithetes</hi> are allowed us, then
being <hi>without friends, without faith, without Religion, without
honesty, without any justice,</hi> of <hi>defying</hi> or <hi>provoking Natures,
light</hi> or <hi>unconstant to the highest degree, cruel, impatient, gluttons,
proud, audatious and covetous, proper for ready execution and
assaults; but uncapable of managing a War with judgment,</hi>
with other such like opprobrious and reproachful expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
besides a Method propounded to be observed in order
to the Conquest of <hi>England,</hi> Page 158, 159, 160, 161. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to raise a lawful <hi>indignation</hi> in all true <hi>Englishmen,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such <hi>insolent</hi> slanderers, who by their impudence,
endeavour to impose <hi>their own</hi> Characters upon <hi>in,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the known experience of the rest of the world.</p>
                  <p>And now Sir I have no more to add then (all Circumstances
considered) my agreement with the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> in this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
that while <hi>France</hi> is so <hi>great</hi> as at present, it can in no
kind be for the <hi>safety</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to subvert <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
&amp;c. which are properly called their <hi>out-guards</hi> or
<hi>works</hi> against all Invasions, and cannot be <hi>demolished,</hi> or in
the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> without laying <hi>England naked,</hi> or at
least the more <hi>open</hi> to that Nation, and that nothing is more
demonstrable, then that since the <hi>United Provinces</hi> cannot
signifie much without <hi>freedom,</hi> they will under their own
Government be of <hi>most</hi> use to all <hi>Christendome,</hi> (save <hi>France,</hi>
who only wants them as a qualification for <hi>threatning,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of courting their Neighbours,) in maintaining the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57801:10"/>
                     <hi>general Ballance</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> even as it was great wisdom in
the <hi>long Parliament</hi> (for <hi>the wickedest of men may have worldly
prudence</hi>) to joyn with <hi>Holland</hi> in the preserving of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
as necessary for the Ballancing of <hi>Sweden,</hi> when <hi>Cromwel</hi>
(in his time) in revenge of manifest affronts, and <hi>hatred</hi> had
designed the ruine of the <hi>Dane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus Sir, having in obedience to your Commands,
given you freely my sense of the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> and <hi>Letter,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
varying from the <hi>matter</hi> in <hi>either;</hi> as it is in them respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
stated, I hope you will pardon any thing wherein I
may <hi>differ</hi> with you in <hi>judgment</hi> or <hi>opinion;</hi> for I have this
for my <hi>Buckler,</hi> that what I have writ is <hi>Truth,</hi> and that I aim
at nothing in it, but the true <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, denying that any
can have more Cordial affection for them, then my self, who
am <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>IN obedience to an Order of Council of the <hi>16th.</hi>
present, requiring my opinion, what is fit to be
done for relief of Sir <hi>Francis Toppe,</hi> and Company:
I do humbly certifie, that I have perused their Case,
and find that they complain of great losses, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
sustained in the year 1644. whilst they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in St. <hi>Malo,</hi> from the <hi>French,</hi> by seizing
their Goods in a time of Peace, in the very Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of <hi>France,</hi> whither they had brought those
Goods in a way of Trading, and where by several
Treaties then in force, and by the very Law of
Nations, (which gives a security to the Persons and
Estates of all, who reside peaceably within the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
of any Prince or State) they ought to have
been safe and free from all Arrests, the owners
not having done any thing whereby to forfeit their
Interest in them; which course, if suffered, must
needs be the destruction of all Trade and Commerce,
between the two Kingdoms, as it is also very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable,
and injurious to his Majesty, that the
publick faith should be broken to his Subjects, who
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57801:11"/>
Trade under his protection, by vertue of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
made between the two Crowns; and it is much
to be feared, that the proceedings in <hi>France</hi> may
become very prejudicial in this kind to the whole
trading of the <hi>English</hi> Nation in that Kingdom, if
nothing be done to stop this growing mischief: In
regard this is not the single Case, where this course
hath been put in practice, the like having been done
several times to <hi>English</hi> Merchants at <hi>Rouen,</hi> who
are not yet free of the trouble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a Capture at
Sea, whether real, or pretended to have been made
in 1616. by an <hi>English</hi> Privateer of a <hi>French</hi>
Ship, belonging to one <hi>Delaun<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> valued but at six
thousand Livers. And whilst I had the Honour
to serve his Majesty, as his Ambassador in <hi>France,</hi>
two <hi>English</hi> Ships coming into Harbour at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seille,</hi>
when they had Landed their Goods, and paid
all duties, were seized upon, Ships and Goods, and
notwithstanding all my solicitations, would not be
discharged: But some Months after, the War
breaking out, were given to the <hi>East India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there, they pretending some Ships of theirs, to have
been formerly taken by the <hi>English.</hi> And now as I
hear at St. <hi>John de Luz,</hi> the same usage is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
if not already begun to our Merchants there,
for the reparation of the Widow <hi>de Lazin,</hi> for some
goods of her late Husbands, taken from her by the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57801:12"/>
Parliament in 1643. So as all this makes me
fearful it may come to be a constant Custom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not
prevented. I do therefore offer it as my humble o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that all care should be taken for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. And for this particular Case of Sir
<hi>Francis Topp's.</hi> and Company, that in the first
place a fair application may be made to the <hi>French</hi>
King, as well by his Ambassador here, as by his
Majesties Ambassador at <hi>Paris,</hi> for the just satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the Petitioners, which may be hoped will
prove effectual, and should it not, it will then be
time for his Majesty to consider, what is further to
be done for the vindication, of his own Honour, and
and the protection of his Subjects.</p>
