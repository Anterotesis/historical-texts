            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe firſt brought to a Tryal was a young man charged with Stealing a Silver Tankard of the value of 5 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> out of a Gentlemans Houſe in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Brides</hi>; The Priſoner appeared to be of an idle looſe Converſation, but no proof being made directly of his taking the Plate, nor its being found with, or diſpoſed of by him, (for indeed it never was heard of) he was thereupon brought in not Guilty.</p>
            <p>An elderly comely Woman was Convicted of Stealing a Green Silk Petticoat on the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> from a Shop keeper near <hi>Pauls,</hi> whither ſhe came on pretence of buying, but it being miſſed before ſhe was out of ſight, ſhe was brought back, and at the end of the Shop, droped the Petticoat, but the Jury were ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable, as to value it but at 10 <hi>d.</hi> ſo that her Back is like to pay the wages due to the activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her Fingers.</p>
            <p>The next was a young fellow for a filthy brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh offence being Arrained on the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 7. for having the Carnal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106400:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a Maiden Child, under the Age of Ten years, The caſe was thus, (as far as 'tis neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or fit with modeſty to be related) On the twenty fifth of <hi>May</hi> laſt, a poor woman-ſent her Child being between Eight and Nine years old to a Maſters houſe of hers for ſix pence, which ſhe had before earned; This Gentleman happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then to be abroad, and the Priſoner (a luſty Lad of about 17 or 18 years old) being his Prentice, invited the Girl in, but ſhe refuſing, he pluckt her in and carried her into a back room, telling her he would give her the ſix pence anon, but having ſhut the door, laid her on the Chairs, and fell to practice his Brutality, the conſequence of which is, That the Child to this day has a Diſeaſe, as was atteſted by a Chirurgeon belonging to the Hoſpital where ſhe is in Cure; The Child fearing the Mother would have beat her, did not preſently declare the matter, though ſhe came home Crying, but there was little notice taken then, nor indeed till on the Wedneſday following, ſome unuſual ſymptomes cauſed the Mother to inquire into it, and then had a full diſcovery; nor did the Priſoner when ſoon after ſhe taxed him much deny it, but ſeemed to make ſome Overtures of paying 12 <hi>d.</hi> a week toward her Cure; ſo that the matter of fact was proved as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in ſuch a Caſe by the Teſtimony of a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, and other Matrons, and the Childs own Relation who declared it very plainly in Court, upon all which he was found Guilty, and being
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106400:3"/>
by the Statute excluded from benefit of Clergy was Condemn'd to Dye.</p>
            <p>Another young fellow was Convicted for ſtealing a Silver Tankard valued at Five pound ten ſhillings at <hi>Stepney,</hi> on the thirteeth of <hi>May,</hi> it was taken with him before he was far gone, <hi>viz.</hi> in the houſe of Office, being ſeen by one who told the Maſter of the houſe to take it out of the Room, where he and another Companion of his were a drinking; he now pretended that fearing his Aſſociate might be naught, he took the Tankard with him to the neceſſary houſe, only to ſecure it, and meant to have preſently brought it in, having no thoughts of ſtealing it, but the Jury had little reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, and therefore brought him in Guilty.</p>
            <p>A Woman was Indicted for Stealing a very great quantity of Apparel, and rich Linnen, divers pieces of Gold, and three <hi>l.</hi> in Silver, To which ſhe reſolutely pleaded Guilty, and was afterwards tryed for another Felony, but upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted being an old Offender, ſhe was for the firſt Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by a Jury of Women was found quick with Child.</p>
            <p>There were ſeveral Indictments brought againſt a fellow, one for ſtealing a Wheelbarrow and Shovel, another for Horſes Harneſs at <hi>Maribone,</hi> &amp;c. but he pleaded Guilty to them, all within benefit, which yet was like to be no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to him, for it was ſaid he had been burnt in the hand at <hi>Kingſton,</hi> and tyed up at <hi>Maidſton</hi> before, however that not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, he was now for ſurety ſake burnt foundly.</p>
            <p>After this ſucceeded Indictments of Murder againſt four ſeveral perſons. The firſt, a young fellow, who on the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> at <hi>Pancraſs,</hi> going to drink in a Nine-pin-yard with a man that wrought together with him; the other was trying his skill to tip the four Corner-pins, and the Priſoner to interrupt him flung his hat at them: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other perſon now dead took his Hat, and carried it over a Bank, and there flung it into water, and ſtamped on it; but ſtill in a way of merriment, which the now Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thought to anſwer by taking up one of the Pins, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106400:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with both hands heaving or toſſing it towards him, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as he alleadged, and ſome of the Witneſſes believed, onely to daſh up the water upon him: But the Pin unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily hit him on the left part of the Head nigh the Ear, and ſo fatally, that it knockt him down for the preſent; and though he got up and went home, ſeeming pretty well, yet the next day he died. However, there appearing no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice preceding, the Priſoner was onely found guilty of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter, and burnt in the hand.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, was a perſon charged with killing his Wife. The matter of fact was thus: On the 21 of <hi>May,</hi> about eleven a clock at night a noiſe, and, as ſome ſaid, a crying out was heard; and Neighbours coming out, found this woman lying at her own door almoſt dead; but no body near her: they carried her into an houſe, and uſing means brought her to life, ſo as to ſpeak, deſiring to be put to bed; but though asked, ſhe did not declare any body had wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her. However there was a ſuſpition her Husband had beaten her; and ſome asking him about it, he at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it; but afterwards ſaid, if he did, it was onely with his Hands and Feet, as one Witneſs alleadged. The woman died about two hours after, and there was no bruiſe found about her that could be judged mortal: Beſides, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſhe had moſt part of her life been troubled with Fits, and eſpecially of late; and likewiſe had a little before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome hurt by a Cows kicking. Upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there appeared no reaſon for judging him the means of her death; and therefore he was acquitted.</p>
            <p>The third, was a Carpenters man, who getting up on a ſtrange Horſe to ride him to water, aſſoon as he was on his back the Horſe run away with him, and in <hi>Fanchurch-ſtreet</hi> flung down a deaf and dumb lad of about 15 years old, ſo violently, that he ſoon after died; but it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the priſoner could not rule the Horſe, but had his own life at the ſame time endangered by a fall, he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcharged.</p>
            <p>The fourth was more black and fatal, which was of a foot
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106400:4"/>
Souldier, who on the 18th of <hi>June,</hi> marching towards <hi>Brainford,</hi> had it ſeems drank too much, and lay aſleep in a field in <hi>Chiſwick</hi> pariſh, where a Countryman was cutting peaſe, who obſerving that he had neither Sword nor Belt, concluded ſomebody in that condition might have ſtoln them from him; and therefore ſeeing afterwards three other Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers come along, deſired them to wake him, and take him with them, which they, though ſtrangers, were willing to do. They found him lying on his Muſquet, and that cockt, which one of them uncockt, and with much difficulty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked him, deſiring him very civilly to go along with them, and not lie there, leſt he ſhould loſe his Arms; withal ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him if his Muſquet were loaden, who anſwered ſwearing, that it was both with powder and ball; but inſtead of going with them turned back towards <hi>London</hi>; whereupon the perſon killed, very courteouſly and with kinde words, took him by the arm and turned him the other way, telling him that was the way they were to march, and he would help him along; but the priſoner tumbling down, and as they were ſtanding at a ſmall diſtance, riſing up again upon his knees, cocks his Muſquet again, and preſents it at them, and giving fire, ſhot one of the three Souldiers into the right part of the belly, juſt below the Saſh, making a wound of two Inches broad and ten deep, of which he inſtantly died without ſpeaking a word, and his Comrade and the reſt ſeiz'd the Priſoner, who had now nothing to ſay for himſelf, ſave only that he was in drink, but that was an inſufficient Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe in Law, it appeared he knew his Musket, to be charged with a Bullet, and that he voluntarily cockt it again, when they out of their care had uncockt it, ſo that he was neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found guilty of Murder, and received Sentance of Death.</p>
            <p>A notable Shop-Jilt, was Tryed for ſtealing of 134 yards of Taffata Ribbon, on the tenth of <hi>June,</hi> out of a Shop in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> the Gentlewoman that proſecuted being alone in her Shop, and finding her Cuſtomer ſo nice and hard to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuſpected her, and turning up her Scarfe, ſaw the piece
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106400:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Ribbon under her Arm, which thereupon ſhe dropt; All that ſhe had now to alleadge was, <hi>That it was her way, to put her hands under her Scarfe, but ſhe had no intention good-woman to ſteal the Ribbon</hi>; However, ſhe is like to be led and drove both at once another way, being ſentenced to be whipt at the Carts tail, the Jury finding it but of the value of ten pence.</p>
            <p>A Country fellow was Indicted for having two Wives, Married to the firſt about ſix years agoe in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> to the ſecond about two years ago at <hi>Dukes Place,</hi> the laſt he own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but denied the firſt, though he had formerly confeſt it before a Magiſtrate, yet there being no other proof, for the Woman her ſelf could be none, he was acquitted.</p>
            <p>A Souldier was Convicted of Felony, for departing from his Colours without leave, contrary to the form of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, it was proved that he had been muſtered and received Pay, and had abſented himſelf, and torn the Lace off his Hat, and changed his Habit, that he might not be known, for which offence he was Condemned.</p>
            <p>A Man and his Wife having been Lodgers at a Butchers, were Indicted, together with another Woman for Stealing of two hundred and ten pound out of one of his Rooms, when all the Family were at their Shop in <hi>Newgate Market,</hi> which 'twas ſuppoſed was done by counterfeiting a Key to the door; There were divers witneſſes examined, but none that could directly or expreſly faſten it on the Priſoners, ſo that they came off not guilty.</p>
            <p>The laſt tryed were a woman for ſtealing a Silver Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, worth ſeven pound ten, about three years ago, and a Man for ſtealing another Silver Tankard, 24 <hi>Sept.</hi> laſt from an Ale-houſe in St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the fields, who were both found Guilty, the Man having been burnt in the hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſet by for Tranſportation, and the Woman having been an old Offender, received Sentance of death.</p>
            <p>In all there were Five Condemned, Three Men, and Two Women, Six burnt in the hand, and Five ordered
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106400:5"/>
to be whipt, ſeveral that were in Goal on ſuſpition of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries on the Highway, and Burglaries in the Country, were ordered to be carried the reſpective Circuits, and in calling over the Goal, the Maid formerly committed for Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was brought to the Bar, and askt ſeveral queſtions, to which ſhe modeſtly anſwered, ſeeming to confeſs her having taken upon her to be God, and yet declaring that ſhe went to Church, and being demanded the reaſons why ſhe went thither, replyed, <hi>To hear the Word of God,</hi> ſo that the Court having gravely adviſed her to Repent, askt if ſhe could procure good Bail, and who would do ſo much for her, ſhe ſaid, ſhe did not doubt but ſome of her Maſters that ſhe had lived with would be her Sureties, having as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, lived in <hi>London</hi> twenty years; in the mean time till ſhe could provide ſuch Bail, ſhe was ſent back to Priſon.</p>
