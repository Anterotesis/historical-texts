            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105348:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we were in any <hi>dangerous Opinions</hi> (which yet is more than all the <hi>Bishops,</hi> were they as willing as they are averse to it; will ever be able to make proof of to our faces) it had been an <hi>apter means</hi> to <hi>reclaim</hi> us from them, and to <hi>stop</hi> the <hi>growth</hi> of what he in his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Emphatical</hi> way scornes at under the name of <hi>Quakerism,</hi> and more <hi>suitable</hi> to the <hi>Profession</hi> of <hi>Gospel Ministers, Bishops</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> of the Church, more answerable to <hi>Divine Iustice,</hi> more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the professed <hi>Piety, Humanity,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of that <hi>House,</hi> and the other also, more agreeable to the <hi>Kings</hi> wonted <hi>Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> if not to have quitted those more <hi>riged Inflictions</hi> by <hi>Penalties</hi> altogether, yet at least to have used first those <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Courses,</hi> which the <hi>Bishop</hi> calls <hi>softer Applications,</hi> for our <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of the <hi>lawfulness</hi> by <hi>God's,</hi> aswel as <hi>Man's</hi> Law, of both those things, which by the said Act, on pain of <hi>Spoile</hi> and <hi>Banishment,</hi> are strictly <hi>imposed</hi> on us, which are not only that of <hi>Swearing,</hi> which the Bishop would fain seem to have said something (though <hi>hoc aliquid nihil est</hi>) more then was ever said before in proof of the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of, but also that Sin of <hi>forbearing</hi> to meet together to <hi>Worship</hi> God <hi>publickly,</hi> according to our <hi>Consciences,</hi> and his <hi>own Will</hi> concerning us.</p>
            <p>Yea and lastly, to add one thing more, which (whether the <hi>Bishop</hi> forgot to urge it or no, I know not, but sure I am) had as great weight of <hi>a reason</hi> in it as any of the rest, to have <hi>byassed</hi> and <hi>swa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>We say the <hi>urging</hi> of <hi>all these Promises</hi> had been an <hi>Argument</hi> of as much force in it self, and as much likely to have prevailed with the House, as any of the rest, had it been in the mind of the <hi>Bishop</hi> to have made use of it (as it seems it was not) for this is enough to render the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>King less Creditable</hi> among all (save such as are yet unwilling to believe any otherwise of him, than that he once <hi>truly intended</hi> what was then by him so <hi>solemnly Avouched</hi>) that instead of an <hi>Act</hi> for the full granting of the <hi>Liberty</hi> so <hi>often</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, there is an <hi>Act</hi> now out for the <hi>final</hi> taking away of the same.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And as for those words, <hi>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain,</hi> they rather <hi>forbid all,</hi> than <hi>command any swearing,</hi> if the <hi>Bish.</hi> words be true (as they are) who sayes, <hi>A true Christians Oath is needless, his word being as firm as it,</hi> p. 41. and an <hi>evil mans Oath worthy of no more credit than a</hi> Lyar, p. 17. Since upon that account, whoever <hi>swears</hi> by the <hi>Name of God,</hi> swears <hi>in vain,</hi> and to <hi>no purpose,</hi> whether he be a <hi>true man,</hi> or <hi>one deceitful,</hi> his word amounting to as much as his <hi>Oath;</hi> for <hi>frustra fit per plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra quod potest sieri per pauciora.</hi> And so whereas the <hi>Bish.</hi> says, <hi>there is no danger of doing hurt to our own consciences, any more in Oaths, than in serious affirmations and negations,</hi> We say there is, if <hi>swearing needlesly</hi> by <hi>God's Name</hi> be (as it is) a <hi>taking Gods Name in vain,</hi> fith <hi>the Lord will not hold him guiltless who taketh his Name in vain.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>So that whereas he says thus; <hi>Swearing is a part of that Moral Law, which Christ signally tells, he came not, nor ever intended to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, but maintain;</hi> he may as well say, <hi>Christ came not,</hi> nor <hi>ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> by his coming to abolish <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>transgression,</hi> which is the <hi>end of Oaths;</hi> for if he came to <hi>finish transgression,</hi> and <hi>make an end of sin</hi> among his people, and to bring <hi>in everlasting righteousness,</hi> then to end <hi>Oaths</hi> also among <hi>his disciples,</hi> which <hi>stand</hi> for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>end</hi> then to <hi>end strife, while</hi> and <hi>where</hi> it stands; for, <hi>Absente aliquo sine,</hi> (<hi>de jure</hi>) <hi>cessat medium tendens ad istum sinem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, in that he says, Christ maintains Oaths, so far as the <hi>love of God, and our neighbour are great accomplishments of all Laws,</hi> to both which religious swearing is most conform; Herein he <hi>pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably contradicts</hi> not onely the <hi>Truth,</hi> but <hi>himself</hi> also, who says, <hi>Swearing</hi> is to be <hi>no where,</hi> but where <hi>strife is,</hi> which is a work of the <hi>flesh, inconsistent</hi> with <hi>true love to the neighbour,</hi> and not <hi>most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> to it; for <hi>love fulfills the Law, works no ill to the neigbour, ends all strife,</hi> and so puts <hi>swearing</hi> (the means to <hi>end strife</hi>) out of <hi>place</hi> and <hi>date.</hi>
