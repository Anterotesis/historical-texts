            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
HISTORY
OF THE
GUNPOWDER TREASON.</head>
            <p>THere are no Conspiracies and Insurrections
more dangerous to States and Governments,
than those that the name of Religion is made
to patronize; for when that doth head and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the Party, as it makes it look somewhat conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in it self, so it doth inspire those that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
with a certain furious and intemper ate zeal,
and an ungovernable violence; they then rebel with
authority, and kill with a safe conscience, and think
they cannot do amis as long as it is to <hi>do God service.
The Brother will then deliver up the Brother to death, and
the Father the Child: and the Children will rise up against
their Parents, and cause them to be put to death;</hi> and the
Laws of Nature, which are of themselves sacred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable,
shall in such a case be despised and lose their
authority. This, this is it which in these latter Ages more
especially hath disturbed Governments, disposed of the
Crowns of Princes, and troubled the peace of the world:
From hence spring all those mischiefs that threatned
and perpetually allarm'd this Nation during the long
and fortunate Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> From hence
proceeded that barbarous and bloody design of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62576:3"/>
               <hi>Gunpowder Treason</hi> in the year 1605. Such a Design a
the World before never heard of, and which Posterity
will hardly believe for the horror of it, say the soberer
of their own<note n="*" place="margin">Thuanus Barclay. Rog. Widdring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polog.</hi> pro jure Principum. Pag. 1.</note> Authors: such a design as even some
of the Jesuits, after it miscarried, and they saw how ill
it was resented by the rest of mankind, professed their
detestation of<note n="*" place="margin">Mori histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria missionis Anglicanae praefat.</note>; but how little to their own vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the satisfaction of the World will easily appear
to any one that doth impartially inquire into the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
and the process of it. For this design was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up of a sudden, and what a small company of rash
and hot-headed persons did without consideration at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
but what proceeded from the same original, and
was carried on by the same Counsels and Endeavours
that were in being in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> the
principals in which for their time were <hi>Garnet</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
of the Jesuits in <hi>England, Baldwin</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
and <hi>Creswel</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> these were the great Projectors
and Encouragers of that which was called the <hi>Spanish
Treason</hi> in the last year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and which
when defeated in by her death, and the Peace that issued
upon it betwixt the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> they
were put upon new Counsels, and forced to take other
Measures for the prosecution of it.</p>
            <p>It was in <hi>Decemb.</hi> in the year 1601,<note place="margin">The Spanish Treason,</note> that <hi>Tho. Winter</hi>
was sent into <hi>Spain</hi> by the ioynt advice of <hi>Henry Garnet</hi>
and <hi>Oswald Tesmond</hi> Jesuits, and of <hi>Robert Catesby</hi> and
<hi>Francis Tresham,</hi> Gentlemen of good quality and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
to try what could be done for <hi>Their</hi> assistance
that were ready to sacrifice their lives and fortunes for
the Catholick Cause; and to assure the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
that could they but prevail with him to send over an
Army, they would have in readiness 1500 or 2000
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62576:3"/>
horses for the service. With <hi>Winter</hi> was sent over
<hi>Oswald Tesmond,</hi> and by them a Letter to <hi>Creswel</hi> the
Jesuit then residing there, By whose Mediation the
motion was readily hearkned to, and <hi>Don Pedro Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesa,</hi>
second Secretary of State, and the Duke of
<hi>Lerma</hi> did assure them of the Kings furtherance and
help; and in the Conclusion the Count of <hi>Miranda</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
told them that his Master had resolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
two hundred thousand Crowns to that use, half
to be paid that year, and the rest the next following,
and that at <hi>Spring</hi> he would without fail set footing in
England.</p>
            <p>About the latter end of the year <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
with this joyful news, and they were now busie
in preparing for it, and almost every day expecting
the arrival of these Forces, when of a sudden all was
dashed by the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which was
<hi>March 24. 1602.</hi> Upon this one of the <hi>Wrights</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
despatched into <hi>Spain,</hi> to give the King no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it; and about the same time was <hi>Guy Fawks</hi> sent
with Letters and Commission from Sir <hi>William Stanly,
Hugh Owen,</hi> and <hi>Baldwin</hi> the <hi>Jesuit</hi> (who were then in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and ready to attend and to prosecute the same
Design) But That King told them that he was now other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
resolved and it became him not to hearken to such
proposals, after he had sent Embassadors to the new King
of <hi>England</hi> to treat of a Peace. It was now therefore fit
either to let their Design fall, or to betake themselves to
some other course to Effect it; but the Former their
Temper and their Principles would not permit; And
therefore since they could not promise themselves suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
therein by force, they did contrive how without
any noise or visible and open preparations it might be
obtained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62576:4"/>
That a King or Queen who is an Heretick may be
deposed or killed was current Doctrine amongst them,<note place="margin">The rise of the Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Plot.</note>
in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and what they had
been taught from Father <hi>Creswel,</hi> or whoever was the
Author of the Book called <hi>Philopater,</hi> and by <hi>Tresham</hi>
in his Book <hi>de officio hominis Christiani,</hi> found with them
about this time.<note place="margin">Proceedings against the Traitors.</note> And though the King was not formally
declared and proceeded against as such, yet it was
thought sufficient by them that the Pope on <hi>Maunday-Thursday</hi>
did censure and Condemn all Hereticks in the
general, as <hi>Guy Fawkes</hi> and others of them did confess.
And therefore the Question was not so much about
the lawfulness of it, as about the order that was to be
observed, and the way that was fit to be taken in it.
<hi>Catesby</hi> who was no Novice in these affairs, and that
from his acquaintance with <hi>Parsons</hi> when in <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Garnet</hi> and the other Jesuits (to whose order he and
his Family, from <hi>Campian</hi> down to this time, were
particularly devoted) had learned great skill and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
quickly contrived this for them; and when <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
who was of the house of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and at
that time one of the Kings Pensioners, according to
the bluntness of his temper, did offer himself for the
service, and that he would without any more adoe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to assassinate the King; This wary Gentleman
replyed that would be too dear a purchase, when his
own life would be hazarded in it; and it was unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
when it might as well be accomplished without
it; And so acquaints him in part with what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>Before this was fit to be fully Communicated, he
thought it necessary that there should be some care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to obliege all to Secrecy; for which purpose an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62576:4"/>
Oath was devised that every one should take, and
which was accordingly Administred to them by <hi>Gerard</hi>
the Jesuit. The Oath was,</p>
            <p>You shall swear by the blessed Trinity,<note place="margin">The Oath of Secrecy.</note> and by the
Sacrament you now purpose to receive, never to disclose
Directly nor Indirectly, by word or circumstance, the
matter that shall be proposed to you to keep Secret nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
from the Execution thereof, until the rest shall give
you leave.</p>
            <p>This was taken and the Sacrament upon it received by
<hi>Catesby, Percy, Christopher Wright, Thomas Winter,</hi> and
<hi>Faukes</hi> in <hi>May 1604.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which <hi>Catesby</hi> Communicated the whole,<note place="margin">The Plot.</note> and
told them that at the meeting of the Parliament which
now drew on, they would have a fair Opportunity to
consummate all their wishes, &amp; without being observed
or discovered by one fatal Blow to destroy the King,
the Prince, the Duke, and the Parliament at once; for
as long as there were those breaches of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
remaining, to what purpose would it be to make
away the King, and as long as there was a Parliament
in being, what should they get if they could not as
well Destroy the Branches as the Root. Therefore his
Design was to extirpate at once all the seeds of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
and by a train of Powder conveniently laid under
the House in which at that time they should all be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
to Blow them up, and their Cause together.
This was what the Confederates very well approved of,
and now the united Counsels and Endeavours to carry
it on.</p>
            <p>The first thing to be Considered was the hiring of the
House,<note place="margin">The house made choice of.</note> and this <hi>Percy</hi> undertook, and having not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some difficulty perswaded the present Tenant <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62576:5"/>
to quit it, he became immediate Tenant to <hi>Whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi>
Keeper of the <hi>Wardrope,</hi> at whose disposal it was
in the intervals of Parliament. The House was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the care of <hi>Faukes,</hi> as being least known,
who, the better to Conceal himself, changed his Name
to <hi>Johnson,</hi> and gave himself out to be <hi>Perey</hi>'s Servant.
Whilst they were thus busie in Contriving and carrying
on their Plot, the Parliament was prorogued till <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>
the 7th, upon which they dispersed themselves into
several Countreys; but to lose no time, did think of
taking in some other Persons whom they might Confide
in,<note place="margin">Others taken in to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates.</note> and expect some help from. <hi>Catesby</hi> was sensible
that he had given <hi>Thomas Bates,</hi> a Servant of his that
attended him, too great cause of Suspicion, and upon
Examination found him to have observed somewhat
from his Proceedings, and therefore invited him into
the undertaking, but he somewhat surprized at the
horror of it, began to Decline it, till his Master referd
him for Advice to <hi>Tesmond,</hi> unto whom imparting it in
Confession, the subtile Priest both invited him to it as a
work of great merit, and obliged him to Secrecy and
Fidelity therein. Then were <hi>Robert Keyes</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Wright</hi> Gentlemen, and <hi>Ambrose Rockwood,</hi> and
<hi>John Grant,</hi> and <hi>Robert Winter,</hi> Esquires admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Number. In <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term they met again,
and then they thought fit to provide a Storehouse for
the Timber which they should use in the Mine that they
intended to make, and for the Powder and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
from whence they might fetch it as Occasion
served. And such a place they found and took at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.
December</hi> 11th, they began to work, but what
from the Difficulty of the work (the Wall that they
were to make their way through being 3 Ells thick)
what from their want of skill in it, and of being used
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62576:5"/>
to such kind of Labour, they found that their time
would be too short for their Enterprize, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to Despair of success in it. But when under this
Irresolution and Discouragement, their hopes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
by two unexpected Accidents. For first the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was Adjourned to the 5th of <hi>October</hi> following,
by which means they should have time before them.
And then they had an opportunity of hiring a Vault,
much more for their turn than the Mine which they had
so long Employed themselves in. This they came to
knowledge of upon this Occasion; As they were one
day busie at their work, they were not a little frighted
by an unusual noise on the other side of the Wall, which
made them think that they were betrayed, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
themselves to their weapons with a resolution of
dying upon the place. But <hi>Fauks</hi> who was sent out to
make Discovery returns with Joy to tell them that it
was only the removing of Coals that were laid in the
adjoyning Vault or Cellar, which was now to be let.
This they presently hire,<note place="margin">The Vault hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> thither they brought their
stores. By this means they quined a double advantage,
first that their business was brought into a less room,
which was more for their ease and safety, and then
that they were rid of their hard, and but upon such a
cause, to them intolerable Labour; for this was a Mine
as it were, already and what was so well scituated by
its being almost under the Royal Throne, that they
could not have chose any thing more commodious.
And now they are at leisure not so much to think of
this Design (for that was brought to its head, and
what they reckoned themselves sure of) as how to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on the other part of it. The King and Prince <hi>Henry</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62576:6"/>
they did not doubt would fall in this common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but the Duke, being but four years old, they
thought would be absent; of him therefore <hi>Percy</hi> took
the charge, and said, he would attend about the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
till the Blow was given, and then in a trice conveigh
him away, with the help of two or three that should
be ready on horse-back; which they might the more
easily do, as many of the Court would be that day up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
attendance and perish with the rest, and the others
would by it be put into Confusion, and unprovided to
make any opposition. As for the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> she
might be reserved, and her Name made use of by them
in stilling and composing the minds of the people, and
for making good whatever they thought fit to use her
Authority in; And her they might the more easily gain
into their hands, as she was now at the Lord <hi>Harringtons</hi>
at <hi>Comb-Abby</hi> in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> whereabouts they might
securely be under the pretence of an Hunting-match,
and with the first news there surprize her.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, was care taken to give notice to those
abroad whom they might trust; and in <hi>March 1605.</hi> is

and with letters from <hi>Garnet</hi> to <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Legier Jesuit
in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Sr. <hi>William</hi> was absent, but having first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
the Oath of Secrecy, to <hi>Owen,</hi> he acquaints
him with the Plot, who promised to give his utmost
assistance; and to dispose Sir <hi>William</hi> to it (whom he
thought it not fit for the present to cummunicate it to,
for fear he might be discovered and fail in a design, that
he was then about in the Court of <hi>England.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the 20 Barrels of Powder laid in at first; they
added in <hi>July, 20</hi> more with Barrs of Iron, and massie
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62576:6"/>
Stones, and at the last made up the Number Thirty Six;
over which they laid a Thousand Billets, and Five-hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Faggots. And at a Meeting at the <hi>Bath,</hi> of <hi>Percy</hi>
and <hi>Catesby,</hi> it was agreed that <hi>Catesby</hi> should take in
whom he thought fit, who thereupon engaged Sir <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard
Digby,</hi> that promised to advance 1500 <hi>l.</hi> towards it;
and Mr. <hi>Francis Tresham,</hi> that gave him assurance of
2000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All things thus being in a readiness,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued.</note> the Parliament
was again Prorogued till the Fift of <hi>November;</hi> upon
which they retired, with a promise of meeting about
Ten daies before. At which time <hi>Catesby,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by <hi>Winter</hi> at a House by <hi>Enfield</hi> Chase, that
the Prince was not likely to be present with the King,
there was another Plot laid to surprize him, if it should
so happen.</p>
            <p>The time drew very near, and they that had past so
long without discovery, seem'd now to be above the
the fear of it. All things had so happily concurred to
further their design, and they had all approved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be so trusty in it, that they were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
how to manage the success than to fear it. But
God that had a reserve of favour for us, and that doth
delight in catching the wise in their own craftiness, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them to proceed thus far in it, that the detection
and overthrow of it might appear to be more from his
than Man's Providence. When <hi>Catesby</hi> first thought
of this, the great difficulty with him was about the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of destroying the innocent with the guilty. For
the blow would know no difference betwixt a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and a Heretick, betwixt a Friend or F. O. When the
Nobles and the Commons, those that were a part of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62576:7"/>
that Assembly, and those that came to be Auditors and
Spectators only; those that were within, and those
that were without the House; when no less than Thirty
thousand must perish at once by it (as <hi>Barclay</hi> saith it
was computed) it must needs be that many whom they
wished well to; and that also (if they knew it) would
wish well to their cause must be part of the Sacrifice.
What an havock would Thirty-six Barrels, or Nine or
Ten-thousand Pound of Powder make, loaded thus with
Bars of Iron, massie Stones, and great pieces of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
how would it tear the Foundations of the strongest
Buildings, throw down all the Tops of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Houses, and bury all within the ruins of
both? What would become of their Friends and Allies,
those that they had received much kindness from, and
others who neither did nor knew how to do them an
injury? How many Families must they undo, by the
loss of Relations, Estates, and Records which were
there deposited? This and much more was what they
well foresaw, and what they could not foresee without
some kind of horror, if they had but one spark of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
left untouched by their unnatural Religion.
What must therefore be done; to whom should he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
for Counsel,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Catesby</hi>'s Case of Conscience.</note> but to his fast Friend Father <hi>Garnet,</hi>
to him he opens the Case (as far as it was fit and as far
as the other was willing to know of it) after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <q>Whether for the good and Promotion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
cause (the necessity of time and occasion so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring)
it be lawfull or not amongst many Nocents
to destroy and take away some Innocents also?</q>
            <q>To which the Jesuit replies, That if the advantage
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62576:7"/>
was greater on the side of the Catholicks by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Innocent with the Nocent, than by the
preservation of both, it was doubtless lawful; further
explaining himself by this comparison.</q>
            <q>That, if at the
taking of a Town possessed by the Enemy, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be seen Friends, they must undergo the Fortune
of War, and the General and Common destruction
of the Enemy.</q>
            <p>With this answer <hi>Catesby</hi> was satisfied, and with this
he satisfied others, telling them that it was the resolution
of the Case given by the Provincial.</p>
            <p>But,<note place="margin">A Letter sent to the Lord <hi>Monteagle.</hi>
               </note> yet though this did thus compose their Minds,
and what they were generally satisfied with, there
wanted not one that having a kindness for the Lord
<hi>Monteagle,</hi> eldest Son to the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> sent this
Note to him, by the hands of one of his Foot-boyes
that was abroad in the Evening of the Saturday was
Sennight before the appointed time for the meeting of
the Parliament.</p>
            <p>My Lord,</p>
            <p>Out of the love I hear to some of your Friends, I have a
care of your preservation. Therefore I would advise you,
as you tender your life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to devise some excuse to shift off
your Attendance at this Parliament. For God and Man
have Concurred to punish the wickedness of this time.
And think not slightly of this Advertisment, but retire
your self into your Contrey, where you may expect the
Event in safety: For though there be no appearance of any
stir; yet I say, they shall receive a terrible blow this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and yet they shall not see who hurt them. This
Counsel is not to be contemned, because it may do you
good, and can do you no harm: For the danger is past
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62576:8"/>
as soon as you shall have burned this Letter. And I hope
God will give you the grace to make good use of it. To
whose Holy protection I commend you.</p>
            <p>The Letter was without Date or Subscription, and the
hand in which it was write was hardly legible, and the
contents of it so perplexed, that the Lord knew as little
what to make of it, as whence it came. But yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
since it respected more than himself he thought not
fit to conceal it, and presently repaired to <hi>White-hall,</hi>
and put it into the hands of the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Secretary of State. The Earl commended the
Lord for his care and Fidelity; and told him that
though there seemed to be little in it, yet because of the
reports that he had received from abroad, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
this Session of Parliament would be very busie
and insolent in their demands for Toleration upon some
prospect they had of being in a condition to command it;
and also that because nothing that concerned the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Majesty and Peace of his Government ought to
be slighted, he would advise with others of his Majesties
Council about it. Accordingly he shewed it to the Lord
Chamberlain, (to whom it particularly belonged to
visit all places where his Majesty either lived or to
which he did resort) to the Lord High-Admiral, the Earls
of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Northampton;</hi> who all were of the
same mind with the Secretary, and concluded it fit to
deliver it to the King at his return from <hi>Royston,</hi> when
he came from hunting, and from whence he was expected
the <hi>Thursday</hi> following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62576:8"/>
On the next day after his Return,<note place="margin">The Letter presented to the King.</note> the Earl presented
him with it, and told him how it came to his hands.
After the reading of it, the King made a pause, and then
reading it again, said, that there seemed somewhat in
it extraordinary, and what was by no means to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
The Earl replied, that it seemed to him to be
written by a Fool, or a Mad-man; for who else could be
guilty of saying, <hi>The Danger is past as soon as you have
burn'd the Letter?</hi> for what Danger could there be in
that, which the burning of the Letter would put an end
to? But the King considering the smartness of the
Stile, and withal what was said before, <hi>That they should
receive a terrible Blow, and yet should not see who hurt them,</hi>
did conclude, as he was walking and musing in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
that the Danger must be sudden, and like the
blowing up by Gunpowder; for what else could the
Parliament be in danger of? or what Rebellion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
could there be, and yet there be no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Stir therein? or how could they be otherwise
hurt, and not see who hurt them? And as for the
Phrase which the Secretary particularly offered at, he
said, to him it seemed to be of a quite different signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and that thereby was to be understood the Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denness
and Quickness of it, which should as soon or as
quickly be done, as that Paper might be burnt. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
this was the sence of it, and what he that wrote it
did intend, who was no Fool, as appears by the other
parts of the Letter; and yet the Discovery of it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
being against the common Construction, far
from what any other did apprehend by it; and therefore
it is what even some of the adverse Party have looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as God's Inspiration. So <hi>John Barclay</hi> entitles his
little Book that he wrote about it, <hi>Series patefacti divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62576:9"/>
Parricidii,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Spondanus,</hi> Ann. 1605. §. 8.
saith of the King, that <hi>divinitus evasit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Secretary admired the King's great Sagacity; and
tho he seemed to differ from him whilst in his presence,
yet presently conferred with the Lords about it, and on
Saturday it was resolved, that the Houses and Rooms
thereabouts should be searched. The Care of this was
committed to the Lord Chamberlain,<note place="margin">The House ordered to be searched.</note> who was appointed
on <hi>Munday</hi> to make the Search; which he accordingly
did that evening, being accompanied with the Lord
<hi>Monteagle,</hi> that was very desirous of seeing the Event.
Having view'd this House, they found in a Vault under
Ground great Store of Billets, Faggots, and Coal, brought
thither (as Mr. <hi>Whinyard</hi> told them) for the use of Mr.
<hi>Percy,</hi> and spied <hi>Faux</hi> standing in a Corner of the
Cellar, who said that he was Mr. <hi>Percy</hi>'s Servant, and
left there by him for the keeping of his House. Upon
the naming of <hi>Percy,</hi> the Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi> told the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,
that he now vehemently suspected Mr. <hi>Percy</hi> to
be the Author of that Letter, both from his Inclination
to the Romish Religion, and the Intimacy that had been
betwixt them. How true that Lord's Conjecture was, I
I know not, (for Bishop <hi>Goodman</hi> in his Answer to Sir
<hi>Anth. Weldon</hi>'s Court of K. <hi>James,</hi> saith, That <hi>Tresham</hi> sent
it). But that Circumstance, with what they had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
so much encreased the Suspicion, that when all
was reported by the Lord Chamberlain to the King, in
the presence of the Lord Admiral, Lord Treasurer, the
Earls of <hi>Worcester, Northampton,</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> it was
resolved, that further Search should be made, what was
under that great Pile of Fewel, in such a House where
<hi>Percy</hi> had so little occasion to reside. But what for
avoiding the Report of too much Credulity, and Easiness
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62576:9"/>
to receive Informations of that kind; what from the care
of doing any thing that might redound to the blemish
of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> whose near Relation, and
great Confident this <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> was; it was resolved
to do it under the pretence of making Inquisition for
some of the Kings Hangings, that were stollen out of
<hi>Whinyard's</hi> Custody. Sir <hi>Thomas Knevet,</hi> one of the
King's Privy-Chamber, was employed in it, being a
Person in publick Office, as a Justice of Peace, and of
great Prudence. At midnight he repaired thither,
and found <hi>Faux</hi> standing at the Door, booted and
spurr'd, whom he presently apprehended. Then
proceeding, he first lighted upon one of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and after discovered the rest of the Barrels. Upon
which causing <hi>Faux</hi> to be searched, he found about him
three Matches, a Tinderbox, and a dark Lanthorn.</p>
            <p>Being thus taken in the Fact,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fawks</hi> his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour upon his Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> he both confessed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it, adding, <hi>That if he had happened to be within
the House, as he was without, he would by putting Fire to the
Train, have put an end to their Enquiry.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had such happy Success, immediatly returns with
joy to the Palace, and acquaints the Lord Chamberlain,
and Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> with it, who went to the King's
Bedchamber, and with as much hast as joy the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain
told the King, that all was discovered, and the
Traitor in safe Custody. This was about four of the
Clock in the Morning. As soon as the Council met,
(who were immediatly sent for) the Prisoner was taken
into Examination, and to the amazement of all appeared
no more dash'd by their presence, or the Questions put
to him, or the Condition that he was in, than if he had
been altogether innocent, declaring, <hi>That he was not at
all sorry for what he had design'd, but only that he fail'd in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62576:10"/>
the execution of it; and that the Devil, and not God, was
the Discoverer.</hi> So pertinacious and resolute was he, that
he would not own any Accomplices, but that he alone
was the Contriver, and should have been the sole Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter
of it, and that he was induced to this for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
sake, as the King (being an Heretick) was not
his lawful Sovereign, but an Usurper. Thus stout and
resolute did he continue, till he was brought to the
Tower, and shewed the Rack, upon the sight of which
he began to relent, and after some days examination dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
the whole.</p>
            <p>The News of this Discovery flew like Lightning,<note place="margin">The Flight of the Traitors.</note> it
was what rejoiced the Heart of every good Subject, and
daunted that of the Rebels, and therefore those
of them that were in Town no sooner heard of it, but
they betook themselves to Flight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catesby</hi> was gone the Night before towards the place
appointed for their Rendezvous; and <hi>Percy</hi> set forward
at 4 of the Clock in the Morning, much about the time that
the Discovery was made: But one of the <hi>Winters,</hi> and the
two <hi>Wrights</hi> that staid behind, staid to hear of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
and Disappointment, and so made all the haste they
could to overtake and meet their Confederates; that they
might consult what was to be done in so great an Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, there was nothing wanting on their
part, who were to contribute their endeavours in the
Country. Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> came to <hi>Dunchurch</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to appointment, and so confident were they of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
above, that one <hi>Grant</hi> a Gentleman in those parts,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62576:10"/>
on Monday Night, much about the time that <hi>Faux</hi> was
apprehended with other of his Associates, broke open the
Stables of one <hi>Benock,</hi> a Rider of great Horses, and took
away all that he found, for their own Service, and with
them they repaired to the rest. But all their hopes were
soon blasted, by the sad News which they quickly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from those that had made their escape. Desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
begets Resolution; and now they are lost as well as
their Cause, if they do not speedily find out a Remedy;
and therefore with all the haste they can, they dispatched
some to call in others to their Assistance, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to them the greatness of the danger that they, and
their Religion is in, unless they appear in its defence.
This <hi>Tesmond (aliàs Greenwel)</hi> the Jesuit, did particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
concern himself in, exhorting all to take up Arms,
and to unite their Forces, and for this purpose rode as
far as <hi>Lancashire.</hi> This riding to an fro made a noise in
the Countrey and awakened the People; the loss of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi>'s
Horses came quickly to the Ears of some of those
Gentlemen that had put them into his Hands to manage
and fit them for their Service. And for one reason or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
the Countrey was presently up in Arms, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pursuit of them.</p>
            <p>Some of them were taken Prisoners,<note place="margin">The Traitors pursued and taken.</note> and others of them
pursued by Sir <hi>Richard Verney,</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> to
the borders of that County. But they kept on their
course, till they came to <hi>Holbeach</hi> in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> the House
of <hi>Stephen Littleton;</hi> thither Sir <hi>Richard Walsh,</hi> Sheriff of
<hi>Worcester-shire</hi> followed them; and by his Trumpeters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them in the King's Name to surrender, assuring
them that upon their so doing he would intercede with
the King for them, and doubted not to obtain their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62576:11"/>
But they that were conscious to themselves of more
than he understood (for the News had not yet spread so
far, nor the King's Proclamations, though sent after them,
had not yet overtaken them) bid him Defiance, and sent
him Word that he must have a greater Force, than what
he had then the command of, to reduce them. But
whilst the one was preparing for the Assault, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for their Defence, God himself seemed to decide
the Quarrel: for by the same means which they contrived
to destroy others, they themselves came to suffer; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
laid some Powder to dry before the Fire, a Coal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the mending of it flew into the Pan and set Fire to the
rest, thereby not only blowing up part of the Roof,
and a Bag of Powder of 17 or 18 pound, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derset
the Pan with, which was carried unfired into the
Court, but so wounding <hi>Catesby, Percy, Rockwood,</hi> and
several of the Conspirators, that they were unable to
make any further Defence. By this time also Fire was
set to the House, and their case grew so desperate, that
they opened the Doors, and exposed themselves to the
Weapons and Fury of the People. The three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
of them, <hi>viz. Catesby, Percy,</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> joined
Back to Back, and the two former of them were mortally
wounded with one Shot, <hi>Catesby</hi> dying upon the Spot,
and <hi>Percy</hi> not out-living him above two or three Days.
The two <hi>Wrights</hi> were slain at the same time, <hi>Digby, Rock-wood,
Thomas Winter, Grant</hi> and <hi>Bates</hi> were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
and sent up to <hi>London, Robert Winter</hi> and <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton</hi>
endeavoured to conceal themselves in the Woods,
but were afterward taken and committed to the Tower;
<hi>Tresham</hi> continued in <hi>London,</hi> and seemed ready to find
out the Traitors, and by that means thought at first to
remain undiscovered, but being suspected, he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62576:11"/>
searched for, and apprehended and sent to the
same place. Thus suddenly was that Design discovered
which had been so long concealed; thus suddenly was
it broken, which they had been some years in contriving,
therein verifying that of the Psalmist, <hi>The ungodly are
sink down into the Pit that they made: in the Net which
they hid, is their own Foot taken. The Lord is known by the
Judgment which he executetb, the wicked is snared in the
work of his own Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Persons thus apprehended were carefully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
<note place="margin">The Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prisoners.</note> (in the doing of which were spent 23 days) and
from their several Confessions was drawn sufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not only for their own Condemnation, but also for
detection of others.</p>
            <p>The most considerable of which was <hi>Garnet</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
of the Jesuits,<note place="margin">The Jesuits in the Conspiracy.</note> 
               <hi>Hall, Greenwel, Gerard</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
Priest of the same Order. The respect that <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
had to the reputation of their Society, and his own
safety, had made him to act with so great caution, that
he would willingly converse with none about this matter,
but those that were of his own Order; or <hi>Catesby</hi> his
trusty Friend. And therefore much of the evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him fell with that Conspirator. But yet there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
such presumptions by the acknowledgment of the
rest that were taken, and Letters that were found, that
there was a Proclamation issued out for the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him and his Brethren, declaring it Treason for any
to harbour and conceal them. <hi>Garnet</hi> when the time drew
near, and all things were ripe for their Design, took a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Coulton</hi> in <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> not far from the place of the
general Rendezvous, where he preached a Sermon, and
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which he exhorted his Auditors to pray for the success
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62576:12"/>
of a great Action, to be undertaken in the behalf of the
Catholicks, at the beginning of the Parliament, as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by his Apologist,<note place="margin">Eudoem. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annis Apologia pro <hi>Garneto. pag. 265.</hi>
               </note> and was confessed by <hi>Hall,
aliàs Oldcorn.</hi> Whilst at that place he received a Letter
<hi>November 6,</hi> from <hi>Catesby,</hi> to let him know that their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
had miscarried, and to desire him that he would use
his interest in stirring up the Catholicks in <hi>Wales</hi> to Arm
and Defend themselves. But the wary Jesuit provided
for his own Safety, and sending <hi>Greenwel</hi> to them for their
Assistance and Direction, he himself with <hi>Hall</hi> fled to Mr.

               <hi>Catesby.</hi> By another Indictment was arraigned Sir
<hi>Everard Digby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They generally acknowledged the Fact, and spake
little in their own Vindication.</hi> Rookwood <hi>pleaded,</hi>
That it was the entire Affection he had for Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi>
which drew him in; and he hoped, as it was his first Fact,
some Mercy would be shewed him. <hi>Sir</hi> Everard <hi>said the
same with respect to</hi> Catesby, <hi>and added,</hi> That he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
it for the Zeal which he had to the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which he was ready to sacrifice all for; and to prevent
those Calamities which he understood that the Parliament was
prepared to bring upon them of his Perswasion. Keys <hi>said,</hi>
That his Fortunes were sunk, and as good now as at another
time, and for this Cause rather than another.</p>
            <p>They seem'd resolved to vindicate the Jesuits, or at least
to say nothing against them; whether it were that they
were not allowed to discourse of the Plot with any but
such and such particular Persons, or whether it were
that they thought it to be highly meritorious, and this
last seems to be not unlikely. When <hi>Tresham</hi> not above
three hours before his Death, in the Tower, did declare
upon his Salvation, that he had not seen <hi>Garnet</hi> in six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years before; whereas it appeared, both by the
Confession of <hi>Garnet,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Anne Vaux, Garnet</hi>'s
Bosom-Friend, that they had been frequently together
the two last years past.</p>
            <p>On the Thursday following,<note place="margin">Their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Sir <hi>Everard Digby, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Winter, John Grant,</hi> and <hi>Bates,</hi> were according to

West end of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church. And on the Friday,
the other four, viz. <hi>Thomas Winter, Keyes, Rockwood,</hi>
and <hi>Faux,</hi> were executed in the Palace-Yard at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62576:13"/>
Now were <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Hall</hi> had in Examination,<note place="margin">Garnet's <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
               </note> and
that several times from the <hi>first</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> to <hi>March</hi> the
<hi>26th.</hi> In all which <hi>Garnet</hi> shewed by the wiliness of his
Answers, and the Confidence he maintained them with,
that he deserved the place of Provincial of the Jesuits,
being so well versed in all the Practices of his Society,
that few could exceed him.</p>
            <p>The King from the first was resolved to forbear the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of the Rack, much practised in other Countries,
in the examination of notorious and perverse Criminals.<note place="margin">Historia missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis Anglican. pag. 315. Pag. 334.</note>
We indeed are told by a late confident Author of their
own, That <hi>Garnet</hi> was kept waking six Days and Nights
together to bring him by that new kind of Torment
(as he calls it) to a Confession of his Crime; and that
<hi>Hall</hi> was put to extreme Torture for fifteen hours space
together in the Tower,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thuanus,</hi> An. 1606.</note> for the same reason. But a
greater than he, one of their own Perswasion, doth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us, that the King to avoid Calumny, did purposely
forbear any thing of that kind of Rigour, and <hi>Garnet</hi>
himself did publickly own at his Trial, that he had been
used whilst in Prison with great lenity. We know not
what effect the Rack might have had upon him, for that
was a way of Trial he had not been exercised in; but
that Course which they took, by frequent and cross
Examinations, by Expostulations and Arguments, he
was so much a Master of, that in all the twenty three
Days spent in it, they would have gained but little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
had they not had some greater advantage.
Had he been alone, and could not have been confronted
by others, he had been much more secure, and they
more at a loss. And therefore to prevent any Mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
betwixt him and others in custody; that their
Answers might not be inconsistent or repugnant, he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62576:13"/>
writes both to <hi>Hall</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Vaux,</hi> to let them know
after what manner he thought to excuse or defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and what Replies to make to some particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries;
As if he should be charged with his Prayer for
the good Success of a great Action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he would say,
It was for the prevention of those severe Laws, which
those of their Church expected would be made against
them by that Parliament. But it happened, that these
Letters that were writ by him, came into other hands
than those he intended them for, and did him a worse
Injury than any Account that his sworn Friends could have
likely given of the same Actions, though disagreeing
with his. And indeed herein his Adversaries did outwit
him, and worsted him at his own Weapons. For
when they perceived that he obstinately persisted in the
defence of his Innocency, they took another Course to
find him out; First, a Person was employed as a Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that should profess himself to be a Roman Catholick,
and that should take a great Liberty to complain of the
Kings Severity, and of the Sufferings their Party were
made to undergo. By these and the like crafty Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
he grew to be a Familiar of <hi>Garnet</hi>'s, and at last
was entrusted by him with a Letter to one, and to another.
Which yet he did not so much venture upon, but that
he wrote sparingly to one, and to the other nothing in
appearance but what any one may see, filling up the
void places with other more secret Matters, written in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but written with the Juice of a Lemmon. By this
means they found out, that it was not so much his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
as the want of Proof, that made him so confident.
By this they came to understand, that <hi>Greenwel</hi> and he
had conferred together about the Plot.</p>
            <p>There was also another Calamity that befell him by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62576:14"/>
the same Contrivance; For now thinking himself sure of
his keeper, he let him know what a great desire he had
of conferring with <hi>Hall.</hi> The Decoy told him, that he
would endeavour to find out a way for it. This was
done, and they had that freedom; but at the same time
there were placed within hearing two Persons of such
known Credit that <hi>Garnet</hi> at his Trial had nothing to
object against them, who took notice of what was said,
and made it known to the Council. The next day
Commissioners came to examine them, and in Discourse
charged them severally with those things that passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them the day before. This <hi>Hall</hi> did acknowledg,
being convinced by the Particulars that they produced,
but <hi>Garnet</hi> did deny it upon the word of a Priest, and
with reiterated Protestations. And when they told him
that <hi>Hall</hi> had confessed, he said, <hi>Let him accuse himself
falsly if he will, I will not be guilty of that folly.</hi> But at
the last, when he perceived that the Evidence was not
to be gainsaid, begg'd their Pardon with no little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and owned the Particulars they charged him
with: and a little to save his Reputation, told
them, That as he denied all, because he knew none but
<hi>Greenwel</hi> could accuse him; so he did deny what he
knew to be true, by the help of Equivocation.</p>
            <p>Now they had gained good Evidence against him, his
Letters first, then his Discourse with <hi>Hall;</hi> and lastly,
his own Confession, were a sufficient Ground for them
to proceed and try him upon. And that they began to
do two days after, viz. <hi>March 28.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great thing charged upon him was,<note place="margin">Garnets <hi>Trial</hi>
               </note> That he
was privy to this Conspiracy, that he held a Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
with <hi>Catesby,</hi> and by him and <hi>Greenwel</hi> with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62576:14"/>
the rest. And the chief Part of his Defence was, <q>That
what he did know of it was in Confession, and what
was told him in that way he was bound to conceal,
notwithstanding any Mischief that might follow it;
he might disswade Persons from it, but whether they
would be perswaded by him or not, he was obliged
not to divulge it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After a long time spent in his Trial, there was but
little taken by the Jury to give in their Verdict, which
was, that he was guilty of the Treason; and accordingly
he received Sentence,<note place="margin">His Execution.</note> and was executed the third of
<hi>May</hi> following, at the West end of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-Yard.</p>
            <p>This is the Man whom the Jesuits extoll to the
Clouds, and that is put into the Catalogue of their
Martyrs, as it is to be found at the end of <hi>Alegambe's
Bibliotheca Scriptorum Socieatis Iesu.</hi> This Person, who
was a perfect Master of the Art of Dissimulation, that
could by Equivocation swear to what he knew to be
false, is what one of them bestows this Character upon,
That there was in him <hi>Morum Simplicitus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hist. Mission: Angl. <hi>p. 311.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>&amp; Candor
animi minimè suspicacis.</hi> This Man who had not the Heart
to die, and who at the time of his Execution was so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
betwixt the hopes of a Pardon, and the fear of
Death, that he could not attend to his own Devotions,
but one while cast his Eyes this way and another that;
now at his Prayers, and anon breaking off from them to
answer to that discourse which he overheard. This Man
I say, is said by <hi>Alegambe</hi> to go to his Death <hi>interritus &amp;
exporectâ fronte obtestans, &amp;c.</hi> without any fear, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
that he exceedingly rejoiced that he was now to
suffer that Death which would be an entrance to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:62576:15"/>
The Conclusion of all which is, that no Jesuit can be
a Traitor, and none suffer for Treason but he must be a
Martyr.</p>
            <p>The Case of <hi>Hall</hi> was much the same with that of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Trial and Execution of <hi>Hall, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> he did confess, and it was also proved that they were
both together at <hi>Caughton,</hi> and they were both found
together afterwards. It appeared that he had afterward
defended the Treason to <hi>Humphrey Littleton.</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses,
the Discourse, the Confessions, were much one
and the same, but only that <hi>Garnet</hi> was the more resolved,
and the more obstinate of the two. Now because as this
Treason was hatched, and to be executed in the main at
<hi>London,</hi> so because part of it was also to be done in the
Countrey, and the chief of the Conspirators were there
taken, therefore six of them were sent to <hi>Worcester,</hi> and
there executed, <hi>viz. Humphrey Littleton, John Winter,</hi>
and this <hi>Hall,</hi> with three others. Thither, I say, he was
carried with them for that reason, and not because his
Adversaries were ashamed to have his Cause heard at
<hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eudoemon-Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annis <hi>Apologia pro</hi> Garnetto. <hi>pag. 272.</hi>
               </note> as a bold Author of theirs would have it.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder to find these Men so concerned to
clear themselves of it, when all the World is against them;
though this is no more to be done, than to prove that
one that kills a King is a good Subject, and one that stirs
up his Subjects in rebellion against him, is a Friend to him.</p>
            <p>These were the Persons that were taken and suffered
for this bloody Treason. Others of them escaped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Sea; of which one, when <hi>Dominicus<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Vicus</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Calice, assured them of the King's Favour, and
though they lost their own Country, they might be received
there,</hi> replied, <hi>The loss of their Country was the least part of
their grief; but their sorrow was that they could not bring so
brave a Design to perfection.</hi> At which the Governour
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62576:15"/>
could hardly forbear casting him into the Sea, as <hi>Thuanus</hi>
relates from <hi>Vicus</hi> his one Mouth. Others there were
whom the Government had a great suspicion of, as <hi>Henry</hi>
Lord <hi>Mordant,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Sturton,</hi> who not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
upon the Summons to the Parliament, were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to absent themselves from some intelligence that
they received, were fined in the Star-Chamber, and to be
imprisoned during the King's Pleasure. The like Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
did <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> undergo, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
admitted <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> his Kinsman to be a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Pensioner, without administring to him the Oath of
Supremacy, when he knew him to be a Recusant.</p>
            <p>This was the end of that Plot, and of the Persons
chiefly concerned in it. And it would be happy if they
had left none of their Principles or Temper behind them,
a Generation whom no Favour will oblige, nor Kindness
retain: whom nothing but Supremacy will content, and
the most absolute Authority can gratify. Whom nothing
can secure against, but a sufficient Power, or great Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
or constant Watchfulness, and scarcely all. And
therefore its fit that not only as a branch of our Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to God, but also as a caution to our selves, that
this Deliverance should be celebrated, and the Memory
of it perpetuated.<note place="margin">Bp. <hi>Sandersons Sermons</hi> l. 1 ad. poulum. Serm. 5. pag. 242.</note> I shall end with what is said of a great
Person of our own, some years since.</p>
            <p>Two great Deliverances in the memory of many of us
hath God in his singular Mercy wrought for us of this
Nation, such as I think, take both together, no Christian
Age or Land can parallel. One formerly from a forreign
Invasion; another since that of an hellish Conspiracy at
home. Both such as we would have all thought, when
they were done, should never be forgotten. And yet,
as if this Land were term'd oblivious, the Land where all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62576:16"/>
things are forgotten, how doth the memory of them fade
away, and they by little and little grow into forgetfulness.
We have lived to see 88 almost forgotten, (God be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
who hath graciously prevented what we feared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in)
God grant that we nor ours ever live to see <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
