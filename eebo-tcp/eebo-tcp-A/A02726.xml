            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If any vtilitie or gain ſhould growe thereby, it were the leſſe maruail, but when there doth nothyng enſue, but ſuche fruite as warre bryngeth furthe, whiche is fackyng of tounes, ſubuerſion of holdes, murder of men, rauiſhine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:3994:2"/>of women, ſlaughter of olde folke and infantes, burnyng of houſes and corne, with hunger and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, twoo buddes of theſame tre: and finally, the vtter ruyne of the whole kyngdom, I wonder that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt ſo many pollitique rulers as be, and haue been in both real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, the nuſchief ſo long ſpied, the remedy hath not yet bee ſought.

            <p>
               <hi>BRVTVS</hi> the firſt Kyng of this whole Iſlande, by whom it was called Britayne, &amp; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof Britaynes, reigned the yere after the creacion of the worlde, foure thouſande, C C. and, xlii. and as writers affirme had three ſonnes, <hi>Locrinus, Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nactus,</hi> and <hi>Camber,</hi> emong who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The proſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if any bee ſo curious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, I aunſwere, that the ſame hiſtories, whiche ſpeake of this particion, declare in likewiſe of the ſubieccion: So that admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng them in the one, thei muſte likewiſe bee admitted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more corroboracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the hiſtories, bothe of Brito<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and Romaines agre, that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlande was vnder kynges at the beginnyng: whiche as thei were called Kynges of Britayne, ſo was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> general name of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Brytons, neither was there
<pb facs="tcp:3994:17"/>any other ſtate or Kyngdome in the Iſlande at thoſe daies, but onely of Britons. In ſo muche, that the Romaines, beyng moſt diligent reporters of the names of Princes by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſubdued, and countreys conquered, whereas thei make particular mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diuerſe kynges of the Britaines and of ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dery cities in Britain, yet do thei neuer name any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called Scottes, ne make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>Iulius Agricola,</hi> whiche, after the Southe partes of Britain was made a prouince to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romayns inuaded vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Orcades, which is the fartheſt part of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: &amp; after .viii. yeres warres there at the foote of the mounte <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> now called <hi>Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>zebe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> fought againſt <hi>Galgacus</hi> with ten. M. Britaines, whom he there ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threwe: how (I ſaie) could he bee ignoraunt of the Scottes or of their warres: So that it muſte be graunted, that at thoſe daies, either thei wer not in Britayne, or if thei wer in Britayne, their
<pb facs="tcp:3994:18"/>name and power was nothyng ſuche, as we pretend. For who ſo diligently conſidereth the courſe of the ſaid ſtories, ſhall well ſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neither Pictes ne Scottes had any dominion in Britayn, vntil about the declinacion of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Empire: and that the Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes entered into Britayn before the Scottes, in the tune of kyng <hi>Marius,</hi> whiche was aboute the yere of Chriſte .lxxij. After whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che tyme, with the helpe of the Iriſhe Scottes, thei vexed the Britaines with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Theſe Pictes wer a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Scithia, now called Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, &amp; driuen out of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, ſought herberough emon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Iriſh Scottes, who beyng nothing glad of ſuch geſtes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb facs="tcp:3994:19"/>theim to ſet foote in Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne as thei did in deede, and ther continued many yers after. This people wer called Pictes, becauſe in ſtede of garmentes, thei vſed to paint their ſkynnes with ſundery figures of beaſtes and birdes, hauing collers of y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron about their neckes, and gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles of the ſame, aboute their waſtes, and ſpecially the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of theim, whiche eſtemed the ſame for a greate poynt of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie. This doth Herodia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> write in the life of Seuerus thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor, whiche came into Britayne, and repaired the walle, begonne afore by Adrian his predeceſſor, by whiche walle, the Prouince of the Romaynes was diuided, from the reſidue of Britain, and
<pb facs="tcp:3994:19"/>was made firſte to reſiſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of ſuche Britaynes as thei accompted, ſauage and bar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>barous. The ruynes of this wal, are to be ſeen at this preſet: wherefore it ſemeth to me, that afore the time of theſaied Adria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the name, neither of Pictes ne Scottes, was neuer knowen in Britayne, ſo that if thei had any poſſeſſion there afore, thei came to it, rather by ſtelth then by any open force, or conqueſt. I ſpeake not this to miniſhe the honoure and glory of my countrey, nor to deface y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nobilitie, or the valeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t actes of the Scottiſhe kynges, but to ſhewe that the firſt inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitors of this iſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, wer al Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, more then .vi. C. yeres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Scottes had any Kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:3994:20"/>there, and that thei had no ſuche originall, as ſome haue phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei are a people mixt with Britaynes &amp; come of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes. In proſe whereof, it is ſaied, that the Armes of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, borne at this date (the trace of the floure deluce except, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was late put in) is the ſelf ſame armes, that Brute bare: yet wil I not affirme that Scottes be mere Britaynes, or Engliſhe men mere Britaynes, but that the more parte of bothe people bee diſcended of Britaynes. For though the Iſlande hath been often inuaded by ſundry nacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as Romaynes, Pictes, Scottes Saxons, Danes, and laſtely by Normaynes: yet doth it not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the whole bloud of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes
<pb facs="tcp:3994:20"/>was ſo extincte thereby, but that there muſt great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre remain in euery parte of the iſland, wherby it maie be ſated y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the race of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is mixte, but not merely fordoen and extirped: for no countrey can bee ſo inuaded by ſtraungers, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the whole race of the olde inhabiters, can bee worne all out, but that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce or more parte, ſhall ſtill remain. As for example, Italie hath been inuaded by Gothes, Vandales, Honnes, and other barbarous nacions, can it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſaied that the whole Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main blod is vtterly extinct? no verely: for of neceſſitie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtocke dooth ſtill abide, thoughe not wholy, yet in the more part. And likewiſe of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
<pb facs="tcp:3994:21"/>I doubte not to ſaie, and am able to proue, that the great parte of bothe realmes, is come of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old Britayns. And thoughe me haue been mixed with foreyn nacions, whereby the Britayne to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue is chaunged &amp; out of vſe, pet doth the bloud and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o remain: and as for the Iriſh toungue, whiche thei ſpeake in the North partes of Scotland, dooth no more proue them to be mere Iriſhe, then the Engliſhe toungue vſed in all the South partes of Scotlande, proueth the people there to be Engliſhe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BVT</hi> to reſorte to our purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, how can it ſtand with reaſon, that the Pictes and Scottes, two ſtrong nacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhould make great warres, ſhould ſo often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb facs="tcp:3994:21"/>and vexe bothe Brytains &amp; Romaines, ye and ouercome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and at length ſtabliſh two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in the Iſland, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce thereof founde in any ſtory, either of the Britains or Romaines, nor in any other autentique or approued Croni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. For <hi>Caeſar Tacitus, Ptholomeus</hi> and <hi>Plinius,</hi> Romayne aucthors (thoughe we ſpeake of no mo) &amp; on the other ſyde, <hi>Gildas,</hi> mooſte auncient writer of the Brytai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, though euery wher in their hiſtories, they make ſpecial me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of all the people, then dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Britayne, yet ſpeake thei nothing of thoſe twoo nacions, whiche if thei were chefe &amp; ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt (as oure writers pretende) how coulde their names be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted
<pb facs="tcp:3994:22"/>of ſo many aucthors, wherby one of theſe two thinges muſte be graunted, that either they were not then come into Britayne, or els (if thei were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me) they remayned ſubiectes to the Britaynes, according to the Engliſh hiſtory. Agaynſt which though it may be obiected, that Britayne was not alwayes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, vnder one Kyng or one Ruler, but was gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſomwhiles by one, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles by mo, (as the Romayne ſtories declare) whereby there ſhould be no ſuche Monarchie and kyngdome, nor any ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der preſcribed by Brute, as the Engliſh ſtories ſpecifie: yet doth that make nothing to proue, the Scottes not to be come of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes,
<pb facs="tcp:3994:22"/>ne enforceth any title for them, to be no ſubiectes to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: for it may ſtand together, that the eſtate of Britayne was ſuche at the beginninge, as the Engliſhe cronicles mencion: &amp; as in time all thinges chaunge, ſo by occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s enſuyng, the firſt ordre might be broken, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one intier Kyngdome, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into partes, as it ſhould ſeme, that it was about the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who writeth, that at his arryuall in Britayne, the cities by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon aſſente, elected <hi>Caſſibilanus,</hi> to their King, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it maye be gathered, that the Monarchie therof, was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by ſome faccion within the Iſlande, which cauſed it to be a more eaſy prey to enemies. And
<pb facs="tcp:3994:23"/>this verefieth my woordes ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken afore: that diuiſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde of the people brought this Iſlande firſt, into ſubiection of other nacions. This is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Romayn ſtories, but namely by <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge that Britaynes at the firſt were vnder Kynges, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes by faccions and ſedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Prynces and great men, were ſo diuided in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfs, that to reſiſt an vniuerſal peril, ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely twoo or three countreys at the moſt, would agre together: ſo fighting in partes, at laſt the whole was ouercome. And by this meane was Britayne fyrſte ſubdued, &amp; made tributarie to the Romayns, vnder whome it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in fourme of a proui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
<pb facs="tcp:3994:23"/>vntill the tyme of great <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Emperour, by whome it was reſtored to libertie: yet was it not ſo broughte in ſubieccion al this tyme, but that there were for the moſt part, kinges in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, as our ſtories teſtifie, and likewiſe the Romayne: wherein we reade of <hi>Aruiragus,</hi> whome <hi>Iu uenal</hi> writing to <hi>Nero,</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be a Kyng by theſe woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: <hi>Detaemone Brita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>no, excidet Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiragus,</hi> that is to ſaye: Aruira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus ſhall fall frome the ſtem of Britayne. And after hym, of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> King, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:3994:24"/>been ſuche at the beginning, as the Engliſh ſtory affirmeth, (which we muſt admitt, becauſe the contrarye appeareth not) though there happened ſom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Monarchie by the Romayns, or otherwyſe: yet when the people atteyned their libertie, and were gouerned by Kynges of their awne: we muſte preſume, that thei obeied them &amp; their lawes, &amp; the people to hold their landes in like courſe, as was ordeyned at the firſt: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it muſte folowe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if Scottes were in Britayn at thoſe daies, they knowledged y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynges of Britayn for their ſuperiors, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtories. In which point I will not muche ſtycke, conſideringe the name of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
<pb facs="tcp:3994:24"/>was not then knowen, as I ſaid afore. And though our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters dreame diuerſe thynges to the contrary, we cannot admitte their bare allegacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in diſprofe of ſo many ſtories, of ſo graue writers, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as there is leſſe ſuſpicion of parcialitie, ſo was there more certaintie of knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then in the other, whiche were vnborne after theim, by a great numbre of yeres. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no ſuche ordre to haue been preſcribed in gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the kyngdome, as the Engliſhe ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie alledgeth: and though there had been, yet the interrupcion to be ſufficient cauſe, to breake the ſame: and admit the Scottes to haue been then in Britayne as thei were not: Let vs ſe whether
<pb facs="tcp:3994:25"/>we cannot vnite theſe people by another waie. It is certain that after the Romayns had reduced the South and Weſt partes of Britayn into a prouince, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſirous to enlarge their empire neuer content with part, till thei had the whole, thei inuaded the Northe partes of Britayne, and ceaſed not, till thei came to the Orcades, and ſo in fine, brought the whole iſlande in ſubieccion: their ſtories herein bee playne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND</hi> no leſſe plain is it, that Conſtancius the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peror, who died at Yorke, maried Helene, called ſaincte Helene, doughter &amp; heire to Coyll kyng of the Britayns, of whom he begatte the greate Conſtantyne, afterwardes Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, not onely of Britayn, but

Now if Scottes wer then in Britayn (as our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alledge) then wer thei ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes to Conſtantine, becauſe the ſtories be euident, that he had al

In contirmacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof, beſides the teſtimony of old hiſtories, there be two notable thynges yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in Englande, by all the kynges ſucceſſiuely, euen ſithe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaied Conſtantine.

            <p>
               <hi>EVTROPIVS</hi> witneſſeth, that Britayne reſted in libertie, duryng the life of Conſtantyne, who left behind hym .iii. ſonnes ſucceſſors of his Empire, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancius, Conſtans, and Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And being deſirous of more empire, with a greate numbre of Britaines, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into Fraunce, &amp; ſtewe <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> the Emperor at Lions, and
<pb facs="tcp:3994:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>forced <hi>Valentinian</hi> the other brother to flee to Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for ayde of the Emperoure ther. Neuertheles (as al world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thynges be mutable) hys for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was to be ſlayne in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leuynge behynd hym a ſonne named <hi>Victor,</hi> who was ſlayne in Fraunce: whereby the ſtate of Britayne, drew euery daye into worſe.

            <p>
               <hi>AND</hi> for the further profe of this Monarchie, it is reade in the tyme of <hi>Lucius,</hi> whiche was the firſte chriſten Kynge of the Britaynes, as is ſaid afore: ther were in Britayne .iii. high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,

To the prouince of Yourke, there belonged all the Northe parte of Britayne, now called Scotlande with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades. And notwitſtanding all the mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, happening in pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſe of yeres, yet al the Biſhops of thoſe countreys, came vnto Yorke to beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Arch

In his daies, the Moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes entered into Egipt, and had broughte the lande vnto vtter ruine, had not the kyng by gods commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, committed his armie vnto Moſes: But after that Gathelus was come, and had wonne a battail againſt the
<pb facs="tcp:3994:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>Moores, Moſes and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grewe out of fauor, and were fain to flee out of Egipt into In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de. Then was Gathelus made lieuetenaunt of Pharaos army, and for his valeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeruice, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined Scota the Kynges ſiſter in mariage, with all the landes lately taken from the people of Iſraell. After the deathe of this Pharao, reigned his ſonne <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choris,</hi> whiche oppreſſed Gods people with more tyranny, then his father did. But after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God had ſent greate plagues emong the Egipcians, Gathelus vnder ſtandyng by the prophetes, that greater were like to folowe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke Egipte, &amp; in the yere of the creacion of the world .iii.M.vj. C.xliij: He with Scota his wife
<pb facs="tcp:3994:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>their children &amp; ſeruauntes, Gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes and Egipcians, came out of the mouthe of Nilus, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng by the ſea, called Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneum, toke land in Numidie, and after, he arriued into a part of Spayne, then called, Luſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, whiche becauſe of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual there, had the name of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyngale, as one would ſaie, the porte of Gathele.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIS</hi> is a greate ſtomble at the threſſholde of the dore: for it is plain by hiſtories, that Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania, was not called Portyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale, almoſt by a M. yeres, after this ſuppoſed tyme. But for the better triall, let vs examine the circumſtaunces of the perſone, time and place. And for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone, we will admit Gathelus to
<pb facs="tcp:3994:35"/>be the kyng of Athens ſonne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no ſuche name is found in the Greke hiſtories, and wee will admitte Pharao to haue a doughter, thoughe no hiſtorie, Greke or Egipt, mencion of any ſuche. But when wee haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the perſons, al the doubt is, how we ſhall couple theim in mariage. For accomptyng the tyme of Pharaos reigne, father of Scota, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrues, then was ſhe in the yere of the creaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worlde, twoo thouſand foure hundred yeres: and by our hiſtories, Gathelus was in the yere of the creacion of the world three thouſand ſixe hundred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and three: whiche is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente, twelfe hundred yeres and more.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3994:35"/>
            <p>
               <hi>THIS</hi> beinge true, here were a very vnfitte mariage betwene theſe twoo perſones, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome beinge elder then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bride, by .xii.C. and .xl. yeres. But ſome wiſeman will ſaye, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> folke liued lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in thoſe daies, yet can thei not denye, but ſhe was to olde a mayde for ſo yonge a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelar, whereby I can worſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, that they had any childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe beinge of ſuche yeares. So that to make this mariage fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, either Gathelus was elder then his father, or ſhe was yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then her brother by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande yeares at the leaſte. And ſyns the tyme of Abraham, men by courſe of nature, haue not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> monlie lyued much aboue a .C. yeares. And this is ouer plaine
<pb facs="tcp:3994:36"/>to be excuſed, as a faulte of the writer, ſeing the whole courſe of our hiſtorie, dependeth vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme. If ſhe then coulde be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter to none of the Pharaoes, no more coulde he be ſonne to any of the kynges of Athens. And in the tyme that Gathelus liued, which is alledged to be in the yeare of the worlde .iii.M.vi.C.xliii. there were no kinges in Athens, but it was gouerned by certayne Rulers, as a free eſtate. If this then be falſe in the originall, we muſte iudge in the ſequele, which is of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into Spaine, and of their ſonne <hi>Hyber</hi> afterwardes into Irelande, of whome it is called Hybernia, with all the proceſſe of the hiſtorie, no leſſe vnlikelie.

The woordes and fourme of whoſe homage, who ſo liſte to peruſe, ſhall well perceiue the ſame to haue been made, neither for any of thoſe Erledomes, neither yet for any other holde, but merely, for the crowne of Scotlande, whiche aſwel he as other, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to hold of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lande, as ſuperior lorde.

But ſome peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture will ſay, that many of thoſe homages were done by force and compulſion: I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, thoughe it might be, that ſome of theim were ſoo done, yet all could not be. For our Croni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſpecifie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe .xviii. ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, were in Englande, which no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can iudge to haue come all thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by force, and all thoſe dyd homage there, and thoſe homa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, well nere all, appere to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue been made for the croune of Scotlande, if we beleue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes of Englande. And if any ſaye, that they be counterfeited, I thinke it ſoner ſaid, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And touching the compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb facs="tcp:3994:43"/>and force, I ſaye, thoughe ſome of our kynges might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pelled by feare, yet howe coulde all be: or coulde an whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament be compelled? Is it not manifeſt, that when queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, vpon the title of the croune of Scotlande, betwene <hi>Balliol.

But here it is ſayde agayn, that he was iudge in that caſe, not of righte, but by conſente of the parties. Then loke well to the woordes of the compromiſſe, which nameth him ſuperior lord of Scotland. And this was done in Parliamente, by conſente of the thre eſtates, which of likelyhoode could not
<pb facs="tcp:3994:43"/>be all compelled. In which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, I am partely aſhamed, of the impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vanitie of our writers, whiche raile without reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Edward in that plea, as corrupte. &amp; falſe. This I ſaie, that if the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were to be geuen agayne, neither <hi>Mynos, Lycurgus, nor Salo mon,</hi> (whoſe iudgementes in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories be ſo celebrate) dyd euer geue a more true, a more perfect or a more rightfull ſentence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ciuile lawes, or by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> practiſe and cuſtome of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, or any other reaſonable lawe, and take the caſe, euen as they propone it. But then we haue an other euaſion, which is to alledge preſcripcion, becauſe thoſe homages haue not been

To that I aunſwere, that thoughe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripcion ſerued in that caſe, (as it doth not) yet the warres made from tyme to tyme, counteruaile a poſſeſſion thereof: In whiche pointe lette vs be well aduiſed, what we ſaye, leaſte by fleynge the ſmoke, we fall into the fyre.

            <p>
               <hi>MOREOVER,</hi> I note this, that the Kynges of Englande would neuer make peace with vs perpetually, neither as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemies, but admitted a

And ſo muche the rather, when thoſe hatefull termes of Scottes &amp; Engliſhemen, ſhalbe aboliſſhed and blotted oute for euer, and that we ſhal al agre in the onely title and name of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons (as verely we ought to do) and the ſelfe realme, beeyng eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones reduced into the fourme of one ſole Monarchie, ſhal bee called Britayn: Then the which forme, there is none other better nor no commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale ſo well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame is, that is ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by one kyng. The experience wherof we haue ſeen, euen from the beginning of the worlde, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to our time. For who ſo ſhall well conſider the ſtates of

For gouernaunce maye in no wyſe ſuffer an equal companyon, ne any more be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into the rule of twoo ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie adminiſters, then one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye maye beare two heades, or the worlde endure to haue twoo ſunnes to geue lighte at once. And that ſame appereth in all other creatures, emonge whom, there is any ſocietie, or body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique, wherby it may eaſily be gathered, to be the primatiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, and the due ordre of nature. Whiche, like as in many other thynges, ſo doth it ſpecially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere in the ſwarme of Bees: for thei beyng ledde with the onely
<pb facs="tcp:3994:54"/>and mere inſtinct of nature, will neither bee without one Kyng and gouernor, ne yet admit any mo Kynges, then one at once. And by the ſame nature, bee wee taught, to repute and recke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that body to be mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtreous, that hath twoo heddes, and no leſſe is the realme, that hath twoo kynges. Then if in all thinges we ſhuld (as nigh as might be) approche to the likeneſſe of heauen, aſwell in our lifes and actes, as in all our faſhions, wee ſhould not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the regiment of many, for that the heauenly thynges, haue but one gouernor, whiche thyng Homere (though he were but an Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poete) ſemeth to expreſſe in theſe verſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To haue mani gouernors is not good But let there bee one ruler of Kynges

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, was of no ſmall grauitie &amp; importaunce. For when <hi>Craeſus</hi> would haue ioyned his brother with hym in the kyngdome: the ſonne (ſaied he) is aucthor of all good thynges in the yearth, but if there ſhould bee twoo ſonnes, it wer perill leaſt their two hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ſhould burne vp al the arth: Euen ſo, as one kyng is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſo mo then one, is hurtfull. The experience wherof, (to ſette examples no farther of) was wel felt in Englande, ſo long as the ſeuen Kynges reigned, as maie well appere to theim that reade the ſtory. Herefore dare I bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaie, if theſe twoo realmes wer
<pb facs="tcp:3994:55"/>brought vnder one Empire and gouernaunce, wee ſhould ſee an ende of al ſtrief and warre, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che will neuer come otherwiſe to paſſe: And then ſhould wee haue this common weale of ours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng now out of all ordre, and in moſte miſerable ſtate &amp; condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee moſte happie and mooſte floriſhing. The whiche thyng to attein, it lieth onely in you (O moſte dere countreymen): yours is the faulte, you muſt make the amendes. And other condicions of recompenſe, then your ſelfes haue agreed vnto, wil vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, none bee allowed. For what other condicions ſhould Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de receiue of vs, (hauing had ſo often experience of oure breaches of peace, of truce, and of our promiſes, which yet vnto
<pb facs="tcp:3994:55"/>this daie, we haue neuer truely kept towardes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as thei maye in no reaſon truſte vs,) but in ſuche ſorte, as they maie be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to fynde vs conſtaunt, firme and ſtedfaſte in oure promiſſe. Wherfore, if there remayn with you (O dere countreymen) any remorce or pitie of our torne and woful cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, or of your ſelfes, ſtaye betymes, while you haue tyme to do well.

And ſurely in this part, I would wyſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as I haue good will to ſet out this woofull tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy in her perfect colours: but ſeynge the ſame doeth not ſerue to my wyſhe, I muſte vtter ſuch matter, as the dolor of my hart, and natural pitte, may miniſter vnto my penne, which if it could as liuely depaynt the greatnes of this euill, as myne harte doth Imagine and conceiue the ſame the multitude of teares, ſhoulde ſet mens iyes from readyng and
