            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>French-Fleet,</hi> according to the Computation of our mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring <hi>Jacobites,</hi> (notwithſtanding their loſs of nigh twenty Capital Ships, beſides Frigats of Forty, and Fifty, and more Guns, laſt Year,) is, by a <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſort of <hi>Miracle,</hi> grown this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer more Potent and Numerous than laſt, and it is confidently given out, by an odd ſort of People among us, That they are both more able, and more reſolv'd to Fight us this Year, than they were before: 'Tis true, (it is agreed on all hands,) that the <hi>French</hi> King, ſince his fatal Defeat at Sea, has been very Induſtrious; and, as his Majeſty was pleas'd to tell his Parliament, very diligent in his applications to repair the remainder of his ſhatter'd Fleet; but at the ſame time we never could have any Account of any new Ships of War he hath added this Year, and the <hi>Thoulon Squadron</hi> was never computed above Fifteen Sail, which, as they were abſent laſt Year, by all Accounts, is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be on the Coaſts of <hi>Spain</hi> now; ſo that we may believe them now to be near Fifty Sail, whereas our <hi>Grand Fleet</hi> now conſiſts of near Eighty Sail of Capital Men of War in the Line of Battle, and, praiſed be God, with a Fair Wind, are Sailed to the Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> reſolving to Face this ſo much boaſted, formidable Fleet of the <hi>French;</hi> for, by the Accounts from <hi>Paris,</hi> we are inform'd they are to rendezvouz at <hi>Bell-Iſle,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King has ſent his Orders to Monſieur <hi>Tourville,</hi> his Admiral, to continue upon their own Coaſts, and that if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeem'd to be forward to preſs a Battle there, not to decline it.</p>
            <p>Our Fleet above Three Days ago were ſeen paſt <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and we are in daily Expectation of hearing of ſome Gallant Action from them, though it is generally believ'd, that this pretended <hi>Bravery</hi> of the <hi>French,</hi> is but a meer <hi>Bravado,</hi> a ſweetning Sugar-Plumb to encourage and keep up the ſinking Spirits of his fainting <hi>Janaſaries</hi> here; for is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe that he will willingly expoſe the Remainder of his Naval Strength to ſuch Diſadvantage now, when leſs than an equal Number laſt Year Scour'd, Drove, and Burn'd them from Port to Port<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, no, without all doubt he would think himſelf happy, could he but ſecure himſelf in his Harbours from our Inſults; and therefore 'tis not improbably believed that he has order'd his grand Fleet to keep cloſe in their Fortified Ports, while the <hi>Thoulon Squadron</hi> attacks ſome place in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Territories, thereby to amuſe or divert us from our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Deſcent; but a very little time will clear our Doubts in this Matter, and our Admirals are Perſons of that known Conduct and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that we have all the reaſon in the World to expect, (by God's Bleſſing) in a ſhort time, to have a very fair Account of them.</p>
