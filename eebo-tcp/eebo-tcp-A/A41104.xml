         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet upon the earneſt deſire of ſeveral perſons, the Cures

it, and its particular virtues, according to late experience, ſince
that general account given of it about 2. years paſt. By the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God it is an univerſal preſerver of mens bodies &amp; every

corruption and infection; more particularly, the <hi>Ens primum</hi>

Scurvy, Feavers, Worms, Cough, Spleen, Flux of blood,
ſhortneſs of breath and ſtitches, great colds, Colick, fits of the

               <p>THat this Oyle is an Univerſal Medicine as well as the Stone it
ſelf, is publikely known by the Writings of <hi>Van Helmont:</hi>
And therefore having for many years tried divers things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it, I have of late found ſomething near it, whereof the Oyle
into which this ſtone is dipped, hath given theſe proofs, <hi>viz.</hi> By
annointing the limbs it has cured the running Gout: And by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
the feet it gave preſent eaſe to a painful Gout: It hath
cured the Kings-Evil, Lameneſs of long continuance, Apoplexie,
Spleen, Melancholly, ſtrange pains in the body: Alſo a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume,
that after many applications in five years was not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
was rendered curable. Another in a Conſumption, having
a hard lump on the ſide of her belly, and all over her body, as it
were an entire ſcab, was perfectly cured in a ſhort time with the
ſaid Oyle. A hand as it were venomed, and ſwelling up to the
ſhoulder with blew ſpots, being annointed, the pain immediately
ceaſed, and the ſwelling aſſwaged. A great ſwelling on the head
and face, neck and ſhoulders with much pain, and the Kings evil,
was eaſed and advanced to a cure by this Oyle. Feet ſwelled and
very ſore, and lameneſs on the huckle-bone, have been cured. A
man overtaken with a painful diſtemper over all his body, for the
ſpace of five days, not knowing what it was, was cured immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.
Another being brought very low, firſt he was afflicted with
knobs in a ſtrange manner, and his fleſh was much conſumed of a
ſudden, and his appetite quite loſt, preſently after he had touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this ſtone twice on the tip of his tongue, the knobs fell in a
wonderful manner; and uſing it in the ſame manner 20 days, his
fleſh came again, and he grew pretty ſtrong. Likewiſe many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
troubled in mind, and many troubled with head-ach have
been ſoon refreſhed with ſome few drops upon the tongue. A very
dangerous and deſperate <hi>Fiſtula</hi> entring into the body, was

                  <hi>PAracelſus (in ſine Libri II. de Praeparationibus</hi>) is declaring
ſomething concerning the Cure of the Falling-ſickneſs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105776:2"/>
Dropſie, Morbus Gallicus (<hi>vide Paracelſum in Chirurgicis, Libr.</hi> 2.
<hi>De Puſtulis ibi: De Puſtulis ſeu Morbo Gallico</hi>) and the Gout, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting
the excellency of the true Spirit of Vitriol in the diſeaſes
made mention of; but he there ſpeaks of the making of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
according to the Philoſophical manner. However <hi>I</hi> may ſay in
truth, that a woman aged 45. years, having had the Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſixteen years in a moſt cruel raging manner, had been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cured by this Medicine within ſix Weeks. Another woman 36.
years of age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being afflicted with the Falling-ſickneſs for 30 years,
hath been cured by the ſame within eight weeks. A Boy of twelve
years being taken with this diſeaſe half a year after he was born,
inſomuch, that when the fit was upon him, he muſt be holden by
two or three men; &amp; when he felt the fit was coming, in a ſtrange
manner he would ſeek to avoid it, ſometimes by offering to run
into the water, ſometimes into the fire, ſometimes againſt the
wall, ſo that it was an exceeding great miſery to behold ſuch a poor
creature; he was at laſt cured within 6. weeks by this Medicine,
and is ſtill in good health. Another Maid of 22. years of age, had
often ſuch fits three hours long, was reſtored within four weeks.
Alſo a woman being conſtantly afflicted with the Falling ſickneſs
whenſoever ſhe was with child, was perfectly cured by the uſe of
this Medicine, and not troubled any more therewith.</p>
               <p>Thus it is manifeſt by ſuch proofs, that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> is true in his
promiſe or aſſertion concerning the excellency of that wonderful
Spirit of Vitriol: And therefore we may ſafely conclude, that the
ſaid <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſpeaks truth alſo, concerning the cure of the Gout,
Dropſie and French-Pox, with the ſelf ſame Spirit of Vitriol;
which whether it be ſo or not, might be experienced without any
harm, becauſe this Spirit of Vitriol is not hurtful at all to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man, as being freed from all corroſiveneſs, that is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
to ſuch like Mineral Spirits, its virtue and nobility being as it
were derived from an Aſtral influence, by its artificial and ſecret
preparation, which <hi>Paracelſus loco citato,</hi> deſcribes under the figure
of the ninth Alembique.</p>
               <p>As concerning Puſtulas, or the French-Pox, which <hi>Paracelſus</hi>
makes mention of, my Book in print, entitled, <hi>A Paradox of the
Shameful Diſeaſe,</hi> may give larger ſatisfaction to him that deſireth
more information of it, together with its cure, under a parable
in the ſecond part of the ſame, wherein I have more particularly
diſcloſed <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ground, whereof the ſaid Medicine of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
doth ariſe according to his intention.</p>

               <p>HAth been from age to age a very hard trial to Phyſicians, of
which the cure by inward means, finally grown deſparate,
hath cauſed the cutting of the bladder-ſtone. <hi>Mercatus</hi> and <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaccius</hi>
do confeſs they were ignorant of any remedy for it. <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>
is perſwaded, that by no means the bladder-ſtone is curable
inwardly. Nevertheleſs the moſt authorized Philoſophers do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
its cure by their experience. <hi>Baſile Valentine</hi> hath performed
the ſaid cure with his <hi>Lapis Ignis,</hi> ſo called; <hi>Paracelſe</hi> with his <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
of which <hi>Van Helmont</hi> declareth ſomething more plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
its preparation, <hi>viz</hi> by the <hi>Alcaheſt.</hi> And ſo always ſuch
as being fitly qualified, have ſought in a right manner, have found
ſomewhat. <hi>A</hi> boy of ſix years pitifully tormented with the ſtone

to expreſs more particularly, Curioſity being not ſatisfactory in
this reſpect. Another boy of a bigger age was cured of the ſame,
<hi>viz.</hi> Stone of the Bladder, after ſome years affliction therewith
by this Medicine alone. So that <hi>I</hi> am convinced, Philoſophers are
true in their writings concerning this cure.</p>
