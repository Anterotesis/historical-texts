            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

then full worthy art thou to be called cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or a charytable man. This that I wryte good reader is true, wherfore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte the to followe it, yf thou denye the folowyng therof, thou art no Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man thou art neyther good nor vertuous. For that I hearein teache is charitie, and if thou haue no charitie, thy fayth is nought and of no value. There be now a dayes as me ſemeth. iii. kyndes of fayth vſed. The fyrſt is fayth faynte, and that is he which I talke of euen nowe, for he hath fayth but it is not a ryght fayth, and ſo it ſemeth by his behauour, for he takethe ſo feruente paynes in perſecutyng his brother, that he waxeth ſo faynt he may no lenger bere any goodnes or charite, but like a faint ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fayntly letteth all fall from him. Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue a fayned fayth, that is to preach one thyng and beleue an other, I pray god we haue none of theſe Anabaptyſtes, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertynes, Arryans, and Maris aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, of which ſorte laſt reſyted we had one not longe ſynce. A great aduerſary to that moſte bleſſed and pure vyrgyn, and not onely to her, but alſo to her ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and to vs his members. I praye God I ſay that we haue no more of theſe hereſyes raynyng, I feare leſt many may be lykened to an aple which is fayre with

out and rotten within: Yf there be any ſuche faynyng people: I pray god ſone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen theyr hartes, leaſt they ſhulde infecte ſimple ſoules: and make them lyke to their ſelues, paſt al remedy, then there is fayth faythfull, and thoſe be they. Math. v.</p>
            <q>Qui perſecutionem patiuntur propter iuſticiam.</q>
            <p>Whiche ſuffer perſecution for a iuſte and ryght cauſe, of them I wyll not muche ſpeke, for although ſome haue ſo done, yet not ſo many as ought, the more pytie, and all for lacke of charitie. For yf they hadde loued Chriſte, ſo wel as Chriſt loued them they wolde not haue ſtopped: but wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly with all theyr harte, haue ſuffred ſome payne for his ſake, that payed ſo greate a pryce for theyr redempcion, this charite is good loue, and good loue is none other thing but charitie, for whether it be loue to god or to thi neighbour, ſo thy loue be good it is charitie it ſelfe. But yf it be a fayned loue, or a noughty loue, then may it in no wyſe bare the name of charitie, for this worde loue, without any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence or matter folowyng, is a worde indyfferente bothe to good and bad as in example. I haue harde a man ſaye to his wyfe, wyfe I loue the, to whome ſhe aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered agayne and ſayd, ye mary huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb facs="tcp:13747:6"/>
but your loue is ſo lytell, that I can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fele it nor ſe it. Nowe (quod he) thou haſt iudged as iuſtly as though thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt knowen my meanyng, for in deede I ſayde that I loued the, but I tolde the not howe, nor after what faſhyon, ſo that I ſay, yf loue be lefte alone, ſhe may chooſe whether ſhe wyll loue well, or loue yl, but yf charitie be once named it can none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe be vnderſtanded, but of good loue, without which a mans fayth is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng worth, as wytneſſeth with me the bleſſed apoſtle ſaynte Paule wrytyng vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Corinthyans. Epiſt. i. Chapi. xiii. On this wyſe. Yf I haue all fayth ſo that I may remoue mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines, and haue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with no charitie. I am nothyng, that is to ſay, my fayth is nothynge, ye heere nowe this lyttell peece of ſaynte paules Epiſtle telleth you what your fayth is without charitie, wherefore ſtyll I deſyre you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynually to call for charitie, and to vſe charitie, as nedefull it is nowe to preache charite, as it was in the premityue church to preache fayth, ſyth faythe is no faythe without charitie. But a lacke who ſhall preache charitie, oure preeſtes? Nowe in good fayth it greueth me ſomtyme to here charitie ſo ſcante amonge them, ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not ſo charitable as I wold wyſhe
<pb facs="tcp:13747:7"/>
them, for one preacheth agaynſt an other, one deſpyſeth an others promocyon, one an others learning, &amp; one an others belefe: ſo that a man can not well tell howe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the venemus enuye of this worlde, but yet I wolde aduyſe eche preſte to loue other, conſyderynge that all the Epy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſaynte Paule wrote almoſte, he hath in them a treatynge for vnitie. Saynte Iames in his Epiſtle wylleth that yf we fall at varyaunce we ſhulde reconcyle our ſelues one vnto an other, and open our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes before god, he wylleth vs alwaye to loue one an other, he ſpecyally there put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ryche men in remembraunce of theyr dutye towarde theyr poore neyghboures. Saynte Peter alſo gyueth greate comfort for one to loue an other, declaryng to eche man his dutye towarde maieſtrates, for where diſobedience is, there is no charitie. Saynt Iohn in his epiſtles feruently doth declare what charitie is, fyrſte exortynge all men to kepe gods commaundementes, declaryng that yf they do otherwyſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and feruent loue to god is excluded, he ſheweth the loue that god bare towarde vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſent downe his onely begotten ſonne to ſuffre death for our ſynnes: and he concludeth of charitie, ſayenge, that who ſo hath charitie hath god: and who
<pb facs="tcp:13747:7"/>
ſo loueth not his brother, hath no charitie in hym. Our ſauyour Chriſt ſayth alſo to his Apoſtles Iohn. Chap. xiii.</p>

Nowe howe Chriſt loued vs to eche man it is knowen, parte therof might herein be expreſſed but for tediouſnes, it is omytted, wherefore let vs all vſe charitie and eſpecially I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to you that be preſtes ſhewe charitie one vnto an other, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryng that Chriſt our mayſter ſayth vnto you. Math. v. Let your lyght ſhyne ſo before men that they maye ſe your good workes and gloryfye your father whiche is in heauen. Nowe ſyth you ſhulde be a lyght to the worlde, for gods ſake let cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie be vſed amonge you, that other men may the rather through your good enſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples learne to lyue charytably: then ſhall eche man louyngely lyue in this worlde, then ſhall ſedcyyon ceaſſe and charitie flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhe: then brotherly loue ſhalbe amonge vs. And without this as I haue alredye tolde you, your fayth is nothyng worthe, yf you lyſte not to beleue me, looke what ſaynt Paule ſayth in his fyrſt epyſtle, and xiii. Chapiter to the Corinthyans, reade

forth that charitie and then ſhall you ſone ſe what fruites charitie bryngeth forth. Agayne I ſay that fayth and charitie ſo charyſhe one an other, that the one in no wyſe can be without the company of the other. Wherefore ſtyll I crye after one ſorte and maner, for Goddes ſake let eche man endeuour hym ſelfe to attayne chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and then vſe it and loue God (as I knowe no good Chriſten man dothe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe) aboue al thinges and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. Mary there be ſome that ſhewe ſmale loue towardes hym, for they feare not to blaſpheme him, to ſweare and ſtare by hym, as though he were more vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler then anye creature that lyuethe, his woundes, his ſoule, his harte, his bloude, his ſydes, his nayles, ſo that frome the crowne of the heade to the ſole of the foote, they leaue not one member of Chriſte vnrecyted, ye and for a moſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon othe they take his hole precious body and make it theyr ſweryng ſtocke, ye and this is done in the moſte exceſſe of fylthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that they vſe, for when they are moſte dronke, then ſwere they moſt, when they are moſte angry then they ſwere and teere Chriſt in peeces. But O wycked people, O blaſphemers of God, O tormenters of Chryſte, O ye worſe then beaſtes, what
<pb facs="tcp:13747:8"/>
ſhall I call you, what ſhall I ſaye vnto you, ye feareleſſe people, ye ſhameleſſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, haue you no regarde of nature, haue you no reſpecte to Chriſt? Knowe you not what you are, what you were, and what you ſhall come to? O thou earth and aſhes wylte thou blaſpheme hym ſo rygruſlye, whiche came downe from his maieſtye to delyuer the, whome the Deuyll faſt hadde bounde in the chaynes of ſyn? Thou arte muche lyke vnto the Adder or Serpent, of whome Yſope telleth a prety fable, a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande man founde this Adder in the colde ſnowe, and of his gentylnes broughte her home, and layde her by a fyer, where ſhe was wel recouered and rendred to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate agayne. (But nowe marke the gentylnes of this Adder) when the good huſband man came to her and touched her, to ſe howe ſhe fared, for his kyndenes ſhe caught holde aboute his boddy and ſtonge hym ſore, wherewith the good man beyng vexed (and not without greate cauſe) toke his Axe in his hande and cut her in peces. Euen ſo our mayſter and ſauyour Ieſus Chryſt, perceyuyng vs vyle and poyſoned wretches, lyeng and quiuering in the cold ſnowe of ſynne: to our euerlaſtynge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, he diſcended from his hyghe trone, noryſhinge vs with the hot fyer of feruent

Beware beware, beware be tyme, beware leſt by your importunable vexyng of God throughe your venemus and blaſphemus othes and abhomynable lyuyng: without eyther vertue, ſhame or feare, he ſodaynely with his axe or ſwerde (the ſharpnes wher of can not be expreſſed) cut and ſouder you from the lyuely members of his myſtycall body, and caſt you into the deepe Donge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hel, where ſhalbe wepyng and gnaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyng of tethe, where you ſhal ſuffer eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall payne, where you ſhall contynually blaſpheme, and neuer ceaſe thoughe you wolde, and yet ſhall you alway ſuffer the tormentes due for the ſame, I thynke yf you loued god, you wolde not on ſuche wyſe blaſpheme hym, you wold I thynke feare ſomewhat the punyſhemente dulye

Nowe in this worde heauen, is comprehended all thynges therein contayned, and lykewyſe by this worde earth, is vnderſtanded eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye thynge conteyned within the ſame, ſo that Chriſt leaueth you nothyng to ſwere by, as appeareth by his wordes folowyng in the ſame Chapiter where he ſayth, lette your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municacion be ye ye, and nay nay.

But euer take heede of boldenes, bolden not your ſelues ſo much vpon his mercy, to leaue al his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes vnfulfylled. For yf you runne ſo far at rouers, lyke wantons and vnbrydeled coltes, he muſte needes ſcorge you, and beate you, wherefore I ſay playe not the parte of blynde bayerde.
