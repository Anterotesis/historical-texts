            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if they be euills, greeue not that thou hast missed them, but remember, that seeing it is not thy study to pursue those things that are not in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1775:27"/>
a mans owne power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of, thou canst not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly haue those graces alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee, that others haue, whose study is all vpon that obiect. For how shall hee that doth not attend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually at a great mans doore, haue equall place in his fauour with him that doth giue this due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance? or he that waites not at his heeles, with him that doth? or he that flatters him not, with him that doth? vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust and insatiable therefore should thine affections be, if thou pay not the due price for things that are thus sale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and yet thinke to haue
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1775:27"/>
them giuen thee <hi>gratis:</hi> For admitte this comparison: what's the price of a dish of lettice? say an halfe-peny. Well, one comes, payes his halfe-peny and hath his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: if thou pay nothing, and so haue none, doost thou thinke thy selfe in worse place then hee that had of them? no, thou hast no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to do so, for as hee hath his lettice, so thou hast paid no price. Euen so it is here. Thou art not inuited vnto some great mans banquet? why, nor hast thou defrayed the price that the banquet is sold for: namely praise, and flattory for which the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1775:28"/>
maker there-of setteth it foorth to sayle. Pay then the price of it, if it like thee to pertake of it. But if thou wilt not performe the first, and yet desirest to enioy the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thy thoughts are basely couetous and deiectd. Well then insteed of this feast, thou hast nothing. No? yes that thou hast: thou hast not pleased him whom thou couldst not finde in thine heart to praise; nor hast thou been forced to endure his insolence, by eating of his viands.</p>

As for example: if thy neighbours childe doe breake a glasse, or such like, euery one presently can say it was a chance.

               <p>Know, that the first and formost point of religion is a true beleefe: to bee assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly perswaded, that there is a God, and that he sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the state of the whole vniuerse, in goodnesse and in iustice: that we must obey him, &amp; assent vnto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the smallest condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: approouing all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and following their directions as the effects of that purest &amp; most glorious <hi>Intellect.</hi> Thus dooing, thou shalt neuer haue cause to repine at him, nor to repute
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1775:34"/>
him negligent of thee. Now this cannot bee, vnlesse thou reiect the things that lye not in thy power to dispose of, and place the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of good and euill in those things whose order is tyed vnto mans owne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. For if thou binde, either goodnesse or bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to any of the other, it is vnpossible that thou shouldst not accuse the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them, and grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an hate of him, when-so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou art deceiued of what thou desiredst, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest into that which thou soughtest to auoyd. For it is inherent in euery creature
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1775:35"/>
by nature, to abhorre and eschue the originall causes of all that seemeth hurtfull, as well as the effects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: and contrarywise, to follow, and admire the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and productions of all that seemeth vse-full. Hee therefore that thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe iniured, hath small reason to reioyce in that hee seemeth to iniurie the other againe: for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that losse should bee parent vnto true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. But this erronious conceit, maketh the sonne to disparage the father, when hee doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe him enough of that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1775:35"/>
which opinion holdeth for a true good, and this made <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polinices</hi> go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the eares for their fathers Empire, because they thought there was such a deale of happinesse inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in soueraignty.

For if it concerne a thing that is not in the power of man, it is impossible that it should bee either good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil.

But sette downe thy staffe at this, what euer the end bee, it no way concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thee: For thou hast power to make vse of it, come in what shape soeuer it will: And in this none in the World can bee thy hinderance. And therefore come to the Goddes, as to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1775:37"/>
thy counsellors with a bold spirit: and when thou hast hard their wils, remember who are thy Councellors, and how great a contempt thou shalt committe in diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying their direction. But if thou come to the Oracle (as it pleased <hi>Socrates</hi> to do) about a thing whose whole consideration relyeth vppon the euent; &amp; wherin neither Art nor Reason can aide thee with knowledge of the dependances, then must thou ruminate vpon the first head therof: therfore if thou beest to vndergo the defence of thy friend or countrey w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> danger of thine own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

For it was none of this city that gaue it, but a stranger, a worthy man, and a true follower of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Parmeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> both in doctrine and conuersation, comming
<pb facs="tcp:1775:60"/>
to this Citty, dedicated both this Temple, and this Table vnto the seruice of GOD <hi>Saturne.</hi> Did you know the man Sir, quoth I? yes, quoth hee, that I did, and was an auditor of his admired doctrine a long time, for euen in his yonger yeares, his instructions bare great perfection, and lustre: many a time haue I heard him teach the exposition of this table vnto his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. I beseech you sir, quoth I, if your businesse be not of greater import, to expound the meaning hereof vnto vs, for I assure you, our desires to know it are vehement.
<pb facs="tcp:1775:60"/>
Truly strangers (quoth hee) and my leasure serueth mee to satisfie you, but you must take one caueat with you, more then you are aware off, and that is this: the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof is attended with much danger. What dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sir, quoth I? Mary this quoth he: if you giue go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>od eare vnto the discourse that you shall heare, and fix your memories with a true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, it will crowne you with wisedome and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: if not, it will plunge you in a boundlesse depth of all dulnesse &amp; misery. For this explanation resembleth the riddle of <hi>Sphynx,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb facs="tcp:1775:61"/>
with shee vsed to intrappe poore passengers, he that could vnderstand it, passed safe, but hee that did not was sure to pay for his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with his life. Euen so is it here. For <hi>Ignorance</hi> is a Sphynx vnto man. And this obscure picture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth a description of all the good and euill that lackeyeth the life of man: As also of all that which is indifferent and pertaketh of neyther. Now if a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not this aright, it will not dispatch him at once, as the Sphynx did those that fell into her clawes: But it will infect his whole
<pb facs="tcp:1775:61"/>
life w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a continual corrosion; and such a torment as those seek, who being condemned &amp; giued, do euery moment expect the hand of the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But contrarywise, if one apprehend it with a true conceit, Ignorance breaketh his owne necke, and the whole course of his life that vnderstandeth it aright; shal be replenished with perfect beatitude. Marke my words therefore well, and lette them not go in at one eare and out at another. Lord God (quoth I) how haue you inflamed vs with a desire to heare this relation, if all be thus: yes assuredly quoth he
<pb facs="tcp:1775:62"/>
it is euen thus. Proceed sir I beseech you quoth I, for wee bee no negligent audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in a matter of so great hope, or so great hurt vnto the hearers. So the old man lifting vp his staffe, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the picture: See you this incloser, quoth he? Yes very well: why then marke me: This is called LIFE: and the great multitude you see flocke about the gate, are such as are to enter into the the course of this life. And that old man whom ye see with a paper in one hand, &amp; seeming to point out some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therein with the other, is called, Lifes GENIVS.
<pb facs="tcp:1775:62"/>
Hee instructeth those that enter, what methode to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue in their course of life, and layeth them downe what they must follow, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perill of their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions. I pray you what kinde of life (sir) doth hee direct them to follow, said I? or how doth hee will them to proceed? See you not a Throne, quoth hee, neere vnto the gate as the people goe in, and a woman sitting thereon witth a visor on her face, in queint appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and a cup in her hand? Yes that I doe, quoth I, what is shee? It is IMPOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVRE, quoth hee, that sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb facs="tcp:1775:63"/>
all the world. What doth she? she drinketh of her owne brewing vnto all men liuing, what drinke is it? It is <hi>Error,</hi> quoth hee, and <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi>: and how then? why when they haue tasted of this cuppe, then enter they, the course of life: Why but tell mee sir, doe all then drinke of <hi>Errour</hi>? All quoth hee, but some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede drinke more, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some lesse.</p>
            <p>And behold, see you not a crue of women at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttired like whores, there within the gate? yes, sir. Why those are called <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Desires,</hi> and <hi>Pleasures,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:1775:63"/>
and as soone as any come in at the gate, presently these run dancing to them, fall to dalliance with them and so lead them whether they list. Whether lead they them, said I? Some to security, said hee, &amp; some to ruine, by <hi>Impostures</hi> meanes. Oh worthy sir, how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a drinke haue you told me of! Nay, when they come first vnto men, quoth hee, they make them promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of all delights, of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall security in perfect bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: now the men, being drunke with the <hi>Error,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> that <hi>Imposture</hi> presented them, cannot
<pb facs="tcp:1775:64"/>
for their liues finde the right way to that good course, but goe wandring about they know not whether, as you see them described in the picture. And you see them that were entred before, goe round about as these wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men direct them. I doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, quoth I; but what wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is that, that stands vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that round stone, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as though shee were blinde, and carrying a sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of madnesse in her gesture: that same quoth he is FORTVNE, her blindnesse is not single, but accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with madnesse, and deafenesse. Why what doth
<pb facs="tcp:1775:64"/>
shee there then? Shee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders about, quoth he, taking from one, and giuing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and by and by taketh that away which shee gaue but euen now, and bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it vpon a third, with-out all reason or constancie; and therefore her token there speaketh her nature at full. Which is that, quoth I? her standing vpon that round stone. What is the meaning of that? that her gifts are neuer secure nor certaine. For hee that buildeth his trust vpon them, shall bee sure one day to pay deerely for his credulity. What names beare they? They are
<pb facs="tcp:1775:65"/>
called <hi>Fooles</hi>: How chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it that some of them weepe, and some laugh? why are they not all in one form? They that laugh and reioice are <hi>Fortunes</hi> fauourites, and salute her by the title of <hi>Prosperous.</hi> But they that wring their hands &amp; waile, are such as shee hath depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of that which shee had giuen them before, and they call her <hi>Aduerse</hi> fortune. What are her giftes then, that they should make the loosers lament, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers reioyce? Her gifts, are <hi>Reputed goods</hi>: and what be those? Ritches, Nobility, children, glory, soueraignty,
<pb facs="tcp:1775:65"/>
Empire and such like. And I pray sir, hold you these for good? Of that heereafter, quoth hee: let vs now make an end of the tables exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. With all mine heart sir. You see now that beeing past that gate, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enclosure, lying higher vppe, and seauen women ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred like curtizans, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding without at the ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. All this I see. Well, one of these is called <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,</hi> another <hi>Luxury,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Auarice,</hi> and another, <hi>Flattery</hi>: &amp; what stand they for there? They watch when <hi>Fortune</hi> bestoweth any thing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any man: how then? then
<pb facs="tcp:1775:66"/>
they reioyce, and embrace him, and flatter him, and intreate him to staye with them, promising him a life, fraught with all the delight that the most vnbounded affect can desire. If any one doe like this, and tarry with them, hee is tickled with false delight, that free ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth his life an heauen, when indeed it is nothing so. For when his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing r<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>turneth, then hee will soone perceiue that hee hath not eaten at their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but that they haue eaten vp him, and when they had so done, sent him away with his sound burden of derisio
<pb facs="tcp:1775:66"/>
And now hauing brought al the benefits of fortune vnto nothing, hee must turne drudge to those drabs, suffer all their imperious iniuries, and vndergo all vnseemely offices for their pleasures, as cousenage, sacriledge, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, the euery, and all the rest of that vngratious bead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll. And when all those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious trades fayle him, then is hee packt ouer into the hands of <hi>Punishment. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi> which is she? Doe you not perceiue a little grate in the picture, behinde those women, and within that, as it were an obscure dungeon? Yes. And a great
<pb facs="tcp:1775:67"/>
many women all in tattred ragges, and forlorne shapes? I see them also Why that same that holdeth the scourge, is called <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: shee that leaneth her head vppon her knee, is <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> Shee that teareth her hayre, hight <hi>Sorrow.</hi> There standes one also behinde them, all deformed, meager, and naked, and a woman with him, bearing the same figure of leane deformity. Who bee they? The mans name, quoth he, is <hi>Anguish,</hi> and the womans <hi>Desperation</hi>: vnto these is the ruined man passed ouer, and confined to liue in dolefull extremitie.
<pb facs="tcp:1775:67"/>
From thence they driue him farther, into the Iayle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity, and there shall his captiuity be endlesse vnlesse Repentance bee his baile. Why, what can she do? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shee can deliuer him out of this huge deluge of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and bring him acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with another <hi>Opinion,</hi> and another <hi>Desire,</hi> who will guide him vnto the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of <hi>True Instruction</hi>: and will also proferre to conduct him vnto <hi>False Instruction.</hi> And how then, quoth I? If hee embrace that <hi>Opinion</hi> that giueth him directions in the way of <hi>True vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> hee shalbe thereby
<pb facs="tcp:1775:68"/>
purified, and reformed, and runne the rest of his liues course in the plentitude of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, beyond the reach of all future calamity: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if he do not so, <hi>False in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi> will subuert him with a new deceipt. O God (said I) how dangerous is this last difference! But what shape hath this same False <hi>Instruction?</hi> Behold yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other enclosure, saith he. So I doe sir. At the portall thereof sitteth a woman in neate and seemly habite: the vulgar and the vainer sorte call her <hi>Instruction,</hi> whereas indeed hir true name is <hi>false instruction.</hi> Now they that
<pb facs="tcp:1775:68"/>
meane to passe vnto <hi>true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi>? Do all come first vnto this woman. Why is there no other way then this vnto <hi>true Instruction?</hi> Yes that there is. Who are they then that walke about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that inclosure? They are the followers of <hi>false Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> imagining in themselues (but al too erroneously) that they inioy the company of <hi>true instruction.</hi> And what are their professions? Some of them are Poets, some Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, some Logitians, some Musitians, Arithmetique, Geometry, Astrology, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, Criticisme, and all other professions haue bast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
<pb facs="tcp:1775:69"/>
within this ring: nay here are prosessed voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries also. But what women are those that conuerse with them in the habites of those former, amongst whome you reckoned <hi>Incontinence</hi> and her fellowes? They are the self-same. What, do they come hether also? That they doe, but not so ordinarily as else-where, into the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure. And do the <hi>Opinions</hi> come thus far also. Yes veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe they: for the drinke that <hi>Imposture</hi> giueth these, euen at first, is not yet out of their heads, they doe as yet smell of the dregs of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi>: nor shall
<pb facs="tcp:1775:69"/>
they euer be quitte of their <hi>Opinions,</hi> or their other vices vntill they renounce the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>False Instruction,</hi> and take them-selues to the true course, &amp; taking the potion that is called <hi>Errors purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> thereby vomit vp all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euils that offended their mindes, as their <hi>Opinions,</hi> their <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and all their other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities: for so shall their consciences be perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But as long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine with <hi>false Instruction,</hi> they shall neuer be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sound, nor shall their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines helpe them away with any one incouenience. Which is the way then that
<pb facs="tcp:1775:70"/>
leadeth vnto <hi>true instruction.</hi> Why look you here, see you this high place that seemes as desart and vnhabited. Well sir, I see it. Then you see that little gate, and the way there before the gate, which looks as if it were but little vsed, lying in such a steepe discent of that craggy rock. That I see also: you see more-ouer that hill there, that is enuironed on eyther side with inaccessible cliffes, hauing onely one narrow path whereby to ascend it: True sir. That same path, is all the way wee haue to <hi>true Instruction.</hi> Truly sir mee thinketh it is almost impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb facs="tcp:1775:70"/>
to get vp it. You marke that steepe rock then by that other hill. So I doe. And see you not two lusty and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Viragoes</hi> standing thervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, &amp; reaching forth their hands in manner of a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full inuitation. I see them well, but how call you their names? One of them hight <hi>Continency,</hi> and the other <hi>Tollerance</hi>: and they are sist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. VVhy doe they reach forth their hands? They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the trauelers that come that way, to bee of good cheere, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie desperation the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of sluggishnesse; assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, that after a
<pb facs="tcp:1775:71"/>
little toile, the whole residue of their life shalbe topt with happy tranquillity, and that if they will climbe but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, all the way after shall bee most plaine and easie. But when they come to the rock how shal they doe to ascend? I see no meane they haue to mount so steep a cliffe. True, but the two sisters do come downe them-selues from the toppe, and lending them their handes, pull them vppe by degrees. After they are gotten vp a little way, they bidde them rest a little, and then they bring <hi>Fortitude</hi> &amp; <hi>Confidence</hi> vnto them, and passe their wordes to bring
<pb facs="tcp:1775:71"/>
them to the presence of <hi>True Instruction,</hi> shewing them how plaine and how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant the tract is, now that they haue surmounted the former difficulty, and how cleare it is from all cragges and incombrances, as you see in the Table. So indeed it seemes. And see you not that wood, and before it, as it were a pleasant launde, or meade? Al full of light &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? Right: and in the midst therof another enclosure w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a gate vnto it? There is so: but how cal you that enclosure? mary it is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>habitation of the blessed,</hi> for in that place are al the vertues resident w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:1775:72"/>
beatitude. Truly it lookes like a delightfull abode. You see then that goodly matron that stands by the gate, with a constant eie of a midle age, rather inclining to fiftie, in a plaine and vngarnished ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, and standing vppon a stone not round but cubike, and directly square? Shee hath two other women also neare her that seem to be hir daughters. So they do. The mid most of these three is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Instruction</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she of the one hand, <hi>Truth,</hi> and she on the other, <hi>Perswasion.</hi> But why doth <hi>Instruction</hi> stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a square stone? To shewe that the path which
<pb facs="tcp:1775:72"/>
leadeth vnto her is faire and firme: and that her gifts doe blesse the receiuer with fruits of security. What doth shee giue? She giueth <hi>Confidence, Security,</hi> &amp; <hi>Acquittance from troubles.</hi> And what vse of those? By these man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth that his life is now to continue voide of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations. Oh glorious, oh gratious gifts quoth I! but why doth she stand without the enclosure? to cure the trauellers, &amp; giue them her drink before they enter, and then to admit them passage in, vnto the vertues. How is this good sir quoth I? In truth I conceiue you
<pb facs="tcp:1775:73"/>
not. You shall, quoth hee. It is heere, as if a person greatly diseased should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his body to the cure of the Phisitian: now hee, first of all, purgeth away the causes, and nutriment of the malady, and then corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the vitalls, and finally confirmeth the body in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect soundnesse. Now if the person had contemned the counsels of Phisicke, hee had been deseruedly giuen ouer to the tyranny of his disease. This I conceiue, quoth I. Well, euen thus quoth hee, do men approach this stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Instruction,</hi> which as soone as they arriue at, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb facs="tcp:1775:73"/>
shee cureth them, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her owne receipt vnto them which purgeth out all their ingulphed euills, as by vomit or eiection. What are the euils they cast vp. <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> both which they drunke from the hand of <hi>Imposture, Arrogance</hi> also, <hi>Auarice, Desire, Incontinence, Anger,</hi> and all the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which they swallowed downe while they were in the first enclosure. And whether doth shee send them hauing purged them? Shee letteth them in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Knowledge</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues. Which bee they? Why see you not a
<pb facs="tcp:1775:74"/>
company of faire &amp; modest matrons there within the gate, amongst whome there is not one that seemeth painted, or curiously ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as they before were all? I see them: what are their names? The fore-most of them, hight <hi>knowledge,</hi> the rest are her sisters, called by the names of <hi>Fortitude, Ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, Integrity of life, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Modesty, Liberality, Continency,</hi> &amp; (<hi>Clemency.</hi> Oh goodly consort! quoth I. How great is humane hope? your hopes quoth he shalbe complete, if you conceiue this relation aright, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it vnto your courses
<pb facs="tcp:1775:74"/>
in the world. Sir, assure your selfe, quoth I, wee will omitte no paines here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Then shall your endes bee crowned with security, quoth hee. But whether doe these <hi>Vertues</hi> lead the man that enters? Vnto their mother. What is shee? Her name is BEATITVDE. Of what quality is she? See you not a way that ascendeth that height there, whereon the tower of the three en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closures is founded? Behold there a faire and flourishing matrone, enthroned in state, at the portch of the sayd tower in goodly raiment, yet vntaxable of profusenesse,
<pb facs="tcp:1775:75"/>
with a crown of roses about her beauteous temples. You say right sir, what is she? she is the person, that is called <hi>Beatitude.</hi> And when one commeth to her, what doth shee? Shee crowneth him (quoth he) with delight ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned vnto all the other vertues, as they are crowned that are victors in dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conflicts: what conflicts hath he bin in, said I? In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sore ones, quoth hee: and hath conquered many a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage beast that wounded him pitifully, &amp; ouerthrew him often: yet brought he al their fury vnder, and now is become his owne man, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:1775:75"/>
those sauages serue him now, as hee was forced to stoope to them before: What beasts are they you speake of, sir? I would faine know that. I speake of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi> first: are not they true beasts? yes, and cruel ones too, quoth I. And then, quoth he I speak of <hi>Sorrovv, Anguish, Aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, Intemperance,</hi> and the whole <hi>Lernean</hi> fen of vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits. All these hath he now at command, whereas before they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded him. O renowned victory, quoth I, and memorably perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med! but I pray sir tell me this, what force is there
<pb facs="tcp:1775:76"/>
in the crowne shee giueth him? A blessed force (young man) there is in that crown. He whose browes it encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleth, shall be really blessed, and lift vp beyond the pitch of misery: nor shall his blisse relye vppon others, but bee fully established in him-self. Oh what a conquest is there! But what doth hee when he hath this crowne? whether goeth he then? Then the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues bring him backe the same way that he came, and shewe him those that liue there beneath, how misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and how mischieuous their estate is, and how they dash the ship of their life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:1775:76"/>
the rocks, keeping no course but rouing at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without all care or compasse: and how they are ledde away to bondage by their foes, some by <hi>Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,</hi> som by <hi>Arrogance,</hi> som by <hi>Auarice,</hi> some by <hi>Vainglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> some by one mean of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine &amp; some by another. And out of these giues of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they haue no meanes in the world to redeeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but there they lye in fetters of perturbation, all their liues long. The reason hereof is, they haue forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the instruction that <hi>Lifes Genius</hi> gaue them at their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, and so cannot light
<pb facs="tcp:1775:77"/>
of the true course of life. In truth you say well, but why should the <hi>Vertues</hi> goe to shew him the place and perills that hee had already passed? He tell you why. At his former passage of them, hee conceiued not the halfe of their maleuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor vnderstood the actions that were done there, almost any thing: but was altogether enui<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oned with doubts, because of the drinke of <hi>Error</hi> &amp; <hi>Ignorance</hi> which hee had tasted, which made him imagine that for good, which had no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in it, and so in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of euill. Whereby hee
<pb facs="tcp:1775:77"/>
was thrust into the course of corruption aswell as the rest were. But now that he hath attained the knowledge of conueniences, hee both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth the misery of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and enioyeth felicity himselfe. But when hee hath obserued the misfortunes of these men, what doth hee then? or whether goeth he? faith euen whether hee lift himselfe. For he is as secure in euery place as if hee were in the caue of <hi>Corycum</hi>: and let him liue were hee will, hee shall liue in honesty and free from all, euen the least encombrance. All men shalbe as glad of his

company as the sicke person is of the Phisitians why but shall he neuer more stand in feare of those beasts you spoke of? shall they haue no more power to touch him? no, not a iot. Hee shall stand at defiance with <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Trouble, Incontinence, Auarice, Need,</hi> and all other extreames whatsoeuer: hee shall check and curbe them now as he pleaseth, who be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore plagued him worse then the stings of adders, and as the serpents that kill all other things with their poyson, medle not with the viper, because his owne ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime is an <hi>Amulet</hi> against all
<pb facs="tcp:1775:78"/>
theirs: so likewise shall no euill approach this perfect man, because in himselfe hee hath a preseruatiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all their infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. All this is well, quoth I: but I pray you sir tell mee this: I see a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany descending the hill as it were, some with crownes on their heads, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to exult and reioyce, and others without crownes looking like despayring men, with their heads and legges all bruised, and diuers women seeme to detaine them: what are these? They that weare crownes, are the adopted sons of <hi>instruction,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:1775:79"/>
and reioyce at their adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The other, are some of them reiected by her, and so fallne into miserable estate: others, beeing weakened by <hi>Sloath,</hi> when they had gotten vp as farre as <hi>Tolerance,</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back againe, and so sell a wandring they knew not whether. But what are the women that follow them? There is <hi>Sorrowe, Trouble, Desperation, Ignominy,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance.</hi> Why then belike all the mischieues that may bee, doe follow them at the heeles. So they do, and when they come back in<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o the first inclosure, vnto <hi>Luxury,</hi> and <hi>Incontinence,</hi> they lay all the
<pb facs="tcp:1775:79"/>
blame on them-selues, and fall a cursing <hi>Instruction,</hi> and al that are in the way to her, as wretches, &amp; vnfortunate fooles, that leaue the tract that these now do tread, and the pleasures of the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure, to goe seeke <hi>had I wist</hi> and hunt out a course of such vnhappinesse, refus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to stay and share with them in their delightfull goods. And what are their goods? Shall I tell you in a word? <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</hi> For like vnto beasts, they are all for the belly, and imagine the filling of that the full fruite of all their expected good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1775:80"/>But what call you the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther women that come downe there, laughing and making semblance of mirth? They are <hi>Opinions</hi>: they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men vppe vnto <hi>Instuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and when they haue done, come backe, and tell the rest how gratiously those they presented were receiued, and how they are now in state of blessednesse. Why but doe these <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> goe in vnto the vertues? Oh no: it is altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for <hi>Opinion</hi> to come in the sight of knowledge, they doe onely deliuer the men ouer vnto <hi>Instruction,</hi> whom shee receiuing, they
<pb facs="tcp:1775:80"/>
goe their waies to fetch more, as shippes do, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnladed their fraught make presently forth for a new voiage, taking in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commodities. In truth sir, your comparison is passing good, quoth I but you told vs not yet what it is that <hi>Liues Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> sayth vnto those that are to enter the course of life. Hee biddeth them bee of good cheere, quoth hee: and bee you of good cheere also, for I will not keepe a letter of the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you: we thanke you most humbly sir, sayd we all. Then hee, reaching forth
<pb facs="tcp:1775:81"/>
his staffe againe, pointed vp, saying, see you that blind woman vpon the round stone there, whom euen now I told you hight <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>? Yes. The <hi>Genius</hi> bids them, neuer to giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vnto her, neuer to imagine any solidity in her bounties, neuer to hold her gifts as your proper goods: for that when shee list, shee will take them from one, &amp; bestow them on another, magure all contradiction, it is her ordinarye practise. And therefore hee warneth them, not to delight in her beneuolence, nor to greeue at her frowardnesse: Neuer
<pb facs="tcp:1775:81"/>
to bee conquered either by her curstnesse or her cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, to giue her neither prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses nor curses, seeing shee doth nothing with discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but hurleth all about at six and seauen, as I told you already. Therefore doth this <hi>Genius</hi> bid vs neuer wonder at her exploits, nor play the badde borrowers to count another mans mony our owne, and to bee offended, and hold our selfe iniured, if it be demanded againe: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that our credite lent vs it, vpon condition to haue it restored without contention.</p>
            <p>Thus (saith this <hi>Genius</hi>) must
<pb facs="tcp:1775:82"/>
we stand affected to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of fortune, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well, that it is one of her old trickes to giue, and take againe, and then to giue one farre more, and presently to take away all euery iot, both what shee gaue last, and what she left before. He bids vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take hir gifts, &amp; hauing them, make hast with them to that firme, and constant kinde of bounty: VVhich is that? That which <hi>Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> giueth to those that come safe to her Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to aske it. And what giueth shee?

<pb facs="tcp:1775:82"/>
thinges,</hi> a guift of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable goodnesse and security. To her therfore hee wils them all to make hast, and when they come to <hi>Luxury,</hi> and <hi>Incontinence,</hi> the two women afore-named, to passe by them speedily, and stoppe the eares vnto their inueyg<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed perswasions, and so to hasten on vntill they come vnto <hi>False Instruction.</hi> There hee aduiseth them to make a little stay, and take what they like of her for their <hi>Viaticum,</hi> the rest of their iourney. And then to scowre away with all speede vnto the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of <hi>True Instruction.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:1775:83"/>
This is the charge that the <hi>Genius of life</hi> layeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all that are vppon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance into the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure: Hee that eyther refuseth it, or misaply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, comes home by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse and ruine. This mine honest friendes is the exposition of this Table: If you would bee further satisfied in any thing else, propound it, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue you. Gramercy, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous sir. I pray you then what is it that their <hi>Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> wisheth them to take at the station of <hi>False In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctruction</hi>? Such things as they shall neede. And
<pb facs="tcp:1775:83"/>
what bee those? Letters, Languages and Disciplines which <hi>Plato</hi> called the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of youth, keeping them out of worse imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Must hee that will passe to <hi>True Instruction</hi> needes take these heere, or may hee lette them alone if hee please? Hee need not vnlesse hee list: They are conuenient, but wholy impertinent to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>No? are they not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the bettering of our vnderstandings? Yes, but our goodnesse may haue increase without
<pb facs="tcp:1775:84"/>
them, yet are they not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vn-vsefull. For we may heare a doctrine reade by another, and yet it were not amisse if wee could reade it in the lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage our selues, then wee benefit by his reading ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse: so that one may bee without these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines, well enough. I but are not these that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the artes of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hability to haue good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse infused into them, then others that want those disciplines? No, how should that bee, quoth hee, when they are as badly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of the true nature of
<pb facs="tcp:1775:84"/>
good and euill, and as black with the pitchy touch of vitiousnesse, as others that vnderstand nothing? It is an easiy thing for one to bee a deepe scholler, and a mais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all the disciplines, and yet bee as prone to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenesse, intemperance, ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, iniury, treachery, yea and madnesse, as he that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sawe the in-side of a schoole-house. There are plenty of those examples, wee neede not goe farre to fetch them. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what prerogatiue hath learning in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of a mans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances? Truely none
<pb facs="tcp:1775:85"/>
quoth I, if things goe thus. But why then are those schollers in the second enclosure, as nearer neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to <hi>true Instruction</hi> then the rest?</p>
            <p>Ablasse, saith hee, what good gette they by that; When wee see often that diuers passe out of the first enclosure, from <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence</hi> and the other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, vnto <hi>true Instruction</hi> without once resting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those <hi>Disciplinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>? What man then can avouch their estate bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter because of their place? They are either more dull, or more idle then
<pb facs="tcp:1775:85"/>
others? Why sayd I, how is that? Because, saith hee, though those of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond enclosure were cleare from all faults else, yet this alone stickes by them for euer, <hi>To professe</hi> to know that, <hi>Whereof</hi> they are vtterly ignorant: which conceite of themselues, maketh them farre more slacke in the quest of <hi>true Instruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, doe you not see how the <hi>Opinions</hi> come floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of the first enclo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure vnto them? These are the causes why their e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>state is not an haire bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the others, vnless<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Repentance</hi> and they fall once acquainted, and that they bee veryly perswaded that they dwell not with <hi>True Instruction,</hi> but with her counterfeit, which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them into errors, and so stoppeth all the meanes of their reformation and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to security. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore strangers, quoth hee, vnlesse you take this course, and beate this discourse of mine ouer and ouer, vntill you haue gotten the habite thereof (to which ende you must continue an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reuolution thereof in your meditation, and make it your thoughts principall
<pb facs="tcp:1775:86"/>
practise) you shall neuer make vse of any word that you haue heard: Sir, wee will doe our best endeuours. But I pray resolue vs this: Why are not those things worthy the name of goods which <hi>Fortune</hi> giueth vnto mans vse? as life, health, ritches, honours, children, conquests, and such other her bounties: and why are not their contraries euills? this assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seemeth strange and incredible vnto vs. Wel quoth hee, be sure then that you answer directly vnto that I shall demand. I will, quoth I: whether is it good for him that is an euill liuer,
<pb facs="tcp:1775:87"/>
to liue, at all or no. It is not good I thinke (quoth I) for him to liue, but rather euil. How then can life (saith he) bee good at all, if it bee euill for him? Because (quoth I) as to the badde liuer, life is badde, so to the good liuer, life is good. So then, you hold life both good and badde. That I doe sayd I. O beware of an absurdity, (quoth hee.) It is impossible for one thing to bee good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. For so it should bee both profitable and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and likewise alwaies, both to bee affected and auoyded, and that both at
<pb facs="tcp:1775:87"/>
one time. This is an absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity indeed, quoth I. But if hee that liueth badly, haue a badnesse by liuing so, how can life but bee badde vnto that man? I but quoth hee, it is one thing to liue, and another to liue badly. That is true quoth I. So then life in it selfe is not bad. For if it were so, it would bee so to the best liues as well as the worst: For all should haue a life that should be a badnes in itself. You say true. VVell then life beeing communicated, both to the good liues &amp; the euil, to liue, of it selfe, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor euill, no more
<pb facs="tcp:1775:88"/>
then cutting or burning is, both which are good in some diseases, but hurtfull vnto all sound bodies. So is this life: and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this to yourselfe: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had you rather liue bad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, or die honourably? The latter should be my choyce, quoth I. So then, quoth he, death in it selfe is no badde thing belike: for it is often times to bee preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore life. Most true. Well then, sicknes &amp; health, haue one and the same respect. For occasion may so fal out, that it befitteth not the sicke man to recouer. It may be so. Good, waigh ritches
<pb facs="tcp:1775:88"/>
then in the same ballance. Suppose that which is often seene: A man hath great wealth, and applyeth it to no good vse: Many such there are. Do not his ritches then helpe his beatitude any way? I think not, because of his own badnes. VVhy then very well, it is not wealth, but <hi>wise Instruction</hi> that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man happy. Surely so it seemes. How then can ritches be good, when they haue no power to better their possessors? They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indeed. VVel, it is befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting then that some should not bee rich at all, because they are ignorant of the true
<pb facs="tcp:1775:89"/>
vse of ritches. Nay I am of your mind in that. How then can that be any way pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to goodnesse, which must bee often times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from the vse of diuers persons, so that he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can vse wealth, as wealth should be vsed, may liue well, and hee that cannot must needes breake downe his owne qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et? you strike on truth in all things, sir. Lastly (quoth he) it is the esteeme of those for goods, or the contempt of them as euils, that molesteth and offendeth the cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, prizing them as thinges of such excellent worth, and the onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
<pb facs="tcp:1775:89"/>
vnto the Court of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse and this maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vndergo all actions, euen of how wicked a front soeuer, onely for the attaynment of these glosses. These acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents attend on all such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of externall shewes, because theirdull vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings can no way penetrate into the natures of thinges truly good, they are so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled in the quick-sands of erroneous <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
