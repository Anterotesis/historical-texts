            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the enemy. Of the firſt kinde he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. 15. 16. and part of the 17. Of the other, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. and 18. Hee armeth the whole man from the head to the feete, that hee might in no part bee hurt of his enemy, and of this kinde of armour hee nameth fiue. The Girdle, the Breaſt-plate, the Shooes, the Shield, and the Helmet.</p>
            <p>Hee beginneth with the loynes, which muſt bee ſtrengthened with the girdle; and the breaſt, as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parts in which the life and ſtrength conſiſteth, and which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my chiefly aſſaulteth; and therefore the ſouldier is wont eſpecially to arme thoſe parts in which the ſtrength and life abideth.</p>
            <p>He ſaith therefore, <hi>Stand:</hi> he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth here three things.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19183:31"/>
we are all called into the Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, that is, to the army of Chriſtian Soldiars, vnder the conduct &amp; enſignes of Ieſus Chriſt. The other is a ſpeciall calling whereby a certaine ſtation and office is aſſigned to euery man in the Church, as it is in a military army. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one ought eſpecially to keepe himſelfe in the army of the Church, and next in his priuate ſtation. Firſt therefore he requireth that euery one abide in the Church, and that hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not from the army for if hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, <hi>actum est,</hi> farewell to him: as to him that going from the army is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlaine of the enemy, or of his owne company by the command of his Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, hee requireth that euery man ſhould conteine himſelfe within the limits of his owne ſtation or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: for in an army nothing is more pernicious then <hi>ataxia</hi> and confuſion. Firſt therefore euery man muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly remaine within the limits and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19183:31"/>
bounds of the Church: and next, in his owne proper condition, to which he is peculiarly called, and not to giue place to the Diuel, which diligently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to draw him from both.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, vigilancy and watching is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſignified by this word <hi>ſtand.</hi> This is neceſſary alſo, and oppoſed to ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>For while men ſlept this enemy came, and ſowed tares.
