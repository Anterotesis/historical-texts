            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Not but that Minds best taught are most afraid,</l>
               <l>To venture out when they for Glory trade.</l>
               <l>An humble Mind doth every Path survey,</l>
               <l>That leads to Fame, and sees how many stray:</l>
               <l>Observes the steep Ascent to th' Sacred Ground,</l>
               <l>Which Envy guards, and all new-Comers wounds:</l>
               <l>Sees many when they are arriv'd so high,</l>
               <l>They seem to grasp at Fame, and touch the Sky.</l>
               <l>Whilst swell'd with Vanity they all deride;</l>
               <l>Stumbling themselves upon the Rock of Pride:</l>
               <l>By some more silent Traveller are crost,</l>
               <l>Thrown from the Top, and all their Hopes are lost.</l>
               <l>But let not this discourage, nor amaze</l>

Praise is the sprightly Wine of growing Fame,</l>
               <l>Adding most Life to the most fertile Brain;</l>

               <l>A truly humble Mind knows what is just,</l>
               <l>When he seeks Praise through Vanity, or Thirst.</l>

               <l>Poems are seldom for the Authors writ,</l>

Let's see the charming nature of this Love,</l>
               <l>Which does the Character of Christians prove,</l>
               <l>What in its self, to what our Hearts 'twould move.</l>
               <l>This his Command our Saviour marks for new,</l>
               <l>Not that its first Foundations there we view;</l>
               <l>But as a Sanction it from him obtains,</l>
               <l>And in each Age from him new Vigor gains:</l>
               <l>Men's Tempers and their Manners this require.</l>
               <l>Tho Love is the most natural Desire,</l>
               <l>Mixt with our Beings, and refreshing found</l>
               <l>In all the Exigencies Life surround,</l>
               <l>The gratefull'st Passion, and most friendly Pow'r,</l>

Disturbance, Torment, and Decay succeed:</l>

               <l>Whence for united Hearts and Souls we pray;</l>
               <l>To this our publick Vows and Reason tend,</l>
               <l>Nature to this seems with full course to bend;</l>
               <l>Yet Sin, and Satan, Nature's dangerous Foes,</l>
               <l>With such Impediments its way oppose,</l>
               <l>That rare's the Love which long continues fair,</l>

How oft on Love does gnawing Envy prey,</l>
               <l>Whose Arbitrary Laws while Men obey,</l>

               <l>And wast those Bowels, which they thus contract!</l>
               <l>How oft does he whom Benefits have bound,</l>
               <l>Think the meer owning them would Honour wound!</l>
               <l>How oft Suspicion breeds ill-natur'd Leav'n!</l>
               <l>How oft an Injury receiv'd or giv'n!</l>
               <l>To hurt one whom you hate, 's thought less unjust,</l>
               <l>Than one who in your Friendship places trust:</l>
               <l>And thence, to colour 'ore the wrong you do,</l>
               <l>Your injur'd Friend is held for constant Foe.</l>

Tho they're great Instances that Love is frail;</l>
               <l>Yet ought our Saviour's Precept to prevail:</l>
               <l>Who from his Brother does his Love withdraw,</l>
               <l>In that's a Traytor to the Christian Law.</l>

               <l>Wilt thou resist Command so absolute?</l>
               <l>Command, good Lord! effectually command,</l>
               <l>And grant I be not able to withstand.</l>
               <l>Atthy Command from the rude formless heap,</l>
               <l>Beauty and pleasing Order forth did leap;</l>
               <l>From Void came Solids, and from Nothing All,</l>
               <l>The Winds and raging Seas obey thy call.</l>
               <l>Thou dost the madness of the People quell;</l>
               <l>So tame my Heart! that there sweet Love may dwell:</l>

With his Example Christ this Precept binds,</l>
               <l>To imitate his Love would raise our Minds.</l>
               <l>Under the Jewish Institutes, we see</l>
               <l>Provision made for Love's Sincerity;</l>
               <l>Yet much the Duty wanted of its weight,</l>
               <l>When Self-Love only was to set the rate;</l>
               <l>Who makes in loving others this his bound,</l>
               <l>To come far short of Duty will be found:</l>
               <l>Themselves indeed all Men sincerely love,</l>
               <l>Blind and imprudent, yet that Love does prove;</l>
               <l>Fondly indulging unrestrain'd Desires,</l>
               <l>Men think they answer what that Law requires,</l>
               <l>Flatter themselves, and blow up Nature's Fires;</l>
               <l>And this they think is justice to their Friend,</l>
               <l>When nothing's more perfidious in the end:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99117:21"/>
Nothing more dangerously insinuates Vice,</l>
               <l>To which that mask of Friendship does entice.</l>
               <l>Sin in Self-Love thus propagates the Sin;</l>
               <l>Hence was a nobler Rule justly brought in.</l>
               <l>How to love others, ask not Flesh and Blood,</l>
               <l>Too often leading you from what is good;</l>
               <l>But let Christ's Love to you, your Pattern be,</l>
               <l>Contemplate that for Manner, and Degree:</l>
               <l>Let your Affections in that order lye,</l>
               <l>By that the Errors mend, Defects supply.</l>
               <l>See what Christ's Love to us does recommend,</l>
               <l>The Choice he made, the Measure, and the End.</l>
               <l>Choice did I say? 'twas rather without Choice;</l>
               <l>In that both High and Low, All, may rejoice.</l>
               <l>Tho weak and indigent, ungrateful too,</l>
               <l>He lov'd, nor doubt my Soul! but he lov'd you.</l>
