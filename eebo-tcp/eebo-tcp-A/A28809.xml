            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56001:8"/>
I would have been more exact and diligent in my observations) yet gave him some content chiefly (I thinke) with a book I lent him to take a Copy of the writing of the priests or religious men there, which Master Doctor <hi>Gouch</hi> told me was the antient writing of the Egyptians in Hierogliphycks or Characters of strange shapes like beasts, foules, wormes, serpents, &amp;c. or like unto utinsels or tooles of labouring men in severall Vocations, which having perused and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out, he returned to me againe with thanks. Secondly, about six or seaven yeares past, the Honourable <hi>Endimion Porter</hi> and that noble well affected Gentleman Captaine <hi>Iohn Bond,</hi> to that Plantation desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to give them some of my observations in writing (it being at that time when as the right Honourable the Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honourable persons intended to perswade Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that businesse, which no doubt had he performed, would have been more effectuall to Gods glory, more advantage and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and beneficiall unto himselfe and brethren then to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance a civill war in this Kingdome so much at all times respective to him and his family) which though more rudely and more defective for want of my papers lost, I performed, was acceptably of them also received (with the Booke formerly mentioned, which they presented to his Majesty as a present of some respect) and though the Booke was grosly charactared and bound up by the salvages, yet it cost me the price of six or eight fat Oxen: I also gave Master <hi>Porter</hi> some of the salvages weapons as darts, and a long knife about two foot long the blade and haft together, much of an equall length, and also a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious India painted Bow and Arrowes, with a Quiver lined with crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Velvet, for all which they offered to bring me to his Majesty to kisse his hand, but I denied not thinking my present worthy so great an honour, and therefore desired to be excused. Thirdly, because I understand that M. <hi>Walter Hamond</hi> Chirurgion, who was at the same time of my last being at Madagascar with us in company, hath lately written a booke of the worthinesse of that Country and the benefit thereof to the incouragement of adventurers, and dedicated the same to the noble Gentleman Captaine <hi>Iohn Bond</hi> (which yet I have not seene) I have (for the reasons premised) adventured to take in hand to deliver my opinion in writing to publike view (though rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) and farre inferiour in such abilities to that honest able person ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Hamond,</hi> to the further incouragement of the worthy adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and planters that shall thinke good to adventure their purses and

persons in that right worthy and famous action (which peradventure I may hit upon such incouragements by way of Trade or act of Commerce (more proper to my vocation) as may give more incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for the proceedings herein then in any other already setled in the parts of America: for as our English proverbe hath it, That there is no service like to the service of a King, nor no fishing compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the fishing in the Sea.

of England to other plantations in America, as farre distant (if I be not deceived) from England as that Country is from India or further. That I may give such advice and incouragement as my weake capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shall conceave, I will descend to some particulars.</p>

The Countries scituation under the Tropick of Capricorne the healthfulnesse of the Country, Augustines bay a chiefe and excellent harbour for multitude of ships, the pleasantnesse and fertility of the Country, a second land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan or a Paradice of the world, the Portugals rich trade to Mussambeg on the coast of Malindia.</head>
               <p>ANd first to the scituation of the place, I mean Augustine Bay, the cheife harbour in that Iland, it is seated and placed neare the Tropick of Capricorne, in 23 degrees of South Latitude. The Country is (as all those parts so neare the Line are) hot, but yet in my opinion not so hot as Surrat in India, which lyeth in 21 degrees north latt. neare the tropick of Cancer, during my abode there above three moneths, in Iune, Iuly, August and September, 1630. I could ever indure to weare an English suit, and that of cloth, which I could never so well brooke in India, and is of so healthfull condition or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, that in almost foure moneths of our abode there, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 460 persons in two ships the Charles and the Ionas, we did not bury one man in all that time (nor to my knowledge) was there any sicke, and besides the Company we met with foure ships out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land at that place, which continued with us making merry, refreshing and feasting about three weekes, in which ships could not be lesse (by my computation) then 600 men at least, and also another ship that came with us out of India, and abode with us a longer time, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from us to returne into India three or foure dayes or some short time before the English fleet came in, containing in her 150 men, yet not one of all these great numbers dyed or were sicke during their abode there to my best remembrance. That haven that we all anchored in is called Augustines Bay, a very large and safe harbour for Shipping (which skilfull seamen can discribe better then my selfe) and may containe (by report of some) 1000 or more or many hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red saile of ships in good and sure hold for Anchoring, of great depth within a bow shoot of shore or thereabouts. The Country about the Bay is pleasant to the view, replenished with brave woods, rockie hils
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56001:9"/>
of white marble and low fertile grounds: what is within the land I can say little having never beene above a mile from the sea side, but many of our men which have stragled further have given their good report thereof, as also the fame and report of others that have either read or heard of the riches of this Country, that the same aboundeth with mines of Gold and Silver and other minerals: moreover that in the Island is a large plaine or champion country of Meadow or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture ground as big as all England: which if it be so, which I am some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtfull of for the large extent, yet without question very large in many places, must by reasonable consequence afford multitude and variety of Foules and Beasts and other creatures for food, cloathing, necessary use and delight, and no doubt but such low grounds afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth also store of large and small Rivers, Tanks and Ponds replenished with multitude of good Fish, water Fowles, &amp;c. and it is apparently manifest or very probable by the quantity of brave fat Oxen, Cowes, Sheepe and Goats brought downe and fold unto us by the natives for refreshing so many people, that the Country is very fertile, selling us brave fat Oxen for about eight, nine or tenne pence an Oxe, worth by computation in England, six, seven, eight, or tenne pounds an Oxe, and after that rate for Goats and Sheepe or a little dearer, they sold also good Capons for three halfe pence or two pence a peece, and excellent good Orenges and Lemmons reasonable, and the common men dranke good store of Milke (though out of their Callibasses not very cleanly) (the Bay or creeke neare the Bay) affordeth us store of excellent Fish of many sorts as Pikes, Mullets, Breames and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others which I cannot call to minde their names: and shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish, as Crawfish, Shrimps, Prawnes and some Lobsters and some Oysters, and sure the place affordeth abundance and variety of shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish of strange sorts, as appeareth by the aboundant divers shapes of of their shels curious to behold, and the shels of esteeme in England, by <hi>Iohn Tredescant</hi> and Master <hi>Slade</hi> dwelling about Lambeth, who treasured up such to please curious people, and to adornish rocks and water-workes in gardens of great persons, of which sort Master <hi>Slade</hi> had of me (gratis) some quantity. And without all question, this Country farre transcends and exceeds all other Countries in Asia, Affrica and America, planted by English, French, Dutch, Portugall and Spaniards: and is likely to prove of farre greater value and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme to that Christian Prince and Nation that shall plant and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a sure habitation therein, then the West Indies is to the King and

This Island of Madagascar is about nine hundred miles in length. There is many Kings upon this Island, the south part of it lies in 25 degrees and 35 min. and the northerne part short of the equinoctiall the inhabitants goes handsome in their accoutrements, and speake the Arabian Tongue, and they have Juncks which they Trade to and fro to the foure Islands which lies about thirty leagues off, viz, Joanna, Malalo, Combro and the Majottes: and to the Coasts of Malindia. The Island of Saint Laurence is a gallant place for to have a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine or Randezvouze, for the Coast of Malindia lies off this Island forty or fifty leagues. The Portugals hath a great fortification at Mussambeg therein, and upon these coasts the Portugals get most of their riches, and drives all their Trade in India, otherwise it was impossible for them to hold out so long, because of their great losse both by the English and Dutch. The Portugals drives such a gallant Trade upon this Coast from 26 degrees south latitude to 3 degrees north latitude, they get great store of Gold, Elephants teeth, Wax, Amber-greece and divers sorts of rich Gums and comodities, which cost the Portugals a very small matter, for they trade with Knives, Bels, Pentathoes, Barbars-aprons, course Calicoes, looking-glasses, &amp;c. I have been taking of a Juncke twenty eight yeeres since which came from this coast of Malindia, laden with Elephants teeth, Amber-greece and rich Gums. The Portugals comming from Mussambeg
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56001:10"/>
and bound for India, they alwayes touch at the Island of Saint Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and there they buy slaves for their plantation. I have beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout seaventeen yeeres since taking of a Junck which was laiden with slaves of both sexes and Sandall wood which came from Mussambeg and so to Saint Laurence and their laden, and bound for Goa, as we found by a Portugall passe.</p>
               <p>If I may be worthy to advice, after a trade is once setled at Madagas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, what a brave gallant trade may be had upon the coast of Malindia three or foure smal ships may be imployed all the yeere long, coasting and trading along the coast from 26 degree south latitude to 3 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees north latitude, and putting off course Indian commodities may lade your ship with rich Commodities much acceptable and venda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in those parts, so that you need not to carry any Mony out of England into India.</p>

This said coast of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindia is neare adjoyning to Madagascar: likewise there is above 1500 Tuns of Wax yeerely which is brought from the coast of Malindia to India which is in great request, rich Gums and divers sorts of Drugs, also the Portugals bring great store of very sine Gold and Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greece from Mussambeg to Goa.</p>
               <p>So that all the world may understand what rich Trade the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall hath on the coast of Malindia, and hath for this many hundreds of yeares maintained a very strong Garrison at Mussambeg, for their is 100 peeces of Ordnance in their Castle. I am confident the richest and best trade the Portugall hath in Asia cannot parallel this on the coast of Malindia, furthermore if Saint Laurence Island had once a plantation set led, what a brave gallant place of commerce there would be: for this Island doth stand in the very Center of the World for trade, ye may build small ships, for their is good store of Timber, for the Natives doe build Juncks of 200 Tuns a peece at the northermost part of this Island.</p>
               <p>The Country people do love and much affect our Nation. And one <hi>Andrew Pela</hi> who is one of their Kings living neere the bay of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine (did offer both to Captaine <hi>Weddle</hi> and my selfe, if we would come and live with them, that they would let us have so much land that would serve or maintaine one hundred thousand men) we had this King aboard the ship Charles and made much of him, and gave him a present at his returne. In this Kings discourse we found how cruell the Portugals had beene to them, comming a shore and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, women and children perforce away: they cannot indure the Portugals, telling me how they did betray them with pictures.</p>
               <p>At any time when our seamen doe shew a picture for to trucke for a sheepe or the like, they will start backe and run away crying out, Portugals, Portugals, Portugals, for they cannot indure Images. But at the northermost part of this Island, there were Priests and Fryers which did live with them for a time, thinking to convert them: the King of that place departed this life, the Natives of that Country put
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56001:11"/>
the Fryers and Priests to death, telling them the reason before they put them to death, because they were religious men, that they must prepare themselves to dye, for to keepe the King company to God, this trick they put upon the Portugals for they are generally hated, I dare say no man can give a better or perfecter account then my self, I have failed round about this Island, and have been a shore five seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times, and for the commerce I was the man that did deale for all (or whom I should appoint in my absence) because we would keepe to our price and not to under rate our dainty commodities, which is the long Cornelions: which five or six doe purchase an Oxe worth here in England ten twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen or sixteen pounds an Oxe, fifteen good Sheepe for the value of nine pence; I have caused the Steward of the ship to weigh the rump of a sheepe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was slayed and it weighted thirty pounds odde ounces.</p>

               <p>There is good store of refreshing, Fish, Flesh, and Foule, I gave leave to one of our men to lye a shore one night, for to kill foule that comes to roost towards the evening in the woods, he killed 35 wilde Turkies in one night, for there is great store of wilde fowle, the place is very healthfull, I have been there when we have come out of Europe, five ships together, we have landed at the bay 80 sicke men, and about 40 of them was lifted in blankets out of the ships into the boats and so carryed a shore, for they were not able to goe nor stand, and after they had been but three dayes a shore, they were all wel and able both to goe and run, and at this bay I have been many times, there is good watering and wooding that our carpenters did cut downe good timber and sawed and made both planks and boards, which was used aboard our ships, I have been seven miles up in the land from the bay. I did present Mr. <hi>Endimion Porter</hi> with some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties which I got at this bay of St. Augustines (viz) Turtle shelles which he promised to make himselfe combes with them, also I gave him some dragons blood and divers sorts of other gumes, after which he sent his coach for me and carryed me to the Councell board, and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was there at that time, and I did deliver my opinion at that time (and since) which businesse was concluded upon and past

               <p>Sr. <hi>Maurice Abbot,</hi> Alderman <hi>Garway,</hi> and foure more of the East India Company did oppose this businesse of Madagascar at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell board, saying this Island was very unhealthfull, which I, Mr. <hi>Iohn Cartwright</hi> and <hi>Bartholmew Churchman</hi> did justifie, that the said Island of St. Laurence was the healthfullest place in the world, and the East India company were blamed for disparaging this Island, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Northern part of this Island is brave good ground and grasse, and better harbour for shipping then Augustine bay, and there is the best commodities to be had. Rice, Sugar great store, Coconuts, Plantans, Pomgranets, Woshee, which we call in India Toddy, and fine good building for their houses, and fine traffack to and fro with their Junks; I have failed two daies and a halfe about three or foure leagues from the shore, we sounded &amp; we had twelve fathoms water, we sailed in this two dayes and halfe two hundred and thirteen miles, from the northermost part towards the southern part of this Island; &amp; in this distance it did appear to be curious dainty pasture ground, green and full of trees, and fine low levell grounds: this I will justifie upon my credit; likewise there do lie off this Island many small spots, rocks and small Islands, between St. Laurence Island and Mauricious; and there is a great current which doth set you to the westward.</p>

Their Haranga or Cornelion beads, they weare about their necks and in their eares, stringed so long that they reach below their brests, or lower, according to their abilities, some having more choyce clear red cornelion then others, whereof in their bargains they are very choyce to pick out the most clearest &amp; freest from spots; their hayre both of men and women is decently cut, and formed not much unlike to our Cavalero fashion at present in England, short before, long on the sides and longest of al behinde, which both short and long being platted or breaded as gentle women, hath their haire in three plats, becometh them well, and they have on the tops of their heads a parcell of haire almost or about halfe a foot long standing upright by tying or rowling it about with a thred or silke, or some kind of string.</p>
               <p>Their weapons are darts of severall sorts, some biger and some lesser, some broad and pointed like lances, and some lesser bearded like fish hooks or broad arrow heads; which the smaller that are bearded I have seen them darth fish swimming in a shallow place of the sea near the shore, and by a line tied to their dart drawn them up out of the water; they also have knives long and narrow but not fit to stab withall but rather to cut withall as a bill, but of these I saw not many, not above two or three, but of darts some men may and doe carry with them of both sorts halfe a dozen or there abouts, but few that carry aboue one two or three which are not dangerous, unlesse at a neer distance, and yet cannot come with that violence or swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse but may be avoyded by stepping aside or by putting by with a staffe or the like; and their bodies being naked are subject to all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance of the like or better armes of offence. There heads being uncovered and the mornings cold untill about eight of the clocke or later, they hover together about fires which they quickly kindle, by taking of a small round stick no bigger then a tobacco pipe, at the middle or thicker end, which set with one end upon a broad piece of wood or chip, and rowling the longer round stick hard in the palmes of their hands upon the other piece of the wood the heat thereof pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently kindleth fire, which with other dry combustible stuffe ready at

hand they kindle a fire to warme them, or to dresse their meat, which is very slovenly, taking it cut out of an Oxe, with the head of a great dart (with which they will quarter an Oxe presently, and hit the joynts so justly as it is not to be conceived, unlesse a man saw it) and lay their pieces a little upon the coales, and eat it better halfe raw, and full of ashes, yet some I think they seeth, for I have seen among them a kind of pots or kettles, which whether of earth or mettall (being very black) I cannot tell, for I never handled them, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made in the Country or brought unto them by Portugalls or some heathen nation is uncertain. The fat or suet of their cattell they save, and the better sort of them rub their heads and haire every morning therewith, which lieth in lumps upon them untill the heat of the Sun melt it, and then it moystneth their heads and discendeth over their bodies, which they also grease or annoint, and those of the better sort that doe so their bodies are smooth, plump and decent, but strong of smell, and they that want that meanes are the poorer sort or slaves among them have their bodies of an ill aspect, dry and scurvy, parched with the Suns heat, and feeding more hard and coursly, (of what we know not but of durty gutts or puddings) have their bellies swolne as if they had the dropsy: and though they have good store of fat cattell yet the poorer sort of people are very hungry, for they will lye about our tents and gather up the worst scraps we cast away, and in their Cannowes will lie about the ships calling out for Tellahenna and Tellaffunga (as I take it meat and bread) which the mariners and others for their disport will fling them out neats feet which they regard not, and dry marrow bones or the like which will speedily sink, for which they will suddainly leape out of their boats and dive a great depth after them and bring them up in one hand, their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowes or boats are made of one piece of timber long and narrow like a hogs trough, upon the upper part whereof they fasten two sticks a crosse, their boats half a yard or more from each end, about two yards long or longer, and upon each side to meet with the ends of these staves or sticks they fasten two more which stay up their boats from overturning and doe so leake that they sit in water, and continually ladeth out water, and one or two more sit therein with little paddles not much bigger then shittle cockbattle-dores to row with all.</p>
               <p>They make little use of labour or manufactures, and those of small value, I have seen a carpenter (for so I may term him) making a Cannow or a boat of a piece of timber like a hogs trough (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said)

having no better a toole then a little axe, such as children or youth may play withall, the Iron or bit thereof not above two inches bread which must needs make long labour. I have also seen a Smith at work to make dart heads in a strange manner, having no other toole that I could see but only a stone for the anvill and an other for his hammer; and for his bellowes two hollow canes about three quarters of a yard long, and about the thicknesse and roundnesse of a mans legge or thigh, which being placed together close to a little fire, with small holes to let the winde out at the bottome; they had to drive the winde out two staves like churme staves, wrapt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout halfe the length of the staves at the bottome, with a sheepes or goats skin the wool side outward, (like a spunge as gunners at sea use to wipe their guns and make them cleane) which being lifted up and pressed downe againe forces out the winde as aforesaid. And also as I remember I saw one weaving as if it had been our poore people or beggers in England, sitting in high wayes weaving course tape, so he weaved narrow striped stuffes of cotton yearn about a quarter of a yard broad, which I suppose they sew two or three breadths together to make coverings for the better sort of people their shame or naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

I have also seen some at one time knawing and suck green Sugar-canes, which is a certainty that Sugar-canes grow there, and perhaps quantity of Sugar may be made thereof, and no doubt but vines are in the Country, for I have seen some wilde Vines growing upon the rockie hills in Augustine Bay, some of our people have said that they have heard it from the Portugals that the Country doth afford Pepper and other Spices, which our English also doe assume who have been far within the land, failing some dayes journey in a large navigable River, where they met as they reported many people offering them cattell for a halfe or one forth part the price we paid for them at Augustine Bay, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving shewed the Natives Pepper, Cloves, Mace and Nutmegs, they

made shew to them of store in that Country, certaine daies journey or nights sleepes distant, by winking and putting their heads under their hands, and pulling them back againe, they report also of large plaine pastures and medowes replenished with cattell of all sorts, Beeves, Sheepe and Goats feeding thereon, and without all question the Country lying in or near the same degree of Lattitude or distance form the Line as India, doth produce the same fruits, as Coco-nuts Plantans Musk-millions and other pleasant Millions as great as our English Pumpeons, and also the Toddy trees which produce as good liquors as white wine and sugar, with which in regard of the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof in India, our English &amp; Dutch Marriners drink so much of it as to be often drunk or foxed therewith. The Country extends it self in length from about II &amp; halfe degrees south lat. to 26 degrees.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56001:15"/>
touching their manner of Idolatry or devilish Worship and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which some of our people conceives was rather to the Devil (not to hurt them) then to God; but I am not altogether of their opinion, but rather think the contrary, by their feasting and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a little before our departure, as a kind of thanksgiving to their Idol God or Gods, for the benefit they accrewed by the trading they had with us, and praying for our prosperity and often return as some were opinionated, the circumstance I will declare as brief as I can and as my memory doth best serve me; one morning the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges killed an Oxe (and I doe not remember that I did see or heare that during our abode there that they killed many other) and a post about eight or nine foot high was set up near their booths upon which the head and hornes of the Bullock were placed and the post all dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with the blood thereof &amp; the Oxe cut out and divided among the better sort of them and eaten halfe raw and half broyled upon coales and full of ashes, and whether before or after their feast (for I have forgotten) they came out of the woods from their booths into a plaine a bow shoot or two from their habitation, where were stuck up in a row about 50 or 60 great poles as big as the bigger fort of Hop-poles, all the bark pilled off and made white and were placed by computation about foure yards a funder and between every pole about three foot distance a stone about the bignesse of a great Turnip or Apple placed in a streight row and in the middle of the poles a crosse pole layed about a yard or an ell high whereon they hanged all or many of their Chains of Beads or Haranga and neer unto having their Alter of Beades (as I termed it) before them sat all the Ancient Men Women and Children, and on the other side of the Alter and poles was two Companies of young men about 20 or 30 or more in a company, each having a dart in his hand and ranked as I take it by three in a ranke or row, each Company being distant from the other about 4 or 5 roddes or more, being thus set in a comly posture they sang and danced keeping even strole and action with their feet and hands according to their tune, (as I have seen in a market Towne in the Country where I was borne, divers Gentlemen, &amp;c. associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together having for their pleasure a noyse of Musitions play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them with every one a cipresse hatband (then in fashion) put over their faces dance the measures through the Market, and chiefest streets in the town, (and so into an Inne and Tavern to make merry together,) these Salvages keeping as even measure proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably

to their sound or singing as the other doe to their musicke.</p>
               <p>And in many postures of their dancing they would make shew of fight or defiance one company against the other, presenting their darts against each other, and sometimes againe of a suddaine both sides gathering themselves into a round ring and laying their heads together as at a consultation, and then suddenly againe fall into their posture of danceing as decently as a company of trained Souldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their severall postures, and each party had of their side a Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sounding with a confused harsh noise, a large crooked Rams horn.</p>
               <p>Their Priests(as I call them of one which I bought a book as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned) laying their fore fingers upon one of the strange shapes or characters therein, would preach or read a lecture or homily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that text a good space, and then remove his finger to another, this feasting dancing or sacrificing was upon a sudden dissolved by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the multitude of our men on shoare who hearing of these sports, came flocking thither apace to see them, but the Salvages fearing (as I conceive) least our men should rob them againe of their Haranga, which they prized as deare as we doe Diamonds and other rich Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; tooke them all from their Alter and departed againe to their tents or booths and so this exercise ended: yet a word or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their justice or punishing of offenders, their chiefe Captain or Commander had lost out of his booth some of his Jewels which were found stollen by a young maide or girle belonging to an other man either his daughter or slave, the Father or Master of the maide to cleare himselfe as innocent of the fact, tooke his lance or great dart and presently slew the girle (surely it was not his owne daughter but rather his slave, else though a Barbarian, he could not have been so cruell to his owne flesh and blood); and this may give some testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that they have some kind of government or law among them: but yet they are adicted to theft and robbery, is againe apparent; for when they met our men in the woods although they did them no harme, yet they would search their pockets for beads and rob them of them, and yet bring them downe to their ships when they could not well tell how to finde the way.</p>
               <p>And my selfe standing among our ships Pursers and others, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cattell for the ships provision, and having a chaine of beads in my hand, a young man snacht at them to have gotten them from me but mist of his purpose and ran away, but one of our men in company standing by shot an arrow after him but mist him, and we never saw his face again.</p>

are somewhat difficult at present to reade, being 14 yeares agoe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in such imperfect Manuscript.</p>
               <p>Yet I thought it not amisse to penn downe what I have lately found, which with the helpe of others especially of one <hi>William Casey</hi> late Purser of an Indian ship, who took more paines therin then my selfe (if his papers can be found) will give some light therein to the helpe of others that will endeavour to attaine the knowledge thereof; the particulars which I have now found I will here manifest so well as I can.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Great incouragement to the plantation, the cheapenesse of cloathing or appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell to be bad out of India for the use of the planters, the rich attire for persons of quality to be had there exceeding cheape, all sorts of hearbs roots fruits and foules to be bad in plentifull abundance in Madagascar, trees yeelding great store of pleasant liquor nothing inferiour to wine and sugar in England, the excellent vertue of India Mirabolins.</head>
               <p>TO the furtherance of this renowned plantation, these advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous comodities, benefits, and accommodation as fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth (far above other plantations) are inducements sufficient to perswade pious virtuous rich men and others that desire the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Gods glory, the honour of their Soveraigne Prince the the welfare of their owne native Country, the inrichment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their posterity and the charitable reliefe of Gods poore E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect upon Earth to enterprize this worthy action.</p>
               <p>And in the first place the Country is healthfull and pleasant, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly its already of it selfe furnished with most chiefe things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to sustenance of mans life, especially, Beefe Mutton Goates Poultry Fish and Fowle. Thirdly it affordeth Oxen for present til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage (the chiefest of all wants in all other plantations) which no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath done or affordeth. Forthly it is as near or nearer to India then other plantations to England, where all things either for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity or superfluity are to be had for the fourth part of the price, and lesse then in England, or other Christian Kingdomes; as Rice and excellent dainty food (as it is cookt in India) whereof Kings and great men daily eate with pleasure and contentment and never furset therein; Wheat Barley and other sorts of graine and good rack, and excellent strong drinke made of Rice, which mixed with Sugar, water and Leamonds or surrop of lymes, or drunk alone, all which are to be had exceeding cheape, with all manner of spices make,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56001:17"/>
a pleasant, wholesome drinke, surpassing any wine to be had in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of which good use may be made (though water there is more contentfull, it being so good and better then in England) untill beere made of mault by barly may be brought to perfection which may suddenly be affected as I shall shew hereafter.</p>
               <p>Also from India may be had cloathing fit for those warme Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to maintaine a man or woman neately comely and cleanly for twenty shillings a yeare and under, nay I dare make it good for ten shillings a yeare, bedding exceeding cheape and dainty either for cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton wooll, or silke cotton, far better and more desired then fether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, or down-beds, and coverlids (whereof in those warme countries they vse but few) of all prizes and curiosities even fine dainty quilts for five shillings a piece, sheets and all sorts of linnen so cheape and fine that no part of the World affords the like. Againe good shirts whiter and finer for meane people at-eight ten or twelve pence a piece, and cheaper, and not so fine and white to be had in England for three or foure times dearer in price (my selfe have worne no other these sixteen yeeres of which six of three shillings a piece have lasted me continually three yeeres together, of the like finenesse not to be bought under twelve shillings a shirt or dearer in England, shooes of English fashion for sixpence a paire, and bootes for two shillings a paire, capps or mountei<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s light and easie, and farre better then stiffe heavie hats made of sattin and taffaty, fine painted linnen, &amp;c. quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or inbroydered much cheaper then hats.</p>
               <p>The better sort of people that affect to cloath themselves, wives and children in rich gentile fashion, may doe it of sattin taffaty wrought damaske blacke, or coloured, and rich stuffes mixt with gold &amp; silver threed: at cheaper rates then with our cheape English cloath or stuffes. Jewels of all sorts, Pearls Diamonds and other rich stones with curious bracelets for Gentlewomen; and others of Christall ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, Jasper, Cornelion, red and white, and Elutropian stones, &amp;c. cheape, with rings and pendants of the same, so cheape that I have sold that in England (to be sold againe by Exchange men and Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths) for five or ten shillings a ring or pendant which have not cost me in India above a penny or two pence per ring or pendant; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Estredges feathers, for womens fannes or for use of Gentlemen, Captaines, Souldiers, and other uses, &amp;c. with curious paper or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fannes guilded and painted; with brave Cabanets of Ivory, Ebony, and Sandall wood, &amp;c. artificially inlayed with mother of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56001:18"/>
pearle, Aggets and other stones and Ivory, so cheape as cannot be imagined, with all dainty purfumes of Civic, Muske, Amber-grease (and rose water in abundance) extraordinary cheape; which I hope will induce Lords, Ladies, Knights Gentlemen, Gentlewomen, Farmers, Artificers and Manufactors to put on a resolution to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe a pleasant easie votage of three or foure moneths; which Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals, Dutch, Danes, &amp;c. have undertaken, to far remoter parts at great danger and hazard to plant themselves, and in no comparison for profit and pleasure with Madagascar or Saint Laurence. I pray God the Kings Majesty and the State of this Kingdome may take it into speedy consideration, least they be prevented by some other Nation (who no doubt have curious eyes and intents to this designe) as of late the right honourable the Earle of Southampton, and the noble Gentleman Mr. <hi>Iohn Craven,</hi> brother to the right honourable the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> who intending to send out ships and Planters to the Island of Mauritious beyond Saint Laurence, and had disbursed many thousand pounds to that intent, yet neglecting speedy oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity the Dutch hearing of their honourable designe made more speedy hast and prevented them, and have now planted in that Island to their great renowne and accommodation (in time) and great losse to those honourable persons and this Nation.</p>
               <p>All sorts of fruits, hearbs, rootes and flowers (of great esteeme in India) of what Nation soever, may be transported thither, and will assuredly grow in so rich and fruitfull grounds, and for more speedy growth; if those transported out of Europe or England saile, at the first for want of skill to preserve the seed &amp;c. in regard of the length of the voiage, yet those out of India (not above one fourth part of the way) may be brought good both to sow or to plant, as rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish, lettice, carrets, turnips, onions, and mustard seed, and many other of moreworth then these in England. And no doubt but this Island affords (if not may easily be transported thither) those excellent trees for good and pleasant liquor, drink, as Toddy and Palmito trees, which trees distill, by art taken from them plenty of excellent drinke, no way inferiour if not better then white wine and sugar, especially the Palmito wine; but the Toddy wine (except some of the best sort) tasteth as if it did come out of Hornes, &amp; therefore (if not there already) may be transported the Coco nut tree, which yeeldeth a nut as big as a childs head, whose kernell is excellent meate, and of that fruite is made also oile, vinegar and other dainties, and the tree it self
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56001:18"/>
yeelds threed or yarne fine and course, to make ropes, cordage, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for ships and many other uses. There may be also had many other trees of excellent fruits as Mirabolins, and Plantans, which our English tearm them Apples of paradice, wherewith the Serpent beguiled Eve, the Mirabolins and Plantans from the trees are farre dantier in tast then our Apricocks, and what they are preserved, are well known to Confectioners and Phisitions, for health and pleasure. The Plantan growes by clusters as a too or more or lesse together, as big as a large beane cod, and is so pleasant in tast, cutting it in small pieces, as parsnips to butter, men use to eate it continually at meales, with viniger, pepper and salt, to abate the sweetnesse, and the tree being about the bignesse of a reasonable Apple tree, beares no boughs but great leaves an ell long, or longer, and both leaves and body are excellent meat for Cowes, for the body is no harder then a well growne cabbidge, and may be cut downe by a good sword at a blow; two or three, my selfe have cut down many at Moalala to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the ship, to feed cattell that we bought their to preserve.</p>
               <p>There is five sorts of Mirabolins the one is like our Apricocks or great plum,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> his intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> the stone is eight square, it is an excellent preserve and in great request, and sells very deare in Persia and elsewhere, the other foure sorts is used in phisicke, the Doctors and Drugsters can tell the severall names, vertue and quality concerning the foure elements of mans body, in India there is some of these Marabolins worth fifty or a hundred pound a piece, which holding in the parties hand which is sicke, will cure him of his disease suddenly or forthwith, either of the bloody flux and feaver and two other diseases which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
               <p>Now for to make it appeare, the curious vertue of these foure sorts of Marabolins which cures diseases holding them in the hand is thus; at the time of the yeare when they prune or lop their trees they doe cut off all the branches and boughs only one sprig left, and it is a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one that the tree heares, for if one tree beares, a hundred will not but die, but commonly one in a hundred will beare: but one or two Mirabolins at the most will grow upon that one sprig of the tree, for all the vertue doth grow out of the tree into one or two Mirabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, which are of the bignesse of an Apple which will cure severall diseases holding of one of these Mirabolins in the hand of the party which is sick. This is very true and certaine, which divers Banian Doctors and Brachmans hath told me, they are very deare and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56001:19"/>
scarce for to be had: for great men in the Country doe buy them, if any of our English Doctors did but know the vertue of these great Mirabolins, they would be worth a thousand pounds a piece and it would be a present for a King.</p>
               <p>But for the foure small sorts of Mirabolins are in great plenty in India and very cheape, for I bought three thousand weight after the rate of a sarthing a pound, and sold them here in England for three shillings foure pence a pound by the great, which the Drugsters sells them for six shillings, eight pence per pound. I do believe their be divers trees of Mirabolins which doe grow on the Island of St. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or else they may be easily planted, by reason the clymat doth agree with India: for their be many sorts of trees, and plants, which grow in the Island of Madagascar which do grow in India; and equal of raste and goodnesse.</p>
               <p>The defect of Cammels, Horses, Asses, Mules, Elephants, Bussels, and Persia sheepe (of high esteem in India,) may have their race or breed from Persia, and bred up in Saint Laurence; and (a more rich and fruitfull Country) will yeeld a great price in India and brought to Saint Laurence by English or Indian shipping at cheape rates, a Horse in Persia, to be bought for 567 or 8 pounds is worth in India 20 30 40 50 or 60 pounds or more, according as they prove.</p>

               <p>THe Persia sheepe are of great price in India, and their skins are as soft as silke, and curiously curled, of mixt colour blacke and white, inclining to gray, are of great esteem in Christian cold Countries, I saw the Palsgrave or Prince Elector sitting at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in winter with his Majesty King Charles, having his coate lined with them, whereupon I sent to a friend in Persia to send me a few who sent me seven, which cost there about sixteen shillings a piece, which M. <hi>Ganthorne</hi> the Kings Furrier seeing, would needs buy them

And Saint Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Oxen (especially white) to be bought there for twelve pence per piece or there abouts, would yeild in India the larger sort twenty pounds per piece; my selfe had a couple of white Oxen in India to draw my Coach, for which I refused 45 pounds, and the tallow and skins of these Oxen to be transported for England costing nothing there, will redound to great profit of the planters. These Oxen and Cowes both of India and Saint Laurence, have bunches upon or between their shoulders, like Camm<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">

The flesh of these Oxen is daintier and more pleasant than ours, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as white as veale: if a race of our English breed (and young calves) be carried thither they will there mightily improve, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their hornes, farre in beauty exceeding those in India, &amp;c. and white will no question but out sell the Indian breed, especially if of Lancashire or the adjacent counties their breed; Hoggs they have plenty out of India for little or nothing, if the country affordeth none, for they regard them not accompting them polluted. But Turkies from England bred in Saint Laurence and their breed carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into India would be of great esteem, whereof many have assaid to transport, but failed either for want of good room to keepe them in, or by negligent attendance, or kild to make meat for sick or dainty people in the voyage, yet in an English fleete that we met with at Saint Laurence at our returne from India, I saw three or foure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served alive, Rabbots and Pidgeons would doe well to be transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for breed; but for Pidgeons India will afford store. And gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den pease and beanes and others, with oates and tares is not amisse to be transported for plantation, and would be of great esteem in India. Butter and Cheese to be made at Saint Laurence would be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent commodity for India, as well as for the Plantation, and ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: and the country will afford them speedily Cowes enough to

make it; but some may alleadge the country is too hot to make it good, or to make beere, or to powder beefe; all which by art and industry of man I conceive may be holpen, to the furtherance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will make bold to lend my weake advice (with desire of pardon if I erre) but surely had I made another voyage into India, (which malice hath prevented me of) I would have made experience of these things, (and whatsoever I have before or shall hereafter in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course make mention of to that end) first to place a house in the coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest place they can finde and most in shade from the sun, then the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry house on the north or coolest side, under ground or in a vault or celler, paved all with the coolest stones that can be had, and the sides thereof also, and if it be paved with stones from Ormus in Persia (whereof all the houses their are builded,) which stones beaten to powder is excellent good salt, perhaps may be most coole and befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and in the midst thereof a small tanke or pond of running or standing water, if it can be neere a river or well to have the water continually running fresh in though by a small stream, and so issuing out againe the better; if not, it may be done as in India, almost in every house of note, to have water carried in leather sacks or barrels upon Oxens backs, and put into an earthen cistern, and from thence by pipes to issue forth in small streames into the tanke, which if it be lower then the cistern, will be with more case effected. The top off the dairy house to be open, with a lower or open place as a turret or pidgeon house top, so boarded every way with boards standing out at length to catch the winde and drive it downe into their dairy houses to coole it, as the Cattanents (which I thinke the Portugals so call them) to let the aire down into their cheifest roomes for coolenesse, of which I onely saw the fashion at Ormus. And no question but many English who have seen the forme thereof in Spain, Portugall, or other hot countries, can give good direction for the performance thereof.</p>

The accommodation and meanes for dayries, brewing of beere and powdering of meat for the use of ships at sea, the meanes to make Saltpeter cheaper then in India or elsewhere, all sorts of excellent materialls for building to be had in Madagascar, poore artificers may live by their labours in all sorts of manufacture, out strip all Nations of the world for the price of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, trade and commerce to and from Madagascar will exceede in bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit all other.</head>
               <p>THe dairy house (or brew house especially for cooling the wort or liquor) this fitted, then round about the sides thereof lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving passage sufficient to goe between the same and the tanks, shelves or strong board p'anks may be framed to place leaden troughes a foote or halfe a foote deepe, or more or lesse as shall be found most convenient, place ing the troughes halfe an inch or more in ascent or discent with a hole at one end to be stopped and opened at pleasur, to let out water to be put thereinto, with water let their be put a sufficient quantity of Saltpeter proportionable to the troughes or vessels of water. In which troughs or vessels let the dairy woman set their milke pins of Earth, Wood, Brasse or any other mettall, or lead, as shall be found most convenient and necessary, which will keepe their milke and cream so coole or cooler then in the English dayrie houses; The experience whereof I have seen and is well knowne to India Merchants, by cooling of water to drinke, for a a bottle of water set out a little while in a small tub of water cooled with saltpeter, will make the water in the bottle so coole that a man can hardly drinke it, it will be so coole to the teeth almost to make the chops to chatter. And thus I thinke beefe layed in salt in dry vessels of stone lead or other mettall set in saltpeter water, will keepe it so coole, that it may easily take salt; and the coolers for woort in brewing of beere so ordered, may happily also cause good beere to be made, which if it can (as I am confident it may) be brought to passe, will be such an accommodation and benefit to the plantation both for its owne use, and to transport butter and cheese into India, (where it is not good and but of finall quantity, and the country not stored with many Cowes, which maketh it deare, also as deare or dearer then in England at highest rate) and of beefe for victualing of ships to sea as the value will be inestimable.</p>

But concerning salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Beefe it will keepe for three or foure moneths, we have kept it but it will eate very dry, the reason is, because we presse it with weights for to fetch out the blood, otherwise it will not keepe. The best way to keepe and preserve Beefe or Mutton, (is to make it into Jerkins) the flesh and meate which the Indians do carry for their sea store, which is cut in little pieces, like unto steaks, they first salt it a little, and so dry it in the sun, till it be so hard as glew, which will be so hard, and then you may carry it in baskets to sea, and water it about one hower before you boyle it, and it will be so fresh as though it was newly killed. It will keepe twelve moneths at the least, and far better for the healths of mens bodies, this is true to mine owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience.</p>
               <p>Now to answer yet one objection that may be made, that saltpeter is deare, and will be so chargeable, that it will not quit the cost; to which I answer that saltpeter is cheape in India, worth a very small matter a hundred weight<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and will be transported into Saint Laurence for one fourth part or perhaps one eighth part of the charge it costeth by transporting the same in great quantities into England, and salt also is in India good cheape. Yet to lessen the charge thereof, both may be had exceeding cheape made in Saint Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, for my selfe have seen salt naturally made of it selfe, lying in the concaves and hollowes of the rocky Hill in Augustine Bay, which the high water filling those concaves with salt water, and at the ebbe when the Sunne hath power over it hath been converted into salt; moreover it seemed strange unto me, one accident there hapning du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our abode in that country. The English for their recreation had made a parcell of ground by much treading and playing at nine pinns so bare, as a bowling alley or much travelled highway, and one day it chanced to raine, which raine stood in small puddles in some lower places of the alley, which the next day by the heate of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56001:21"/>
the sun was converted into salt, browne as our bay salt here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and that by reason of the saltnesse of the earth in that place so neare the sea, not a bow shoote from the same, which may be occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by overflowing of the same at some times of the yeare in that low ground, and the grasse growing thereon is salt, which for my experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I have also tasted.</p>
               <p>Now if saltpeter may there be made of salt earth (as I take it is in England, which I have seen saltpeter men to tast of, to know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by whether it were for their use or purpose or no,) then assuredly saltpeter may be made there for a trifle, having a dainty brook of of fresh water issuing out of the rock in the bay enough to turne a mill, if such fresh water be usefull for steeping thereof (howsoever for other occasions it's exceeding usefull and in especiall for present use for the businesse before premissed, it issuing out of the rock eight or ten foot high or more, at low water may with ease and small charge be carryed in pipes upon the land, within a stones throw thereof or nearer,) and there saltpeter may be made to send into England much cheaper then out of India, brought down to the Port Town a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand miles and more upon Cammels backes: and being a great deale nearer England, about a fourth part or the way, may be shipt home for lesse fraight, especially by ships to convey planters into that Country, and there they may even at the first returne lade perhaps hides and tallow which will not stand them in a penny, though for many thousands.</p>
               <p>For building in this brave Island there is abundance of good tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and stone, and no doubt but bricke also may be made as well as in India and Persia, where many buildings are made of unburnt brickes dryed only with the heat of the sun. And no doubt but in short time (being planted, diligent skilfull men will finde out there as well as in other the like and not so likely countryes; Mines of Gold, Silver, Brasse, Lead, Iron, Tin and other minerals, with precious and costly drugs for phisicke, and Allowes we made there some; sold in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at six shillings eight pence per pound, and excellent materials for Diers uses and multitude of other commodities that cannot at present be conceived. And the Country being well planted with Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and manufactors will outstrip all others in the world for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures (which though I should grieve to give incouragement to imploy men therein, to the hurt of my native country and to the robbing the poore therein of their labour, yet being wrought there

by our own natives, or by other slaves of Freemen, to the benefit of the English Planters, I do not conceive any wrong done to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and will draw a boundance of poor people into that, and disburden our own of many unnecessary idle vagrant people, which think themselves born for no other use but <hi>Natus consumere fruges,</hi> and and to live upon Industrous mens labours.

               <p>These incouragements already mentioned, may enduce all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and industrious, pious, Charitable men, to take opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to advance this unparaleld project yet much more, that which is yet behinde to expresse, may animate them thereunto.</p>

               <p>And because I have gone thus farre with my rude and unskilfull Pen, to mention the benefit of Commerce in generall. I will descend a little to particulars, to give some People better satisfaction: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed therein, I will endeavour to clear my self of aspertion, which I expect will be cast upon me by the unworthy Governour and Committees of the Honourable East-India Corporation, who I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume will tax me, of perjury and false-hood, to the same Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company, whereof my self am a Member, for discovering that which may prove hurtfull or prejudiciall to that worthy Society: (though unworthy Governement) as one already hath endeavoured though he shall never be able to make his accusation good, but by sturring therein shall rather discover his own shame and Malignant Spirit.</p>

               <p>THe East India Company at my last arrivall from India, hearing that I, Master <hi>Clement,</hi> and Captain <hi>Wedall,</hi> had 18.

               <p>Now the Merchants which comes many hundreds of miles, out of the further most parts of <hi>Persia</hi>: to meet our Ships at Gombroone, they

know we doe stay but about 5. Weekes, and they know that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and Dutch men, will put off their goods at very reasonable profit, before they will carry it back again to Surrat, that is the reason, the prize is so much fallen, as it hath been, for your English Factors will give you so much as the Persians, Banians and Jewes, for they dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their Money, to Spahan, your India Merchants doe send to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia great store of Steele; Tinne, and Sinomon, which they make great profit off; when the Portugalls had Ormus, it was the Gallantest place of Commerce and Magazine of the world none like it, as <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> reports, (if all the world was a Ring, Ormus may be the Jem,) Marchants come from most parts of the world for to trade at it. All Asia did come, and brought Commodities to this famous Island, the Portugalls took a small Custome of all those that brought goods thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Portugalls lost 260000 pounds yearly, when they lost the City of Ormus (for Custome of goods) and made the King of Persiapay Custome for their own goods, otherwise the Portugalls would let nothing passe into the Gulph, the English went every yeare with a great Fleet of Ships for to carry a small quantity of marchandize for to supply their Factory, as Royalls of 8. Cloth, and Tinne, so they brought back some yeares 150. 250. 300. Balls of Silk, which had it not been for the Portugals, a small Ship would have been sufficient to have carried and recarryed our small Cargazeen of goods: For the Portugall kept the Gulph by force from all Nations, and every yeare met us with a great Fleet of Ships, at Cape Gascosse Road, which is entering into the Gulph, and we have had many great Sea fights with them, which put the East India Company to a very great charge yearely, neverthelesse the Gulph did ever belong to the Persian King, which bred a heart burning to the Persian Empire.</p>
               <p>The next yeare after the last fight at Cape Gascosse, we went with a great Fleet into the Gulph of Persia, expecting to have an other Fight with Jack Portugall; the names of the Ships are these, in the Jonah, Captaine <hi>Weddall,</hi> in the Whale, Captaine <hi>Woodcock</hi>; in the Dolphen, Captaine <hi>Stevens</hi>; in the Lyon, Captaine <hi>Beauerstone</hi>; in the London, Captaine <hi>Bligh</hi>; in the Rose, Captaine <hi>Iohnson</hi>; and in the Richard Captaine <hi>Dauice</hi>; with the Robert and Shilling, which were two small Ships of the burthen of 200.

refreshing, and a letter from our English Factors, and a letter from the Caune of Persia, and Pilats for to Pilate our Ships a great way downe into the Gulph, to a place where our Merchants, the Caune and divers Sultans were, at a place called Custake; at which place we received 800. Balles of Silk; and there the English and Persians did enter into Articles to this purpose, that the English would joyne with the Persians in the taking the Island of Kishme, and the Island of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, from the Portugalls. The Persians promised that we should have all the trade of Persia to our selves, and our Custome free; and half the custome of all other Nations that brought goods into the Gulph, and the English to have all the Christians that should be taken at our disposall, and the Persians to have all the heathens, the Marriners of our Ships to have 6. Monethes pay gratis, and what Ammunition we spent in the siege, to be all made good, &amp; the East India Company to have straight for their Ships, and the English to have half the Treasure, Pillage, Ammunition, and Ordinance of both the Islands of Kishme, and Ormus, Ships, Gallies, Frygots, Cities, Townes, Villages; and for to have the command of the Castles. These in short was a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>greed upon, which was at that time of both sides performed. It will be too tedious for me to relate the whole proceedings. The Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galls did surrender both the Castle of Kishime to us and likewise the Castle of Ormus, we gave them two Ships to carry both men, women, and Children, with some provision, and some Baggage to Muskat; but the Persians put all the heathens to death, I have seen 1000. heads for a break-fast cut off in a morning. Although we had the possession of the greatest Jewell of the world, as <hi>Healine</hi> and other authors doe report; if the Commanders, and those of the Counsell at that time had had so much understanding as <hi>B<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56001:25"/>
for there is more Gold upon this Island then all the world beside, for the Poet wrights and calls it the Gold of Opher, and <hi>Solomon</hi> had his Gold from this Island, besides many rich Spices, Gums and Druggs, also from the Straights of Malaco, and from the Straights of Sindia, Java major, from the coast of Chouchichina, Burnua, the Molookcos, and from all parts of China, and the Maneelous; from all these parts they came with Junckes, very richly laden to the Portugals at Ormus, for the Portugals did make them come to trade with them, otherwise they would make prize of their Junckes wheresoever they met with them; for the Portugals was as King of all the Orientall Seas for many hundred of yeares before the English ever knew it; at the taking of the Island of Ormus, there was over the Castle-gate, the date and the yeare of our Lord God, which was at that time 500. yeares since they builded the Castle, which I and divers other English took speciall notice of, saying amongst our selves, that the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals had been many yeares in India, before they builded the Castle of Ormus, and they were the first that did discover all these rich places of India, and Asia. So all men may plainly see that the Portugals did make choise of the best places of their plantations for a Magazine, and the hopefull'st of a commerce of rich trading. I do verily beleive that the City of London and Amsterdam, joyne them both together, could not paralell the rich trade of Ormus, when it did florish before the English traded into India: and hath been such a heart burning to the Portugall, since, that they have endeavoured to raise all their forces in India, which the least Galloones they had did carry 48. peeces of Brasse Ordinance, besides they had many more out of Spaine, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Frigots and Gallies. And all the prime Commanders, Officers, Marriners, and Common Souldiers made a great fast; and all took the Sacrament before their great Fleet went out from Goa, to fight with the English in the Gulph of Persia. The Portugalls taking the Sacrament, to take and burn and sinck our Ships, and to beat us out of the Gulph of Persia, which at that time they failed of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: and we could not make great braggs of our Victory, so every yeare, we did expect a meeting with the Portugals: so the English and the Dutch did joyn together in a Fleet to overcome the Portugalls and did meet once in two yeares in the Gulph and had a great Fight, and the Portugall had almost surprized the Dutch Admirall, if it had not been for our Vice-Admirall, for which afterwards the Dutch Admirall gave our Vice-Admirall his Gold Chaine for releiving of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56001:26"/>
him, so that their was no great victory at that time gained, but the Portugals seeing we were to strong for them, they left us, and went to Muscat to recruit themselves, but never came into the gulph with their fleete of ships to meet our fleete any more.</p>

               <p>THe Portugals did endeavour before to beate us out of India, because they did first discover it. And the last fight that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Portugals had with the English in India I was in, the Portugals did challenge both the English and the Dutch, to fight with them, the Dutch had six saile of ships and the English had the ship <hi>Ionah</hi> riding in Swallow road, and the Portugals had their seven great Galloons and twenty foure Frygots each Frygot had 200 men a piece in them, and the Portugals riding on the other side of the Bar in Swallow hole or roade where we lade and unlade our ships, so that the Portugals could not come to them, for but one ship at a time can come over the Bar, and at a high water on a spring tide, so they could not come together. But the Palsgrave, Dolphin and the ship Lyon, comming out of Europe, and we had many sicke men in these three ships and falling on the coast of India between Bassine and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull, in the morning at the sun rising we spied two Frigots which we found to be spies, we called a counsell presently, and met aboard the Admirall, and all concluded that the Portugals had a fleet of ships neare to Surrat which we found to be true, and we plying off it up to Surrat with the winde and tide, being short of Surrat twenty leagues, and in the interim fitting our ships for fight, which did wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and tire our men, and the two frigots aforesaid keeping us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with out shot of our Ordinance between the shore &amp; our ships, about twelve of the clock we spied the Portugals great Armado con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining seven great Galloons and twenty foure saile of Frigots, so soon as they had espied us they all weighed anchor setting saile to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; us, and we making to them, within three leagues one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and making of their colours very plaine; one Admirall, two vice-Admirals, a reare Admirall, and three other great Galoons, with twenty foure Frigots; we did suppose and conclude that the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56001:26"/>
had another fleete and had taken Swallow hole or roade where we lade &amp; unlade our ships, because they had two vice Admirals, which was a great pollicy of the Portugals, and sending one of our men up into the main top gallant top, espied seven ships riding in swallow road we all concluded that the Portugals had taken the road: otherwise if they had been our friends, they would come out and helpe us, which said seven ships as we heard the next yeare was six saile of Dutch ships and the ship <hi>Ionah</hi> which the Portugals had challenged to fight with, so that the Dutch thought themselves too weak to fight with the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals. But Captain <hi>Kerredge</hi> then being President at Surrat he would have come out with the <hi>Ionah</hi> alone to helpe us, but that he was perswaded to the contrary by the English and Dutch, so we tacked about for to get sea roome, and about two a clock the ship Palsgrave, Dolphin and Lyon, met the Portugals great fleete, all the sailes of their ships crost with red crosses: they shot at us as though they had been mad &amp; after they had discharged their Ordinance, our men stood up &amp; played about them like brave gallant Souldiers, giving the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my three broad sides for their one, and about foure a clock we shot downe the Admirals maine top mast, at which all our men gave a great shout; and about twelve a clock at night two of their galloons clapt our reare Admirall aboard, throwing wilde fire into her, that the ship was all of a light fire, and we doing our best (to relieve her) and being in that great distresse the Master caused an anchor to be let fall, whereupon the two galloons brake off their grabnels from the ship Lyon by reason that the tide doth run so strong that the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals and we did drive to sea, and did continue in fight all that night and the next day and the next night and all the next day and night; so that we did maule them that most of their masts and yards were shot off: and in the morning they were almost out of shot of us, we edging to them, I made a shot at the Admirall but he would not answer us any more, we had spent halfe our ammunition which we carryed out for the reliefe of our ships which we had in India; for we did fight three daies and nights, our ordinance went off so fast as small shot, that you could hardly see the skie for fire and smoak. The Natives of India did see the light of our powder in the skie, and did heare the report of our ordinance, and also Captaine <hi>Weddall</hi> in the great <hi>Iames</hi> comming from Bantam, on the coast of India; who did likewise meet peices of masts, yards, timber and dead men swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on the water, and we were at that time about sixty leagues at sea,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56001:27"/>
and yet they heard and saw the light of our ordnance; so the Portugals was glad to leave us and went for Goa: and we steered our course for the Island of Sacatora for to stop our leakes and to mend our ships, being very much battered, shot and torne, that we had not a yard square canvas in all our sailes but that there was a hole shot thorow, but all this time we did not know what was become of the ship Lyon, which was our reare Admirall, till the next yeare; that after the Portugals galoons broke their grabnels from the ship Lyon, could not come to her any more, because the tide would not suffer them, and the ship Lyon riding at anchor, that in an houres time both we and the Portugals fleete had lost sight of her; in the meane time the ship Lyons company put out their fire, and throwing many deadmen overboard, whereof the Captaine was one, and fitting their ship for to steere their course for Persia because they all supposed the Portugals had another fleete at swollow road, because they met us with two vize Admirals: the Portugals well knowing that the Ship Lyon what case she was in, sending foure Frygots after her into the Gulgh of Persia; and these foure saile of frygots went to Muskat for more helpe to surprize the ship Lyon, and in the meane time the ship Lyon arived over against Gombroon and had unladed all their goods and merchandize, and left it in the costody of <hi>Thomas Ioyce</hi> being pursers mate of her; and the next day after the Portugals came with twelve frigots and galleys, and did set upon the ship Lyon and after halfe a daies fight all the frigots and gallyes laid the Lyon aboard and did enter her with many men and they blowed them up, the Portugals did enter them againe severall times, so that they were forced to blow up all their deckes with many hundred of the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals, and seeing they could doe no good in entring the Lyon, then they fired her with wilde fire, that the mast did burne so much that coales fell down on the decke; our stout gallant English men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured still to put out the fire, and to put the Portugals off which lay round about her (our men throwing fire balls and pots of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into them, yet could doe no good, for our men could not use their Ordinance, if they opened a port hole the Portugals did let fly a hundred small shot in, so that our men could not rowse out a peice for to doe any execution, so that our brave Englishmen were put to their shifts, either to surrender, or to burne, or else to blew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up, so Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> who went out Pursur of her, was by the ships company chosen Captaine of her after the other was slaine in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56001:27"/>
fight with us, so with unanimous consent rather then to yeeld to the Portugals upon any quarter, saying amongst themselves, never any English ship was taken or surrendred to the Portugals. So one gallant Englishman who was both Purser and Captaine of the ship Lyon seeing no hope or recovery for to put out the fire, the ship being much burned, that coales of fire fell downe on the decke from the top of the mast: our English was contented to die with their brave Commander. They all concluded, and in the first place they all commended their soules into the hands of the Almighty their Creator, and in the second place, all agreed to lay a traine of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder to the powder roome, and so to blow up their ship; before they would be a prey to the enemy. This sad accident was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the twinkling of an eye, and foure great frigots which had two hundred men at the least in each frigot, which lay aboard of the ship Lyon, perished all together: some of our men so soone as fire was layed to the train leapt over board, and after the blow was past the other frigots and gallies lying off our ship, seeing our men swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the water for life, shot at them and darted at them with pikes; the Portugals tooke up twenty five of our men which was not slaine, yet some wounded, and the next day in cold bloud they put all our men to death excepting one <hi>Winterton,</hi> which was Steward of the ship Lyon. <hi>Hugh Frerow</hi> being at that time Admirall of those twelve saile of Frigots and Gallies, and formerly commander in chiefe of all the Portugals Sea forces in the Orientall parts; who many yeares before we took in the Castle of Kishme, and it was ordered by the Sea counsell that <hi>Hugh Frerow</hi> should be sent aboard the ship Lyon, and so to carry him a prisoner to the President and counsell of Surrat.

At the Ship Palsgrave and Dolphins ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, we understood by good intelligence of the Natives of India, of the Portugals inveterate divelish malice to us, for taking Ormus from them, and how all tooke the Sacrament and swore by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin Mary, that they would never returne to their wives and children, till they had either taken us, or fired us, or else to sink us; the Portugals had many fasts to this purpose for to destroy us, and that whensoever they tooke the English, that then they would cut off all their heads; and the Dutch, that they would hang them up by the members till they died. This was their malice because we tooke Ormus from them, and hindering of them of their trade in India. This fleete was the greatest that they have had in India; I do beleive and have been credibly informed, that they had in the fight fifty men for one which was a great advantage, but it was the great mercy of God, to preserve us from our enemies.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. The Portugals mediation for peace with the English Nation, the Persians valuation of Ormus, at twenty Millions of treasure, now they are possessed thereof, which the English might have enjoyed, if they had had wise Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Committees, and Agents, of the India corporation; the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding folly of the East India court, in sending treasure into Persia, to touch at Surrat, where the money being invested in commodities would have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned almost to double money profit, the unconsionable custome of India Courts in not shipping out our own rich native commodities, which would yeeld good profit, but transporting much Gold and Silver, to their countries losse, and proofe of their ill office to the Common-wealth; the way to drive a rich trade into India, without transportation of treasure. Multitude of English commodities beneficiall for transportation into India, to save exportation of treasure, if the India courts were good members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; the beneficiall trade in India, between Surrat and Goa neare adjacent: all commodities from Surrat to Bantam vendible, at great beneficiall prizes.</head>
               <p>THe Portugals never since dared for to attempt to fight with us any more,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> his intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> but the Portugals hath endeavoured and sent many messengers to the President and councell at Surrat, for to desire that a peace may be concluded between them and us, which since is performed between the President and Councell of Surrat, and the Vice-Roy of Goa, and likewise confirmed by both the States of England, and Spaine, but I have heard many Portugals tell me, that the English hath done them more wrong then the Crown of England can make them satisfaction, for taking Ormus from them, and for to give it to the Persians; I must needs confesse the like was never known, that one Christian warring against another, and then for to give the prey and all the benefit to the Heathen.</p>
               <p>The Persians I am confident will not leave the Castle of Ormus, for twenty Millions of Treasure. I have been in Persia many times since we tooke Ormus, and the Persians hath told me as much: the Persians hath flourished gallantly since they have gotten Ormus in their custody, for Gombroon when I first knew it, had but eighteen houses in it; and now it is a great City or Town as most in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, it may compare for commerce of trade, that there is not the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56001:29"/>
like place of trade in all Persia; also it is become the best Port Town and doth bring more custome to the King of Persia, then all the port Townes besides; this the English might have enjoyed, if they had been wise, or had but good descreet Factors and Commanders, which hath brought such exceeding losse to the Adventurers, I may boldly say many Millions, since Ormus was taken.</p>
               <p>And herein by the way, let not the India Courts at home malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously maligne (as they have done a long time, to the utter ruine of me and mine, for my good service done them, and acknowledged by their owne acts of Court) for casting aspertion upon them, (in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to my country-men in generall, and to the Honourable Adventurers in particular,) of their indiscreet and injuditious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the India trade, far from the repute of prudent Merchants, which hath brought such exceeding losse to the Adventurers of the second stock, and to my selfe a poore member of the company in particular, which I manifest in these few words.</p>
               <p>The India Court have shipt for many yeers together great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Silver and Gold, viz, 20 30 40 or 60 thousand pounds per annum. into Persia to buy silke, which money hath been at all times first brought to Surrat in India, and from thence transported into Persia untoucht, which being invested at Surrat in commodities as aforesaid, would have turned to the companies great profit, 40 50 60 or 80 per Cent. <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> money yeelded them not a penny profit; for they might have had the same money in Royals of eight for their commodities at the port Town of Gombroone, to have fitted their turne at Spahan where it was to be invested in silke, and if they had carryed up the commodities themselves to Spahan, as the Persia Merchants, that came to the port Town with ready money to buy the commodities, they might peradventure have advanced their profit as much more; for it is very probable that Merchants would not come down fifteen hundred miles by land to buy commodities with ready money, but to their great advantage.</p>
               <p>The India Company transport but little of our native commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, viz Cloath and other woollen manufacture, which though they vend not in great quantities, (as in Germany, Low-countries, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, Muscovia, Denmark &amp;c.) yet when they are sold they goe off at great profit, especially if transported from the port of Surrat, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remoter parts of India, and my self have made double and almost treble money of cloath above the price in London; but the maine
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56001:29"/>
of their exportation is in Gold and Silver, which whether they be good common wealths men or no I leave to the judicious state of this Land to examine and consider.</p>
               <p>But I know and am certainly assured, that a great trade may be driven in India without any money at all exported (as by experience in the several rich Factors returned, who carryed smaller or no stock at all) (of which I could nominate many) yet by 5. or 6. yeares employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or some longer time, have brought home Estates of 5.10. or 30. thousand pounds a man, their sallery not paying their charge by a quarter part more or lesse, which I manifest thus. A good stock once set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in India of 100000 pounds more or lesse by goods, of severall sorts exported from England, as Cloth, Kersies, fine light Stuffes, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver, Lead, Tinne, Iron, Steele, Currall, Amber, Ammell, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestry, hangings, Pictures, Swords, Blades, Knives, Scissers, Sheeres, Rasors, Looking-Glasses, Glasse-Beads, Spectacles, Locks, Keyes, Hinges, Horses, Bitts, Stirrops and Curry-Combes for Horses and Oxen, and Nailes of all sorts; French and Norrembour toyes, &amp;c.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56001:30"/>
permition) a standing stock may be raised and kept in India, which with credit will be abundantly heaped upon them, that have but a small stock in the Countrey, a mighty trade may be driven to all the Kingdoms of India and Asia, and to great profit; and the Surplus thereof still yearely after one or two yeares made hence into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land will much advantage the state of this Common-wealth (in my simple opinion) and for the better accommodation of this tradeing, small Ships of a 100. or 200. or 300. Tunne may be kept in India, to make speedier returnes then by India Junckes from place to place, which notwithstanding may be much usefull, for ladeing and transporting of grosse commodities, as Cotton, Cotton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarne, Rice, Tobacco, Sugar, Ruinas, Gaules, Brimstone, Allome and such like, of small valuation yet great in Bulke, and profitable both for exportation and importation to Surrat and other parts in India; and the other English Ships to be laded with finer and lesse bulkey Commodities, which as long as Peace continueth in those parts between us and the Dutch, and Portugals, there is little or no danger, the seas of themselves (taking opportunity of the munsones or trade winds) as pleasant sailing in, as in the River Theames or Narrow seas in faire or summer weather. And this course as I conceive will save an infinite charge of shipping, which now the company are and have been at to passe continually between India and England, their abode in the Countrey untill they be worne out and decayed, and so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to come home a long voyage; whereas shipping upon advice from India sent out once a yeer strong and in good case to stay there a moneth, two or three for their relading and recreation, will be of much lesse Charge and danger in coming home. What I write here is out of the little intelligence I have gotten by being one yeare at the Northern parts of India, at Surrat, and half that time a close priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, most injuriously and wickedly oppressed for my affection and indeavours to doe God and my Country the best service in my poor power.

               <p>ONe thing I had forgotten which now comes to my minde, which will with all the other advantages in trade, adde much to the benefit, either of private men, or to the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the plantation as aforesaid, and that is as followeth; at Swol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low roade, the port or haven for Ships sent to Surrat in India, upon the shore in open fields is usually kept a Bazor, Market or Faire, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the abode of the English Ships there, which sometime lasteth a moneth two or three together, where the English have a Tent for their President or Councell to sit or lye in at their pleasure, and their to are annexed a Tent for the Merchants of the Maryne, the Companie's servants, (so called because they are alotted to do service there in lading and relading of the Ships) and the English house Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser or his Mate, hath another Tent accommodable for him to give order for buying provision of fresh victualls for the Ships, and other
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56001:36"/>
services. And the Dutch company likewise have the same convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, distant about a quarter of a mile one from the other. But the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor or market place for provision of victuals, or for sea commodities, and Marriners their investments for merchandizing of all sorts, is annexed to the English Tent, like a little Town, with a street or two, and many Tents of Banians, richly furnished with all manner of wares, which they sell both to English and Dutch, but most to the English, who are the more Royall Merchants; and the Banians buy also such goods as they bring out of England, or from other parts in India, where they have been in trading. By which meanes the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians get great store of wealth by such trading at the Maryne, with English, Dutch, Portugals, and others; the benefit whereof may all be accrewed to the English, which had I gone a second voyage for India, either for the company if they thought good, or my selfe, I would have put in practice, and am assured of great advantage and profit to have redounded thereby; and the more incouragement I had thereunto by some of the chiefest Banians themselves, who put it into my head, and promised to be my assistants therein and layed me downe a way how to effect the same to my great profit, viz by buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the time of raynes 56 or 7 moneths time beforehand all sorts of vendible commodities fit for sale at the ships arival, and to sell the same againe unto the seamen and marriners at 20 or 30 per cent. profit, ready money; and faithfully promised to assist me with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis for the investments at easie rates, and so to put them off againe for me as aforesaid, some good experience I had of their affection and fidelity towards me in a high degree, though a close prisoner.</p>
               <p>It fortuned that during that time the ship Ionah returned from Bantam to Surrat with store of Spices, especially Cloves, which at their departure from Surrat to Bantam, and about six moneths past were a drug or unvendible commodity, but at the Ships arival inhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted suddenly to a great price, to almost double money the price they cost at Bantam, whereupon the Banian Usurers and Brokers pittying my intollerable wrongs, came to visit me and offered me great curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies beyond my expectations, which was in advising me to buy up presently all the Cloves in the Ship Ionah, amounting to many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds, and they would sell them againe for me to 40 50 or 60, per cent. profit, I made them curteous and thankfull reply for their freindly advice, and made known unto them the impossibility in me to effect it, partly in regard for want of monies to buy them up,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56001:37"/>
which must be with ready money, and partly in regard I was a prisoner and had not liberty to goe about such or any other businesse. To both which impediments in me, they propounded present cure and accommodation, and first for monies they would supply me, with such quantities as the businesse should require; and secondly, for want of my liberty, they advised me presently to write to Captaine <hi>Richard Swanley,</hi> Commander of the Ship Ionah, with whom they knew I had good correspondency and friendly familiarity, to procure his assistance therein, upon which their incouragement and friendly perswasions; I wrote presently to Captaine <hi>Swanley,</hi> to intreat his furtherance therein, and to allot him the halfe share therein, and to furnish him with money, but he being overawed by the usurping po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of a tyranus Prendent, with whom at that present he was out of favour, durst not attempt the business, which might have been bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to us both some thousand of pounds, which by his neglect, fell into the hands of his and my adversaries, <hi>Richard Wilde</hi> President, and <hi>George Page</hi> one of the Counsell</p>
               <p>And this I conceive needfull to manifest for two reasons, the one to give information what benefit may be made by the Marine trade onely, without ventering further to sea, which my selfe if I could have obteined (but most ungratefully denied) passage into India for my money (which was freely given to aliens and strangers) I would have made my cheifest investments in that way of commerce (which would not in any sort have been prejuditiall to the India Company) and would not have doubted thereby to have raised as great or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortune to my selfe proportionable to my paines and small adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then the India Court hath done or is like to doe to the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Companies advancement, with their Massie Hock and credit, which perhaps was the cause of their envie towards me, least it should turne to their great reproo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e.

vowed by his heathen Gods, to race the City and expell the Dutch, though with the losse of the lives of many 100000 of his people (a most desparate daring nation of them selves, who will venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on most desperate designes though apparent death before their eyes, as many experiences have bin proved of late; a desperate enraged Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va adventured to come a beard an English Ship himselfe, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to kill all the men aboard, or to die himselfe; upon which despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate designe he flew 4. 5. or 6.

which if we neglect the Dutch or Portugals or both will out top and domineere over us by expelling us out of India, and encroach that wealthy action of commerce to their exceeding great advantage, and our irrecoverable, and deplorable losse.</p>

               <p>But should as heartily grieve to hear of such persidious treacherous acts among Christians, as that heretofore committed by the Dutch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders at Batavia, upon the English at Amboyna in India, which hath been twice published in print to the world, and yet no restitution
