            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS
ON THE
Hiſtory of Paſſive Obedience.</head>
            <p>WHAT muſt we do, muſt we be always
Reading and Writing? Will Pens and
Preſſes never give over? It was pleaſant
of late to ſee Men generouſly undertake
the Defence of the Proteſtant Religion,
and the Vindication of the deſpiſed, and almoſt ruin'd
Church of <hi>England.</hi> They did it effectually, and they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
it by the beſt Principle, for the honour of God,
and the ſafety of Religion; for this they ventured their
Credits, their Fortunes, their Lives; they knew they had
malitious Adverſaries, and curious and prying into Secrets,
and ſuch as would and muſt diſcover, who they were who
durſt ſpeak againſt Error, when ſupported by a King, and
maintained by all the Art and Sophiſtry of Prieſt or
Jeſuit, Yet they <hi>wrote,</hi> and certainly did well in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
for they have carried their cauſe, and ſhewed to all
the World upon what good grounds the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ſtands, and how excellent is the Conſtitution of this
Church of <hi>England.</hi> Something muſt be owned to be due
to their Labors for the clear underſtanding that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry of this Nation have of the Cheat and
Miſchief of Popery, and it may be from thence many who
have been unconcerned and indifferent for any Religion,
have taken courage to act heartily for Truth againſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and perhaps thereby they have help'd to give a ſtop
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52047:3"/>
to the deſigns of ſome very ill-minded Men. In all this
it muſt be acknowledg'd that they have done very well,
as became Divines and Scholars, Men of Religion and
Men of Knowledg.</p>
            <p>Why now may they not take their reſt and quiet? their
Enemies are vanquiſhed and fled away, and one would think
that there ſhould be nothing left in this Nation, but their
Friends and Admirers. But it is not ſo, they have Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
not open in the ſtreets but ſculking in Corners; ſuch
as will not, perhaps cannot, or perhaps ſcorn to ſpeak for
Popery; but they have Malice; and can envy the ſucceſs
of a Conquerer, throw dirt at him, or give a ſecret wound
to him. Theſe now come from under their bulks and
lurking holes. And ſince they will do no good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reſolve to
do evil, and will be at the pains and coſt of writing and
divulging of Tales or Stories, or Hiſtories: to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
or what end they themſelves dare not tell. But we
muſt gueſs, that they have a deſign to blacken ſome very
good Men.</p>
            <p>That is the reaſon (as far as we can gueſs) that a Book
is lately ſent abroad entitled, <hi>The Hiſtory of Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
ſince the Reformation.</hi> Certainly never was any
thing called <hi>Hiſtory</hi> written to ſo little purpoſe, ſo little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
or pleaſing. Why muſt ſo much pains be taken
in the peruſal of Sermons, popular Diſcourſes and leſſer
Tracts, to find out, and report to the World what ſuch and
ſo many Men have ſaid upon this Subject? They have <hi>writ</hi>
excellent things, and thoſe many; but all of them it ſeems
are inſipid to the palate of this Searcher; ſave their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
touches of Paſſive Obedience. This looks odly and
ſeems to come from Spleen, Melancholy, or ſome Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal
Affection; for at this time of the day, we have
no need of Paſſive Obedience, or any Diſcourſes about it.
God has delivered us from our dangers, and the diſmal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
which hung over our heads, he has given us a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52047:3"/>
an excellent Prince, under whom our Laws, our
Rights, our Fortunes, our Lives, our Religion are all ſecure,
and aſcertained to us; we doubt not to have Juſtice, and all
that honeſtly our hearts can wiſh. He gives us Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and leaves them to their Freedom; he ſets over us
upright Judges; and allows us to have honeſt Juries. He
will not be any other ſort of King, than what the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of this Nation requires; who is one that can do no
wrong. And if he neither will nor can do wrong, but lets
the Affairs and Intereſts of his People be conducted in the
methods of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs: here can be no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
but for evil deeds and as evil doers. Here can be
no hopes of the Crowns of Martyrs, and no uſe at all of
Paſſive Obedience. Why then does our Author drudg and
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yl; tire himſelf, and tire us, that we may have before
our Eyes, a whole Hiſtory of Paſſive Obedience? He
knows the ſubject is ſad, and melancholick, grievous to fleſh
and bloud, and but juſt tolerable to Reaſon fortified with the
beſt Religion; it is the laſt reſort of the wretched, and
perhaps the heavieſt burden that ever God laid upon Men.
It is a Duty we grant it, but ſuch a one as cannot always
be practiſed, nor ought it at all times to be diſcourſed of;
becauſe it carries fire in its tail, that which may heat and
inflame the angry and froward.</p>
            <p>The talking of this can never be ſeaſonable, but when it
is neceſſary; it is to come out as <hi>Mahomets</hi> Banner does, to
ſerve a turn, when all things elſe fail. As long as we can
ſerve God and Man too, there is no uſe of Paſſive Obedience.
And as long as there are fair hopes that our duties may not
claſh one againſt the other, it is not good to move People
to prepare themſelves for Sufferings. As long as we can
obey, we muſt obey, and as long as we obey we ſhall not
ſuffer. But if a Prince will command things unjuſt, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
againſt Law, againſt Conſcience, againſt Religion,
we can no longer obey him, becauſe we muſt obey God,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52047:4"/>
and there we are under a calamity moſt deplorable, that we
muſt ſuffer by the rage and fury of Man, becauſe we do our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God. At ſuch a time as this Paſſive Obedience becomes
neceſſary, it ought to be practiſed, and it ought to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for Men muſt know that it is their duty rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
than to obey, and they muſt reſolve within themſelves
ſo to do. Thus S. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and all
the chief Biſhops of the Primitive Church taught their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And to the laſting honour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
her Divines have done the ſame, as our laborious Hiſtorian
has ſhewn beyond contradiction or doubt: this was well
done, but why are we told all this?</p>
            <p>Here we muſt ſtop awhile, and lament the misfortunes of
the late King <hi>James.</hi> Certainly never had any Prince worſe
Counſellors before his Deſertion, nor ever had any worſe
Advocates ſince. His Counſellors perſuaded him to go on in
ill Deſigns, becauſe the Preachers taught the People the duty
of Paſſive Obedience; that is, that he might do any ill thing,
becauſe the People out of Conſcience to God were moved
to be willing to ſuffer. And here we have an Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
or Advocate, for the Cauſe of King <hi>James,</hi> who thinks
to be friend him by telling the World, that ſo many of the
chief of the Clergy, for ſo long time together, did preach
Paſſive Obedience. Now it is as clear as the day, that
there can be no exerciſe of this Duty, nor ought there
be any popular Exhortation to it, but at ſuch a time, when
there is a very ill Prince, and a miſerable People; what
then would our Author have? does he deſign to publiſh an
everlaſting blot upon the memory of the late King <hi>James?</hi>
does he deſign to tell the World, that he was reſolved
to do miſchief to his People? That nothing could correct or
retain him? That he would go on, tho the Pulpits ſounded
out Paſſive Obedience, and his People were taught that there
was no hope of Juſtice or Equity from him, and that they
muſt think of ſuffering and dying rather than obey him?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52047:4"/>
This is ſevere; it will furniſh out a worſe Character of
King <hi>James</hi> than any of his Adverſaries have yet given
him; it will juſtifie the Receſſion of his People from him,
and ſhow to Poſterity how it came to paſs that ſo eaſily
and ſuddenly he fell to the ground. For who can read all
theſe ſo many Pleas, Advices, Inſtructions, Exhortations
to Paſſive Obedience, but he muſt reflect upon the Cauſes
and Reaſons of them: and if he does ſo, he will be forced
to think, that at that time wicked Counſels governed,
and lawleſs Violence prevailed, and that the whole Nation
was clouded with a diſmal Appearance of Oppreſſion, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
and Tyranny. For ſeeing that a Prince ruling
by Law, and with Juſtice, cannot be put off with any
thing leſs than Active Obedience, and nothing can exerciſe
the Paſſive Obedience of Subjects but vile, and baſe, and
wicked Commands contrary to Law and Religion; we
muſt either blame thoſe Preachers for amuſing their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
with needleſs Thoughts of unjuſt Sufferings, or we
muſt blame the late King for giving too much cauſe for
juſt and reaſonable fears of them. Now what can be ſaid
in his behalf to acquit him, no Man has yet told us.</p>
            <p>But our Hiſtorian has effectually vindicated the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
he every where commends them and their Writings;
this he tells us was well ſaid, that excellently, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably.
He likes their Doctrine, and finds no fault
in the timing of it: and likely enough he had reaſon to
believe the Doctrine as proper to the Time in which it
was delivered, as it was true in it ſelf. If ſo, the late King
is again deſerted by this Hiſtorian, as well as by the reſt
of his People; and his Cauſe, like himſelf, falls to the
ground; for why muſt he do ill things, and why muſt
he load his People with dreads of worſe? Why did not all
this noiſe about Paſſive Obedience awaken him? Why did
he not give ſtop to his Proceedings when his People own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo loudly their fears of Miſchief? Could he think it a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52047:5"/>
ſmall thing to make his People miſerable, or to be thought
one that would do ſo? All this was intimated by thoſe
Sermons and Tracts. From thence he ought to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
warning to deſiſt, and his Counſellors ought to have
perſuaded him to it; for certainly popular Diſcourſes about
Paſſive Obedience are as inſtructive to a Prince to move
him from deſigns of doing ill, as they are to the People
to engage them to be willing to ſuffer wrong.</p>
            <p>From hence I am forced to blame our Hiſtorian for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating
the Memory of theſe Diſcourſes: it were for
the honor of the late King that they were forgotten. Thoſe
excellent Divines would never have revived paſt Actions,
or the grievous ſad Thoughts which they had, when they
compoſed or delivered their excellent Arguments and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions
for Paſſive Obedience.</p>
            <p>They could wiſh from their Souls, that they never had
occaſion for them, tho they are ready to morrow to write
the ſame things upon the ſame grounds, which with good
reaſon they hope that they are not like to ſee as long as
they live.</p>
            <p>Why then does the Hiſtorian take pains to collect all
theſe things together? He can do no Service to the late
King by it, and he does not ſeem to deſign the Honor
of the Preachers. It is hard to gueſs his meaning: but if
he tempts out an ill Thought, he muſt blame himſelf. He
gives us nothing elſe to think, but that he might be one
of the <hi>Adepti,</hi> one of thoſe who knew the Secret; for in
the late Times (they tell us) there was a Secret. The
Miniſters of State, they ſay, who knew the Reſolves of
the Court to be harſh and ſevere, made it their buſineſs to
perſuade Men to preach and talk up Paſſive Obedience;
that what could not be done by the Power of the King,
might be gained by the eaſie Submiſſions of the People.
This was <hi>Machiavel</hi> to purpoſe. It is ſad and lamentable
that ſo excellent a Doctrine ſhould be abuſed by ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52047:5"/>
of naughty Men. If our Author was one of their
Inſtruments, and knew what he did, he can neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
himſelf to God nor Man. I will undertake for our
excellent Divines, whom he commends, and I and all others
muſt do the ſame, that they were never thought ſo baſe
as to be truſted with the Knowledge of ſuch a pernicious
Deſign. They out of Honeſty and Sincerity preached
againſt Rebellion, and perſuaded Men rather to ſuffer, than
obey evil Commands; but they would not for all the
World that the innocent and conſcientious ſhould be cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their Lives and Fortunes by any Diſcourſes of theirs.
Therefore when it was proper, they preached up this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
but when it was not, they let it alone; becauſe
they would not have the People to rebel, nor would they
give Encouragement to ſuch as might be willing to oppreſs
them: in both theſe things they did their Duty both to
the King and to the People. It had been well if others
would have done the ſame, and ſpoke as plainly to the
King, as they did to the People. But it was very ill done,
if done at all, to perſuade the King that the People of
<hi>England</hi> were ſo ſubdued by the Doctrine of Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
grown ſo tame and eaſie that he might do what
he would; pull down and ſet up what Religion, what Law
he pleaſed. It is certain that all the Preachers in the
World could never perſuade them to this; for tho the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be Loyal, and willing enough that the King ſhould
have his Dues, yet they were never thought a Nation of
Aſſes, fit only to bear Burdens. As they are not born
Slaves, and by the Conſtitution of the Nation ought not
to be made Slaves, ſo they have more Spirit and Wit than
to ſuffer themſelves to be cheated into Slavery. Their
Forefathers, for many Ages, have made a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and his Counſellors; tho they would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the one, yet they would not ſuffer the other: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the Men of this Age ſhould not be thought ſo dull
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52047:6"/>
as not to diſtinguiſh between Honoring the King, and
Obeying Father <hi>Petre;</hi> and that tho all the Proteſtant
Preachers had talked of nothing elſe but Paſſive Obedience.
For Preachers can do no more than tell the People their
Duties, and they muſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tell them all their Duties; but if
they ſtretch beyond, and require more than they ought,
the People will find it out, and will not part with their
Rights for a Word, tho it ſound never ſo well. But they
did their Duty, they preached Paſſive Obedience not Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
they would have Men to be true to their King, but
not falſe to their God, or falſe to their Country; this
was underſtood, and their Doctrine was received kindly,
and practiſed faithfully.</p>
            <p>Thence it came to paſs that all Sorts and Orders of
Men prepared themſelves for Suffering; ſome of all ranks
actually did it: for, Nobles, Judges, Magiſtrates, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Citizens, Burgeſſes, every where took up the Croſs,
and choſe rather to Suffer than to Obey, that is, do what
by Law, and Reaſon, and Conſcience, they ought not to
do. This was well.</p>
            <p>But others went beyond theſe: for, tho they ſuffered
much, yet they ſeem at this day to be grieved that they
did not ſuffer more: They had ſo fixed their Thoughts
upon the performance of this Duty, that with a Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity
not to be preſidented, they take no pleaſure in their
Deliverance, becauſe they have loſt the opportunity of
dying for their Religion, to gratifie no very commendable
Humor of their Prince.</p>
            <p>Theſe are very extraordinary effects of the Doctrine of
Paſſive Obedience, and ſuch as may be accepted: but
ſome Men will be ſatisfied with nothing; for our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
is angry, and it is likely the Politicians of the late
King, his Juſuits and his Prieſts, are angry too, inaſmuch
as their Expectances are not anſwered; they have not all
which they deſigned, and hoped for; the Nation is not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52047:6"/>
enſlaved; they have it not in their power, to caſt Church
and State into a new Model, and to give Laws to the
People of <hi>England,</hi> as well as they did to the late King.</p>
            <p>This is cauſe enough to make Men angry, for they have
loſt a rich Booty, and ſuch Advantages as they are never
like to get again; beſides, they have loſt their Credit and
Reputation, ſo as never before happened to Men of their
fineneſs in Sophiſtry and Contrivance, and that by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed,
clot pated People, ſuch as had no higher reach than
to do their Duties to God and to their King. Thus Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
(God be bleſſed) muſt ſometimes triumph in
this World; Honeſty and Probity have their Succeſſes as
well as Slight and Craft, and may they always have ſo.
But tho the Jeſuit had cauſe to be angry at this, yet why
ſhould our Hiſtorian? we know him not, and cannot gueſs
what Deſigns he had, nor how his Plots are defeated; but
yet he is angry, and as much as if he had loſt a good
Biſhoprick or a good Deanery.</p>
            <p>He gives us a Hiſtory, and ſets a Preface before it, and
a Concluſion at the End of it: the Head and the Tail are
his; he frowns and bites with the one, and then he ſtings
with the other. He tells us that he finds Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
much in Writings, little in Practice; <hi>That we muſt
acknowledge to our ſhame,</hi> that this, with other Doctrines,
<hi>are more illuſtrious in our Books than in our Lives, (Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
p. 2.) But then in the ſeventh Page of his <hi>Preface</hi> he
has a long ſharp biting Character of certain Perſons, which
is to be read one way, and to be underſtood another; for
tho it ſeems to ſay no ill, but to provide for the Acquittal
of all, yet it is ſo phraſed, that according to the modern
Figure called <hi>Innuendo</hi> ſome Readers will find in it a very
ſevere Reproof, and others a mere Calumny. All this
comes from Anger, and ſomething worſe; and it ſhews
that the deſign of our Hiſtorian was not to teach the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church in this point, what it was in it ſelf,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52047:7"/>
how it ought to be ſtated, by whom it had been owned,
and by what Arguments it had been proved, and who had
beſt cleared it from Objections, Miſtakes, and Miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.
This had been a Work worthy of an Hiſtorian.
But this was none of our Author's Buſineſs; they are the
Writers upon this Subject that have offended him; he
would do them a miſchief, ſhoot at them in the dark, and
wound them in ſecret: he would have the World to
think, that they and their Writings, their Lives and their
Books, do not agree: he deſires nothing elſe but this, and
ſeems reſolved to have his Point whether his Reader grant
it or no. At the firſt Onſet in his <hi>Preface,</hi> he ſays it
boldly, and ſays it with Advantage, That they ought to
be aſhamed it is ſo. Then he gives us a large Catalogue
of the Sayings of excellent Perſons tranſcribed out of their
Books, but does not give us one Word of their Lives; nor
does he tell us, whether all of them are alike guilty, or
only ſome: nor does he give us any one Action of any one
of their Lives to juſtifie his Reproof. This is certainly a
groſs dull way of calumniating; ſhould another imitate it,
with that Indignation would he read, and deſpiſe the
Author? For ſuppoſe another ſhould take for his Theme,
Murder, or Adultery, or Drinking, or Swearing, or Lying,
and gather together out of his Writings, and out of all
his Friends, his Acquaintance or Neighbors Writings, and
many others too, all they have ſaid againſt any one of
them, ſuppoſe it be Lying only, and compoſe as large a
Hiſtory as this; and then ſay in a ſtout ſcornful Preface,
<hi>That we must acknowledge to our ſhame, that a ſenſe of the
Sin of</hi> Lying <hi>is more illuſtrious in our Books than in our
Lives.</hi> Such a thing as this might be done; but when
it is done, it can tend to no other end, but to beget an
Opinion in the Readers, that ſuch and ſuch Writers, all
of them, were a pack of lying Knaves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52047:7"/>
Now this were baſely done, our Author would think it
ſo were it his own caſe. <hi>Horace</hi> makes an inſtance of a
like Treatment, and with Indignation ſays of the Practice,
that it was meer Canker and Venom:
<q>
                  <l>Hic nigrae ſuccus Loliginis, haec est</l>
                  <l>Aerugo mera.</l>
                  <bibl>Ser. Lib. 1. Sat. 4.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Had our Author annexed to his Hiſtory the due Praiſes
of thoſe who had performed their Duties, of which ſort
he might have found many amongſt the Lords Spiritual
and Temporal, and amongſt the Commons too; and then
given us the Grounds upon which he judged that others
failed in theirs, he would have deſerved Thanks for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks,
as well as for his Hiſtory; for then his Book
might have done good, by exciting ſome to repent for
what was paſt, and others to be more cautious for the
future.</p>
            <p>But to give a ſtop to this ſort of Diſcourſe, let Anger be
gone, and all unwarrantable Paſſion laid aſide: I will now
endeavour fairly to conſider our Author's Notion of Paſſive
Obedience, and accept in it what is to be accepted, and
take the freedom to oppoſe what I judge not defenſible.
As for the Sayings of our excellent Divines, I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
my Thoughts by the Reverence I have for their
Authority: I will not therefore conſult their Words, leſt
I ſhould be tempted in the proceed of the Diſpute to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my ſelf under their great Names; and ſo perhaps I may
engage a whole Army to fight, when a ſingle Duel, or a
ſmall Skirmiſh, may put an end to the Action.</p>
            <p>Firſt then I and my Adverſary muſt ſhake hands, we will
agree as far as we can; and where we cannot we muſt
wreſtle it out.</p>
            <p>I will therefore grant ſeveral things that are in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
according as they appear in the Pages: as pag. the 1ſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52047:8"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience, or Non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of our lawful Superiours has been a Doctrine found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the holy Scriptures: and recommended to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World by the practices of our Saviour's more immediate
followers, and that the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath aſſerted the
Principles of obedience to Princes, as the beſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
owned and practiſed it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, P. 2d. I will grant too,</hi> That it is the duty of
every Chriſtian actively to obey his Superior, in things lawful
(<hi>ſo that the laſt word be duly interpreted</hi>) and that it is
the duty of every Chriſtian in things unlawful to ſuffer rather
than obey. <hi>And I will grant further all that S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſays,</hi>
Rom. 13. 2. Whoſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
damnation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, P. 4th. I will grant too; <hi>That theſe Doctrines
are not Apoſtolical and ſuch as ought to be preached in all the
World.</hi> Firſt, That Power is originally in the body of the
People. Secondly, That the foundation of all Government
is laid in Compact, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much we give, and that freely, and it is enough to
ſatisfie any fair Adverſary. But yet I muſt tell him, That
when he has all this, he has no reaſon to cenſure, reproach
and blacken the Lives and Actions of ſo many excellent
Perſons: He has no ground from thence to diſparage the
late Revolution, or to think himſelf able to wheedle us
into an opinion that we have done ill, and that we ought
to repent much rather than give thanks to God or Man for
the happineſs we enjoy. Certain it is, that when the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and conſequences of thoſe general Doctrines come to
be ſeen in the practice of Men, as ſome may ſlinch from
their Duties, and do too little; ſo others may require
more than Duty, and expect too much. For the Intereſts of
this World blinds as well on one ſide, as on the other: and
he that cenſures moſt boldly, is not always the moſt juſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52047:8"/>
and impartial Man. Defeated Ambition can eaſily charge
Ambition, and worldly mindedneſs upon a prevalent Party;
and Spite will throw out as freely, and as goodly words as
plain downright Honeſty can.</p>
            <p>Let us then conſider theſe three things again: Firſt, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Secondly, Non-reſiſtance. Thirdly, The Origination
of Power; and ſee if we can frame clear Notions of theſe, and
find out the particular diſtinct Duties, which Men muſt be
obliged to, in conſequence of them.</p>
            <p>1. Then as to Obedience; It's plain that this is due to
Kings, to all that are in Authority; and that by Laws, by
Oaths, by the Laws of God, by the Laws of Men; the
publick good, and the intereſts of Nations require it. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this there can be no Government, and the People have
more need to be governed, than a King can have to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern;
therefore they muſt obey not ſo much for wrath, out
of fear of puniſhment; but for their own ſake, for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſake, for God's ſake, and for their Countries ſake.
This is to be given frankly and fully; with all chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and upon all occaſions, in all inſtances where it is
poſſible. Nothing can be pleaded in bar to it, but onely
want of Power. If the Laws of God, or the Laws of the
Country, which oblige us to obey our Kings, make obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in ſome inſtances morally impoſſible, then we muſt
not obey, becauſe we cannot; for what we cannot lawfully
do, we cannot do at all; But where we are at our own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſal,
not under previous neceſſary Obligation, there pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good, Law and Reaſon require us to obey without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
trick or device. For we muſt do what we can to
ſupport Government, and to carry on the ends for which
Men are incorporated into Bodies Politick. Therefore in
doubtful matters we muſt obey, as far as ever we can, and
never omit our Obedience, but where the Cauſe is moſt
clear and moſt urgent; there is no excuſe, no exchange to
be made, but the Duty muſt be paid in kind. Suppoſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52047:9"/>
that a great part of the People ſhould take up a reſolution
not to do, but to ſuffer, a Prince would have a very ill
bargain, if he accept the one in exchange for the other. For
their ſufferings can do him no good, and he and his People
too may be undone for want of their doings. He muſt have
aſſiſtance to repreſs the Thief, the Robber, the Murtherer,
to ſecure his People from Pyracies and Invaſions. Beſides
what a ſhame it is, that Princes ſhould be ſo baſely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to find Racks and Gibbets, and Halters, and Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for their People: They have their Power for nobler
ends, to defend, to ſave, to do good, to give praiſe to them
that do good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3. And when they execute wrath,
they muſt do it upon the Evil-doer, and that with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
that they may ſave many, by taking off a few: or
elſe all their Executions are ſtark naught.</p>
            <p>There cannot therefore be a bargain driven between King
and People, of giving and taking ſufferings inſtead of
doing, for Kings muſt be obeyed and the People muſt obey;
the one cannot puniſh, and the other cannot ſuffer, but upon
account of Tranſgreſſion, and the Law declares the greatneſs
of the fault, and the extent of the Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>But yet ſome are apt to think, that Subjects may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
of their Duty to their Prince by ſuffering as well as
by doing; and when they have called the one Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and the other Active, they ſay the Prince is obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and has his due, and ought to be ſatisfied. This ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
once to be a fundamental in the Quakers Doctrine, who
would take a Cudgelling, a Whipping, a ſlaſhing or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
with a great deal of ſatisfaction, whilſt they
would make themſelves a diſtinguiſh'd People from others,
by unaccountable humors and fanſies, and tho they gave
diſturbance to their Neighbours and trouble to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet they would think themſelves good Subjects, and
very much obedient to the Prince only becauſe they ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This was and is a groſs miſtake; for they that ſuffer,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52047:9"/>
ſuffer becauſe they do not obey; the Prince, the Judg, the
Executioner, they themſelves, all think they do not obey,
for neither would he puniſh, nor ought they to ſuffer, if they
did obey. But becauſe they will not obey their Prince, he
puniſhes, and they ſuffer. The Prince therefore in this caſe
has no manner of Obedience.</p>
            <p>But let us conſider further, tho we cannot barter
with a Prince, and give him Suffering inſtead of Doing, yet
we may be obliged to ſuffer, and we may obey in doing,
and obey in ſuffering for ſo doing, and that Obedience may
be called Paſſive Obedience; tho in truth and reality all
the Obedience which we perform in this caſe is Active.
For we obey one, and ſuffer from another; we obey God,
and ſuffer from Man, or we obey Man, and ſuffer from
God. But becauſe God hath commanded us not only to
do our Duties, but likewiſe has commanded us in certain
caſes not only to do, but to be ready to ſuffer for ſo doing;
our obedience to this Command of ſuffering has been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by ſome Paſſive Obedience. Now this is Great and
Noble, and ſpeaks an excellency of Spirit, which is moſt
admirable, for Men to do well, and to continue in ſo doing,
whatever they ſuffer upon that account. But as it
is Noble, ſo it is hard and difficult. It is hard to be
bound to confeſs Chriſt before Men that we may gain
Heaven, and at the ſame time to be forced to loſe all that
we have on Earth for ſo confeſſing. This ſets Body and
Soul at variance, nay the Soul is confounded in it ſelf,
whilſt hopes and fears engage one another in a ſevere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
the one would gain, and the other would not loſe,
the one pulls upwards, and the other downwards; upon
this account the thing is difficult. But yet we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that for all the difficulty, it is very practicable,
becauſe it has been always required, and always expected.
No Philoſopher would ever allow him to be a good Man,
who would flinch from his Duty upon the account of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52047:10"/>
To do ſo (they ſay) is ſlaviſh, and it is one of
the Rules of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> that in the exerciſe of Vertue
a Man muſt have nothing of the Slave in him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he
muſt have no regard for any thing but his Duty. <hi>Hierocles</hi>
p. 209. <hi>Tully</hi> in the 2d of his Offices will not allow it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for a Man to be juſt, or honeſt, or good who fears
either poverty, or pain, or baniſhment, or death it ſelf, ſo
as to be warped from right by the fears of them, or by the
hopes of any advantages that are contrary to them. <hi>Horace,</hi>
(that very eaſie Man, who can never be thought by a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
to be an over-ſevere directer of (Conſcience) expects
from his juſt and good Man, that he ſhould bear up againſt
Tyrant and Rabble, and ſuffer all that their rage and fury
can throw upon him; and yet not veer in the leaſt from
his point, but go on in his Duty, ſteddily and firmly.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Juſtum &amp; tenacem propoſiti virum,</l>
               <l>Non civium ardor prava jubentium,</l>
               <l>Non vultus inſtantis Tyranni</l>
               <l>Mente quatit ſolidâ.</l>
            </q>
            <p>This Principle of ſuffering in a good Cauſe for the ſake of
Vertue, Goodneſs, and Righteouſneſs; or of doing our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
notwithſtanding that we muſt ſuffer, lies ſo open
and clear to the reaſon of mankind; that Men of worth
and honour in every Age, could not fail to practiſe it.</p>
            <p>And we Chriſtians are bound to the obſervance of this
Duty, as others were before, by the reaſon of the thing, as
well as by precepts of Chriſtianity. Whatever principle a
Man has, and whatever he accounts a Duty, if he will be
true and faithful, juſt and upright, it may ſometime or
other bring him under ſuffering; and he muſt be content
with it, becauſe it is baſe and unworthy in certain caſes
not to do it, it is a betraying of our Conſciences, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of all the good opinion that we can have of our
ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52047:10"/>
Now, if this be true, and this be called Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
that muſt not be looked upon as a peculiar of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
or a new Doctrine introduced ſince our Saviour's
days; much leſs can any particular Church appropriate the
Rule to it ſelf, becauſe it lies in common to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and has ſometimes been practiſed by the little as well
as by the great.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps may have juſt cauſe to complain of falſe
Caſuiſts, and baſe corrupters of the genuine ſenſe of right
Reaſon, and true Chriſtianity; but when they have done
it, they have onely reproved a groſs fault, they muſt not
expect any great honour, for having had a right notion of a
plain Truth.</p>
            <p>If we would ſpeak clearly, we muſt confeſs that our
bleſſed Lord has not heightened this Duty, for he can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no more ſufferings than what Pain, and Beggery, and
Death ſignifie; but as a moſt gracious and tender Maſter he
has made all theſe much more eaſie and portable than ever
they were before, and that in ſeveral ways; As firſt by
giving us moſt gracious Promiſes of Reward in another
World in caſe we are called to ſuffer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11.
Secondly, By aſſuring us that aſſiſtances of God's grace
come in to our help, whenever we do ſuffer, <hi>Matth. 10. 18,
19, Phil.</hi> 1. 29. Thirdly, By giving us ſuch thoughts of
God as are moſt powerful to ſupport us under all ſufferings.
For what can diſmay him, that will think with S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
that he who ſuffers as a Chriſtian, or ſuffers according to
the Will of God, he may commit the keeping of his Soul to
God in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 16, 19.
Theſe things are beyond Philoſophy, and they are mighty
ſupports to all Chriſtians, who muſt ſuffer for well doing.
Theſe would acquit the juſtice of God, if he had required ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
as ſufferings, and made them ſo neceſſary means of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52047:11"/>
Salvation, that he would accept of none into Heaven, but
ſuch as came thither as Martyrs through a flaming fire, or a
Sea of bloud.</p>
            <p>But God is not ſo fond of ſuffering, as to require them
for their own ſakes. We are not bound like <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts to
cut and flaſh our ſelves, that we may pleaſe our God. We
are not bound to move others to cut our Throats, or to
threaten to kill them, if they won't kill us, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
tells the <hi>Circumcellions</hi> did.</p>
            <p>We ought not to give advantages and opportunities to
wicked Men to execute their wicked purpoſes upon us. In
times of Perſecution we are not bound to go out of our
Houſes, and provoke an inraged multitude to throw us
in the Fires, or to the Lions. This raſhneſs has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by whole Councils; though at ſome time we may
and muſt leave Father, and Mother, and Houſe and Land,
and Life it ſelf for Chriſt's ſake and for the Goſpels, yet at
other times we may keep them as well. Tho the firſt
Chriſtians (<hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41.) did rejoice, that they were <hi>count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
worthy to ſuffer ſhame for Chriſts Name;</hi> and as it is
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. they <hi>took joyfully the ſpoiling of their
goods.</hi> Yet they did as much rejoice, and gave hearty
thanks to God when they ſuffered neither.</p>
            <p>We muſt ſuffer, when we are called to ſuffer; but we
are not bound to call to God to ſend ſufferings upon us.
We muſt take up the Croſs, when it lies in our way; but
we are not bound to go out of our way to find one; and
when we do take it up, we muſt remember to follow
Chriſt, who took it up when his hour was come; before
that he oft withdrew and preſerved himſelf from immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
dangers. And at the very laſt he ceaſed not to pray
to his Father, that the Cup might paſs from him. We are
not to bring upon our ſelves needleſs ſufferings, becauſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52047:11"/>
we are always bound to pray to God, that he would not
lead us into temptations, but that he would deliver us
from evil; And we are alwayes bound to believe that God
is both able and willing to deliver us, and that too at ſuch
times, when we know not any particular means, by which
deliverance ſhould come to us, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 13. 2 Pet. 2. 9.
Dan.</hi> 3. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>We may and muſt ſuffer ſometimes if it be the Will
of God; and we may eſcape, if God will find out the
way, and then we muſt accept of the deliverance, and we
may as well pleaſe when we ſo eſcape, as when we ſuffer.
It is not the Suffering, but the Cauſe that makes the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.
If we ſuffer <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 18. to give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
to the World of our ſincere faith in the Chriſtian
Doctrine, we may hope to be accepted; If we ſuffer for
Righteouſneſs ſake, we have a promiſe to be happy; If
we ſuffer for being true, juſt, or honeſt, we may commit
our Souls to God as to a faithful Creator; we do well, and
are ſatisfied in our own Conſciences that we do ſo, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we ſuffer, but becauſe we perſevere in doing our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to the end.</p>
            <p>Now if Men will call this Paſſive Obedience they may,
for here is Obedience, and here is Suffering; many advices
and exhortations ſeem to move for this; and it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worthy of the beſt thoughts of the Divines to teach it,
to perſuade the People to be ready upon occaſion to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
it; it is in it ſelf excellent, praiſe-worthy, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſays, a Duty which God and right Reaſon requires
of us; our bleſſed Lord, and his Apoſtles both taught and
practiſed it. All the Primitive Chriſtians, who had the
glory of being Martyrs and Confeſſors, acted from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
ſubmiſſion to it. All ſorts of Men ſee their Obligation
for it; which Heathens derive from a ſenſe they have of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52047:12"/>
Probity; Chriſtians from Faithfulneſs, Simplicity and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Kings as well as Subjects are bound to the practice,
when ever it can become their Duty, that is, when ever
their unhappy circumſtances are ſuch, that they muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuffer, or do ſomething which they account extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
baſe, wicked, or unjuſt. This the glorious Martyr
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt owned to be a truth, and ſealed it
with the laſt drop of his Bloud. The Duty is laid upon
all; the Intereſts of mankind require that it ſhould, for
without the obſervance of this Rule, all would be baſe,
and ſlaviſh, and degenerate; there would be nothing of
Vertue, or Praiſe, or Honour amongſt Men.</p>
            <p>But to leave this, there is another ſenſe of Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
as it is uſed to ſignifie a peculiar Duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
towards their own Prince; it is a Duty which Princes
do not owe to Princes, nor private Perſons to private
Perſons; for though they may ſuffer and die, each by the
means of the other, yet the ſufferer is under no ſuch
Duty as can be called Paſſive Obedience; upon which
account the Duty meant by the word in this ſenſe is quite
a different thing from what it was in the former. It
comes in as a ſubſidiary Duty to ſupply the place of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
which in certain caſes we cannot do. It is that
which Princes take inſtead of Obedience, and as it comes
from Subjects, it is ſometimes called Loyalty, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Submiſſion, and ſometimes Obedience, but with
ſuch a diſtinctive mark before it, <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi>
which ſpeaks it not to be that which is ordinarily meant
by the Name, but a very different Thing; ſometimes it
is explained as if it were no more than Non-reſiſtance,
and ſometimes as if it were a more excellent Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52047:12"/>
But however it is named or explained, certainly there
is a great Duty owing from Subjects to Princes, and
that not onely to the good, but to the bad, not onely
when they rule according to Law, and require nothing but
what is juſt and right: but when they go beyond Law,
and Reaſon, and command ſome things which are againſt
Conſcience and Religion, then they may be obeyed in
all things elſe, though they can't be obey'd in ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
points, though the Prince does not thereby loſe
his right, nor is the Subject leſs ſubject in all things
wherein he ought to be ſo. The Command of God
is, that we are to be ſubject to the Higher Powers; and
a like Command is, that we are to profeſs Chriſt before
men. If the Prince will command us to deny him, we
we cannot obey in that point. But yet we may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in all things elſe; we may live peaceably and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at home, if we be permitted to do ſo; we may give
the Prince all thoſe dues which St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi>
13. that is, Tribute, Cuſtom, Fear, Honour.</p>
            <p>We may love him, and truſt him too, as long as he will
be a Friend; but if he will be an Enemy, we muſt love
him, though we cannot truſt him. We cannot indeed do
any thing that is baſe, and wicked, to gratifie his humor,
his rage or fury; yet we may and ſhould fight for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all Enemies forein and domeſtick, to preſerve his
Perſon, and ſecure the good of our Country, when it is not
beyond all doubt that he employs us as Inſtruments of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
and Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus the Chriſtians did under <hi>Julian;</hi> They ſerved
him againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and they would have ſerved him
in any executions of Right and Juſtice; But they would not
have condemned the innocent, or cut the throats of the good,
nor yet have done any thing toward the ſubverſion of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52047:13"/>
Chriſtian Religion, though <hi>Julian</hi> himſelf had commanded
them.</p>
            <p>But where they cannot fight for, they are not to fight
againſt; though they cannot aſſiſt, yet they are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to oppoſe. <hi>Papinian</hi> the Lawyer would rather die,
than make a plauſible Speech to defend a bad action of his
Prince; but yet as long as he had lived, he might have
held his tongue, and ſaid nothing againſt it.</p>
            <p>It is a Duty to cover the nakedneſs of a Father, and
of a Prince; many things may be ill done, and many ſhould
be born, and ſuffered patiently, many ſhould be allowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the conſiderations of humane frailty, paſſion and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion;
what may be ill done may be repented of, and ſo
ought to be pardoned and forgotten.</p>
            <p>Subjects pardon one another, and oft beg the King's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and ſo may very well pardon their King too; becauſe
as he hopes better from them, they may hope for better
from him.</p>
            <p>The common Offices which Charity requires from one
private Chriſtian to another are certainly as well due to
Kings; Subjects muſt look upon themſelves under Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to ſuffer long, and to be kind, not to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unſeemly, not to ſeek their own, not to be eaſily
provoked, not to think evil; to bear all things, to believe
all things, to hope all things.</p>
            <p>If theſe Duties were but well diſcharged towards Princes,
all the reſt that can be truly comprehended under the name
of Paſſive Obedience would be much more eaſie.</p>
            <p>Let Subjects do theſe ſincerely and heartily, and ſtop a
little and think; they will ſoon find, that they muſt yield
more, and give greater allowances to Princes than to fellow-ſubjects;
becauſe they are higher Powers, they are ordained of
God, they bear the Sword, they are to execute wrath upon
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52047:13"/>
them that do evil; and they are to give Praiſe to them
that do good. Theſe things are of high conſideration, and
they ſhould beget in the minds of People a great Awe and
Veneration for the Perſons of Princes; for infinite are the
Advantages that every ſingle Man receives from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Juſtice, and the Diſtribution of Rewards
and Puniſhments. What if Praiſe and Wrath ſometimes
miſtake their way, and the firſt flies to the evil and the
latter to the good? This is no more than what God's own
Thunder does, as far as we can underſtand. The beſt
Marks man may ſometimes miſs, and the worſt hit the
Mark. When we undertake to vindicate God's Providence,
we are forced to bring in extrinſick Pleas; and when we
have done all, we confeſs that we do not underſtand the
reaſon of Events; but we believe that all is well, becauſe
all comes from God. If we did but uſe a little of like
Submiſſion when we examine the Actions of Princes, in
many Caſes we may be content to ſay, that we do not
underſtand; thereby we ſhall ſhew not only a Reverence
to them, but a Reverence to God too: they are but Men,
and may oft fail, and are always fallible; they do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
but the cauſe of their Miſtakes are moſtly from
Subjects; theſe deſign and contrive one againſt another,
and miſrepreſent, and the Prince hears from them, and ſees
by them; and the Law provides Puniſhments for thoſe
Miſrepreſenters, and acquits the Prince, becauſe it ſeems
impoſſible that one Man ſhould find out ſuch a number
of honeſt and good Men to ſupply all the Truſts which
he is to provide for, and never be cheated with one Knave;
therefore if ſuch a one will crowd in, the Prince is abuſed,
and it cannot be help'd; but the Knave is to be puniſhed,
and the Prince excuſed from blame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52047:14"/>
Beſides, The Work and Buſineſs of Princes is the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and moſt difficult that any ſort of Men upon Earth
have; becauſe they have ſo many to order, and ſo many
to defend; ſo many to reward, and ſo many to puniſh;
ſo many that expect from them, and ſo many that muſt
be diſappointed in their Expectations; ſo many to deal
withal that are falſe and baſe, and ſo many that are dull
and ſluggiſh; ſo many Knaves and ſo many Fools. Upon
theſe Accounts, and many others innumerable, Princes
ought to have all Favour, and all reaſonable Allowances
in Miſcarriages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all fair Abatements for Miſtakes and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
in the choice of Miniſters and Inſtruments that are
to ſerve the Intereſts of the Commonweal: For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that all the Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rules and Methods of conducting
publick Affairs, which the Wiſdom of Anceſtors for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Years have found out, will not anſwer all the
Behoofs of a Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Old Rules are oft laid aſide, other Expedients found
out, and new Laws made: All the Prudence, and all the
Wiſdom in every Age, when beſt imployed, is little enough
to keep Government ſteddy, and the People in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
to repreſs the Outrages of the Factious at home, and
give ſtop to the Contrivances of ambitious Enemies abroad,</p>
            <p>Princes therefore are to be ſupported, defended, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
pleaded for, as long as any plauſible Pleas can be made
for them: it is not enough that they are not taxed, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
reproached, calumniated, blackened; but there is
great reaſon that they ſhould be gently treated, kindly
dealt withal; the beſt Conſtruction and the faireſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
is to be put upon the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Actions.</p>
            <p>Law makes the Perſons of Kings ſacred, and their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not to be examined without great Reſpect and
Veneration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52047:14"/>
If Subjects ſuffer (not altogether according to Rule) loſs
of Goods, of Honors, of Powers, they may and ought to
bear it patiently, as long as they ſee any thing like Reaſon
for it, if they can but think that the Good of a Nation
requires it, that the Neceſſities of humane Affairs will have
it, or that their Sins againſt God call for it; they do well
to indulge themſelves in all ſuch meek and humbling
Thoughts; thereby they will really practiſe two great
Duties of Fearing God, and honoring their King.</p>
            <p>Thereby they ſhew their Abhorrence of Plots and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies,
of the Counſels of the Factious and Seditious;
that they have no part with thoſe who would overturn
Kingdoms and States, Princes and People, Religion and
Laws, to greaten themſelves, to advance Projects and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
Tricks and Humors of their own.</p>
            <p>They ſhew that they are good Men whilſt they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their private Concerns to the publick Good; and they
ſhew themſelves to be good Subjects, ſeeing they in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to their Prince bear all that which in reaſon can
be thought tolerable.</p>
            <p>They that do this, do a great Duty, a thing very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
in it ſelf; it is that which God requires, all that
which the Intereſts of Princes can need, and as much as
the Good of a Kingdom can allow.</p>
            <p>The excellent Divines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have
endeavoured with all Care and Attention to ingraft this
upon the Hearts and Minds of their Auditors; and they
have had extraordinary effects of their Labors: for if all
things be fairly conſidered ſince the beginning of K. <hi>James</hi>'s
Reign, it may perhaps be found, that no Nation in the
World did ever deport themſelves with greater Submiſſion,
Reſignation, and hearty Obedience toward a Prince, than
this has done. View the Actions of his Parliament, of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52047:15"/>
Nobility, Gentry, chief Burghers; reflect upon their Fears
and Jealouſies; and let him that can, challenge them for
the leaſt provoking Action, or neglect of their Duty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
all things tended to confound him and them too, about
the time of the fatal Deſertion. For what could the late
King wiſh? what could he deſire? Would he be great
and powerful? formidable to Enemies abroad, or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
at home? He had all things at Pleaſure; his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
gave him Monies beyond Example largely; his
Nobility raiſed him Forces; the Commonalty readily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
their Lives to ſerve him: he had Hands and Hearts
and Purſes of all Orders of Men at his Command; each
ſtrove to outvy the other in Loyalty and Dutifulneſs.
He had the beſt opportunity that ever Man had to be
great, if he could have been contented to have been King
of <hi>England,</hi> or would have conſidered that he was a King
of <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> Why ſhould he think his People to be Fools
or Raſcals, that they would part with their Laws or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
for an Humor, merely becauſe he thought that they
might be as well without them? Their Forefathers had
for many Ages paſt laboured hard to get their Laws fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fairly and evenly betwixt Prince and People, for the
good of both. And their Religion, at the Reformation,
had ſingular Advantages to be cleanſed from all the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
which Folly and Vanity had brought upon other
Churches: and the Profeſſors of it have in all Times ſince
been as induſtrious and curious to find out; and as free
and impartial to diſcover any thing that looked like Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
or Error in the firſt Settlement, as ever Men were.
We have all that Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught; all that
the Primitive Fathers recommended as Chriſtian Doctrine.
We can part with nothing (as the Papiſts own) becauſe
all we profeſs is pure and ſimple Chriſtianity; and if we
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52047:15"/>
would take in what they have ſuperadded, we muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to a moſt heavy Burden of groſs Cheats and Errors.</p>
            <p>But yet the late King would try, he would make the
Experiment whether we would be willing to part with
our Laws and our Religion: he would uſe his Art and
Policy to get them from us, and he has had the unhappy
Fate of Projectors.</p>
            <p>Upon this Account our Hiſtorian is not ſatisfied with
what we have done or ſuffered. He thinks himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to lay before us ſo many Sayings of our eminent
Divines, on purpoſe to convince us, that we have not
yet fulfilled all the Meaſures of a Paſſive Obedience: he
would have it thought, that we have apoſtatiſed from
the Doctrine of this Church; or, as he ſays, that this
Doctrine <hi>is more illuſtrious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> our Books than in our
Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truth is, we are not hanged; the Northern He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
is not yet extirpated; we are not put into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>French</hi> Refugees, that we ſhould be forced to
leave our Goods, and fly from our Country to ſave out
Lives. Our Church is preſerved, and we are delivered
from the Rage and Fury of petulant Enemies. We bleſs
God for this. If he be grieved, let him find out that
Fool who is willing to be hanged to gratifie his Humor
with a ſcurvy Sight, or to put him into a better Mood.
Neither can God nor Man pleaſe ſome Perſons.</p>
            <p>Paſſive Obedience is a Duty, but it is no further a
Duty than God hath made it to be ſo; it is large enough
of it ſelf, it will not endure to be put upon the Tenters;
if you ſtretch it never ſo little, you will make that which
is good in it ſelf to be ſtark naught: it is a Vertue as
long as it ſtands upon its own grounds; if it ſteps beyond
thoſe, it is no longer a Vertue, but a Fury.</p>

We muſt Obey we confeſs, and ſubmit to Suffering,
as far as God and Reaſon call for it; as far as publick
Good and the Conſtitution of the Government requires it.
But muſt we not only ſubmit, but court Suffering? muſt
we expoſe our ſelves to it? run upon it? make it our

            <p>A certain Divine has ſaid, and Hand in Margin directs

of that Paſſive Obedience. Do they ſin in this? Are
they diſobedient for this?</p>
            <p>Men ſubmit to the Outrages of a Prince, and ſo they
do to a Fever, or the Plague; and tho they ſubmit to
God's Providence under thoſe Calamities, yet they uſe
all fit and proper means to leſſen, to abate them, and
if poſſible to be recovered from them.</p>
            <p>In the utmoſt Extremities of Subjects, and higheſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
of Princes againſt Religion and Right, many things
may and ought to be done.</p>
            <p>1. They may make their Defences, and plead their Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Thus did S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and thus did S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and thus
did the Primitive Fathers when they could be heard; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52047:16"/>
when they could not, they publiſhed their Apologies,
and made the People Judges between their Prince and
them, by diſcloſing the merits of their Cauſe to all the
World. Our Savior himſelf encouraged them to this
by promiſing to give them a Mouth and Wiſdom, which
all their Adverſaries could not gainſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He promiſed them too the beſt Advocate that can be,
the Holy Spirit to ſpeak in them and for them; and that
too when Rulers and Governors, Kings and Princes
ſhould appear againſt them:</hi> Matt. <hi>x.</hi> 18. 20. Ye ſhall be
brought before Governors and Kings for my ſake: Take no
thought what ye ſhall ſpeak, for it is not ye that ſpeak, but
the Spirit of your Father.</p>
            <p>Our Reverend Biſhops, when of late they were brought
before Judges, I think for Chriſt's ſake and the Goſpel's
ſake, they did not wholly abandon themſelves to the Will
of their Prince, nor ſo act as if they thought it Duty
forthwith either to do or to ſubmit, either to pay him
Active or Paſſive Obedience; for when they could not do
the firſt, they did what they could to avoid the ſecond.
They ſtood upon the Defence, and uſed the beſt Mouths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and beſt Wiſdoms, the beſt Pleaders and Advocates in
the Nation, to juſtifie their Actions, to clear up their
Innocence. And tho that Vindication of themſelves did
more affect the Intereſts of the late King than if they
had raiſed up Arms againſt him: yet do I not hear that
any one of them has repented of it, nor do I ſee cauſe
why he ſhould.</p>
            <p>2. But then further, they may pray to God to find a way
for their Deliverance. All grant that <hi>Preces &amp; Lachrymae,</hi>
Prayers and Tears, are Weapons which the Chriſtian al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
may, and upon all occaſions ought to uſe; but
yet the Stretchers of this Doctrine, ere they are aware,
ſeem to extort theſe from us: for if it be our Duty to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52047:17"/>
give unto our Prince either ſo much in Active Obedience,
or in lieu of that, ſo much as is equivalent in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
of Paſſive, we cannot pray to God for deliverance;
becauſe we cannot pray to God to free us from giving to
our Prince his Rights, or to deliver us from doing our
Duties.</p>
            <p>3. We may accept of deliverance, and that in ways ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
without making the ſtricteſt examination of
all the niceties, doubts, ſcruples which may occur in the
caſe. Thus certainly St. <hi>Peter</hi> did in that remarkable
action related, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. He left his Chains, his Goal,
his Guards, and followed his Deliverer; tho he had all,
and many more cauſes for ſcruple, than thoſe which
now adays give ſo much trouble, and ſeem ſo inſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
For</p>
            <p>Firſt, He was committed to Priſon by his King; upon
that account, he might have thought it his Duty to obey
in all things lawful, and patiently to ſubmit in the reſt,
or elſe according to the other way of expreſſing it, That
what he could not give to his Prince in Active obedience,
he ought to make up in the Paſſive.</p>
            <p>Secondly, His King went in the way of Juſtice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to bring him to a Tryal. Upon that he might have
thought, that a ſecret withdrawing of himſelf would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparage
his Cauſe, and in the Opinion of others ſpeak him
guilty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. His King acted in behalf of the eſtabliſhed
Law, and Religion; <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, he was one who had
a great zeal for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Conſtitution, Polity and
Worſhip. Upon that account St. <hi>Peter</hi> might think, that
his King acted from Conſcience, according to his Duty, in
proſecuting of him, and therefore he was bound at the
command of his King, to declare plainly and openly, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52047:17"/>
what grounds he a private perſon undertook to draw
people off from the ſettlement, and a long and moſt legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſtabliſhed Worſhip to a new one, eſpecially he could
not but ſee, what himſelf taught, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. That it
is the Duty of every Chriſtian <hi>to be ready always to give
an anſwer to every man that asketh a reaſon of the hope
that is in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Caſe of his Guards, of the Keepers of the
Priſon-gates was moſt deplorable, he could not but ſee
that his eſcape would be charged and revenged upon
them: upon that he might think, that he ought not to
do evil that good may come of it; to ſave his own life, he
ought not to give cauſe and reaſon for executing of ſo
many innocent Men.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There is another thing, which though much
leſs, yet may give matter of ſcruple; for what will not?
that in this ſudden flight, it is not likely that he ſhould
pay his Jaylor for Fees or Diet. Upon this account he
might think, that his Honeſty would be queſtioned, and
he would be accuſed of doing wrong and defrauding ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his dues, and that other Chriſtians who ſhould
afterwards be committed, would ſuffer hardſhip and ill
uſage for his ſake, and therefore he had better ſtay where
he was, and give his Jaylor, and his Prince, and the
Law, all they could require, and take from him; and ſo
pay down a compleat Paſſive Obedience in full meaſure
and tale by dying, to gratifie his Prince's humor; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the Reward of his Action from God.</p>
            <p>This he might have thought; but he did not, for he
followed his Deliverer out of the Priſon, and took care to
make good his deliverance, by abſconding for near five
years after, as Computers reckon it. Had he been under
thoſe ſtrait boundaries of Conſcience in this caſe, which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52047:18"/>
others think they are; Had he had their Rules of Duty; could
he have ſeen it to be his Duty to ſtay in Priſon, and ſuffer
according to the will of his King; he could not have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his Deliverer, though he had been an Angel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8.
and he could never have prevailed upon himſelf to have
believed, that an Angel of God would have moved him
to act contrary to his Duty.</p>
            <p>He accepted of deliverance, and the whole Church that
then was, bleſſed God for it; and in like caſes ſo may and
ought others to do, and that without penetrating into all
the grounds of nicety and ſcruple, which Men ſeldom do,
but when they deſign to ſeem extraordinary; and then
uſually they refine upon Morality, and ſet down Rules of
Duty, which neither Humane Nature can bear, nor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
requires, and for the moſt part they are againſt
the good of Societies, and do alike miſchief to Kings as to
Subjects.</p>
            <p>Seeing then we are not by Gods Law ſo abandoned
to the will and humor of a Man, though he be our King,
but that when he proceeds in Methods of doing wrong
and injury, of ruling by Power againſt Law; we may flee
from him; we may plead our Cauſe and Right againſt
him; we may pray to God to give a ſtop to him; and we
may accept of deliverance from him. We muſt ſay that the
modern Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience is ſtretched beyond
its bounds; for we are not obliged to make it our buſineſs
to give and pay him that, which he has no right to take;
we are not obliged to put our ſelves into his way, and
give him opportunity to cut our throats. We are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
not to move others to intercede for us, and if they
can with juſtice, to defend and preſerve us; we are not
obliged to refuſe a deliverance, if it comes to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52047:18"/>
But if Force prevails, and we are to be knock'd down
by Violence, againſt Right and Juſtice, we muſt take
care to fall as decently as we can, ſubmitting to God's
Providence, and giving all reſpects to our King as far as
our Caſe will allow, if our Calamity comes from him.
For this will bring credit to our Memories, and to our
Religion; and may do good to others who ſhall be in
our condition, by appeaſing of wrath and diſpleaſure,
how unjuſtly ſoever conceived againſt them or us.</p>
            <p>I will end this Diſcourſe with one Remark upon the
Caſe of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> He was a noble inſtance of a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Obedience: he ſubmitted entirely to the Will
of his Father, and of his King; for <hi>Abraham</hi> was both
to him: but yet the Praiſe of that wondrous Action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<hi>Gen.</hi> 22. falls to the Father, and not to the Son.
Much is ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, and little of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
whatever other Reaſons there are for it, one
is very obvious and plain, That it might not be a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from whence Kings might meaſure their Rights,
and Subjects their Duties.</p>
            <p>So much of <hi>Obedience, Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive.</hi> The next
thing to be treated of is the Doctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance.</hi>
This our Hiſtorian tells us has been avowed by the
Church of <hi>England</hi> ever ſince the Reformation; Preachers
and Writers, have declared for it, and that with a great
deal of warmth, and much advantage, eſpecially in lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
days. Upon this Account he would have it thought,
That Men have ſwerved from their Principles, and that
this Doctrine, as well as the other, is more illuſtrious in
Writings than in Lives. Now this Cenſure I challenge
to be very hard and unreaſonable, becauſe it does not
appear, that thoſe Men who preached up Non-reſiſtance
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52047:19"/>
before, have ever preached for Reſiſtance ſince; nor have
they who perſuaded others to Non-reſiſtance reſiſted
themſelves. The Preachers ſuffered in King <hi>James</hi> his
Time all that he laid upon them, and that with patience
enough; and ſince his Deſcrtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have had no
Temptation to ſpeak either of Reſiſtance or Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
for the truth is, that this is one of thoſe ſort of
Doctrines, which is in the Text, but is not yet got into
the Creed; it may come into the Pulpit, and may be
kept out of it: it will neither do King nor People good,
but when external Emergencies call for it. In peaceable
and quiet Times, when Law and Juſtice flouriſh, and
there is little complaining either in Houſe or Street; if
Preachers harangue upon Non-reſiſtance, they puzzle and
confound the People, and give 'em ill Work, to find
out poſſible Cauſes of Reſiſtance, and to examine the
Grounds and Reaſons for Non-reſiſtance. But when the
People grow peeviſh and froward, quarrelling and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
againſt, daring and deſigning upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
then the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance, and S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Text for it, may be brought forth to awe and ſcare them,
to terrifie and affrighten them, to allay their heat and
fury, and to bring them to a more diſcreet Temper, to
the Exerciſe of Chriſtian Patience and Modeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon
this account many have much commended the Labors of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> Divines in the late Times of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſts
and Oppoſitions, of Plottings and Counter-plottings,
becauſe they did much good in ſupporting of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and for the reſtraining of the Madneſs of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and toward the prevention of Inteſtine Broils and
Civil War.</p>
            <p>But yet ſeeing the Preaching or not Preaching upon
that Subject is matter of Prudence, and depends upon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52047:19"/>
times and ſeaſons, and many by conſiderations, from
whence it may either do good or harm: it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
that Sermons of that ſort were not every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with the like favour and ſubmiſſion. Becauſe ſome
feared that great Evil to the Kingdom and Nation might
come from them, inaſmuch as they naturally tended not
only to tame and ſubdue the People, by allaying their
zeal for their Civil Rights and Intereſts; but likewiſe they
might embolden evil Miniſters and Counſellors to ſet the
King upon the pernicious Project of making his advantage
of the Subjects good nature and eaſineſs toward the ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Religion, Laws, Rights, and the enſlaving of
the whole People.</p>
            <p>For that reaſon many ſaid, that the Preachers were too
warm and went beyond their boundaries; for they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
ſometimes to treat upon matters that were only to
be concerted betwixt the King and his People in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
they did not think that the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Law of God, tho it is not altogether the ſame
with <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Declaration, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. They did not think
that God would damn Men for defending and ſecuring in
all juſt, and fair ways thoſe Rights which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from their Forefathers, by vertue of a National
Conſtitution, that has remained one and the ſame for ſome
Hundreds of years.</p>
            <p>They obſerved, that there is but one Text declaring the
damnation of Subjects reſiſting; but there are Hundreds
that threaten as highly Kings and Governors, and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
who are injurious and oppreſſive of thoſe that are
under them. Now if Charity govern Men in the choice
of that Subject, and it be deſigned to ſave the Souls of the
People from damnation; they wiſhed that there were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed
a little Charity toward the Souls of Kings, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52047:20"/>
they too might be reſcued from the damning ſin of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
And it was thrown our (with an <hi>under Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>)
that if Kings would venture againſt ſo many Texts
upon Gods pardon, to enlarge their Powers, the People
might as well venture againſt one to preſerve their Rights.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it was ſomewhat ſharply and angrily ſaid by
the Men who had been intruſted in Parliaments and in the
management of publick Affairs, That ſeeing the Clergy
challenged ſpiritual Powers by vertue of the Text, and
would not allow Kings or Parliaments to limit, abridge,
or ſtraiten their Rights; They might well leave the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Power to the Text too, which is the Law of the
Land, and the proper Interpreters of it, which is a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and not preſume dogmatically to determine againſt
the uſe of that which at ſometimes is the onely natural
and neceſſary means to obtain and ſecure to themſelves
Right and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Thus Men differed and ſpake their thoughts freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the uſefulneſs and effects of thoſe Diſcourſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as to the point of Prudence in the timing of them.
But yet whatever they ſaid, it is manifeſt that the Preachers
deſigned no baſe or mean thing, to betray their Countrey,
their Religion, or the Laws, to the arbitrary diſpoſition of the
King, whilſt they perſuaded to Chriſtian Patience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
becauſe the ſame Men that preached up Non-reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
did with Courage and Spirit enough in proper time
and place appear in the behalf of the Laws and the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Religion, both againſt Popery, and againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
uſurpation of the peoples Rights: and if at other times
they did any thing toward the correcting a tumultuous and
rebellious humor, to prevent Civil War and Confuſion; the
Nation has the benefit of their labours, and all perſons of
Juſtice and Equity owe them due thanks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52047:20"/>
But yet our Hiſtorian is as angry, as if a Hare had croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him in the way, ſomething has happened which he
thought not of, and who can help that? He might have
thought better. They are in, and perhaps he is out; for
that reaſon he will think, that they have changed their
Principles: Alas, this is groſs miſtake. They did their duty
in declaring to the people, that they ought not to reſiſt, but
they never became Warrantees to the late King, that in caſe
of Wrong and Injury they would not. All the World
knows, that it is good for a Nation, that the People
ſhould think, that they ought not upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
reſiſt their King; ſo that the King does but at the
ſame time remember, that Oppreſſion makes a wiſe Man
mad, and that an injured people always did, and always
will endeavour to recover or ſecure their Rights, as well
againſt their King, as againſt their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>He muſt have rare Skill in Language and Argument, who
can prevail upon a people to be willing to be Slaves, when
they may, and ought to be free; or to ſtand ſtill and ſee
their Goods taken from them, merely becauſe another has
a mind to them. If they muſt loſe in one kind, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to gain ſome other way; for generally they are of Saint
<hi>Peter</hi>'s mind, when he ſaid to our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 19. 27.
We have forſaken all, and followed thee; what ſhall we have
therefore?</hi> The Queſtion deſerved an Anſwer, and upon it
our Saviour gave a moſt gracious promiſe of advantages in
this World, and in the other too.</p>
            <p>Had we the like Promiſe in the Caſe of Submiſſion or
Non-reſiſtance to Princes, who will be Abſolute and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Divines would have a better Argument, and might
expect better effects of their Diſcourſes. But ſeeing the
Non-reſiſters have no promiſe of Pardon for their other
ſins, and ſo of Salvation, the Non-reſiſters, who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52047:21"/>
all, muſt come to S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Query, and ask, What
ſhall we have therefore? And the Reſiſters who have ſaved
all, will hope to eſcape damnation as well for that ſin, as
for all the reſt.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that there are many and good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from Reaſon, from Policy, from Law, from Scripture
for Submiſſion, or Non-reſiſtance of Kings, and that of bad
as well as good, and in moſt caſes too.</p>
            <p>But when the main ſtreſs of the Aſſertion is laid upon
one Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which threatens no leſs than damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Offenders againſt that Point; there muſt be great
care taken to fix the true ſenſe of the Text, or elſe Men
will deduce from thence very incredible things, which will
eaſily be diſcovered to be falſe; and ſo inſtead of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
a Duty, they will blemiſh it, and beget in the
people a diſguſt to it. And who knows but ſome of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Clergy in the late times might offend in this kind;
ſeeing it was generally ſaid that they had too great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
for a buſie Writer, who then preſumed to lay down
monſtrous and deſtructive Principles againſt the National
Conſtitution, and yet dared to challenge to himſelf the Title
of being a gentle Guide, or humble Hinter to thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Tho he and they did make great uſe of that Text,
yet both might be miſtaken in the ſenſe of it; it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
and it is poſſible that their miſtakes in the event
may have done good to the Nation; for extravagant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
like harſh Phyſick many times operates the quite
contrary way from what was deſigned.</p>
            <p>After all their noiſe and pudder, I muſt ſay, that I do not
find that Men have ſpoken clearly either the Nature of
the Sin, or the Weight of the Puniſhment; They do not
tell us what Reſiſtance ſignifies, nor yet who are the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and onely Objects of a damning Reſiſtance, nor yet
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52047:21"/>
laſtly, whether Damnation in the Text ſpeaks nothing leſs
than downright Hell and Eternity of Torments; for many
ſins may be in their nature damnable, but they that have
committed them, need not preſently be concluded certainly
to be damned.</p>
            <p>Denials, Refuſals, Oppoſitions made againſt Opinions,
Deſires, Demands, eſpecially if others be ſolicited to join
in with the Oppoſers, may in a large ſenſe be ſaid to be
Reſiſtances; but yet ſuch actions may be far enough from
being damning ſins, or elſe many times woful muſt be the
condition of Privy Counſellors, of Parliament Men, Lords
and Commons, and of Judges, who will not allow of Kings
Patents, which are againſt Law.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe ſuch a Caſe ſhould have happened amongſt us,
which once was betwixt <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Naboth;</hi> muſt he that
acted <hi>Naboth</hi>'s part be damned for refuſing to part with or
exchange his Inheritance?</p>
            <p>Or ſuppoſe ſuch another clowniſh Churl as <hi>Nabal,</hi> who
ſent the unmannerly anſwer to <hi>David;</hi> or had it been to
<hi>Saul,</hi> a King in poſſeſſion; If in conſequence to that Anſwer,
when the Commiſſioned Officers came againſt him, to kill
and ſpoil him, and all his, he had appealed to Law, and
ſtood upon his defence, till the matters were brought to a
legal Trial, he might be ſaid then to have reſiſted; and
therefore perhaps he might have deſerved to have been
whipped for his ſaucineſs; but it is ſomewhat too much
to think that he muſt needs be damned for it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>David</hi>'s caſe is much worſe, when his Maſter
ſought his life, he liſted Soldiers, and ſeiſed upon ſtrong
Holds; and ſtood upon his defence in a way that looks
like open defiance, ſo far was he from ſubmitting or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring
himſelf to <hi>Saul</hi>'s Officers, or <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf; and
after all we do not find that he repented of this Sin, or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52047:22"/>
begg'd God's pardon for it. What now, can we have no
hopes of God's mercy toward <hi>David?</hi> Muſt he for that
reſiſtance certainly be damned; or if he had a particular
Diſpenſation from God; yet I fear his Soldiers had not;
and their caſe muſt then be deplorable; for the reaſon
and juſtice of Gods proceedings in the caſe was the ſame
always, and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Text does not ſeem to ſpeak a new
deſignment of God to raiſe the Intereſts of Kings higher;
and ſubject the People lower than they were before. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
therefore for <hi>David</hi>'s ſake ſhould be thought on, that
the Text ſhould be ſo limited that we may have ſome hopes
for him, and for his Soldiers too.</p>
            <p>But yet we have a nearer Caſe that is piteous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
ſome thoughts, and that is the Caſe of <hi>George Walker</hi>
poor Man, he is one of <hi>Solemon</hi>'s wiſe Ones, who by his
wiſdom has ſaved his City; He has done a brave Action,
and all that hear it, commend and admire it, excepting
the late King's Soldiers, and perhaps in their hearts they
admire him too. But after all the praiſes and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the generality of Mankind, and thoſe coming
freely and ſincerely upon the ſuppoſition of true Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
without deſign of daubing or flattering the great and
the proud: muſt (I ſay) this Man after all this be thrown
into Hell, and damned as one of the worſt of Miſcreants?
Such judgments as theſe will confound the genuine and
moſt delightful Idea's that Men have of God's Goodneſs,
and Wiſdom; they may ſerve perhaps to adorn a Diſcourſe
for abſolute Reprobation, or upon the excellency of damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for damnings ſake, without regard to Sin; but they
can have little other uſe for glory to God, or Man; for
good of King or People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:52047:22"/>
Theſe, and many other Caſes ought to be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
before we fix the Sence of the Text; becauſe, as
in all Sciences, one Truth agrees with another; ſo in
the Interpretation of Scripture, every ſingle Text that
ſtands by it ſelf, muſt be expounded according to the
Analogy of Faith, that is, the general Agreement of
the reſt.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, There is further Matter of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about the Perſon that is to have the Benefit of
<hi>Non-reſistance,</hi> it is many times very difficult to diſcover
who He is; and it would be hard, if upon a Miſtake
in that point, the erring Perſon ſhould be damned in
the ſtrict ſence of the Word.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething that governs in human Affairs,
beyond the Thoughts and Imaginations of Men; the
Wheel goes ſmoothly on, but of a ſudden meets with
a rub, and the Carriage, perhaps, is overturned, the
headleſs Multitude then ſtare and wonder, and ſay the
like was never ſeen before, and yet the like has oft
happened. What ſeemed to be ruled is over-ruled, and
then men ſeek for their Rule, and know not where to
find it: Thus men are almoſt fatally confounded,
they think and act contrary to one another, and yet
each believes himſelf in the right, and that he has
ſtrength and clearneſs of Reaſon on his ſide. Its very
poſſible that our Hiſtorian is ſtill for King <hi>James,</hi> and
thinks him now as truly King of <hi>England</hi> as he was
before: And it is very likely, that I am for King
<hi>William,</hi> and think him as truly, and as much King,
as ever King <hi>James</hi> was. We do not ſtand in the
ſame light, we do not think of the ſame things, and
ſo we differ. And had we lived in many other Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
of time, it is very likely that we might have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
too: Had we lived when <hi>Saul</hi> was made King
over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I know not but he might have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52047:23"/>
him, and I for him. At <hi>Saul</hi>'s death it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that he might have been for <hi>Saul</hi>'s Son <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi>
and I for <hi>David.</hi> At <hi>David</hi>'s death, he might have been
for <hi>Adonijah,</hi> and I for <hi>Solomon:</hi> For <hi>Adonijahs</hi> Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
are very taking, he was the eldeſt Son then living
of King <hi>David,</hi> he was a goodly Perſonage, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Darling. 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. Yet my <hi>Solomon</hi> reigned,
and the People obeyed with a very good Conſcience;
and that though he himſelf was ſomewhat ſuſpitious of
his Title; for he did not truſt to his Anointing by King
<hi>David</hi>'s order, but got himſelf to be made King a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 22. But to go on, Let us paſs
over the inſtances of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> of <hi>Zimri</hi>
and <hi>Omri,</hi> and many others who gave occaſions to like
difficulties. Suppoſe we had lived in the days, when
<hi>Jehu</hi> took poſſeſſion of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is very
poſſible that he might have been for <hi>Joram,</hi> or <hi>Joram</hi>'s
Son, or ſome of the Family of <hi>Ahab;</hi> and it is as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that I might have been for <hi>Jehu,</hi> he for a King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the modern Phraſe, <hi>de jure;</hi> and I for a King
<hi>de jure,</hi> and <hi>de facto</hi> too. For he was a Conqueror, tho'
not of the People (neither he, nor they ever thought
ſo) yet of the King he was; and ſo if the Cauſe of the
War was juſt, his Title was certainly good: Some
think he was a Rebel, I am not concerned to diſpute that
Point; but if he were, he came to the Throne in the
ſame way that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did, who was the firſt beginner
of that Kingdom, and ſo could tranſmit to his Succeſſors
no more Title to the Regal Dignity than he had himſelf:
Be that as it will, let my Adverſary be for <hi>Joram,</hi> or <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>'s
Son, and I for <hi>Jehu;</hi> he has the Point of Loyalty to
a late King on his ſide, and I the Point of Loyalty to
my God on my ſide; both great Pleas. But at ſuch a
time mine ſeems (at leaſt to me) to be the better; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is ſomething in Religion that tyes me faſter
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52047:23"/>
to my God, than any thing elſe can tye another to his
Prince: Now if an <hi>Ahab</hi> or a <hi>Joram,</hi> will not only be
diſloyal to their God, but require me, and uſe all the
Tricks and Slights in the World to gain me, and the reſt
of the People, to a like Diſloyalty; if he will daringly
and boldly trample upon the Religion eſtabliſhed by Law;
if he will require abſolute Obedience, and Obedience
without Reſerve, and make his Will the Law, and me,
without Law, or pretence to Law, his Slave; Why muſt
I in ſuch a Caſe as this, be againſt my God, and againſt
my ſelf, for one who has the Name of King, but has
thrown away from him all that which ſhould, and all
that which can ſpeak him in the Exerciſe of true Kingly
Power over <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot tell, but ſome may think me in the wrong,
for declaring to be for God and <hi>Jehu,</hi> againſt <hi>Baal</hi> and
<hi>Joram;</hi> but if I am, I may be rectified by being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that either now there is, or ever was ſuch a man,
who could perſwade himſelf that any one true Servant
of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in thoſe days, did not heartily
cloſe in with <hi>Jehu,</hi> and ſubmit to his Government; or
that any Worſhipper of <hi>Baal,</hi> who was ſo in reality,
did do it; and then there could be no Grumbletonians in
thoſe days, except the Halters, thoſe that were betwixt
God and <hi>Baal,</hi> and could be very indifferent whether
they worſhipped the one or the other.</p>
            <p>Thus we muſt ſee, that the things which are, have
been of old; there are difficulties in human Affairs, and
men have had great Grounds to differ about the Subject
of Regal Power, and ſo about the Object of <hi>Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
and that not only in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but as might be eaſily
ſhewn among the <hi>Aſſyrians, Perſians, Romans, Britains,
Engliſh,</hi> and very much in this Nation, ſince the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52047:24"/>
Now this difficulty may be an Argument to move
Men not to be over-poſitive, in determining, that Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
in the ſtrict ſenſe, ſhall be the Portion either of the
one or the other, in caſe he acts ſincerely according to his
beſt knowledge, whether he ſtands up for his King, or
his God; whether he ſtands to Defend a former King
in the Rights he had, or another who takes poſſeſſion
upon the ſuppoſition of a Deſertion or a Conqueſt:
Whether he be willing to have continued, or to have
been made a Slave, and loſe his civil Rights, and the
Exerciſe of the true Religion; or whether he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have been made free, and ſo let eaſily into
his Rights, by the Aſſiſtance of another who might
juſtly do it; and if he would, might have left 'em in
full enjoyment of their folly and miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the Puniſhment here denounced by
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Damnation, whether nothing leſs
can or ought to be underſtood by it, but down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Hell or Eternity of Torments. Here many things
ought to be well weighed before we determin poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
in ſo great a point. As 1. That all Men agree,
that there are different Senſes of this Word in Scripture.
2. Commentators do much differ and contend about the
true meaning of it in this place. And tho' Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
be reſolute in this aſſertion, yet by the multitude of
Objections, which in his Notes he labours to anſwer,
he ſhews that his Opinion was neither general nor
clear. 3. That as the Commentators differ, ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
ſeem ſomewhat to differ too. For what is
in King <hi>James</hi>'s Tranſlation, <hi>ſhall receive to themſelves
Damnation,</hi> is in the Biſhops Bible (Tranſlated in Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time) <hi>ſhall receive to themſelves Judgment.</hi>
Some may think that both theſe words ſignify the ſame:
But if they caſt an Eye upon another Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 16.
they will hardly do it, for theſe we have, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52047:24"/>
and that is rendred in the Biſhops Tranſlation; <hi>for the
fault came unto Condemnation,</hi> but in King <hi>James</hi>'s it is,
<hi>for the Judgment was to Condemnation.</hi> Fault or Judgment,
here, is not the ſame with Damnation, or Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but that which leads to it. And if we look into
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 12. it will be worthy of a little remark: That
tho' the Tranſlators differ in the former places; yet
they intirely agree to render here the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by
Damnation; but if you look into St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and
moſt of the old Writers, and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> himſelf;
you will find that Hell-puniſhment is by no means to
be underſtood in that Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is to be obſerved further, that as Men
differ concerning the nature of the puniſhment, ſo they
differ concerning the quality of the ſin. Some tell us
that the Apoſtle means here a very monſtrous ſin, a
ſin as black as Hell it ſelf; and then they tell us that
the demerits of it are no leſs than Hell Torments: Others
ſpeak of a ſin which they deſcribe with all poſſible
alleviating circumſtances; and as the ſin they ſpeak of,
is quite of another nature from the other, ſo the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
is, which they ſuppoſe to be allotted to it.
Now if Men did agree about the ſin, there could be
little diſpute about the puniſhment. The Reverend Dr.
<hi>Hammond</hi> in his Paraphraſe on the firſt verſe of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.
ſays, That the Apoſtles advice is contrary to the Doctrine
and Practice of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> and he referrs us to the
<hi>8th.</hi> verſe of St. <hi>Jude</hi>'s Epiſtle, to ſee what that was;
and there we have an account of a company of wretched
woful ſinners, ſuch as no Man now in <hi>Europe</hi> would be
in the leaſt concerned to pity, if he thought that Hell-Torments
were decreed for them; and ſo in reference to
them, Damnation in the Text may be interpreted in
the ſtricteſt, and moſt ſevere Senſe. They are deſcribed
<hi>Jude 8th.</hi> as filthy Dreamers, that defile the Fleſh, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52047:25"/>
Dominion, and ſpeak evil of Dignities: Upon which
words, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Paraphraſe ſays, <hi>That they
fall into all unnatural filthy Practices, and teach the Doctrine
of Chriſtian Liberty, ſo as to free all Chriſtians from all
Authority of Maſter or KING.</hi> Here we have two
Characteriſtick Notes of them, that they were moſt
impudently declaring againſt all manner of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and againſt all manner of Vertuous Life.
Now to both theſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in the 13. <hi>chap.</hi> to
the <hi>Rom.</hi> to the Firſt, <hi>verſes</hi> 1, 2, and 3. and to the
Laſt, <hi>verſes</hi> 13, 14; and therefore it is poſſible, as the
Dr. hints, that St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Diſcourſe in that Chapter, is
intirely directed againſt theſe.</p>
            <p>And perhaps the Author of the <hi>Preface</hi> to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of PASSIVE OBEDIENCE, is of the ſame
Opinion in the caſe, becauſe he brings in an excellent
Divine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and now one of our
Right Reverend Fathers in God, ſpeaking their ſin and
folly in theſe words; <hi>The Gnoſticks thought all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
of the World to be nothing elſe, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of ſome evil ſpirits, to abridge Men of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
which God and Nature had given them; and that
this is the ſpeaking evil of Dignities, which they are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with by St.</hi> Jude. Now if theſe be the Men, and
that the ſin which St. <hi>Paul</hi> provides againſt in the
13. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> there can be no diſpute in the Chriſtian
World concerning the ſenſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the
Text; as it is, ſo it ought to be rendred Damnation, or
the Puniſhment of Hell.</p>
            <p>But then, When the ſame Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Notes
(perhaps forgetting what he had hinted in his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe)
deſcribes another ſin, and cloathes that with
all poſſible alleviated circumſtances, and will have down-right
Damnation, or Hell Torments to be the Puniſhment
which Gods Juſtice deſigns for it; it is no marvel that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52047:25"/>
he finds many Objections, and hard work to anſwer
them.</p>
            <p>If he would but allow the word to be interpreted
as it has been either by <hi>Fault,</hi> or <hi>Judgment,</hi> or <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in that leſſer ſenſe, in which it is uſed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 12.
He would neither find nor make any matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy;
for all will readily grant, that Reſiſtance of
a King, in moſt, almoſt all Caſes, is a fault, and leads
to Judgment, and will certainly bring to Damnation,
at leaſt, in the ſenſe, the word is uſed in the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Text.</p>
            <p>Theſe things well conſidered, may divert men from
raſh and haſty Judgments, and move them not to be
eaſy in the declaring the Damnation of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
who may be urged by a ſenſe of extream ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
to do thoſe things which they would not, ſince
they have not ſo clear a Text, as they imagined, to
ſupport the weight of their aſſertion. Becauſe it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that the ſin meant in the Text may be ſuch as
can now be charged upon no Man; and it is poſſible
that the word Damnation there, may have no ſuch
dreadful ſignification, as in ſome certain places it has.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I have ſet down, not by any means to
incourage Reſiſtance againſt Princes; for that, in moſt
Caſes, is a great ſin, and every ſin tends to Damnation.
But I would move men to frame their Pleas againſt it,
from proper Heads, and ſuch as are moſt likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
Becauſe, generally, ſcaring and affrightning Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
if they be not very clear, and well grounded,
do but beget Suſpitions and Doubts, fill men with Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
make them ſtiff and pertinacious in their Miſtakes,
and heedleſs of ſober Inſtructions in undoubted Duties.
Obedience is the thing that is due to Princes, and muſt
be paid to them, as well for our own ſakes, as for theirs,
as well for Conſcience ſake towards God, (who is a God
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52047:26"/>
of Order, and not of Confuſion) as upon the Account
of Wrath, and for fear of Puniſhment: For if we don't
obey, he can neither ſecure himſelf, or protect us; it
can ſcarcely happen, that he can ſuffer alone; in ſuch a
caſe, he himſelf muſt be the Author of his own Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
He muſt ſap the Foundations upon which his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
ſtands, and cut down the Pillars that would have
Supported him. Thus he may be overwhelmed on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and his People not ſuffer much, but in the general
courſe of things, King and People go together; if one ſuffer,
all ſuffer. And therefore it is the Intereſt, as well as the
Duty of People, to obey; this they apprehend, and are
ready to comply with all; and that without taking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thought, the nice Speculations about the outmoſt
ſtretch of Power; or what are the higheſt, and what
may be the loweſt Meaſures of Submiſſion: What a
King may take, and what they may, and ought, or
ought not to yield. The Talk of <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
men think) does little good in the World; and
the Talk of Reſiſtance, in a certain Caſe, does as little
harm: For where <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> is moſt cryed up, and
ſtrongly avowed, there have been moſt vigorous Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
and where there has been a Reſiſtance owned
as lawful in a certain Caſe, there has been a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Obedience, and no Reſiſtance at all. Of the
firſt, <hi>England</hi> is an Inſtance; of the ſecond, <hi>Rome:</hi> I
muſt profeſs, it is ſtrange and puzzling to me, and may
be ſo to others, to compare the Doctrine of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
with the Doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and to ſee both
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> quite contrary effects, from what
their Doctrines tends to: Our Men call for <hi>Non-Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;</hi>
and will not allow of any Reſiſtance of the
King, or thoſe Commiſſioned by him upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
whatſoever. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us plainly, that the
higheſt Power, the very Supream, as he thinks of all,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52047:26"/>
the very Pope himſelf may be reſiſted, and that with Gun
and Sword, with Force and Arms, in a certain Caſe;
and yet the Pope never complains of this, the Papacy
receives no harm by this, and there is no Reſiſtance
made againſt him, but profound Obedience is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. But then there is not the ſame effect of the
Doctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> amongſt us; for the Divines
moſt engaged in teaching of it, and founding their Hopes
and Expectations upon it, do now complain of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Diſappointments, and ſeem to think the World
mad, or at leaſt very fooliſh, that they do not meet
with an intire Compliance with it.</p>
            <p>There muſt be a great Miſtake ſome where or other,
and yet it is ſtrange there ſhould be one in ſuch a Caſe
as this, which lyes clear and open alike to all. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
certainly ſaw all the difficulties that our Divines do,
and our Divines ſee all the Reaſons that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did,
and yet both are reſolute in the Contradictory: It is
pretty to conſider the Thoughts of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the Caſe;
after he had wrote his five Books <hi>de Pontifice,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſet up his Pope as high, as high may be, next and
immediately under God himſelf, Chriſt's Vicar, ſupreme
over all, Emperours, Kings, Princes, Nations, Countries,
and that by divine Right, Warrant, and Authority; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
to all the Tribunals in this World, judge of
all, and to be judged by none. He then falls to write of
the Authority of Councils, and goes on ſtill in the ſame
way to mount his Pope, as well over all Church-Power,
as over all Temporal. And having done this, any one
would think, that he had made a compleat irreſiſtable,
or a moſt proper Object of <hi>Non-reſiſtance:</hi> But <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
thinks not ſo; for he thinks again, that this his
wonderful great one is yet but a man, and poſſibly he
may commit Faults, he may miſ-rule, miſ-govern; he
may deſign to ſubvert the Conſtitution of the Church, he
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52047:27"/>
may endeavour to ruine and to deſtroy it: Upon that
he queries, Whether the Church, in ſuch a Caſe, has no
Remedy, no help, nothing to do toward its own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
muſt it needs ſink and fall, becauſe a certain
man is willing it ſhould? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſays no, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
ſeveral Methods to be uſed for the ſupport of it,
which are ſofter, more decent, and mannerly; but after
all, if they ſhould fail, he ſpeaks roundly that this Pope
is to be reſiſted, to be oppoſed <hi>Vi &amp; Armis,</hi> with Force
and Arms; and that in ſuch a Caſe, there needs no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to juſtifie the Action of thoſe that reſiſt him.</p>
            <p>His own Words are theſe, <hi>de Concilior. Auctor. Lib. 2.
C.</hi> 19. At inquiunt, ergo ſola Eccleſia ſine Remedio ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
ſi habet malum Pontificem, &amp; poterit Pontifex im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punè
omnes vexare, &amp; perdere, &amp; nemo reſiſtere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terit.</p>
            <p>Reſpondeo, non mirum, ſi manet Eccleſia ſine Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio
humano efficaci, quandoquidem non nititur ſalus ejus
praecipuè humana induſtria, ſed divina protectione, cum
ejus Rex Deus ſit. Itaque etiamſi Eccleſia non poſſit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere
Pontificem, tamen poteſt ac debet Domino ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicare,
ut ipſe Remedium adhibeat: Et certum eſt,
Deo fore curae ejus ſalutem; qui tamen Pontificem, vel
convertet, vel de medio tollet, antequam Eccleſiam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruat.
Nec tamen hinc ſequitur, non licere reſiſtere
Pontifici Eccleſiam deſtruenti; licet enim eum ſervata
reverentia admonere, &amp; modeſtè corripere, repugnare
etiam vi &amp; armis, ſi Eccleſiam deſtruere velit: Ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtendum
enim, &amp; vim vi repellendam non requiritur
ulla Auctoritas.</p>
            <p>That is in Engliſh thus, by way of Objection and
Anſwer.</p>
            <p>But they ſay, then the Church only is without Remedy,
if ſhe has an ill Pope, and the Pope may ſecurely vex and
deſtroy, and none may reſiſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52047:27"/>
I anſwer, it is no marvel, if the Church be without all
human effectual Remedy, ſeeing her preſervation does not
chiefly depend upon mans care, but God's protection, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as God is her King. Therefore, although the Church
cannot depoſe a Pope, yet it may, and ought to pray to
God, that he would give a Remedy; and it is certain,
that God will take care of its preſervation, and ſo will
either convert the Pope, or take him out of the World,
before he can deſtroy the Church. But yet it does not
thence follow, that it may not be lawful to reſiſt a Pope
indeavouring to deſtroy the Church: For it is lawful,
keeping up a due Reverence, to admoniſh him, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
to reprove him, and to fight against him with Force
and Arms, if he will deſtroy the Church: For to reſiſt,
and repel Force with Force, there is required no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
at all.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſays, and he is very clear, that it
is lawful to Reſiſt the higheſt Power, the <hi>Pope</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
for the ſake of the Church, to preſerve it from
Ruine and Deſtruction; I hope no Man will ſay that
this may be done for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but not
for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or that we are not bound
to have as great Zeal for our Church, as he has for
his; I am ſure, we cannot challenge, in behalf of a
King of <hi>England,</hi> more right to impunity, or make him
look more unaccountable than <hi>Bellarmine</hi> does his <hi>Pope.</hi>
And ſo there can be no more Grounds of concluding
for, or againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> in the one
caſe than in the other. But yet, Some may think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
under deeper Obligation than others, and they may
practice the intire Duty of a compleat <hi>Non-Reſiſtance;</hi>
none will blame them for it, ſo that they do not
condemn others, who are not ſo eaſie as they, to
give up their Church, and civil Rights, when they
are not obliged to it, as far as they can ſee, either
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52047:28"/>
by the Law of God or Law of the Land: Men
muſt give allowances to one another, becauſe it may
be poſſible that they may differ about Notions that
are very near to firſt Principles; I know not but
ſome may affect ſlavery, as a ſtate exerciſing high
Vertue, and tending to perfection; others that cannot
reach at ſuch heights, content themſelves with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and think that, a uſeful and deſireable conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency:
This may ſeem ſtrange, but from thence it
comes, as far as I can gueſs, that ſome in the ſame
Text, and ſame Words, finds Argument that they
ſhould be Slaves, and others that they ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to be Free. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 21. Art thou
called being a Servant? Care not for it; but if thou
mayeſt be made free, uſe it rather.</hi> Upon theſe Words,
ſome ſay that St. <hi>Paul</hi> recommends to us ſlavery, and
would have us to be Slaves, tho' we can be made
Free, and ſo much the rather, becauſe we can; others
ſay, that the Apoſtle would have us be content to be
Slaves, when we are Slaves; but if we can be made
Free, we ſhould chooſe Freedom rather. Here is a
great difference, which does not derive from the Text,
but from previous thoughts, which Men have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning Slavery and Freedom. As they are affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the thing, ſo they judge that they find Argument
for it. Now I for my part am for the later inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
becauſe I have a good Opinion of Liberty
or Freedom; but if another prefers ſlavery, and thinks
he has Argument from that Text to be a Slave, let
him be a Slave, and let him enjoy his Opinion of the
thing, and of the Text too, I ſhall not hinder him.
But I muſt ſay, it would be an undecency in him to
call my underſtanding into queſtion for differing
from him, becauſe I have the higheſt Probability, the
Concurrence of the Wiſeſt, and the beſt in all Ages
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52047:28"/>
on my ſide. But yet this may be done, becauſe when
Men leave common Senſe, and ſeek for extraordinary
Notion, they uſually grow froward and troubleſome.
<hi>Tacitus</hi> remarks in the 14th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his Annals, that ſome
who had got into their Heads that flight of the <hi>Stoicks,
That a Wiſe Man was a KING, preſently begun to be
buſy and medling, and very ſcornful of others;</hi> Ea male
intellecta arrogantes faciebat &amp; turbidos. It is pity
that ſuch little things ſhould give diſturbance to
Kingdoms and Nations, but it cannot be help't, for
it is Opinion that governs Men; and it is not what
is great, but what is thought to be great that ſtirrs
them. A little before the fatal overthrow of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
there were many warm Perſons in it, who had
their Heads full of Fancies, and particular Notions,
and for the ſake of them, they could run upon the
moſt deſperate Enterprizes, but they would not know
the things that belonged to their Peace. <hi>Pliny</hi> has a
ſaying, that has much puzzled Phyſicians and Criticks;
He ſays, that Men die of Sapience or Wiſdom, <hi>per Sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam
Mori.</hi> The Phyſicians find no ſuch Diſtemper in
their Books, but gueſs that he means a Phrenſy; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
there is, that gets into Mens heads, which
ſeems to them that have it, to be high Wiſdom, but
to others a meer Phrenſy, which is extreamly mortal
and pernicious. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſo long ago, adviſed properly
againſt it, and it were to be wiſh'd, that his Councel
might yet be taken: He ſays, <hi>Eccleſiaſtes 7. 16. Be
not Righteous overmuch, neither make thy ſelf overwiſe;
why ſhouldeſt thou deſtroy thy ſelf?</hi> It is hard to think
that Men ſhould be either over-righteous or over-wiſe;
but if Men will affect impracticable Notions without
ſufficient Grounds, and look upon them as their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
or their Wiſdom; and that meerly becauſe
theſe are againſt themſelves, and deſtructive of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52047:29"/>
they may well enough be ſaid to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,
and over-wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Third thing to be ſpoken of, is the
Origination of Power; and this is a Subject which I
could willingly omit, becauſe I judge it for the Intereſt
of a Nation, both King and People; that the People
have as High, and as Reverend Thoughts as they can,
both of their King, and his Power: Let them think,
that they have their King from God; and that he has
his Power from God, and let him think ſo too; all
this tends to good, becauſe it will make him in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of his Power, to Act in the fear of God; and
by vertue of that fear, to abſtain from wrong, and to
do Juſtice: And it will awe the People with a dread
of their King's Majeſty, and of their God's; and ſo
keep them from being froward, and peeviſh; muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and rebellious, whileſt they believe themſelves in
ſuch actions, not only to be offenders againſt the Law
of the Land, but ſinners againſt the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of God. Upon this Account, I could willingly
chime in with the Compiler of this Hiſtory, and with
him, fault <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and <hi>Milton,</hi> and <hi>Doleman,</hi> or <hi>Parſons;</hi>
and with him declare againſt thoſe Doctrines, <hi>That
Power is originally in the Body of the People, and that
the Foundation of all Government is laid in compact,</hi> as
he ſays in his Preface. And I could ſay with him
in his concluſion, <hi>pag. 132. That Power is only from
God.</hi> Theſe may be allowed him, or let paſs without
altercation, ſo that Men uſe them according to their
natural tendency, for the Support of Righteouſneſs,
Juſtice, and Goodneſs. But if theſe be uſed to dazzle
and amuſe People, that others may have advantage
to Rob and Spoil them: If by vertue of theſe a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
is made to let in upon a Nation, a lawleſs Power,
Wrong, Injury, and Tyranny: If Law, Religion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52047:29"/>
Senſe, muſt all be laid aſide, and one of the beſt
framed Polities in the World muſt be ſubverted by
ill conſequences, and forced Pleas deduced from theſe
Doctrines, we may certainly have Liberty to examin
both the Principle and the Deductions; we may
conſider what the one will bear, and how the other
is laid upon it. If we muſt be Slaves, it is all one
to us, whether we be made ſuch in the way of <hi>Hobbs,</hi>
or of this Hiſtorian; it is all one, whether a King
has his Power from God, or from the People; if he
muſt be abſolutely abſolute, and be obeyed without
reſerve, without conſideration of Law and Right. And
if a King muſt be a Monſter, altogether Arbitrary,
meer Will acting at pleaſure, without bounds or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
he may as well be made ſuch by the People,
as by God; and of the two, the People are the more
likely to make the Monſter; becauſe God is always
Wiſe and Good, and all his Actions are Juſt, and
Right; and therefore as there is more of God in Power,
there ſhould be more of Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs
in the Exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>It ſeems therefore a Deſign ill laid, to challenge for
Princes, an infinite Power of doing what they will,
without Check or Controul from National Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
becauſe their Powers come from God; or to be
zealous to fetch all the Powers of Princes from God,
for this purpoſe, that they may do evil things ſecurely,
that they may do what they pleaſe, right or wrong,
without danger or hazard, without ſtop or lett.</p>
            <p>If we believe the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. The Powers
that come from God, and are ordained of God, <hi>are
not,</hi> they cannot be <hi>a Terror to good Works:</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this way of diſcourſing, they are as terrible
to the good, as to the bad; and that for this Reaſon,
becauſe they come from God. Had Princes that ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52047:30"/>
Excellency of Nature, which God has, that they
neither would nor could do evil, they might then be
allowed to act, as he does, according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of their Wills, without Controul. But if we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
that they may do evil, they may oppreſs, rob,
ſpoil, kill, murther, and do all the baſe things which any
other man can do, for which they have no Licenſe or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
from God; why may they not then have ſome
ſtops from human Conſtitutions, to lett and hinder them
from doing thoſe things, which God never gave them
power to do, and to keep them in thoſe Methods of
acting, which God himſelf preſcribed, when he gave
them power of ruling and governing.</p>
            <p>If we ſay that the neceſſity of human Affairs does
require that Princes ſhould be unaccountable in this
World, it may be allowed ſo far as that neceſſity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears;
but then their Exemption from Check or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul,
does not derive from the Source and Origine of
their power, that is from God; but from another Cauſe,
which muſt be fairly made out, upon the Compare of
Benefits or Miſchiefs, that happen from the one ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
or the other.</p>
            <p>But when men ſay, that becauſe Kings receive their
Power from God, they muſt have no letts from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Conſtitutions of doing what they will, good or
bad; and then diſtinguiſh, that though they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable,
unaccountable in this World, yet they
are accountable to God, and muſt give a ſtrict Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to him, and that for the ſame Reaſon, becauſe
they receive their Power from God: I ſhould think
that ſuch men are unkind to Kings, and treat 'em with
the moſt uncouth Courtſhip in the World: For they
do, in effect, tell them this; You are great and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
you may do what you pleaſe, you have none to
fear but God, nothing to be affraid of but Hell and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52047:30"/>
Damnation: Others are awed by human Laws, they
are kept in, and reſtrained from doing the Evils they
might do, they are made better than they would be,
and ſo put into a way of Salvation; but you Great
Princes, you are entirely free, you may do as you will, as
you have none above you, ſo you have none to awe
you, none to give ſtop to you in all the eruptions of
nature or humour, but only God and his laſt dreadful
Judgments.</p>
            <p>I ſhould think a Chriſtian Prince ſhould give a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
but little thanks for ſuch a Speech as this; as he
has a Soul to be ſaved, he muſt rejoyce in God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
Grace, and give thanks when ever it pleaſes
God to keep him from doing evil, and he may likewiſe
be glad, if by Laws, and human Conſtitutions, his ways
were ſo bounded and fenced in, that it might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him to deviate from Righteouſneſs and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
ſo he would be in the ready way of being Happy
here, and Glorious hereafter.</p>
            <p>As to the Intereſts of a King of <hi>England,</hi> it is but
vain to ſearch into the Source and Origine of his Power;
how it may be ſaid to be from God, or how from the
People; ſeeing he has that ſingular happineſs, that if
he will Act truly his part according to the National
Conſtitution, he muſt appear in the Exerciſe of his Power,
altogether Divine like God Himſelf: He is Great and
Powerful, his Perſon is Sacred, his Actions unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
He does good, and nothing but good; inaſmuch,
as the Powers of Diſpenſing of Favours and Benefits, the
Power of Rewarding, Advancing, Preferring, of giving
Riches, and Honours, to the Induſtrious and Well-deſerving;
the Power of Protecting, Defending, Relieving, Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the poor or miſerable, are intirely left to Him:
But then the Power or Impotency of doing Wrong,
Injury, or Evil to others, is abſolutely taken from Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:52047:31"/>
A King of <hi>England,</hi> as ſuch, can do no wrong; if he
does it, he ſtretches beyond himſelf, and the Man is
too hard for the King; becauſe, according to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Conſtitution, all thoſe Acts wherein wrong can
be done, are to be done not by himſelf, but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Miniſters and Officers, who are accountable for the
actions which they do, or may have done. Thus the
Kings Perſon is Sacred, and his Actions unqueſtionable;
and they that do wrong, are anſwerable to the Law,
and may ſuffer according to their demerits.</p>
            <p>This certainly was a happy Contrivance of Wiſdom
in our Fore-Fathers, to ſecure the Veneration that is
due to Princes, and withal, to provide, that goodneſs
and Righteouſneſs may flouriſh in their Kingdoms. The
Subject, every one of them either by himſelf, or his
repreſentative, agrees that he will be hanged or Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betted,
ſubmit to the halter or the axe, if ever he be
mutinous or rebellious againſt the King: His King he
will Love and Honour, Serve and Obey, Fight and be
willing to Dye for Him: He ſhall be Great and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful,
Dreadful to Enemies abroad, and Dreadful to
Enemies at home; and have all the Aſſiſtances of Men
and Moneys, to inable him to do all the good his
heart can wiſh for, if he will but ask it; and that His
Majeſty may yet be more Bright and Illuſtrious, He
in his particular, in all his Actions, ſhall be unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
unaccountable. On the other hand, the King
agrees that he will Protect and Defend his Subjects,
Support them in all their Rights, he will uſe their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances
to beat down, and ſubdue all their Enemies, and
take Care that they may Live in Peace and Proſperity. He
will not oppreſs, or trample upon any, whether great or
little: Nay, He will not leave it in his own Power to
be able to do wrong or injury to them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
He will make Laws by his People's Conſent in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52047:31"/>
Parliaments; He will Conduct the Intereſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Advice of his Subjects in Council; He will
Rule by Officers, and Judge by Miniſters, choſen out
from amongſt themſelves, and that in all Cauſes both
between themſelves and between himſelf, and them;
who ſhall pronounce and determine about right, and
wrong; and who is guilty, and who is not; without
the leaſt appeal to him: And then, leſt thoſe Judges,
as Men, ſhould warp aſide, and think that they may
be able by their goodly appearances to bear down right,
and ſet up wrong, they themſelves ſhall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
to pronounce a Judgment in any Cauſe, but as a
Jury of Neighbours, Twelve Men choſen out of the
Voicenage, ſhall firſt find it to be. After all this, The
King agrees, that Miniſters of State, Privy Councellors,
Military Officers, Judges in Courts, and each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Jury-man ſhall be queſtionable, and accountable,
puniſhable for any corruption, oppreſſion, wrong, or
injury, that by Law he ſhall be found guilty of; and
that as much, as rebells are, which too has actually
been done in ſeveral Reigns.</p>
            <p>How Venerable and Divine is this whole Diſpoſition
and Order of Affairs? What appearance is there of
Wiſdom and Goodneſs, that is of God, in it? If a
Prince would be Great, he muſt be Good; and if he
keep to theſe Methods, he muſt be both. And if a
People would have happineſs in this World, they muſt
either find it in ſuch a Conſtitution, as this, or ſeek
it in <hi>Vtopia.</hi> Why then do Men trouble themſelves
to ſeek for the Source and Origine of Power, and think
they do much in ſhewing that it comes from God,
and God only? Whereas we have here before us
Power running down from the Fountain-head a long
way, and in all its courſe like it ſelf, the ſame it was,
pure and clean, and in all its appearances Divine and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52047:32"/>
God-like; it acts juſt as God would have it, and tends
to all thoſe glorious Ends, for which God gave it,
and to which God requires and directs the Uſe of it.
It exerts it ſelf to thoſe Purpoſes, for which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. That the Law of God was made,
not for the Righteous, to oppreſs them, but for the
Lawleſs and Diſobedient, to beat them down; to ſhame,
as well as puniſh them. In theſe Methods a King may
be ſtrong and mighty, able to throw down, and caſt
down ſtrong Holds and Imaginations, and all that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth
it ſelf againſt God, and Goodneſs, and Himſelf
too.</p>
            <p>If then men will have us to ſay, that Power comes
from God, and only from God, we may well allow it;
becauſe we know that Nature, and an inclination to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
living, and Order come from God, and only from
him; all theſe are good, and God is the Giver of all
good things; and beſides, we find ſo much of goodneſs
both for King and People in this National Conſtitution,
that we may well think that God, himſelf, by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
did influence our Fore-Fathers to agree, and fix
upon it. But now if men, from this ſpeculative Notion of
Power, deſcending down from God, will draw and force
out Conſequences, and by vertue of them, will ſet up, and
pull down at pleaſure, make new Frames of Government,
and Schemes of Policy: If they will ſay that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Diſpoſition of Affairs muſt be thrown down, and
the Engliſh Law be laid aſide, and right and wrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
mutable at pleaſure; if they will ſay that Kings
of <hi>England</hi> muſt be abſolute, and obeyed without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;
and all this, only for this Reaſon, becauſe their
Power comes from God, I hope that they will expect
that we ſhould beg their Pardons; they may think that
we judge their Logick deceives them, and that they left
their <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> too ſoon. A Philoſopher once undertook
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52047:32"/>
to demonſtrate that it was impoſſible there ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch thing as Motion, and he talk'd prettily upon the
Subject; but all the while he talk'd, men of plain ſenſe,
laught at him for his vain deſign; yet, however, he
went on demonſtrating, and they laughing.</p>
            <p>So it is, Men, engaged in a bold Adventure, will go
on, whether they have, or have not hope of Succeſs.</p>
            <p>If Men would but conſider fairly, they muſt ſee, that
there is a vaſt diſtance between their Principle, and their
Conſequence; it does not follow, that becauſe God gives
Power, therefore Kings muſt be free to do what they
pleaſe, or that they cannot be reſtrained by National
Conſtitutions, to exert their power in particular ways
and methods. For who knows, but the Limitations
and Reſtrictions of power, may come from God too;
for there are no more miraculous Atteſtations to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Origine, and deſcent of the one, than there is of
the other. And it would be agreeable to God's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to do it; becauſe Power is in it ſelf a very flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing, that may be bent and bowed this way, or the
quite contrary; it is like unto Nature, which as it came
from God was very good; but as the man, who had that
Nature, and was therewith made upright, ſought out
many Inventions: So the King, who has from God the
power, may do the ſame. The man thought many of
his own Inventions to be his Nature, and to come from
God; and a King may think many of his to be his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and to come from God. Therefore as God gave
new Laws to limit and bind in the man, and his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
ſo he may, and it were agreeable enough to his
Goodneſs, if he ſhould, in the Courſe of his Providence,
direct and order Affairs ſo, that there might be Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Reſtrictions given to the King and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</p>
            <p>But beſides, according to the uſual Courſe of things,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52047:33"/>
God generally gives Bounds to Power, according to
which it ſhall, or ſhall not operate, and therefore as
he makes one Power, ſo he makes another anſwerable
to it; as he makes the Agent, ſo he makes the Patient;
as he makes Fire, ſo he makes combuſtible Matter to
receive it, and to feed it, or elſe the Fire will ſoon go
out. God gives to men Power over the Beaſts of the
field, but if a man will command any one of them,
he muſt treat 'em in ways agreeable to their Natures,
and make them to find that it is good to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
He that comes on the blind, or the ſore ſide of his
Horſe, may have a kick, and he that will vex and fret
his Dog, may have a Bite, and none, in ſuch a Caſe,
will blame either the Horſe, or the Dog, but the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Maſter. God gives to Kings, Power over men,
their Subjects; but if a King will treat his Subjects,
juſt as the indiſcreet Maſter does his Horſe or his Dog,
he can hope for no better Returns, than what the
other finds. Men and Beaſts, by the Frame of their
Natures, are in this much alike; you have them, you
looſe them; they come to you, or run from you, juſt
as you treat them; give them kind Uſage, and fair
Treatment, they both will follow, and ſerve, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to pleaſe; but if they find that they muſt be
abuſed, kick'd, and ſtarved; if they find nothing but
the Effects of Wrath or Contempt, that they muſt be
trampled upon, each of them will get off, and ſhift
for it ſelf, and ſeek a more eaſie and comfortable State
of Beeing.</p>
            <p>Now this Temper, whether in ſubject Man, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Beaſt, coming from God; as well as Power in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
King, or governing Man, the one of theſe muſt
be ſuted and accommodated to the other, and muſt
proceed in all Actions upon the ſuppoſition of it; and
as it is the Mans part to find out the proper Ways to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52047:33"/>
gain upon the Beaſt, to win him, and make him his
own, fit for his Service; ſo it is the King's part to
find out, and to uſe a due and proper Managery for
his People, by which he may bring them in to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and beget in them Truſts and Confidences to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. God makes a Power in one to lay on,
and in another to bear; but he that lays on, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what the other can bear, or elſe, houſe, and all
manner of impoſitions will come to the Ground, and,
poſſibly, overthrow, and ruine him in the Downfall.</p>
            <p>Every Power has ſome Bounds, and natural proper
ways of exerting it ſelf, whereby it becomes effectual,
and of uſe. He that would have Food from Cows, or
Cloathing from Sheep, or Service from Horſes, or Dogs,
he muſt provide for them, that firſt they may do well
for themſelves, before they can do well for him; he
muſt therefore feed them and defend them from Fears
and Affrightments, ſuch as uſually hinder them from
attending to their own Neceſſities, and Intereſts. But
he that will not give 'em, whereon to feed, or if he
does, puts Wolves and Lyons amongſt them, to ſcare
and terrifie them, muſt never expect good or benefit
from them.</p>
            <p>Thus it was, and ever will be, what way ſoever
the Man came to have Power over them, right Titles
to them, whether that was from God or man, by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
or Emption, by Deſcent or Conqueſt: And as
it is betwixt the Man, and his Beaſt, ſo at leaſt, it
muſt be allowed to be betwixt a King and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
If a King will treat them frowardly, make no
due Proviſions for their Good, but will treat them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily,
juſt as he will, and that becauſe he wills it
according to humour, he muſt not expect what he
wiſhes from them, how or in what manner ſoever he
receives his Power over them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52047:34"/>
Thus let Power be owned to come from God, let
it be confeſſed that He is the Source and Original of it;
yet I think no Man can fetch from thence any Ground
for the aſſertion of either Deſtructive or of Arbitrary
Proceedings in Government; a King may however,
have bounds and limits, ways and methods fixed to
him, wherein he may, or may not, profitably and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
exert the Operations of it; and the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his own Actions, whether they be good or bad,
commendable or blame-worthy, will be imputable
chiefly and primarily to himſelf.</p>
            <p>But after all this, What if Power may in ſome
Senſe be ſaid to depend upon the People; tho' it
comes originally from God, yet it may come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to one certain Perſon by the people; and as
God is ſaid to make Kings, ſo the people may be ſaid
to make them too: I know that this Language is
thrown off with ſcorn and contempt, and repreſented
in ſeveral Prints as moſt odious. How this comes to
paſs, I can't tell, for it muſt be owned, that in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
amongſt God's own people, this way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was very current and familiar, in all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
of State, the people are ſaid to make their
King.</p>
            <p>Thus it was in the Caſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 11. 15.
He was indeed Anointed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> but that Action
was done in ſecret, his own Servant was not permitted
to ſee it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 27. and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1, 2. The
Inſtruction that he then had, was, not to challenge the
Kingdom by Vertue of God's Gift, <hi>but to do as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſerved,</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 7. and tho' he be ſaid to be
<hi>choſen of the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 24. yet he was ſaid
to be made King by the people, 1 <hi>Sam. 11. 15. And
all the People went to</hi> Gilgal, <hi>and there they made</hi> Saul
<hi>King before the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:52047:34"/>
Thus too, <hi>David</hi> was made King by the Men of
<hi>Judah,</hi> over the Houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 Sam. 2. 4. and
<hi>David</hi> himſelf owns, that the Men of <hi>Judah</hi> Anointed
him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 7. and <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> at the ſame time
was made King over all the reſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Abner,</hi>
2 Sam. 2. 9.</p>
            <p>After the Death of <hi>Iſhboſheth, David</hi> was again
Anointed by the people, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 3. and made
King by the people, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 38.</p>
            <p>So was <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 22. and <hi>Rehoboam,</hi>
2 Chron. 10. 1. and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 King. 12. 20. <hi>They
called him to the Congregation, and made him King over
all</hi> Iſrael. Thus it was with <hi>Omri,</hi> 1 King. 16. 16.
and with <hi>Joaſh,</hi> 2 Chron. 23. 11. and <hi>Vzziah,</hi>
2 Chron. 26. 1. This is the plain way of ſpeaking
in our Tranſlation, and ſo it is in the vulgar <hi>Latin,</hi>
and in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, and that theſe were not
empty Words, but that real effects for the producing
of Power, did depend upon this Action of the People;
we muſt needs think, becauſe we ſee in two inſtances,
that at the ſame time they made their King, they made
Proviſions for the Reſtraining and Limiting of his Actions;
for, that I gueſs, muſt be the ſenſe of that League, or
Covenant, or Contract, which then he made with
them, and they with him. This we find was done
between King <hi>David,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> people; and King <hi>Joaſh,</hi>
and the people: This we find was done by King
<hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 3. 21. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Sam. 5. 3. and 1 Chron.
11. 3. and by King <hi>Joaſh, 2 King.</hi> 11. 17. and likely
enough by <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he was made King the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 21. and poſſibly enough, this
was done at the Inauguration of each of their Kings.</p>
            <p>But whether this be ſo, or no, it is not ſo materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
as to ingage us, or others in Diſpute and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy.
That we are now to promote and ſeek for, is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52047:35"/>
Peace and Unity, that Brotherly Love, and Chriſtian
Charity may abound amongſt us; we muſt do what
we can, to advance the good of our Countrey, People,
and Nation; to ſecure our Religion, that we may
continue to ſerve God in ſimplicity and ſincerity; as
for Nicety and Notion, men may think, and if they will,
ſpeak either this way, or the quite contrary. If Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and Animoſity, Heat and Anger, be laid aſide,
we may allow men to ſay, <hi>That Power is only from
God; That Reſiſtance is a dangerous thing, and in moſt
Caſes very ill; That Paſſive Obedience (well explained)
is a Duty.</hi> And they, on the other hand, may be content
not to urge and diſcourſe theſe Doctrines in ſuch a
way, as muſt give us to fear and ſuſpect, that trick
and deſign are carrying on; that we are to be amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
firſt, and then fooled, and cheated.</p>
            <p>And why may it not be preſumed? That hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
no man will dare to move the People of this
Land, Lords, and Commons to ſubmit their Birth-rights;
all the Intereſt they have in Life and Fortune to Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Diſpoſals; from none of thoſe wheedling <hi>Topicks,</hi>
neither from the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> nor
that of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance,</hi> nor yet, that of the <hi>Origin of
Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſeeing the Reverend Clergy now Aſſembled in
<hi>Convocation,</hi> ſtand up ſo reſolutely to keep and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all the particularities of their Rule, that they will
not part with the leaſt Title of their Eſtabliſhment;
though deſired by the King, and perhaps too, by the
greateſt part of the Nation: It is very likely that the
Example may be taking, and a Parliament, or the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the People may be as zealous to hold their own,
as others are, to hold theirs; and it is very poſſible
that there ſhould be every jot as great Reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>

For certainly it may be thought, that the principal,
and eſſential parts of this National Conſtitution, may
be of more Value than the Diſpoſition of things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs. I ſhould think it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
worſe, to be hanged, right or wrong; than right

And another man may be more willing to permit his
Child to be Baptized without the Sign of the Croſs,
than to conſent that he will be dragoon'd, whenever
his King pleaſes, only for this Reaſon, Becauſe he does
not change his Religion, and become Papiſt, Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
or what you will.</p>

to be wiſh't, that every one, of greater or leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
would caſt a few ſerious Thoughts upon thoſe
Words of our Saviour, <hi>Luke,</hi> 19. 42, 43, 44.</p>
            <p>Saying, If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this
thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now
they are hid from thine eyes.</p>
            <p>For the dayes ſhall come upon thee, that thine enemies
ſhall caſt a trench about thee, and compaſs thee round, and
keep thee in on every ſide.</p>
            <p>And ſhall lay thee even with the ground, and thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
within thee: and they ſhall not leave in thee one ſtone
upon another, becauſe thou kneweſt not the time of thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation.</p>
