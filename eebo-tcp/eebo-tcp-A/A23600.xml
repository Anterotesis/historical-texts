         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N Sunday laſt I received yours of <hi>Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary</hi>
the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and have inquired into the
Truth of the Story of an <hi>Iriſh Papist</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
in this Countrey, who at the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
denied the Fact for which he was to
ſuffer; but after he had Hanged awhile,
the Rope by accident breaking, and the Malefactor
comeing to himſelf, confeſs'd it to be true.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:37777:3"/>
The perſon was one <hi>John Curphy</hi> a <hi>Papist,</hi> who, this
<hi>Lent Aſſizes</hi> will be Seven years, was Tryed before Mr.
Baron <hi>Hene</hi> (then His Majeſties Serjeant) for <hi>Burglary</hi>
in the County of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> and being found Guilty,
was condemned to dye. <hi>At the Gallows this</hi> Curphy <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the Fact with great Confidence and Aſſeverations of
his Innocency,</hi> and was turned off the Ladder, <hi>perſiſting
in his denial;</hi> but after he had hanged ſome little ſpace,
the Rope by chance breaking, and he falling down a
little ſtunn'd, <hi>came again to himſelf, and fell to his prayers,
thanking God that he had given him time to declare the
Truth, and not to go out of the World with a Lye in his
mouth, and then confeſſed himſelf Guilty of the Fact for
which he was Condemned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards this <hi>Curphy</hi> was brought back to the
Gaol by the Sheriff Mr. <hi>Lucas,</hi> and application made to
Baron <hi>Hene</hi> to Reprieve the Priſoner; but he telling
the Sheriff that the Judge had done his duty, and the
Sheriff muſt do his, <hi>Curphy</hi> was Executed.</p>
            <p>This Account I write from Mr. Baron <hi>Hene</hi>'s own
mouth, this very morning, who perfectly knows this
Narrative to be true, and was the Perſon who acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
your Lordſhip with it, at your firſt coming into the
Government.</p>
            <p>He alſo tells me, that to the beſt of his remembrance,
this <hi>Curphy</hi> owned, <hi>That the Priest had given him Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
upon condition not to diſcover any thing, or declare his
Accomplices: And that he need not doubt his Salvation,
the Fact not being committed against Gods People,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(<hi>as he ſuppoſed) the Papiſts,</hi> or to that effect. <hi>Lucas</hi>
the then Sheriff, lives in <hi>Monaghan,</hi> and the Records of
this Tryal are there, wherefore I have waited upon Mr.
Juſtice <hi>Johnſon,</hi> who goes that Circuit, and left with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37777:3"/>
him a Memorial of theſe Particulars, who will inquire
into them, and give me an atteſted Account thereof,
which when they come to my hands, I will tranſmit to
your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>Mr. Juſtice <hi>Johnſon</hi> alſo told me another Relation,
ſomething of this nature There was a ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
lately directed to himſelf, to try ſeveral Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
for Murthers and Robberies, committed in the
County of <hi>Cavan.</hi> The Perſons Indicted, were two of
the <hi>Duffies,</hi> and one <hi>Plunkett, all Iriſh Papists.</hi> The <hi>Duf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi>
when they were firſt apprehended, <hi>Confest that they
were Guilty of the Crimes laid to their Charge, and gave
the ſame Evidence alſo againſt</hi> Plunkett <hi>at his Tryal,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, with other <hi>moſt undeniable Circumſtances,
Plunkett</hi> was Condemned. The <hi>Duffies</hi> were afterwards
tryed for the ſame Facts, and Condemned alſo.</p>
            <p>I ſhould likewiſe have told your Lordſhip, <hi>That</hi>
Plunkett <hi>upon his firſt Apprehenſion, owned to Sir</hi> John
Edgworth, <hi>that he was Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Sentence was paſt upon them, one <hi>Brady</hi> a
<hi>Prieſt,</hi> came to theſe <hi>Duffies</hi> in Priſon, and <hi>uſed Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to induce them to Recant their Evidence;</hi> but they
perſiſting in the Truth, would not be prevailed
upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Juſtice</hi> Johnſon <hi>hearing this, ſent for</hi> Brady, <hi>who,
upon his Examination,</hi> could not deny, but that he had
been with the <hi>Duffies,</hi> to perſuade them to Renounce their
Teſtimony againſt <hi>Plunkett.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the Judge Committed him. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
was, That one of the <hi>Duffies</hi> (the other being
Reprieved) ſuffer'd, confeſſing the Fact, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in his Accuſation of <hi>Plunkett.</hi> And <hi>Plunkett dyed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37777:4"/>
as obſtinate,</hi> on the other ſide, <hi>utterly denying, that he was
Guilty, with Curſes upon himſelf, and Renunciations of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
if he were not innocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt alſo crave leave to trouble your Lordſhip
with another Narrative of this ſort, which I had from
Sir <hi>Richard Reynell,</hi> one of the Judges of the <hi>Kings
Bench.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About <hi>October</hi> laſt was Twelvemonth, there was tryed
before him, upon a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi>
one <hi>Neile-O-Neile,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh Papiſt, for a Murther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi>
at <hi>Rathdrum</hi> in the County of <hi>Wicklow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Neile-O-Neile</hi> in Priſon, and at his Tryal, owned
to ſeveral Perſons, (amongſt which I hear my Lord of
<hi>Strafford</hi> then in <hi>Ireland</hi> was one) <hi>That he was Guilty,
and was ſo found by the Jury, the Fact being clearly
proved againſt him:</hi> But at the Gallows, <hi>he utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe three Particulars being averr'd to me this very
day, by the three aforementioned Judges, I humbly preſume
to ſend them your Lordſhip as true.</p>
            <p>I fear I have tyred your Lordſhip with this long Letter,
but I thought it my Duty to give you the fulleſt Account I
