            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ADdresses of this nature did use, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, to be made to <hi>Great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> for their <hi>Protection;</hi> or else, to <hi>Special Friends,</hi> to shew the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's <hi>Respects:</hi> But, your Way of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging this Controversie, has been so <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous,</hi> that it has oblig'd me to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse those <hi>Usual Methods,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this Defensive of mine to <hi>your selves,</hi> tho' my <hi>Adversaries.</hi> And, because I fear that, coming from my Hand, it will not <hi>please</hi> you, I will endeavour to make it as little <hi>Unwelcome</hi> as I can. Let me ask you then, What means all this <hi>Railing,</hi> and <hi>Libelling?</hi> Can any Man of Common Sense think, this is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to <hi>promote Truth?</hi> And, if not; pray, What was your <hi>Aim</hi> in taking this Way, so <hi>Ungrateful</hi> to <hi>Sober</hi> Men, so
<pb facs="tcp:102124:3"/>
               <hi>Nauseous</hi> to the <hi>Learned,</hi> and so <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi> in it <hi>self?</hi> Does it conduce to <hi>prove TRUTH,</hi> or <hi>confute ERROUR?</hi> Or, rather, Does it not expose you to the Censure of all Lovers of <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Civility;</hi> as Men, whose <hi>Reasons</hi> are at a <hi>Nonplus.</hi> I beseech you to consider, that <hi>Reason</hi> is our True Nature; and, therefore, whatever subsists by <hi>Reason,</hi> does naturally claim the <hi>Assent</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation</hi> of Mankind: Whereas, <hi>PAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION,</hi> if excessive, is never <hi>Wise;</hi> and, especially, in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> where Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Arguments ought to be the <hi>only</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers, 'tis a meer <hi>Folly.</hi> 'Tis Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to <hi>Truth,</hi> as well as to <hi>Modesty,</hi> that <hi>Brawling</hi> should usurp the Place of <hi>Demonstrating.</hi> Indeed, no <hi>Credit</hi> being got by Answering <hi>Squabbles,</hi> you could not have invented any better Way to make me lose <hi>mine:</hi> And, the best Compurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor I can bring, to keep me fair in the Opinion of the World, for Answering Books that <hi>abound</hi> in <hi>Raillery,</hi> but are quite void of <hi>Sense,</hi> is, that I saw it was a great Good to the Commonwealth of <hi>Learning,</hi> to lay open, once for all, such <hi>Ridiculous</hi> and <hi>Unfair</hi> Methods; that
<pb facs="tcp:102124:3"/>
their Insignificancy being Expos'd, they may, for ever hereafter, he held Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any <hi>other</hi> Answer, but that of <hi>Scorn,</hi> and <hi>Neglect.</hi> What I most fear, is, that my Reader will think, that, while I am Replying to Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi>'s <hi>CENSURA,</hi> I am rather framing an <hi>Idea</hi> of the Incredible Weakness of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Reason, than giving him a True Account of his <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Perpetual</hi> Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: But, my Comfort is, his Book is extant, to justifie me. Philosophers use to say, that <hi>Nature abhors a Vacuum:</hi> I am sure, <hi>Rational Nature</hi> as much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors an <hi>Emptiness of Sense;</hi> yet, this is all he has allow'd me to work upon, or confute.</p>
            <p>Now, since to talk <hi>Incoherently,</hi> is, by all Mankind, held to be <hi>Folly;</hi> and, to do this in a <hi>High Degree,</hi> and <hi>Constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> is that which Men call <hi>Distracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> or <hi>Madness;</hi> which is a <hi>Total</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling of our <hi>Rational</hi> Faculty: 'Tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, hence, that <hi>REASON,</hi> which is our <hi>Nature,</hi> consists in the <hi>Conjoyning</hi> our Thoughts <hi>rightly;</hi> and, that 'tis the <hi>Perfection</hi> of our Reason, to discourse <hi>Coherently,</hi> or <hi>Connectedly.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb facs="tcp:102124:4"/>
my <hi>only</hi> Request to you, is, that, leaving off all those <hi>Foppish</hi> and <hi>Irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Ways of <hi>Raillery,</hi> and <hi>Buffoonery,</hi> you would do your selves the Favour to pursue this Way of <hi>CONNEXION;</hi> so <hi>Natural</hi> to your <hi>Souls,</hi> so <hi>Honourable</hi> to your <hi>Credits,</hi> and so <hi>Beneficial</hi> to the <hi>Learned Part</hi> of Mankind. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, besides the doing a just Duty to <hi>Truth,</hi> will, over and above, make all <hi>Uncivil</hi> Language <hi>Impracticable:</hi> No such <hi>Stuff</hi> can find Place, while we are <hi>Laying Principles,</hi> and <hi>Deducing</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate <hi>Consequences;</hi> which are all a Philosopher has to do: Nor, can Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent <hi>Babblers</hi> find Opportunity to put in a Word, while such <hi>Serious</hi> Business is in Agitation. You have too much <hi>Disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd</hi> and <hi>Scandaliz'd</hi> all Good Men, and no less <hi>Mortify'd me,</hi> in forcing me from this <hi>Solid</hi> Method, by your bringing the Controversie from <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Arguing,</hi> to the <hi>worst</hi> sort of <hi>Drollery;</hi> since you neither brought against me <hi>any one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> the Terms of which you would <hi>undertake</hi> to be <hi>Connected;</hi> nor went about to <hi>solve</hi> the <hi>Close Connexion</hi> of <hi>mine;</hi> but, only huddl'd together a <hi>Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102124:4"/>
of <hi>Rambling Cavils,</hi> tending only to <hi>blemish my Reputation:</hi> Which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me (it being expected I should say something, and you giving me no wiser Employment) to lose Time in laying open your <hi>Injuriousness, Weaknesses,</hi> and <hi>Falshoods;</hi> whereas, I do assure you, I should, with much more Joy and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, have commended your Learning, and Civility, if <hi>your Carriage</hi> would have <hi>permitted</hi> me to do it with Truth.</p>
            <p>I beg of you, that you would not (as Lawless <hi>Assassinates</hi> and <hi>Robbers</hi> use) thus disgrace your selves, by assaulting me <hi>with your Vizards on;</hi> but, appear <hi>Bare-fac'd.</hi> Why should an <hi>Honest Man,</hi> in an <hi>Honest Cause,</hi> be asham'd to <hi>shew his Face?</hi> Own your true Nature, <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> State your <hi>Cartesian</hi> Thesis; for, our Controversie begun about <hi>that;</hi> and, if you flinoh from <hi>it,</hi> and run to <hi>other</hi> Subjects, you <hi>quit the Field.</hi> Then, lay <hi>Determinate Principles,</hi> and bring <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Arguments</hi> to prove your As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions; and, I will promise you to do the same. But, I beseech you, let not the least Disrespectful Word pass between us, under Penalty of being held to have lost our
<pb facs="tcp:102124:5"/>
Cause. If you please to take this Way, so Proper for Settling <hi>Truth,</hi> I shall <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Respect</hi> you, and civilly <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse</hi> whatever may hap to be <hi>Defective.</hi> But, if you resolve still to continue these <hi>Untoward</hi> Methods, here laid open, I shall not think it worth my while to stand Bartering Angry <hi>Repartees</hi> with you; but, will let you <hi>Rail on</hi> to your selves. Resting confident, that all <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Sober</hi> Men will both <hi>Condemn</hi> your <hi>Prevaricating Incivility;</hi> and, will also hold me <hi>Excus'd,</hi> if I let you gratifie your own <hi>Genius,</hi> and apply my self to better Employments, more becoming a Scholar, and a Christian.</p>

            <p n="1">1. WHen Pretenders to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, instead of producing <hi>Arguments</hi> of their own, or <hi>Answering</hi> those that are brought by others, do break in upon all the Rules of Decency and Civility, and betake themselves to <hi>Railing</hi> and <hi>Libelling,</hi>

'tis the Concern, not only of the <hi>Learned,</hi> but of all <hi>Mankind</hi> to declare their Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of such an Indirect and Senseless Prevarication. Invectives cast such a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow upon the clearest Truths, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce so pernicious a Precedent into Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation about Points of Philosophy, and those also of a more Sacred Nature, that, unless this absurd Carriage be discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd, the best Efforts of <hi>Exact Reason</hi> will be turn'd into <hi>Buffoonery.</hi> That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but my Opposing <hi>Cartesianism,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Undeniable <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> or by my <hi>Arguments,</hi> did force Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> and his Complice to this <hi>Hurry of Passion,</hi> and (as your selves will character it when you see their manner of Writing) <hi>Madness of Malice,</hi> will appear manifestly by a plain Stating of the Case; which is this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Very many of my Learned Friends (tho' it was my Concern to name but one of them) had blam'd my <hi>Ignobile Otium,</hi> and had press'd me to write. To speak candidly, I cannot perfectly remember, that they desir'd me, in express Terms, to write <hi>Philosophy;</hi> but I am certain I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood them so, the Circumstances seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very Improper to publish any thing else. Being thus won, I cast about how I might make my Productions as <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally</hi> Beneficial as I was able. At first sight I <hi>Diseover'd,</hi> and had, (with many others,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102124:6"/>
who aim'd at True Science,) in my Thoughts, <hi>Bewail'd,</hi> that a kind of <hi>Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> or <hi>Despair</hi> of <hi>Certain Knowledge,</hi> had insensibly crept into the World; and I had experienc'd how it had corrupted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent Wits, and made them turn <hi>Libertines.</hi> I saw that this dangerous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper of the Mind was grown very Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical; of which, in my Preface to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Philosophy Asserted,</hi> I so heartily and feelingly complain. I saw that this Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Humour did hinder the Progress of Scientifical Knowledge, and the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rational Nature; nay, that it brought a vast Prejudice to Religion it self: For, those who had only <hi>Wit</hi> enough to <hi>raise Objections</hi> against Christian Faith, but wanted <hi>Solidity of Judgment,</hi> and <hi>True Principles,</hi> enabling them to <hi>settle</hi> their Volatil Thoughts, were apt to think that the Mysteries it propos'd were altogether Repugnant to Reason, and <hi>Inexplicable.</hi> But, particularly, I had observ'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of <hi>Atheism,</hi> and (which is next to it) of <hi>Deism</hi> here in <hi>England.</hi> Which kind of Men, making a Scoff at Scripture, and disregarding Church, Councils, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and all Authority, could no way be so properly and effectually combated, or confuted, as by REASON; to which, and which only, they appeal'd.

to advance the Way of Exact <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning;</hi> and, thence, pitch'd upon the Writing and Publishing a METHOD to <hi>Science.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Regard I had to <hi>Christian Faith</hi> was the Chief Motive that prevail'd with me to write <hi>Philosophy,</hi> or that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, will appear hence: First, Because it is manifest that I took there all Occasions that could come in my way, to apply my Discourses to the <hi>Defence of Faith;</hi> and when I had establish'd any Truth by way of <hi>Reason,</hi> I did, upon the Spot, make use of it to confute some <hi>Heresie;</hi> or else some Tenet which seem'd not so well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with Faith, but subcontrary to it. For Example; In my <hi>METHOD, p.</hi> 6. I argue against the <hi>Scepticks. Pag.</hi> 7. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pre-existence of <hi>Souls. Pag.</hi> 32. I prove that Man is but <hi>One</hi> Thing, and not <hi>Two,</hi> as the <hi>Cartesians</hi> hold; of which more hereafter. <hi>Pag.</hi> 43. I conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Hypothesis. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, <hi>p.</hi> 59, 60. that the World had a <hi>Beginning of Motion;</hi> and, consequently, that there is some <hi>Spiritual Nature,</hi> which, either by its own Virtue, or by Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from some Supreme and <hi>First Cause</hi> of Motion, did move <hi>Unactive Matter.</hi> I hint, <hi>p.</hi> 80. the Grounds which shew the Mystery of the Blessed Trinity conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Right Reason. I prove, <hi>p.</hi> 93.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102124:7"/>
that Angels are not properly in Place. I explicate, <hi>p.</hi> 97, 98. in what GOD's Attribute of <hi>Eternity,</hi> and the <hi>Aeviternity</hi> of Angels, do consist. I take care, <hi>p.</hi> 105, 106. that Weak Men do not mis-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scripture, by taking <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions <hi>Literally,</hi> and <hi>Dogmatically,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> does frequently, and very rashly; from which proceeded the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I explicate, <hi>p.</hi> 109, 110. how, and in what Sense, <hi>Religious</hi> Honour, or Respect may be given to <hi>Creatures,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shocking any well-meaning Christian, or breeding Disunion amongst them. I shew, <hi>p.</hi> 112. the Incomparableness of GOD's Divine Word, the <hi>Holy Scriptnres,</hi> from its having or bearing many several sorts of Senses, and yet all of them <hi>True.</hi> I attempt, <hi>p.</hi> 137, 138, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by a Logical <hi>Medium,</hi> to demonstrate the <hi>Existence of a Deity.</hi> I shew, <hi>p.</hi> 153. the Way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Souls in <hi>Solid Vertue.</hi> I demonstrate, <hi>p.</hi> 277, 278, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> GOD's <hi>Providence</hi> in the whole Course of Nature, even to the very least Effect: That he cannot be the <hi>Author of Sin:</hi> How senseless a Sin <hi>Irresig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> is: How great our <hi>Gratitude</hi> to GOD ought to be: And, how <hi>Wise</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Christianity</hi> is. I manifest, <hi>p.</hi> 286. how <hi>Ignorant</hi> Atheists are. <hi>Pag.</hi> 299. That the World had a <hi>Beginning;</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:102124:8"/>
and, that there are <hi>Spiritual Natures.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate at large, <hi>p.</hi> 302. that there is a <hi>Self-existent Being,</hi> or a <hi>Deity.</hi> I prove, <hi>p.</hi> 318. against the <hi>Origenists,</hi> how Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal it is that there should be an <hi>Eternal Hell</hi> for the Devils, and wicked Souls. I I settle very largely, to the End of that Lesson, the Rational Grounds, <hi>previous</hi> to Humane and Divine <hi>Faith.</hi> And, <hi>p.</hi> 343. I shew, from a <hi>Logical Medium,</hi> the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness of <hi>Opinionative Faith,</hi> which grounds <hi>Light Credulity,</hi> and <hi>Bigottery.</hi> I inform my Reader, <hi>p.</hi> 360, 361, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how to arm himself against being surpriz'd by <hi>Fallacies</hi> brought against <hi>Christianity.</hi> And, Lastly, <hi>p.</hi> 373. I demonstrate, that the <hi>Practical Judgment</hi> of a <hi>Sinner,</hi> and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, all <hi>Sin,</hi> is clearly <hi>Opposite to Right Reason;</hi> and an <hi>Evident Fallacy,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Commonest Rules of True Logick.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I pursue the same good End in my <hi>Solid Philosophy Asserted;</hi> and take all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions (even though not given me some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) to apply my former Grounds to higher Subjects. I will only touch upon some Instances. I explicate, <hi>p.</hi> 174, and 199. GOD's <hi>Immensity,</hi> and set it above those low Conceits fram'd by our Fancy. As likewise, <hi>(p.</hi> 202.) his <hi>Self-Existence,</hi> and <hi>(p.</hi> 211.) his Absolute <hi>Infinity.</hi> I shew <hi>(p.</hi> 223.) the Necessity of a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102124:8"/>
Doctrine, against the <hi>Deists. Pag.</hi> 225. How to conquer in our <hi>Spiritual Warfare. Pag.</hi> 227. That Man, pre-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by GOD, <hi>determines himself,</hi> or is <hi>Free. Pag.</hi> 229. Whence <hi>Sin</hi> springs. I lay open <hi>(p.</hi> 271, 272, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> the Nature of Solid Vertue. I shew <hi>(p.</hi> 303, and 391.) the Clear <hi>Distinction</hi> between <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures; which is of vast Concern, both to Philosophy, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and Faith it self; and, is the best Rule of Interpreting Scripture in such Passages as concern <hi>Spirits,</hi> unless the known Faith of the Catholick Church has already establish'd the Doctrinal Point to our hand. I distinguish <hi>(p.</hi> 438, 439,) what is due to <hi>Reason,</hi> what to <hi>Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> And, <hi>(p.</hi> 441, 442.) that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is <hi>not</hi> to be rely'd upon in Things <hi>above Reason.</hi> Lastly, <hi>(p.</hi> 452.) I give a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule how we can never come to be <hi>mis-led</hi> by <hi>Authority, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That I writ <hi>Philosophy</hi> to maintain the Interest of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and not out of the vain Motive of being held a <hi>meer Philosopher,</hi> does farther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear hence, That in the Epistle Dedicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Solid Philosophy Asserted,</hi> I did civilly challenge the <hi>Socinians, Deists</hi> and <hi>Atheists,</hi> that some Learned Men of those Sects <hi>would please to send me those Reasons which they, or their Leaders, do judge to be of most</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102124:9"/>
               <hi>Weight why they cannot embrace the Doctrine of the Trinity, or Christianity; which they may send privately, and unnam'd, to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner who publishes this Book:</hi> Promising them, that <hi>I would give their Arguments their full Weight, and publish an Answer to them.</hi> Which manifestly shews, that my Design was, to apply my Books of <hi>Philosophy</hi> to the Explication and Defence of <hi>Reveal'd Faith.</hi> From some of <hi>those Sects</hi> I might have expected a <hi>Rude</hi> Opposition; tho' I do not think any of them would have thought it <hi>Prudent,</hi> or <hi>Creditable</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or their Cause, to leave my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and my Books <hi>Unanswer'd,</hi> and let fly at me with <hi>Personal Reflexions;</hi> but, that those who bear the Name of <hi>Christians,</hi> should, instead of Answering my Reasons, fall to Decry, Traduce and Libel those very Books, and their Author, in the most <hi>Vile</hi> and <hi>Scurrilous</hi> manner, I could not have expected. This plainly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all sober Men, that these angry Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men esteem nothing so Sacred as the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their private Pique. But, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is so Fiery, and Furious, as Men too fond of Empty Fame, when they fore-see their <hi>Ignorance</hi> is in danger to be <hi>baffl'd.</hi> I dare presume, that whoever considers the several Particulars lately mention'd, to demonstrate which, in those Treatises, I have laid Grounds; (not to speak of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102124:9"/>
others I have omitted,) will acknowledge they are of no small Weight; and therefore, that the Writer who advances Positions which are so useful and service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Christianity, ought (were it but out of respect to that Best Cause) to be <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy treated,</hi> even tho' he had <hi>erred.</hi> Nor could my Adversaries have shewn a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Kindness to those Sects above-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, than to bend their whole Endeavours to revile and blacken an Author, who, as they already saw, had enter'd the Lists a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those Men; so to fore-stall (as far as they were able) the Efficacy of all his future Labours to defend Christian Faith! Poor Men! What Service has either of them done for <hi>Christianity!</hi> They have spent their whole Life, or the greatest part of it, in contemplating Groundless Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, coin'd by their own Brain; or, (as they call it,) in <hi>Eliciting,</hi> or Producing <hi>Ideas;</hi> and in talking Voluntaries while they explicate them, without either Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or Connexion; and that's the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of their empty Performances. And then, when they should defend their Cause by <hi>Arguments,</hi> if we will not allow their <hi>Explications</hi> for good <hi>Proof,</hi> they fall to Railing and Libelling. But Envy is of so froward an Humour, that it will neither do Good it self, nor let it be done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:102124:10"/>
6. I might add, as a Third Argument, to prove, that my chief Aim in my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, was, to do my Duty to <hi>Faith,</hi> that I have oppos'd all the <hi>Whole Way</hi> of <hi>Ideas;</hi> because I saw them very Unfit to <hi>Explicate</hi> or <hi>Defend</hi> it. Far be it from me to cast in a Suspicion, that the Authors who follow that Way are <hi>Unsound</hi> in Faith. What I affirm, is, That I can neither conceive how the <hi>Ideas</hi> of the <hi>Cartesians</hi> can well sute with some Points of Faith, (of which more hereafter;) nor that those of Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> tho' his Simple Ideas being taken from the Things in Nature, his Doctrine is in comparably better grounded than that of <hi>Cartesius,</hi> do so clearly serve to explicate Faith, but that they are obnoxious to some Exceptions. I should be better satisfy'd with both those <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> could I once see a Body of Speculative <hi>Divinity;</hi> or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an <hi>Explication</hi> of two or three Points of <hi>Reveal'd Faith,</hi> manifesting the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Faith with the Principles of Right Reason; so that we may see how the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructure of that Divine Doctrine does <hi>accord</hi> with <hi>those Grounds;</hi> as it must with <hi>True Science.</hi> For, I cannot but judge, that since <hi>[Verum vero non contradicit,] Philosophical Truths,</hi> which are <hi>Inferiour</hi> ones, and lie level to our <hi>Reason,</hi> and therefore are <hi>Clearer</hi> to our Understanding than are those <hi>Sublime</hi> Mysteries, and are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102124:10"/>
more maniable by it, ought to lend their Assistance to our weak Capacities in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating</hi> and <hi>Defending</hi> them from being Contradictory to True Reason: Whence, I cannot think Tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Philosophy</hi> to be <hi>True,</hi> which, like an Officious <hi>Hand-maid,</hi> is not thus Subservient to her Mistress, <hi>Faith.</hi> And, if any Writer, or Sustainer of those Sects above mention'd, shall think fit to attack any Article of <hi>Reveal'd Faith,</hi> as contrary to True <hi>Science,</hi> I doubt not but to make it evidently appear by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I have settl'd in my <hi>METHOD,</hi> how far short their Arguments are from any Shew of Concluding.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Lastly, It was not in me any Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of advancing <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> but my Zeal of pursuing the same <hi>Good End,</hi> which made me attempt to demonstrate in my <hi>Method</hi> divers Points which shock the Fancy of the Vulgar, and, perhaps, of some Learned Readers, till they well weigh their Grounds; <hi>viz.</hi> those of the <hi>Immutability of a Pure Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of Annihilation</hi> by GOD's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Power. I had observ'd, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Distinction between <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> was <hi>Ill understood</hi> by <hi>most,</hi> and their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>Confounded</hi> by divers Ingenious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Also, that very few did penetrate thorowly the Nature of their <hi>State,</hi> their kind of <hi>Duration,</hi> or their manner of <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating;</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:102124:11"/>
but conceited them to have a kind of <hi>Commensuration</hi> to Body, Time and Corporeal Operation. Which put, it was impossible to devest them totally of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Predicates; or to evince clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Atheists,</hi> that there were any Beings of a Nature truly and properly <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or <hi>Indivisible,</hi> unless we could prove they were <hi>Contradictorily Different</hi> from <hi>Body,</hi> and all that belong'd to it, excepting only as to their <hi>Genus,</hi> or Common Notion, <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Thing.</hi> Wherefore, reflecting of what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance it was to clear this main Point, both for <hi>Philosophy,</hi> the Adequate Object of which these two Natures are; neither of which could be clearly understood, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they be thus perfectly, that is, <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorily</hi> Distinguish'd: As also, for <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> which treats mostly of <hi>Spiritual Things,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Natures:</hi> And, Lastly, for <hi>Faith;</hi> because, otherwise, <hi>Atheists,</hi> who <hi>deny</hi> all <hi>Spirituality,</hi> might take a Conceit, that we meant nothing by a <hi>[Spirit,]</hi> but only some more refin'd sort of <hi>Matter;</hi> and, thence, might come to deny also the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> (which is one of the main Grounds of all Religion,) if we ascrib'd to <hi>Spirits</hi> any Mode, or Manner of Operating, which appertains to <hi>Body;</hi> nay, would thence be apt to conclude, that there is nothing above <hi>meer Matter:</hi> Hence, I saw it fit to demonstrate the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102124:11"/>
of these <hi>Theses, viz.</hi> their <hi>Immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as the Best, and most Convincing Proof of their <hi>Immortality;</hi> and, at the same time, quite defeat <hi>Origenism,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of an <hi>Eternal Hell,</hi> which (tho' it be a known Point of Christian Faith) is now creeping again into Fashion in <hi>England.</hi> And, it was for the same good Reason, that I went about to demonstrate that Point of the <hi>Impossibility of Annihilation;</hi> because our Modern <hi>Socinians</hi> explicate the Spiritual Perdition of the Soul, by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation.</hi> And, that the Reason why I advanc'd and demonstrated those <hi>Theses,</hi> was out of my Respect to Faith, appears yet more manifestly, because I apply them still to the Confutation of those Sects.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Hitherto, then, it is not visible to the Eye of any sober Christian, how I, or those Books of mine, could fall into the high Displeasure of Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> to that degree, as to revile my self, and degrade <hi>them</hi> to the lowest degree of Contempt. If he had dis-lik'd my Reasons which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish'd these Particulars in my <hi>Method,</hi> he might, in behalf of Truth, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed them; and he should not, in the least, have disoblig'd me; nor had it broke any Friendship between us. But, now comes my Crime: It was my necessary Duty, while I was writing my <hi>Method to Science,</hi> to confute those Methods advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102124:12"/>
by others, which I judg'd to be <hi>False</hi> ones: Whence, I took notice of that of <hi>Malbranche,</hi> who pretends that all Science comes by Divine Revelation; and of that of <hi>Cartesius,</hi> who, (as the Writer of his Life tells us,) by endeavouring to bring himself to question all the Certainty he had receiv'd from his Senses, fell into Fits of <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi> I thought it a Duty I ow'd to Mankind, and to the Subject I was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of, to forewarn Studious Men of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing such Methods as might prejudice their Wits; and, withall, lead them into Errour; and to declare, that <hi>I could not think that God ever intended That for the only Means</hi> (as they pretend) <hi>for Men to get Knowledge, which might make them lose their Wits in looking after it.</hi> This highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended those <hi>Cartesians,</hi> and transported them into most Tragical Exclamations. But with what Reason? It lay directly in the Road I had taken; and, What Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation had I to either of those Authors, that I should dissemblingly favour them, against the Duty I ow'd to my <hi>Readers,</hi> and the Regard I had for <hi>Truth?</hi> It could not proceed from any private Pique a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their <hi>Persons,</hi> for they had never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd me. Again; Had I wrong'd either of them, it had been easie to confure me, by shewing that I either falsify'd the Words I cited, or suppress'd their own Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102124:12"/>
of them. But, both these being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, and Confutation by way of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> not being their Talent, another Way (tho' nothing to the purpose) was thought fit; which was, to rail at me aloud, and bespatter my Person.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I had brought also some Arguments against divers Positions of the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Doctrine, advanc'd by Mr. <hi>Le Grand;</hi> but I had not one unhandsom Word against his Person, but spoke <hi>respectfully</hi> of him: Which, from a <hi>Scholar,</hi> and a <hi>Well-bred</hi> Man, might have merited the like Return. If the Arguments against <hi>Cartesianism</hi> gave him too much Trouble to answer, it was too good a Fault to be sorry for it. It seems, there was no other Crime in them, nor me; for, could they have been An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd by <hi>Calm Reason,</hi> there had been no need to have Recourse to <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi> which abounded in his Reply. A hundred Cavils, which were <hi>foreign</hi> to the Matter in hand, were hal'd in by head and shoulders; and fitted up by sinister Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, and false Representations, to lay an <hi>Odium</hi> upon me. Not one of those Questions were stated, or fully treated of, to benefit the Reader, by letting him see what was <hi>True,</hi> what <hi>not:</hi> But a few Words were snatch'd out of my Books, here and there; and then distorted, and perverted, to make them fit to be descanted upon with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102124:13"/>
Raillery. My <hi>Conclusions,</hi> against all Laws of Disputation, were stoutly <hi>Deny'd:</hi> The <hi>Proofs,</hi> by which they subsisted, were sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled in <hi>Silence;</hi> at least, the <hi>Force</hi> of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments were scarce ever taken notice of: Whereas, the most puny Logician knows that a <hi>Conclusion,</hi> for which a <hi>Proof</hi> is brought, is to stand firm, and be allow'd, till the <hi>Proof</hi> for it be <hi>Invalidated.</hi> Do they think I would have taken it ill from any Man, if he shew'd me the Weakness of my Argument? I do assure them, I am so far from that Humour, that I should take it for a <hi>great Favour:</hi> For, by this means, they would either <hi>satisfie</hi> me, by convincing me of my Errour; or else, by Attempting to answer my Reasons, and not performing it, <hi>Truth</hi> would become more <hi>Victorious;</hi> which is all an honest Man ought to aim at. On the contrary, How civilly did I invite Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> to take the Manly Way of Arguing becoming a Scholar, and to <hi>prove</hi> what he <hi>says?</hi> End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with these Words, <hi>Id. Cartes. p.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Nec peto à Te, &amp;c.</hi> Nor <hi>do I require of you to</hi> Perform <hi>this; at least,</hi> Endeavour it, <hi>and you shall see with what Honour I will treat you, tho' you do sometimes, nay, often, fail.</hi> But I was not so Fortunate, as to meet with such a Candid Adversary. The Way of <hi>Invective</hi> was resolv'd on, as more favourable to their Cause; and all Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102124:13"/>
that were handsome, and becoming Learned Men, were rejected.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Now, Gentlemen, since I have, in my Reply, shewn this Carriage of theirs Evident by Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> judge how strangely <hi>Imprudent</hi> (not to say, worse) these Men are, who can persuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that this manner of Writing, never taken by any sober Man since the World stood when he is to answer another Man's <hi>Arguments,</hi> or to establish his own <hi>Thesis,</hi> does not perfectly convince every Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Person, that they are at an <hi>end</hi> of their <hi>Reason</hi> when they fall into such a high Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation of Passion; and this without any other Provocation, than what my <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> gave them? Can their pelting their Adversary with such abominable <hi>Slanders,</hi> (even supposing him guilty of them all,) either Answer his <hi>Proofs</hi> for his Doctrine, or avail in the least to <hi>prove</hi> their own? Were the Person they impugn a Profess'd Atheist, it could not justifie a Writer who is to defend <hi>Truth,</hi> to run away from the Question, and fall to <hi>Impertinent Brabbling,</hi> and bring in twenty <hi>Foreign Exceptions,</hi> and <hi>Personal Defamations,</hi> which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to the Point. Nay, it would, in that Case, be far more requisite to take care to confute him with Pregnant and <hi>Solid Reasons;</hi> lest prudent Readers, who are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious enough to see that Ill Language,

            <p n="17">17. 'Tis to be noted, then, That the Perfect Distinction between <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures was formerly unknown to many, even of the Antient Fathers; the Doctrine of <hi>Faith,</hi> (only which was their Concern, as <hi>Fathers,)</hi> abstracting from such particular Questions, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Philosophical Speculations: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that <hi>Joannes Thessalonicensis,</hi> in the Second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, said, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were, indeed, <hi>Intelligibles,</hi> (he means, <hi>Intellectuales;) Sed non omninò Corporis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertes, verùm tenui corpore praediti, &amp; ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reo, sive igneo:</hi> That <hi>Angels were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Body, but had a Thin Body of Air or Fire.</hi> Nay, this Opinion of his was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of by the Council. And, which is yet more, he says, that <hi>Catholica Ecclesia sic sentit;</hi> that is, <hi>'Tis the Sentiment of the Catholick Church:</hi> Which shews, that this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102124:19"/>
Opinion was very <hi>Universal.</hi> Though it ought here to be observ'd, that he says not that the Catholick Church holds this as a <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> or <hi>descended</hi> from <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles;</hi> but only, that the Church <hi>sic sentit;</hi> that is, <hi>thinks</hi> or <hi>opines</hi> so. For, no wise Man can doubt that the Fathers, in Council, being not only <hi>Witnesses</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> deliver'd from the fore-going Church, which they <hi>propagate,</hi> and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Following Age, (which gives them, properly, and formally, the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Fathers;)</hi> but, being also Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, and Divines; they do hence, sometimes, deliver themselves, (tho' not in their Decrees of <hi>Faith)</hi> as Men endow'd with these later Qualifications.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The Reason which made so many Holy Men fall into that great Errour, contradicted now by most of the Divines of the Christian Church, was, because, the World not having yet arriv'd to that Maturity of Science as to get above Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and therefore not distinguishing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly those two sorts of Substances, hence they were apt to take <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Texts of Scripture, (such as those generally are, where it speaks of <hi>Spiritual Natures,</hi> and their <hi>Operations,)</hi> to be meant <hi>Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> and <hi>Literally:</hi> Nor, consequently, could they conceive otherwise, but that Pure Spirits were <hi>Passive;</hi> and therefore,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102124:19"/>
of their own Nature, <hi>Mutable,</hi> by Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions on them, as <hi>Bodies</hi> are; and, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Matter</hi> being the only <hi>Potential</hi> or <hi>Passive Principle,</hi> to have some <hi>Materia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> or <hi>Corporeity,</hi> in their Natures. Yet were not <hi>all</hi> the Antient Fathers thus weakly grounded: For, one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientest, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> was more Solid, and <hi>(Lib. de Animâ, cap.</hi> 2.) lays this for a kind of Principle: <hi>[Incorporalitas nihil pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur, non habens per quod pati possit; aut si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habet, hoc est Corpus: In quantum enim om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Corporale passibile est, in tantum omne quod passibile est, Corporale est: An Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi> (that is, a <hi>Spiritual) Thing cannot suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> (from another Agent,) <hi>having nothing in it, by means of which it can suffer;</hi> (that is, having no <hi>Matter</hi> in it, through which only those Things, call'd Bodies, are Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive:) <hi>Or, if it have any such, it is a Body; since, for what Reason every Bodily Thing is Passive, for the same Reason every thing that is Passive, is Corporeal.]</hi> Which Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so perfectly consonant to the <hi>Aristote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Doctrine, was, I believe, the Reason why, speaking of those in the Interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate State, he says, <hi>Non dimittetur nisi mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico quoque delicto morâ Resurrection is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penso: He shall not be pardon'd, till every little Sin be paid for by the Delay of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</hi> Nor is it hard to alledge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Antient Fathers, of the same Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,

The Reason for this seemingly strange Position is grounded (as was now shewn) on the <hi>Essential Differences</hi> of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> and no less on the <hi>Duration</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to <hi>Angels,</hi> which Divines call <hi>Aevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity;</hi> which, being of a Superiour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to that of <hi>Time,</hi> does comprehend and concentre in it self all the several Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of our Fleeting <hi>Time,</hi> and, after an Eminent Manner, includes, and is Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to them <hi>all:</hi> Not by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensuration, (which can onely be found among <hi>Quantitative</hi> Things,) but by the Excellency it has <hi>above</hi> them. So that, as when an Angel <hi>operates</hi> upon any Body of a <hi>vast Extent,</hi> it is not <hi>Diffus'd,</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,</hi> according to the <hi>Extent</hi> of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it works upon; but, by its own <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible</hi> Nature, produces that <hi>Divisible</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: so neither are its Indivisible <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>

They who dislike this Discourse of mine, ought, if they would confute me, to shew that I do not, in it, <hi>hold Firmly</hi> to the <hi>Nature of the Thing,</hi> or <hi>Subject,</hi> in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and thence draw my Argument; but <hi>deviate</hi> from it: And, withall, they are to make it Evident to the Reader, that themselves <hi>do this,</hi> while they oppose me.

            <p n="23">23. Lest any should think it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, so many several Effects should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by an Angel in <hi>one Instant,</hi> and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it is some Whimsie of my own head, I desire them to reflect on what St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin (Prima, Q.</hi> 62. <hi>a.</hi> 4.) positively asserts, or rather lays for a Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Angels, by one Act, and in the first Instant, did merit.</hi> Perhaps, I might here alledge, That, if in the <hi>first</hi> Instant they could <hi>merit,</hi> or <hi>chuse GOD</hi> for their <hi>True</hi> Last End, they might also, in the <hi>same</hi> Instant, chuse a <hi>wrong Last End,</hi> or <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and so be <hi>damn'd.</hi> But I need not press it so far here: I only desire we may consider how many distinct Acts would pass in us, successively, ere we could be <hi>dispos'd for Heaven;</hi> which, in the Old Language of the Church, is call'd <hi>Merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Several Objects are <hi>propos'd</hi> to us, to <hi>chuse</hi> out of: Then we <hi>consider,</hi> or <hi>compare</hi> them; then we yield that <hi>this</hi> is more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to us, (thus affected, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc'd,) than the <hi>other;</hi> then we <hi>make choice</hi> of the one, and <hi>reject</hi> the other; then we <hi>resolve</hi> to <hi>pursue</hi> it; and, lastly, we set our selves to <hi>lay Means</hi> to <hi>compass it,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:102124:23"/>
Now, all these are, according to this great Divine, perform'd by an Angel, in one <hi>Instant;</hi> tho' there be evidently Priority of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> of the fore-going Acts; to the following ones: and, therefore, that the Angels must necessarily, in the <hi>same</hi> Instant, (it being suppos'd by us the <hi>First,)</hi> know their own <hi>Nature,</hi> their <hi>Existence,</hi> what is <hi>Agreeable</hi> to that Nature, and all the Train of Motives that conduce to the <hi>Determination</hi> of their <hi>Wills;</hi> without which, there can be no <hi>Merit.</hi> By which, Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> (who understands no more of those hard Points, than a Child does <hi>Algebra)</hi> may see they may have that which we call <hi>Deliberation</hi> and <hi>Determination</hi> in in the first Instant, without needing Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of <hi>Time</hi> to it, as he seems to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Nay, the same Learned Doctor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that Angels are <hi>happy by one only O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration;</hi> which includes, virtually, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, nay, Innumerable, of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. These are strange <hi>Paradoxes</hi> to Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi>'s <hi>Merry man,</hi> and such Men of Fancy; yet, we see this Great and Profound Speculater asserts them for <hi>Truths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">24. I know the same Holy Man holds the contrary Opinion to that which, in this Point, I think most reasonable; nay, which, I see, follows out of the Grounds lately mention'd, which <hi>himself</hi> had laid.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102124:23"/>
For, if they may have <hi>so many</hi> Operations in the First Instant, (subsequent to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in the Order of Nature,) why not <hi>more?</hi> What can stint them to such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Number? But, 'tis to be noted, First, That in the place cited, <hi>(Q.</hi> 63. <hi>Art.</hi> 5. <hi>corp.)</hi> he affirms, with St. <hi>Austin,</hi> that this Opinion I follow does not induce the <hi>Manichaean Heresie,</hi> because it makes them not <hi>Bad by their Nature,</hi> but by the <hi>Depravity</hi> of their <hi>own Free-Will:</hi> Which evinces, there is nothing <hi>against Faith</hi> in it; nor would he have pass'd it over so unconcernedly, had it been so. Next, speaking of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I maintain, he says, <hi>Quidam posue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, &amp;c. Some Divines maintain'd,</hi> &amp;c. Which shews, that there have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Learned Men of that Opinion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. Thirdly, He confutes those who gave this for their Reason why it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, because two Operations could not be terminated in the same Instant; and tells them, That this Reason holds on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in those Agents which work by Local Motion; but, that it may well be thus in Operations which are <hi>Instantaneous;</hi> and, that in <hi>these,</hi> there may be, in one Instant, the <hi>Terminus</hi> of the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Lastly, The Reason for which only that Great Man dissents from those who held our Opinion, is grounded on that Maxim of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> That the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:102124:24"/>
or he that gives <hi>Being,</hi> gives also the <hi>First Operation;</hi> which, in the Devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sinful,</hi> cannot therefore be in the <hi>First</hi> Instant; lest it should make GOD the Author of Sin. Which Reason does not convince me, or seem to conclude. For, First, However this may hold in <hi>Natural</hi> Agents, for which only <hi>Aristotle</hi> did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly intend it as a Maxim; yet, I see not how the Parity holds in those Agents which have <hi>Free-Will;</hi> for, the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of such Agents are not purely refun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>GOD,</hi> but <hi>partly</hi> into <hi>themselves,</hi> who are the <hi>Producers</hi> of them; nay, <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as far as they are <hi>Defective.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The First Natural Operation of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Creature, is, to know her own <hi>Essence,</hi> at least (in Souls) their own <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence;</hi> and, by them, all other Things which may be known by it, according as its Nature and Circumstances require; and this is given her by the First Cause, who gave them their Natures. But, there are <hi>many other</hi> Operations, subsequent to one another in Posteriority of Nature, (as is explain'd above,) which may be all perform'd in the First Instant, as St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> himself, above-cited, has declar'd; and, among them, the <hi>Choice</hi> made by their <hi>Free-Will:</hi> Nor does any Reason ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, why all these thus subsequent Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations should be <hi>ingenerated</hi> in them, by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102124:24"/>
the Giver of their Being; much less, why those <hi>Defective</hi> Operations, which have a Natural Dependence on others, should be refunded into GOD.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Let us pass on now to <hi>Souls separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> which die with some Venial Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them, or (as St. <hi>James</hi> calls it) with <hi>Sins not unto Death,</hi> and therefore need <hi>Purging;</hi> nor can be <hi>sav'd, but by Fire.</hi> Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> puts it upon me, that I hold them <hi>Immutable</hi> in their <hi>Intermediate</hi> State, as <hi>Angels</hi> are. I would ask him, <hi>how</hi> he <hi>knows</hi> I hold that Opinion, since I have never declar'd in my Writings that I hold it. Wherefore, the putting it upon me, who no where assert it, is Unfair, Uncivil, Captious, and Invidious. I have shewn, indeed, <hi>(Id. Cart. p.</hi> 58.) that his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against it, do not conclude. So did St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in the place now cited, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the <hi>Inconclusiveness</hi> of the Reason brought against his own Opinion; and, yet, <hi>himself</hi> held that Opinion of his not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding. He will say, the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument concludes equally for Angels and Them: But he will be hard put to it, to prove it. The <hi>Soul</hi> had its <hi>Being,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Dispositions in the <hi>Embryo,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring such a <hi>Form</hi> as Nature could not give. It is the <hi>Form</hi> of the Body, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally requires, to <hi>act with it.</hi> It had its <hi>Education</hi> (as we may say) <hi>in the Body;</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:102124:25"/>
for it receiv'd its Spiritual <hi>Growth</hi> in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by means of <hi>Bodily</hi> Impressions on the Senses. It is <hi>Unactive</hi> when the Body is <hi>out of Order.</hi> It has naturally a dear <hi>Love</hi> for it; procures its Good, grieves when it is hurt, and has a kind of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to <hi>part with it.</hi> Nay, it retains a <hi>Hankering</hi> after it, after it has parted with it; insomuch, that even the Greatest Saints have not the perfect Consummation of their Bliss, till they get their Bodies again at the Resurrection; and, <hi>magis est Anima ubi amat quàm ubi animat.</hi> Lastly, Those Imperfect Souls carry some Bodily Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions along with them. Hence, <hi>F. Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinus Caponi,</hi> in his <hi>Elucidationes Formales, Q</hi> 76. <hi>Art.</hi> 1. says, the Soul is <hi>always uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Body, vel actu, vel inclinatione na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali; either Actually, or by its Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination:</hi> And he gives for his Reason, <hi>Aut ergo aptitudine saltem unitur tali mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae, aut non est Anima; sed semper est Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, ergo, &amp;c. Either the Soul then is, by her Aptitude at least, united to the Body, or it is not a Soul: But it remains always a Soul,</hi> &amp;c. The contrary to all which Particulars is found in an <hi>Angel.</hi> Now, what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Dispositions to Mutability these Considerations may give to a <hi>Soul,</hi> rather than to an <hi>Angel,</hi> I have not speculated so deep upon that Point, as to determine; which made me pitch upon an <hi>Angel,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102124:25"/>
than a <hi>Soul,</hi> when I advanc'd that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration. And, had I spoke of a <hi>Soul</hi> expresly, own'd its <hi>Immutability</hi> as my Tenet, and gone about to defend it, I do not doubt but so to explain my Sentiment in that Point, as will give no Offence to any sober Man, nor any who is not resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remain unsatisfy'd.</p>
            <p n="26">26. The next pretended Bug-bear, is, the Impossibility of Annihilation; which I prove thus:</p>
            <p n="27">27. 1. Every Cause <hi>acts</hi> according as it <hi>is,</hi> or according to <hi>its Nature;</hi> at least, it cannot act <hi>contradictorily</hi> to its own Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. But Annihilation is the putting of <hi>Nothing,</hi> or <hi>Not-being;</hi> which is Diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Opposite to GOD's Nature, which is Pure <hi>Existence:</hi> Therefore Annihilation cannot be caus'd by GOD.</p>
            <p n="28">28. 2. Every <hi>Active</hi> Power, (as Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence is,) even tho' Infinite, is for some <hi>Action:</hi> But Annihilation is no <hi>Action;</hi> therefore it cannot proceed from GOD's Omnipotence. That Annihilation is <hi>no Action,</hi> I prove thus: That which is <hi>no Species,</hi> or <hi>no Sort</hi> of Action, is <hi>no Action:</hi> But Annihilation is <hi>no Kind,</hi> or <hi>Sort,</hi> of Action; for, every Scholar knows that every Action is of such a <hi>determinate</hi> Kind, because its <hi>Terminus,</hi> or <hi>Effect,</hi> is such or such; whereas, <hi>Nothing</hi> is <hi>no Effect</hi> at all, much less a <hi>Determinate</hi> one; but, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102124:26"/>
imaginable Respect, a <hi>Defect,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate.</hi> Therefore, Annihilation is <hi>no Action;</hi> nor, consequently, can it be perform'd by an <hi>Active Power,</hi> as Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence is; and, therefore, it argues <hi>no Power</hi> at all; and, which follows, 'tis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>Impotency,</hi> or Want of <hi>Active</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than <hi>Omnipotence;</hi> because that <hi>Active</hi> Power which can have <hi>no</hi> such <hi>Action</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from it; or, (which is the same,) an <hi>Active</hi> Power which <hi>cannot VVork</hi> or <hi>Act,</hi> is so far <hi>Impotent;</hi> which cannot be said of <hi>GOD's Omnipotence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="29">29. 3. To be <hi>Creator</hi> of all Things, or <hi>Giver of Being,</hi> is (as our <hi>Creed</hi> teaches) one of GOD's Attributes: But it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of, that to be <hi>Uncreator,</hi> or <hi>Destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> of Things, was ever attributed to GOD; or, that <hi>Contradictory</hi> Attributes could be peculiarly Appropriated to him; as my Adversaries hold there can, while they deny both <hi>Creating,</hi> and <hi>Uncreating,</hi> or Annihilating, to be <hi>Possible</hi> to <hi>any,</hi> but to GOD; that is, Peculiar to him.</p>
            <p n="30">30. It will be said, that Annihilation is perform'd by <hi>Suspension</hi> of GOD's Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Action of Creating, or Giving Being. But this seems more Unconsonant than the former: For,</p>
            <p n="31">31. 4. <hi>Suspension</hi> (if it have any Sense) means, the <hi>Action</hi> of Suspending; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, being put by them to be only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102124:26"/>
by GOD's <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> which is an <hi>Active</hi> Power; and this Action must have its Effect upon that which is <hi>Suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> making it, of <hi>Not-suspended,</hi> to become <hi>Suspended;</hi> that is, <hi>Chang'd.</hi> But, that which is here Suspended, is GOD's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of giving <hi>Being.</hi> Wherefore, this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of <hi>Suspension</hi> puts a kind of <hi>Passive</hi> Power in GOD, receiving this Action, or <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Suspension;</hi> which makes Him, who is <hi>Essentially Immutable,</hi> to be <hi>Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> Neither of which themselves will say.</p>
            <p n="32">32. 5. That Actuality is not Infinite, which is not actually <hi>Exercis'd,</hi> or produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not <hi>actually</hi> the Effect peculiar to it, when the Subject is <hi>Dispos'd</hi> to receive its Influence, and it self is intimately <hi>Apply'd</hi> to it. But the <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Thing,</hi> suppos'd to be Annihilated, was equally <hi>Dispos'd,</hi> or <hi>Capable to be,</hi> in the Instant it is suppos'd to be Annihilated, as it was <hi>before;</hi> and the Cause, by GOD's <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> was intimately <hi>Apply'd,</hi> and yet the <hi>Effect,</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> was <hi>not put;</hi> therefore the Cause it self was not Infinitely Actual, as it was before; which is impossible to be thought. Note, that to an Infinite Actuality, it is requisite, and necessary, that it be (all other Requisites being put) actually <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd;</hi> For, Actual <hi>Exercise</hi> being the <hi>most Formal</hi> Notion of <hi>Pure Actuality,</hi> it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102124:27"/>
follows, that it is not Infinite if it be <hi>stint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> or fails <hi>precisely on its Part,</hi> of being <hi>Exercis'd,</hi> when all other Requisites are put.</p>
            <p n="33">33. 6. The same may be deduc'd from GOD's. Infinite <hi>Goodness;</hi> which consists in his being (as far as is of it self) <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative</hi> of Goodness and Being when the Subject is capable, and his Wisdom sees it best; by which only it is <hi>stinted.</hi> This is so certain a Truth, that, in such Cases, (as Divines shew,) even in <hi>Supernaturals,</hi> 'tis the <hi>Incapacity</hi> of Wicked Souls, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Obstacle to the ever-ready Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Heavenly Grace, that suspends it from working in such Corrupt and Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Hearts: Whence, as soon as, by their sincere <hi>Repentance,</hi> that Obstacle is <hi>taken off,</hi> they receive again the Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Influence of the Holy Ghost, and the Gift of Divine Love. And this is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant a Doctrine of the Church, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did the most Sceptical Divine que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion or fancy that it could become GOD's Goodness to <hi>Suspend</hi> the Influence of Grace to such Penitents; but rather, they oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times receive it in a greater Measure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Saying of our Saviour, <hi>(Luke</hi> 7. 47.) <hi>Cui minus dimittitur, minùs diligit: He to whom less is forgiven, loves less.</hi> Whence also, upon their hearty Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (which includes a Will to do what
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102124:27"/>
GOD and his Church enjoin,) the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Church are bound to <hi>Absolve</hi> them, or admit them to the Participation of the Sacrament of Love; by which they are spiritually restor'd to the <hi>Communion</hi> of Christ's true Members, Vertuous Souls. Hence I argue: The Creature suppos'd to be Annihilated, was equally capable to <hi>receive</hi> Being at the Instant in which 'tis suppos'd to be Annihilated, as <hi>before;</hi> and GOD's Exuberant and Infinite <hi>Goodness</hi> cannot but be <hi>Equally</hi> ready to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Goodness, or Being, to his poor, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent Creatures, as it was formerly; therefore, the same Effect, or Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Being, must follow; and, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, there can be no Annihilation.</p>
            <p n="34">34. The same is deduc'd from that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preamly wise Saying, grounded on GOD's Infinite Actuality, and Goodness, <hi>[Dona Dei sunt absque paenitentia: The Gifts of GOD are without Repentance.]</hi> Which signifies, that, Let not the <hi>Creature change,</hi> and GOD is still <hi>immutably</hi> the <hi>same;</hi> and so, the same Effect must still follow. Nay, the Diversity of the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes that respect us, is wholly grounded on the various Disposition of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. So that the same Ill Accidents are <hi>Mercies</hi> to good Souls, and serve to try, purifie, and improve them in Vertue, and thence, increase their Reward in Heaven;

which, to obstinately <hi>Wicked</hi> Souls, who are <hi>not</hi> Dispos'd to make good Use of them, is truly call'd an Effect of his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;</hi> vexing them here by Comfortless Irresignation, and Sinful Repining at GOD's Chastisement; and, so, tending to increase their Torments in the next World. Wherefore, as was said, by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the <hi>Disposition</hi> of the <hi>Creature</hi> being the <hi>same,</hi> and GOD being Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the <hi>same</hi> also, the same Effect will follow: Nor can it be, that any Creature should be Annihilated.</p>
            <p n="35">35. The same is evinc'd from GOD's Attribute of <hi>VVisdom,</hi> or <hi>Knowledge,</hi> by which he made the World. To under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the following Discourse, we are to reflect upon that admirably profound Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of St. <hi>Austin, (Conf. cap. ult.) Nos ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que quae fecisti videmus, quia sunt; Tu au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem quia vides ea, sunt: VVe see</hi> (or <hi>know) Creatures, because they are; But thy Seeing</hi> (or <hi>Knowing) them, is the Cause, or Reason, that they are.</hi> Which amounts to this, That GOD gains not his Knowledge of Creatures from their Being so as he sees them to be, as we do; but his <hi>Seeing,</hi> or <hi>Knowing,</hi> them to be fit for the Best Order of the World, which his Infinite Wisdom had Determin'd, <hi>gives,</hi> or <hi>makes,</hi> them to <hi>be.</hi> By which <hi>Metaphysical,</hi> or rather <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Maxim of this Learned and Holy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102124:28"/>
Father, it follows, that GOD leaves off to <hi>know</hi> a Creature at the Instant it is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated: And, consequently, since this Knowledge of his is not taken from the <hi>Existence</hi> of the <hi>Creature,</hi> (which is <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal</hi> to him,) nor depends on it, but on <hi>himself;</hi> it should follow, that GOD, by Annihilating a Creature, becomes <hi>Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secally Chang'd;</hi> which is impossible.</p>
            <p n="36">36. The same is prov'd from GOD's Attribute of <hi>Justice.</hi> For, if any <hi>One</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be Annihilated, <hi>All of them</hi> may; since 'tis granted by both Parties, that they do, all of them, <hi>Entirely</hi> and <hi>Equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend</hi> on the Divine Goodness, for their Existence. Let us put then two Souls to be Annihilated; the one of which, by loving GOD heartily, is, at the Hour of Death, perfectly Dispos'd for its Glorious Reward in Heaven: The other dies obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and Devilishly Wicked: It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that neither that <hi>Holy</hi> Soul will ever be Rewarded, nor the <hi>VVicked</hi> one Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, in case they be Annihilated. But, this is against GOD's <hi>Justice;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be done.</p>
            <p n="37">37. In a Word; Let them explicate <hi>Suspension</hi> as they will, and assign it for the Cause of Annihilation, it makes GOD the Cause of <hi>no Effect;</hi> that is, to be <hi>no Cause,</hi> which destroys their own Position: Nay, it makes him the Cause of the <hi>worst</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:102124:29"/>
               <hi>Defect</hi> imaginable; or rather, of <hi>Pure De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi> for, <hi>Nothing,</hi> or <hi>Not-being,</hi> is <hi>such;</hi> to put which upon GOD, who is <hi>Pure Actuality,</hi> and, therefore, a Cause (as far as concerns himself) ever Actually Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is (to speak with the least) a strange Tenet. If they mean only to say, that Creatures <hi>depend</hi> every Moment on GOD, for their <hi>Being;</hi> or, that, if, <hi>per impossibile,</hi> he should suspend his Acting, they would no longer <hi>be,</hi> I do heartily agree with them; for this is Agreeable both to the <hi>Self-Existence</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the <hi>Nothingness</hi> of <hi>Creatures,</hi> of themselves: But, if they contend it is an <hi>Act</hi> of his <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence,</hi> (the Notion of which is manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relative to its <hi>Effects,</hi> that is <hi>Active,</hi> or <hi>Effective</hi> of <hi>Something,) actually</hi> to <hi>execute</hi> this, or, that it consists with his Divine Attributes; they must bring very strong Arguments to prove it, ere I shall think fit to yield it; whereas, hitherto they have brought <hi>none at all,</hi> but <hi>Merry-man</hi>'s silly Explication of a Glass falling down, and breaking, if he takes away his Hand; which the weak Fop thinks is a rare Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: Whereas, it is demonstrable in Physicks, that the Glass would stand for Eternity where his Hand left it, if there were no <hi>Positive Action</hi> of a Cause impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it downwards, <hi>viz.</hi> (the Descent of the Atmosphere;) which kind of Positive A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is <hi>here wanting.</hi>

38. They will object, that GOD is a <hi>Free Agent,</hi> and so may chuse whether he <hi>will</hi> sustain Creatures in Being, or <hi>no.</hi> But those weak Divines take the Notion of <hi>Freedom</hi> from the Folly of Creatures; which is this, that we can, out of <hi>Humour,</hi> do, and undo Things at our pleasure, whether it agrees with <hi>True Reason,</hi> which is our <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>no.</hi> Whereas, <hi>True Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> does not consist in a foolish Humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>someness, or in the <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>undoing</hi> Things, <hi>as the Toy takes us;</hi> but in this, that, <hi>Unforc'd,</hi> and <hi>Unconstrain'd,</hi> by any thing which is <hi>without us,</hi> we determin our selves according to the Inclination of our true Nature, <hi>Reason;</hi> and, when we do otherwise, we are less Free; or <hi>Slaves</hi> to some <hi>Passion</hi> which impels us, and makes us deviate from the Propensions we have by our True Nature, to do what is <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> Wherefore, GOD's <hi>Freedom</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in this, that he is Essentially <hi>Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd</hi> to act <hi>according to his own Nature,</hi> and <hi>to his own Attributes,</hi> which are <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to his Nature. Since, then, it has been shewn, that to <hi>Give Being</hi> is Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to GOD's <hi>Essence,</hi> which is <hi>Self-Existence,</hi> and to his <hi>Attributes,</hi> he is <hi>more Free</hi> for his being thus <hi>Self determin'd</hi> to give Being to such Creatures as his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom sees fittest for the best Order of his World; and, that, to do otherwise, or to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102124:30"/>
               <hi>Annihilate,</hi> is to be <hi>less Free,</hi> because it is less according to his Essence, and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; which is, not to be every way Perfect, and <hi>Infinitely</hi> such.</p>
            <p n="39">39. I must confess, it seems very <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> and <hi>Shocking,</hi> to Pious Ears, to say that <hi>GOD cannot do this,</hi> or <hi>cannot do the other:</hi> But the School-men, in their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, first brought that Expression into Custom; and, tho', following them, I have sometimes us'd it, yet I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to <hi>soften</hi> and <hi>explicate</hi> it so, as it may not breed any Offence. Hence, in my <hi>METHOD, pag.</hi> 363. I have these Words, <hi>[It is generally more Safe, more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying, and more Proper, to say, in such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> [It cannot be that GOD should will such a thing.] <hi>than bluntly to say</hi> [GOD cannot do it:] <hi>For, This flatly</hi> limits <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence; That only</hi> restrains <hi>its Acting</hi> hîc &amp; nunc, <hi>because of some Attribute of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, to which it is Disagreeable.]</hi> Hence, also, I affirm, <hi>(Id.

40. But, now comes an Objection of weight: <hi>Spondanus</hi> tells us, (he says,) that <hi>It was one of</hi> Wickleff<hi>'s Errours, Condemn'd in the General Council of</hi> Constance, <hi>by a perpetual Decree, That GOD could not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate.</hi> This looks <hi>Great,</hi> and <hi>Mighty.</hi> But, why does he not relate this <hi>Perpetual Decree</hi> of the Council, in its own Words, if there be any such? Is not the Council it self extant? Or, is <hi>Spondanus</hi>'s Relating it more Authentick than the Words of the Council <hi>it self?</hi> Why does he not tell us then, out of the Acts of the Council, in what Sense, and under what Terms, <hi>Wickleff</hi> propos'd it: In what Words, and in what Sense, that Council condemn'd it? Or, whether it were more express than that of <hi>Joannes Thessalonicensis,</hi> in the Second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> That <hi>'tis the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of the Church,</hi> (that is, <hi>the General Opinion,) that Angels have thin Bodies of Air, or Fire?</hi> The contrary to which, for all that, the best Catholick Divines do now publickly teach. Lastly, If this be a Point of Faith, (as they would have it thought,) why is not this press'd home against me? This would knock me down at one Blow; and there would need no paltry Jeers, Flouts, or Falsifications, to do that Job, which is their only Aim. The Reader may be sure they are conscious there is some <hi>great Flaw</hi> in this Objection, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102124:31"/>
they are so favourable to me, in thus <hi>bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>crudely</hi> Alledging it. But, what is all this to me? It is a common Doctrine, taught openly in the Schools, That this is not performable by GOD's <hi>Ordinary Power;</hi> and, I have already shewn, out of express Words, both in my <hi>METHOD;</hi> and in my later Books, that I speak of no <hi>other</hi> Power. So that, either I am no <hi>Wickleffist</hi> for maintaining it; or, I have enow of very honest Brother-Hereticks; who maintain publickly the same, and, yet, are not ill look'd upon for it by the Church: Which being manifestly so, it would be worth our Consideration to find the Reason, why our Libelling <hi>Merry-man,</hi> whose Ironies are Sarcasms; and, who pretends Mirth, to cloak his Uneasie Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, does let <hi>all those</hi> Divines alone who hold the <hi>same</hi> that I do, and fall upon <hi>me only.</hi> But those Men had not challeng'd the <hi>Cartesians</hi> to <hi>produce Principles</hi> for their New-fangl'd Doctrine; in which consists my peculiar Heresie, which blows their <hi>Zeal for Faith</hi> into such a <hi>Flame.</hi>

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:102124:32"/>
               <hi>Things,</hi> each of those Things must have its peculiar Determinations, Modes, or Complexion of Accidents, <hi>constituting</hi> it an Individual Thing, which are <hi>sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by those <hi>Things,</hi> as their <hi>Subject;</hi> which is the very Notion of a <hi>Suppositum.</hi> There are therefore, and must be, Two <hi>Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> in Christ, as long as those two Natures remain in his Humanity; that is, <hi>for ever.</hi> To which, add the <hi>Divine Suppositum,</hi> it must follow, that there are <hi>Three Supposita</hi> in Christ; which shocks Christian Faith. To those, Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> has given no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Answer; nor can, unless he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes the <hi>Nature</hi> from the <hi>Suppositum;</hi> which, if he does, then the <hi>Suppositum</hi> of every Man may have <hi>Two Natures</hi> in it; and so, the Soul and Body may compound <hi>One Ens,</hi> or <hi>One Thing:</hi> And, then, since 'tis <hi>impossible,</hi> and contradictory, they can be One and Two in the same Respect, or under the same Notion, it will follow, that <hi>Man</hi> need be no more than <hi>One Thing.</hi> They will, perhaps, say, they are One <hi>Compound</hi> Thing; but Two Simple Ones, or Two <hi>Parts</hi> of that Compound: But I have taken off, and shewn, the Weakness of that Distinction, <hi>Id.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102124:32"/>
alone, when separated; which cannot be be True of the <hi>Body,</hi> which is a Distinct Thing when Separated, <hi>(viz.</hi> a Dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cass,) and not the same Thing, with the same <hi>Nature,</hi> much less the same <hi>Existence</hi> it had: Nay, a <hi>Compleat</hi> Thing too; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, That is <hi>compleatly</hi> a <hi>Thing,</hi> which wants nothing to make it <hi>Capable of Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and, if it wants that, it is not a <hi>Thing</hi> at all. But, what enforces farther, this Objection is, That 'tis defin'd in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Vienna,</hi> under Pope <hi>Clement</hi> V. that the <hi>Rational</hi> or <hi>Intellectual Soul</hi> is the <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi> The Words are these; <hi>[Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinam omnem seu positionem, temerè asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentem autvertentem in dubium quòd Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Animae Rationalis seu Intellectualis verè ac perfectè Humani Corporis non sit Forma, velut Erroneam, ac veritati Christianae Fidei ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micam, hoc Sacro approbante Consilio, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bamus.

               <hi>Cartesians;</hi> but I see plainly, that their New Notions, or <hi>Ideas,</hi> will never agree with the Explications which former Divines make of Christian Faith; much less, help them with <hi>better;</hi> or, indeed, with <hi>any.</hi> But, to return to our Subject:</p>
            <p n="42">42. Let us sum up this Tenet of theirs, concerning Annihilation, and see what Work they have made of it, according to the Lights <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> working upon our <hi>Natural</hi> Notions, have given us. First, They make it belong to GOD's <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> for which Attribute alone they seem zealous; for, I do not see that, in discoursing this Point, they even think of, or regard, his <hi>Self-Existence,</hi> which is his <hi>Essence,</hi> or his <hi>Goodness,</hi> his <hi>Justice,</hi> or any other Attribute of his; or pretend, in the least, it is Agreeable to <hi>them.</hi> Now, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency</hi> is a Power of doing <hi>all</hi> things; and they would make it a Power of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,</hi> or of <hi>doing Nothing,</hi> as to the Things Annihilated, to which <hi>only</hi> it relates. 2. Omnipotency is an <hi>Infinite</hi> Power, and withall, an <hi>Active</hi> Power, (for, I do not think they will put a <hi>Passive</hi> Power in GOD:) And, every <hi>Active</hi> Power is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially such, because it can have such an <hi>Action.</hi> Yet, Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, <hi>p.</hi> 36. seems to grant, that Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the <hi>Action</hi> of any Power; nor, indeed, such a <hi>Power;</hi> they being, as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102124:34"/>
specify'd by their Objects: To which he answers, <hi>Rectissimè!</hi> So that here we have an <hi>Active</hi> Power working, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an <hi>Action</hi> answering to it; or an <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent</hi> Power, (to which they ascribe that Effect,) which may be <hi>Deny'd</hi> to be <hi>such a Power;</hi> or, (which is the same,) he makes that a Power, which is <hi>no Power.</hi> 3. They say, 'tis done by <hi>Suspension:</hi> Well then; this belonging, as they say, to GOD's Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, which is an <hi>Active</hi> Power, this Suspension must, for the Reason given, be an <hi>Action.</hi> No, say they; 'tis <hi>no Action,</hi> but a <hi>Cessation</hi> from Action. Now, that <hi>not Acting</hi> should belong to Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; or, that the Action of <hi>Suspending</hi> his Power, should be an Action <hi>of that Power,</hi> gives us a Second Bull of the largest Size. 4. <hi>Suspension</hi> must either have some Effect, or no Effect: If <hi>none,</hi> 'tis to <hi>no purpose;</hi> If <hi>any,</hi> it must be in GOD; for, 'tis his Power that Acted <hi>before,</hi> and is now Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended: But, this puts a <hi>Passive</hi> Power in GOD; which is a higher Strain of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense, than either of the former. No, say they; the Effect is upon the Creature An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated; But this is as nonsensical as the former; for, Common Sense tells us, that <hi>Suspension</hi> has its <hi>proper Effect</hi> upon that which is <hi>Suspended,</hi> which is GOD's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative Action: Nor is the Existence of the Creature, in good Sense, Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102124:34"/>
for, that which is only Suspended, <hi>remains</hi> still, tho' <hi>in Suspense;</hi> whereas, the Creature remains not <hi>at all,</hi> being An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated. Yet, grant the Existence of the Creature could be said to be Suspended; still, GOD's Conservative Action, which made it <hi>be,</hi> must, in Priority of Nature, be suspended <hi>it self,</hi> ere its Existence could be suspended, or it self cease to be. But, waving this, let us see where this Effect is, which terminates this Action of <hi>Suspension.</hi> In the Creature, say they: And, what can we conceive to be in the Creature when it is <hi>Annihilated,</hi> which is the <hi>Effect</hi> of this Action, and terminates it? Why, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Nothing.</hi> Now, <hi>Nothing,</hi> or <hi>Not-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is a pure <hi>Defect;</hi> nay, infinitely, or in every imaginable Regard, <hi>Defective;</hi> and so can be <hi>no Effect,</hi> for this has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>Positive</hi> in its Notion. The last thing, therefore, they can possibly alledge, is, That Suspension is <hi>no Action.</hi> For An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to which, we must turn them over to School Boys, who can tell them, that <hi>Suspendo</hi> is a <hi>Verb Active,</hi> has a <hi>Transitive</hi> Signification, and must have an Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Case after it. The Question, then, is, What is this Accusative Case? Or (which is the same,) What is this Thing which is Suspended? Which we have already shewn, can with no Sense either be GOD, or the Creature; that is, Nothing is sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended;

and, therefore, this Suspension <hi>is no Suspension.</hi> So that, which way so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they turn and wind themselves, their own Contradictions still meet them in the Face, and confound them. And so much of this Point, which is only therefore scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, because 'tis unsutable to <hi>Fancy;</hi> that Faculty, which, if solely attended to, leads all its Followers into <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="43">43. Another <hi>Impiety</hi> of mine against GOD, is, That I will not allow that The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis of <hi>Cartesius,</hi> (for, we are to suppose, that all his Conceits, tho' never so Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, are Gospel with these Men,) that <hi>GOD is the Immediate Cause of Motion;</hi> the Denial of which does ravel the Scheme of that <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> Hence Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> infers, that I deny GOD to be the <hi>First Mover:</hi> Whereas, (so short is his Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faculty,) the direct <hi>contrary</hi> follows: For, he who only <hi>denies</hi> that GOD is the <hi>Immediate</hi> Cause of Motion, does, even by doing this, imply that he is the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, Remote</hi> and <hi>Principal</hi> Cause of it; as giving Angels, his Ministring Spirits, both the <hi>Power</hi> to move Matter; and, withal, <hi>moving</hi> them to <hi>move it,</hi> by Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Motives, or Manifestations, of the Wise Decrees of his Divine Providence, how he would have it done. Thus, all <hi>Instrumental</hi> Causes are the <hi>Immediate</hi> Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102124:35"/>
of <hi>every</hi> Effect in Nature. Will he say, that this is <hi>Impiety against GOD;</hi> or, that it debars Him from being the <hi>Principal</hi> Cause! Does not Fire <hi>immediately</hi> burn us? Water wet us? Or, Will any but a Mad-man say, that GOD is the <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> Cause of that Burning, or Wetting? Or, that this hinders Him from being the <hi>Principal</hi> Cause of <hi>all</hi> the Effects in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who gives them <hi>Power</hi> to produce those Effects, and <hi>Premoves</hi> or <hi>Applies</hi> them to produce them? Does not the Denial of this make all <hi>Second</hi> Causes <hi>Useless?</hi> How shallow, then, is this ridiculous Objection! Wherefore, let them either shew that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which are of a <hi>Superiour</hi> Nature to Matter, and are <hi>Pure Acts,</hi> have not <hi>Power</hi> to act upon it, or move it; or, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Sublimeness of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, to put his <hi>Immediate</hi> Hand to such mean and low Effects that his <hi>Servants</hi> have a Power to produce them; or, that this Power was given them by Him, to remain <hi>Useless,</hi> and <hi>Unemploy'd</hi> about its Proper Objects: or, let them grant that <hi>Angels,</hi> or (which is the same) GOD, by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, gives Motion to Matter. Again, to omit many other Arguments; That which GOD does Immediately by Second Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, is <hi>according to Nature;</hi> but, what he does <hi>immediately</hi> by <hi>Himself,</hi> is <hi>Miraculous,</hi> and <hi>Instantaneous,</hi> as coming from an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102124:36"/>
whose <hi>Infinite</hi> Power no <hi>Indisposition</hi> on the Creature's side can check, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard. Did GOD move Matter, when (as they hold) he divided it into greater Lumps at first, <hi>Instantaneously;</hi> whenas, it is not Motion, unless it have <hi>part after part;</hi> or, unless it be <hi>Successive?</hi> Would these Men but please to leave guiding their Thoughts by the hasty Sallies of their <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and regard deliberately the Natures of the Things we are discoursing of, that is, the Nature of GOD, who is Pure <hi>Self-Existence;</hi> the Nature of an <hi>Angel,</hi> and the Nature of <hi>Matter,</hi> and build their Discourses from those Grounds, we might hope, in time, for some Sense from them: But that is too Solid for them; it will not give their Fancy Leave to range, and take Vagaries in the Air, but holds them in too strictly; and, therefore, 'tis not <hi>their</hi> way. Yet, something must be said; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Ill Language</hi> must supply the place of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Solidity.</hi>

Who sees not that this odd Prevarication, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward Management of it, does evidently bewray a Distrust of their Cause, and a perfect Despair of maintaining it? Who sees not, that, by their flinching thus from the Question, and haling in impertinent Points, which were odd to Vulgar Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and were deny'd by other Divines, they hop'd (to save their own Bacon) to get those Men on their side, to make use of their Arguments, and of their (mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called) Authority, to decry me, because they wanted Arguments of their <hi>own,</hi> to uphold the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Doctrine? Lastly, What is their Scurrilous Dialogue, to their producing, or so much as <hi>Naming,</hi> any <hi>one Principle</hi> of theirs; to do which, I had challeng'd them?

Method, unheard of amongst Learned Men, hitherto: Who can hinder them?

But, to take off the Edge, and blunt the Teeth of all their reproachful Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I have shewn, above §. 39. that what they object to me, if they will but truly represent my Doctrine, can dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no sober Man, even of their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; since, in the three first Points, which their Confus'd and Undistinguishing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger strives to render so Invidious, I speak of GOD's <hi>Ordinary</hi> Power, or, of the Course of Causes, and the Nature of Things, as they come to our Knowledge by <hi>Natural</hi> Means, and are carry'd on by <hi>GOD's Ordinary Providence.</hi> What Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, but a Mad-man, will say, he can fathom and comprehend all the <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Methods and Ways which GOD's Infinite Wisdom can contrive, or his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power execute, when he shall please to work <hi>miraculously?</hi> He who is the Original Cause of those Natures, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he order them as he pleases, when His Wisdom, for Reasons inscrutable to the Greatest of his Creatures, sees it fit, to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102124:37"/>
bring about those Hidden Ends design'd by his Divine Decrees? Who can say, that, tho' <hi>Angels</hi> have no Means to <hi>acquire</hi> New Knowledges, and so ought, by their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to have all the Knowledge they are capable of, <hi>infus'd</hi> into them at first; yet, that GOD, acting <hi>miraculously,</hi> cannot <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> some Light from an Angel, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to him (as we conceive) <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards?</hi> Who can say that GOD, if he pleases to alter the Course and Nature of Things, or to order the Circumstances of the next World, by Ways unknowable by us, cannot, by his <hi>Miraculous</hi> Power, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that Imperfect Souls may be releas'd from the Chains of their Captive State, and be reciev'd into Heaven before the Last Day? Or, Who dares contend, that his Divine Goodness, that oft-times does Stupendious Miracles for the Prayers of <hi>one</hi> single <hi>Saint</hi> on Earth, will not do <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> and this frequently, for the Prayers of his Spouse, the <hi>Church!</hi> Once more I do earnestly beg of Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> it may be consider'd, that all our Science is built on the Nature of Things, <hi>as they are in themselves,</hi> and govern'd by GOD's <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> Power: 'Tis beyond the Skill and Sphere of Philosophy, even to <hi>guess at</hi> how many Miracles may be wrought upon the very least Thing in Nature: Nor did any Man, I know of, ever pretend to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102124:38"/>
any such Point; and I cannot but think it some kind of Neglect in them, not to declare as much. Miracle is beyond all Humane Science; <hi>Ecce, DEVS vincens Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam nostram! (Job, ch.</hi> 36. 28.) Which being my present Sentiment, and having ever been so; and, that Philosophers have nothing at all to do with the Subjects they treat of, as standing under GOD's Power working <hi>Supernaturally,</hi> and <hi>Miraculously;</hi> 'tis manifest, that all the Expressions I have any where, do still relate to his <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power</hi> only; nor can they be meant, or wrested by Malice it self, to be meant, of any other: And, tho' I may seem, in some extravagant Case, to <hi>doubt,</hi> because a Power that never Acted, seem'd <hi>Useless,</hi> and, so, was not an Attribute befitting GOD; yet, I no where assert that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation is Impossible to GOD's <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous</hi> Power. Indeed, in case it be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against GOD's Attributes, I should not stick at all to say, it is <hi>beyond Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;</hi> yet, I no where maintain, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom may not <hi>miraculously</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive it so, if it sees it fitting to be done, that it <hi>may not be</hi> against his Attributes; tho' Things being left in their <hi>Natural</hi> Condition, it may truly be concluded to be opposite to GOD's Attributes admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring the World after the Ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Providence: Which being so;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102124:38"/>
and, that I, as a Philosopher, speak of GOD's <hi>Ordinary</hi> Power only; what is become of all their Calumnies, of which they are so lavish? Why is my <hi>Foot Cloven?</hi> Why did <hi>none but his Devil set me on writing?</hi> Why do I <hi>run down all Piety, Religion,</hi> and <hi>GOD</hi> himself; as <hi>Merry-Andrew,</hi> their Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon, in his Hurry of Calumny, would as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure his Reader, if any regarded him?</p>
            <p n="46">46. Convicted thus of rallying me so severely, and without the least Occasion, or Ground, since I say no more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Divines in the Schools do, without any Control, maintain publickly; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they may, for their Excuse, pretend very charitably, that they are heartily glad they have prevail'd with me, at length, to be a good Christian; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ult, (as their Fellow-Libeller, <hi>Lominus,</hi> did,) that they have brought me, with much ado, to <hi>retract</hi> my Unwarrantable Opinions. But, I am their humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and beg their Pardon; I have not seen one Argument of theirs, as yet, that could bring a Man, endow'd with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reason, to <hi>retract;</hi> no, nor <hi>hold</hi> any thing; but to be a Sceptick, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend there is no Certainty in the World, seeing Men, who, as appears by their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, are mighty Ambitious to be held Men of Knowledge, produce neither <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> to ground their Discourse, nor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,</hi>

to make the Parts of it hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What my Sentiment was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to this Point, I have told them often, ere this, (in my <hi>1d. Cartes. p.</hi> 61.) where I say, First, <hi>Idem sonat apud Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophos, &amp;c. It signifies the same among Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,</hi> (especially Scholasticks,) <hi>to say, [GOD cannot do such a thing;] as to say, [It is impossible to be done.]</hi> Next, That, <hi>when Philosophers pronounce any thing to be Possible, or Impossible, they have respect only to the present State of the World, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Second Causes.</hi> Thirdly, That, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a Thing may be Contradictory, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, according to the Ordinary Course of the World, or to the Natures of Things, by which GOD, according to his Ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, governs the World; which, yet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Supernatural and Miraculous Power, by which he subdues all things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, are Possible.</hi> Of which, I there brought divers Instances.</p>
            <p n="47">47. Perhaps too, they will say, that, by this Doctrine I abandon and give up all my Demonstrations; and leave them to shift for themselves, or confess them to be <hi>False.</hi> I answer; Not one jot: For, all Science regards its Objects only as they stand in <hi>Nature,</hi> and not under GOD's <hi>Miraculous</hi> Power, which <hi>orders</hi> or <hi>alters</hi> the Natures of Things as he sees fit. Thus, One perfectly Skilful in the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102124:39"/>
of Physicks, might demonstrate, that it was impossible a Virgin should Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; or, that Clay, temper'd with Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, should cure Blindness; yet, by GOD's <hi>Miraculous</hi> Power, both were done: Thus, a Speculative and Learned Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, before the Incarnation was Reveal'd to the World, might have brought most clear Demonstrations from his <hi>Altissimae Causae,</hi> and the Nature of GOD, that it was Impossible GOD should be <hi>Chang'd, Suffer,</hi> or <hi>Die;</hi> (which, amongst other things, made the <hi>Greeks</hi> esteem Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <hi>Foolishness;)</hi> yet, GOD's Infinite and <hi>Miraculous</hi> Wisdom and Goodness could contrive a Way, how all those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions might be <hi>Verify'd.</hi> Which will make it less wonderful to us, that he can, if he sees fit, find Ways enow, which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount our Guess, or Imagination, how a <hi>Pure</hi> Spirit may <hi>Change;</hi> Souls in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate State be deliver'd, or a Creature Annihilated, if his Incomprehensible Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom sees it fit. Whoever reflects serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on those Powerful and Emphatical Words, <hi>[Ecce, Nova facio omnia,</hi> Apoc. 21. 5.] spoken by the Great Restorer of the World, and Promoter of all Creatures, and, amongst the rest, Glorify'd Bodies, to their Utmost Perfection, in their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Eternal State, will find in them Matter enough of Contemplation; and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102124:40"/>
easily apprehend that their Condition will be so alter'd for the <hi>Best,</hi> that, to our Low Conceits and Notions we have of them <hi>now,</hi> it would seem impossible for them to be such as we shall find them <hi>then.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I have not <hi>expresly</hi> put this Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction formerly, because it was not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, nothing of that kind being then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to me; yet, I had done this <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valently,</hi> and in other Terms, by telling Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> (Id. Cartes. p. 61.) that, <hi>When Philosophers affirm any thing to be Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, or Impossible, they regard the present State of the World, and the Order of Second Causes.</hi> And, he is aware of it; for, in his <hi>Censure, p.</hi> 63. he would wave that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, and seems willing to deny it; yet, is forc'd to admit it, by his Recurring to <hi>Potentia Obedientialis</hi> in Creatures; which is the same I express'd by <hi>Quâ naturas Rerum sibi subdit.</hi> But, to fix his Cavil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, he tells us, that <hi>the Question is not, Quid Philosophi pronuntiant; sed, Quid ille statuit:</hi> And, I do <hi>statuere,</hi> it cannot be done by GOD's <hi>Ordinary Power;</hi> and, that all the Notions we have of GOD, and his Attributes, by <hi>Natural</hi> Means, and <hi>Acquir'd</hi> Learning, (or <hi>Philosophy,)</hi> seem Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit to it: But, I hold, notwithstanding, that, if GOD's <hi>Wisdom</hi> sees <hi>fit</hi> it should be done, the same Wisdom can contrive Ways how it may be done <hi>Unknowable,</hi> nay, not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102124:40"/>
possible to be <hi>gues'd at,</hi> by our Uneleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Infinitely Short <hi>Natural</hi> Reason inform'd by the Lights we have of him from Creatures; and that, what his Infinite <hi>VVisdom</hi> sees <hi>fit,</hi> and his <hi>VVill ordains,</hi> his <hi>Power</hi> can <hi>execute.</hi> Which is what (ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying my Words to this Particular) I call <hi>Potentia Miraculosa,</hi> or <hi>Extraordinaria.</hi> Nor do I any where say, that GOD's Wisdom, if he sees it Fit, cannot bring it about that it <hi>may be</hi> done, and yet, <hi>not be</hi> Prejudicial, or Contrary to any of those Attributes, from which, as far as known to us by Ordinary Means, I, as a <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> ought to argue. And, it would be a Madness in either of us, to maintain, that GOD's Power is not beyond our foolish <hi>Philosophy,</hi> or the Reach of Knowledge, which Ordinary Means can afford us.</p>
            <p n="48">48. I do not doubt, but it will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd by my Adversaries, that they have been so wanting to their Cause, as to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it only by <hi>Bantering,</hi> and <hi>Railing:</hi> They will say, (for, what will they not <hi>say,</hi> if <hi>Saying</hi> would do their Business?) that they have produc'd Arguments to prove their Doctrine, and have invalida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all <hi>mine.</hi> But, I deny that Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> has, in his <hi>Censura,</hi> even so much as given an Answer to any one of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations; unlese he thinks it is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer sufficient to call them (as he does in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102124:41"/>
his Epistle to the Reader) <hi>Cavils;</hi> and to tell him, according tò his Way of <hi>saying any thing,</hi> that he has, <hi>satis abundè,</hi> reply'd to them. I must, I say, absolutely contest against him, that he has not produc'd <hi>any one Conclusive Proof</hi> for any one Tenet of his own, nor given <hi>any one Solution</hi> to any one Argument of mine, where I pretend to <hi>Demonstrate,</hi> as I do frequently. I know he mentions some Words pick'd out of them, and reflects on them with Jeers, or Jests; but, when he should come se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously to a Close Discourse with them, and either <hi>admit</hi> or <hi>confute</hi> the Connexion in which the Force of them consists, he is in a <hi>Hurry,</hi> and <hi>Hast,</hi> to be gone to <hi>another</hi> Business; (for, his whole Method here, is a <hi>VVild</hi> and <hi>Distracted</hi> Leaping from one thing to another;) and so, he fairly takes a <hi>short Leave</hi> of them, and away he is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd. So that the Frame of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course seems to be made up of little else but <hi>Transitions.</hi> And, as for his Proofs, he thinks it is enough to <hi>say</hi> a thing; and, 'tis a <hi>Favòur</hi> to the Reader, <hi>now,</hi> if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows so much as a <hi>slight Explication</hi> of any Point; of which, <hi>formerly,</hi> he was more free. He sometimes cites my Words at large, even a whole Page together; so that one would verily think he meant ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confute me; but the Reader may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily see, it was only to make a Shew, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102124:41"/>
swell his small Performances to the <hi>just Size</hi> of a <hi>Treatise:</hi> For, if we set aside the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casms, Ironies, <hi>sought</hi> Phrases, quaint Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, pretty Curiosities and Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (to shew how profound a Man he is at <hi>Note-Book-Learning;)</hi> if we set aside these, with his Angry Words, and what he transcribes out of me, and others; and his Medly of little indifferent <hi>Nothings,</hi> which do not signifie any thing, either <hi>pro,</hi> or <hi>con;</hi> and, look for what only should be expected from a Philosopher. <hi>viz. Connected Sense,</hi> grounded on <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> and then go about to cast up the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of them, the Total Summ would amount to nothing but a <hi>long Row of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. Mediums</hi> fit for <hi>Demonstration,</hi> or any thing that, even, savours of true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, are such Strangers to his Loose Talk, that the Solid Sense in it might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd in a <hi>Nut-shell;</hi> as will more amply appear hereafter.</p>
            <p n="49">49. To give farther Satisfaction, and, perhaps, some Benefit to the Reader, I will instance in one Demonstration of mine; and shew how empty Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi>'s Pretence is, that he has (as he phrases it,) <hi>abundè satis,</hi> answer'd my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; and, how frivolous it would be in me, to lay open his Incredible Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the rest of his Imaginary Solutions of my other Demonstrations: For, since I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102124:42"/>
him, and the <hi>Cartesians,</hi> to give an Answer to <hi>this</hi> Argument, we may be sure he will exert his utmost to perform it pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, and satisfactorily. Whence we may conclude, that if he most miserably <hi>falls flat</hi> in doing Right to himself, and his Cause, in <hi>this;</hi> it cannot be expected, but he will much more <hi>fail</hi> in all the rest; which is the only Reason why I pitch'd upon this in particular, as a Decisive <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> of all his Atchievments of this kind. 'Tis mention'd above, §. 20. and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it in distinct Propositions; fetching it (perhaps, something needlesly) from Remotest Grounds; and, then, reducing each piece of it to <hi>Self-Evidence,</hi> both that the Force of it may the better appear to be Irresistible; as also, that Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> may consider which of the <hi>Identical</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions he will, in his great Learning, think fit to <hi>deny.</hi> But, first; to avoid the Old Cavil, let it be remember'd, that we speak here, as Philosophers ought always to do, of the Nature of an Angel, <hi>as in it self,</hi> and not as it may be wrought upon by <hi>GOD</hi>'s <hi>Miraculous</hi> Power, by which he disposes of all his Creatures, as he sees to be <hi>Wisest</hi> and <hi>Best</hi> for <hi>Supernatural</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; which, as they are beyond the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Philosophers to <hi>Know,</hi> or even to <hi>Guess at;</hi> so, 'tis evidently beyond their Province to meddle with them.</p>

Ere I come to examine Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi>'s Solution of this Demonstration, I desire all Ingenuous Readers to reflect what Advantage it would bring to True Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or SCIENCE, were this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected</hi> Way of Discoursing from Clear Grounds brought into Fashion, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly pursu'd. It would quickly make Truth appear; and discover, what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions are the <hi>Genuine</hi> Effects of <hi>Right Reason,</hi> and what is only <hi>Loose Talk.</hi> It would <hi>put</hi> an <hi>End</hi> to all <hi>Controversies,</hi> and avoid all Occasions of Men's Catching at, and availing themselves, by those insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Methods of Wrangling, Ill Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and Prevarication; to which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate Opposers of Truth are forc'd to have recourse. Whence, I must sincerely declare that (as far as I am conscious to my self of my own Intentions) it was not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102124:44"/>
any Arrogancy, or Vanity of preferring my Labours, and Thoughtful Productions, before those of some Writers, who took not this Way of Connexion but seem'd wholly to dis regard it; but, that which caus'd me to take that Way of expressing my self with that <hi>Assuredness,</hi> was, an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Desire to <hi>invite,</hi> and (as far as I could possibly) <hi>incite</hi> others, and breed an Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in them to follow such a Method, as might set Truth in a <hi>Clear Light,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Science, and difcountenance and beat down Scepticism, and all its Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive Ways of <hi>Talking;</hi> which, in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, where Solid and <hi>VVell-grounded Truth</hi> is aim'd at, (let it be never so Pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Witty,) amounts to no more, nor deserves any better Name, but that of <hi>Idle Tittle-Tattle.</hi> Nay, I express'd my self, in my Preface to <hi>Solid Philosophy Asserted,</hi> that I was aware this would be objected to me; and, therefore, I did there (from §. 8. to §. 14.) alledge many Reasons, to shew that this Carriage was necessary for a Writer who resolv'd, without Fear or Favour of any, to pursue those <hi>Good Ends;</hi> and to put it to the Test, what <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Method,</hi> was <hi>True;</hi> what <hi>Sophisticate,</hi> and <hi>False.</hi> Which Reasons, till they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, themselves must confess, that their Objecting Arrogancy can only be built on their seeing my Heart, and penetrating
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102124:45"/>
my Inward and Invisible Intentions. The plain Truth is, Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> would have had me speak well of his Books, (and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writers of the same Strain and Pitch;) for which Reason he complains of me sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in his Preface to his former Treatise, that I had not so much as <hi>read</hi> his Books, <hi>sive Latinè, sive Gallicè scriptos;</hi> (there is a <hi>Quod not a benè</hi> for you, now!) My Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why I neglected that <hi>Expected</hi> Duty were these: First, Because (except his Volume which is a Collection out of <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> his <hi>Placita)</hi> they were so <hi>very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,</hi> and <hi>universally taken notice of,</hi> that I never so much as <hi>heard of them.</hi> Next, I did not apprehend I had any such great <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>read</hi> them. Thirdly, I read as much of them as I had occasion to speak to; which did not so hugely please me, as to think it worth my while to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any more of them. Lastly, Those I had read were like Whipp'd Cream; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so empty of <hi>Solid Sense</hi> and <hi>Frothy,</hi> so void of <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Connexion,</hi> that is, without either <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Tail,</hi> that I was weary of them. And, as for his last Books, he has so doubly disfigur'd them with Ill Language, that the Ground-work of them is Insipid and Unconnected Talk; and the Embroidery of them is Raillery: Which are no such great Philters, to make me in love with their Brethren; nor could
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102124:45"/>
any Flattery be so fulsom from me, as to deck them with <hi>Encomiums.</hi> But, Words from an Adversary are of <hi>no VVeight;</hi> Let us, then, come to examine how <hi>pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>punctually</hi> he has Answer'd this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, which was so highly incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon him. I earnestly beg of the Reader, to take the pains to go along with me for this once, so that we may get a full View of the Solution of it; which, if he does, I am confident he will confess, that never did a weaker Writer appear in Print; and, that he will both grant that my farther Confuting him is <hi>Needless;</hi> and, withall, will admire I have had the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to lose my Time so long upon such an Insignificant Trifler.</p>
               <p n="51">51. He recites my Demonstration in his <hi>Censura, p.</hi> 44. and sets himself to answer it, <hi>p.</hi> 45. First, He says, <hi>This Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is none of those he brought formerly; but, that this is the first time he has produc'd it.</hi> What is this to purpose? Let it be <hi>where</hi> it will, <hi>whose</hi> it will, or <hi>whensoever</hi> first produc'd, here it is; and I have <hi>challeng'd</hi> him, and his <hi>Cartesians,</hi> to <hi>Answer</hi> it; and therefore, we are to expect their <hi>Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</hi> Yet, he is much out, even when he talks <hi>frivolously;</hi> for, I produc'd it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, at large, (tho' not in the self-same manner,) in my <hi>Method to Science, p.</hi> 316. as any one that can read, may see. Next,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102124:46"/>
He says, <hi>I durst not repeat here my former Argument, drawn from the Immutability of GOD.</hi> He says very right; for, I <hi>dare not</hi> commit such a <hi>Folly,</hi> as to repeat an Argument which was brought to evince <hi>Another Point,</hi> to prove <hi>This</hi> Thesis, which is so widely Different from it. The <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> was my <hi>Medium,</hi> to prove, that GOD could not be the Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Cause of that which is Essentially <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> as <hi>Motion</hi> is; his Nature being <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory</hi> to it. Why must this Argument be repeated <hi>here,</hi> where we are speaking of the Manner of Operating peculiar to <hi>Angels?</hi> Tho' this be nothing to purpose, and sillily Ridiculous; yet, the Words, <hi>[He durst not bring it here,]</hi> look <hi>Great;</hi> and would persuade his Readers, if they were Fools, that he has <hi>frighted</hi> me from my Argument; which, tho' he sets a <hi>good Face</hi> on it, and looks and talks <hi>Big,</hi> I dare say, poor Man! himself is far from <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</hi> Thirdly, He talks Ironically of its <hi>Formidable</hi> and <hi>Invincible Strength.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>Invincible,</hi> will be best seen by his Answer to it: But, it seems, 'tis <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable</hi> to him; for he is loath to come up to it, but makes his <hi>Approaches</hi> very <hi>backwardly',</hi> and <hi>cautiously.</hi> Fourthly, He calls it <hi>Garrulity,</hi> and (afterwards) <hi>Verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</hi> What Reader will not smile at his Humour of <hi>saying any thing,</hi> tho' never so
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102124:46"/>
                  <hi>manifestly False?</hi> Whoever reviews my Argument, put down by himself, in the fore going Page, and in my very Words, will see there is not <hi>one</hi> superfluous Word in it, but barely as many as suffic'd to shew the <hi>Connexion</hi> of my Discourse: And, of all the things in the World, <hi>Verbosity</hi> and <hi>Garrulity</hi> in a Demonstration is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to <hi>blunt</hi> and <hi>spoil</hi> the Force of the Argument; since this <hi>Loosness</hi> of much Talk, bIinds the Considerer from seeing the <hi>Close Coherence</hi> of its Terms. But this acquaints us perfectly with his <hi>Genius:</hi> The very Grain of his Thoughts is laid so cross to all kind of <hi>Connexion,</hi> that he thinks all <hi>Connected Discourse</hi> is nothing: but <hi>Idle Babbling;</hi> and, that only <hi>Loose</hi> and <hi>Rambling</hi> Talk is <hi>True Demonstration.</hi>

               <p n="52">52. But, these <hi>Avant-Guards</hi> of his, are only <hi>VVhifflers</hi> before the <hi>Show,</hi> to make way: Now comes the <hi>Answer</hi> it self. First, He excepts against the Common Notion of <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Thing;</hi> which I had said, consisted in this, that <hi>It had a Power to be,</hi> or <hi>could be.</hi> Upon which, he thus descants; <hi>Quasi verò Essentia omnis Entis. Finiti, tam Creati quàm Creandi, non sit quid Positivum, sed nihil aliud quàm Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Essendi, seu id quod Quo possit Esse.</hi> More Folly, and Shifting Tricks, could not have been well crouded into five Lines! Where did I speak in the <hi>Abstract</hi> of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentia,</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:102124:47"/>
                  <hi>Potentia essendi,</hi> or <hi>Quo potest esse?</hi> Does not he see, in my Words, put down lately by himself, that I speak of <hi>Ens,</hi> or the <hi>Concrete;</hi> and, that, in my <hi>Id. Cartes. p.</hi> 244. where I demonstrate to him, what the Notion of <hi>Ens Creatum</hi> must be, (of which he takes no notice here, but only <hi>talks against,</hi> that is, <hi>denies,</hi> my Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,) I express'd what was meant by such an <hi>Ens, p.</hi> 245. <hi>l.</hi> 2, 3, <hi>viz. Illud quod po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test existere;</hi> and, all along, I name <hi>Ens, Corpus, Spiritus,</hi> which are all <hi>Concretes.</hi> And, surely, he will not say that the Essence of Created Things includes <hi>Actual Existence;</hi> for, if he does, he makes them so many GODS; for, 'tis the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the <hi>Deity</hi> only, <hi>Essentially to Exist.</hi> Let him take any Individual, Created Things, (those being most properly <hi>Things;)</hi> For Example; <hi>Michael, Peter,</hi> a Horse, a Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then examine his Thoughts, whether he finds either <hi>Actual Being,</hi> or <hi>Not-being,</hi> in their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and, if he cannot, but finds (as he must) they Abstract from both, that all that can be said of <hi>Ens,</hi> as to what it has <hi>of it self,</hi> or its own Nature and Essence, in order to <hi>Being,</hi> is, that it <hi>can be,</hi> or can <hi>receive Existence,</hi> if the First Cause pleases to <hi>give</hi> it. This being so, let us abstract the Notion of <hi>Ens</hi> from all Individuals; and we shall see that the Notion of <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Thing,</hi> in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102124:47"/>
Common, is <hi>That</hi> which is <hi>Capable of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and can be no other.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Having thus <hi>chang'd</hi> my <hi>Words,</hi> let us see what Advantage he makes of this slippery Dealing. He objects, that this would make the Notion of <hi>Ens</hi> not to be <hi>Positive.</hi> What means he? Does he think that the Notion of <hi>Quo est Res,</hi> or the Form, or <hi>quo potest esse Res,</hi> (suppose I had said so,) is not <hi>Positive;</hi> whereas, 'tis Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible a <hi>Negative</hi> Nature <hi>can exist,</hi> or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Thing <hi>Capable of Existing?</hi> Indeed, <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s First Matter is defin'd <hi>Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as having no kind of <hi>Form</hi> at all in its Notion, neither <hi>Substantial,</hi> nor <hi>Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi> but, that the Form which is part of the Essence, and constitutes the <hi>Thing,</hi> should be <hi>Negative</hi> too, would make the whole Thing to be made up of <hi>Negatives;</hi> which is such a strange Blunder in <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi> as admits no Parallel. The Form <hi>determines</hi> the Potentiality, or Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Matter, and makes it become <hi>This,</hi> or an Individual Thing, and so <hi>fits</hi> it for <hi>Existence;</hi> because a Thing <hi>in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> or that which is <hi>Indeterminats,</hi> is not <hi>Capable of Existing.</hi> Now, that the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence that makes an <hi>Individual Thing,</hi> which is the <hi>most Positive</hi> Notion we have, (or rather, no Notion is <hi>perfectly Positive,</hi> but it,) should not be Positive <hi>it self,</hi> or be <hi>less</hi> Positive, because it makes the Matter
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102124:48"/>
                  <hi>capable</hi> of a <hi>farther,</hi> and <hi>best</hi> Perfection, to wit, the last Actuality of <hi>Existence,</hi> is a Paradox unheard of in Metaphysicks. So that Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> has <hi>alter'd</hi> my Words, and yet gets no Advantage by it, but blunders himself, while he went to blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Demonstration. For, What is all this to the Argument? If he do but grant that <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are Species of <hi>Thing in Common,</hi> or (which is the same) that they are both of them <hi>Things,</hi> (which 'tis a Madness to deny,) the Demonstration, which consists in the Connexion or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Notions, will go on, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, whether he will or no. And, this he fore-sees very well; and therefore, by throwing these <hi>Flim-flams,</hi> as <hi>Rubs</hi> in the way, he endeavours to <hi>keep it off,</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from <hi>going on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="54">54. Next, He tells us, that <hi>De Corpore &amp; Spiritu, rebus finitis</hi> actu existentibus, nunc <hi>sermo instituitur: This Discourse treats of Body and Spirit, actually existent.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him, <hi>who</hi> stated the Question on this fashion, or pretended we spoke of <hi>This</hi> Body, or <hi>This</hi> Spirit, which only do <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually exist?</hi> He knows, that, when he put my Demonstration, I acknowledg'd, that I spoke of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which were the <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Ens,</hi> in Common; and therefore, are themselves the <hi>most common</hi> Notions next to it; and, not <hi>Particulars,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:102124:48"/>
which only do <hi>exist actually.</hi> Yet, he tells us, <hi>Nunc Sermo instituitur: The Speech now,</hi> is, of Things <hi>actually existing.</hi> I beseech him, <hi>VVhose Speech? His,</hi> or <hi>Mine?</hi> Not <hi>Mine,</hi> as is now shewn: It must mean, then, that 'tis <hi>His</hi> Speech. And, by what Rule must I needs <hi>speak</hi> as <hi>he</hi> would <hi>have me?</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, I have Right to put my <hi>own</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration as I please <hi>my self.</hi> It lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; and, he is to answer it as it lies. What wriggling is here to pervert the Sense of it, instead of representing it in my <hi>own VVords,</hi> and <hi>Solving</hi> it! Again, this is a Sign he knows little what belongs to <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> for this treats of the <hi>Abstracted</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Natures of the <hi>Subjects</hi> we han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; which, <hi>as distinctly such,</hi> exist in our <hi>Understanding,</hi> and <hi>no where else;</hi> for, there they are <hi>concise,</hi> and <hi>exact,</hi> even to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible; whereas, if we treat of them as they <hi>actually exist</hi> in Matter, or <hi>in re,</hi> they are jumbl'd confusedly with innumerable <hi>other</hi> Modes; so that there cannot possibly be any <hi>Science,</hi> nor Demonstration of them at all. I wish him to reflect upon all the particular Sciences in the Mathematicks, whether they are of Circles, Quadrates, Triangles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he will see they do all of them treat of those <hi>Formal</hi> Notions, or Natures, <hi>abstractedly,</hi> from their Actual Existence <hi>in re;</hi> where, perhaps, no Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures Mathematically so exact as our
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102124:49"/>
Mind frames of them, are to be found. The same is to be said, when we treat of the <hi>Common</hi> Notions of <hi>Ens, Corpus, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, &amp;c.</hi> which can no where exist, but <hi>in</hi> the Understanding: Nay, 'tis evident, I speak of <hi>Ens</hi> Formally, as its Notion is taken <hi>Generically,</hi> or of <hi>Ens</hi> in <hi>Common;</hi> and, sure, he will not say, the <hi>Thing</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, as <hi>in Common,</hi> can any where <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exist,</hi> but in our Mind.</p>

He proceeds after his old rate, and tells his Reader, that <hi>all my Verbosity, hoc solum vult, means only this,</hi> that <hi>Body has Parts, and Spirit has none;</hi> and, that <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Body is Successive, and thence Mutable; and Spirit Immutable.</hi> He puts my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, after a fashion, indeed; yet, only <hi>slightly,</hi> and <hi>slubberingly:</hi> He would have more oblig'd me to have us'd my <hi>own VVords,</hi> which were more <hi>Ample,</hi> and <hi>Full, viz.</hi> That the Differences which constitute them being <hi>Contradictory,</hi> it follows, that whatever we say of the <hi>One,</hi> (except what belongs to the Common Notion of <hi>Thing,)</hi> the <hi>Contradictory</hi> to it must be said of the <hi>Other;</hi> and, therefore, if Body <hi>have</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in its Operations, Spirit must <hi>have none,</hi> but must have all its Operations in an <hi>Instant;</hi> and, consequently, be <hi>Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</hi> However, I thank him he has put the <hi>Substance</hi> of my Demonstration on any fashion, tho' not <hi>forcibly,</hi> but <hi>rawly.</hi> Here
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102124:49"/>
'tis the Argument <hi>presses;</hi> now let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his <hi>Solution.</hi> First, He says the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is <hi>Easie;</hi> and, 'tis true; for, in <hi>his</hi> Way one may easily, without any Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Answer all <hi>Euclid:</hi> 'tis but altering his Words, and <hi>saying</hi> something, or rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some extravagant Scruple against his <hi>Conclusions,</hi> and the Deed is done. Next, He grants they may know <hi>some</hi> Things <hi>at one View,</hi> but <hi>not all.</hi> This is <hi>said;</hi> but, still the Question is, Why not <hi>All at once,</hi> if <hi>Some?</hi> His Reason? Does the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of those <hi>Some</hi> burthen or <hi>fill</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel's Intellect, so, that it can <hi>hold no more?</hi> No, surely; for, we experience, even in our Souls here, that are very much Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Intelligences, which are <hi>Pure Acts,</hi> that the having <hi>some</hi> Knowledge, <hi>increases</hi> our Capacity to take in <hi>more;</hi> whence 'tis demonstrable, that nothing can <hi>fill</hi> or <hi>satisfie</hi> them, but the Sight of an <hi>Infinite Truth,</hi> or the Beatifical Vision of <hi>GOD.</hi> Do Angels require some Time to have <hi>more</hi> Knowledge, because slowly-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Corporeal Phantasms, must <hi>bring</hi> things leisurely into their Understanding; or, Impressions on their Nerves <hi>occasion</hi> the producing <hi>Ideas?</hi> Neither of these can be said. What hinders, then, their having at once <hi>all</hi> they naturally can have? Are not all Truths, the Objects of these Knowledges, <hi>Connected;</hi> but some of them
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102124:50"/>
stand at variance with one another? This would disgrace GOD's Workmanship, the Product of his Wisdom, if we make Truths <hi>Incoherent, Contradictory</hi> and <hi>Chimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical.</hi> None of these Rubs, then, being possible, which only could hinder or retard an Angel from having <hi>all</hi> his Intellectual O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations in an Instant, it had been but a piece of Civility in Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> to have bestow'd upon us <hi>some Reason</hi> for his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting from us in this Point; and, not to have popt us off with a <hi>bare</hi> voluntary <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> of the Conclusion, which is the only thing in question.</p>
               <p n="57">57. For, we have much more Right to expect his Reason, because (as was now said) this Denial of his, instead of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering</hi> the <hi>Argument,</hi> is a plain Denying the <hi>Immediate Conclusion</hi> which follow'd from that Demonstration. Yet, I must say, that (however those foolish Fellows, the Logicians, would laugh at him, for such an Unpardonable Errour in Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet) he behaves himself here like a Civil Gentleman; for, he <hi>compounds</hi> with us, and grants very kindly, that they do <hi>at once</hi> know <hi>some Things,</hi> but denies they have all the Operations belonging to them <hi>at once,</hi> or know <hi>all</hi> they ought to know in an Instant. Now, this being evidently the Conclusion of my Argument, (as far as I there press'd it,) 'tis a double Injury;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102124:50"/>
first, only to hint the Argument, and then slide away from speaking to it, and <hi>deny</hi> our <hi>Conclusion;</hi> and, yet, give us no kind of Reason why. Yet, he pretends to give us something that he would have <hi>thought</hi> a Reason, tho' 'tis so <hi>slight,</hi> that he is shy to <hi>call</hi> it so: Which we will hearken to; only, let it be first remember'd, that he is <hi>Arguing</hi> against the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> which he had most learnedly <hi>Deny'd;</hi> and, not <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering</hi> my <hi>Argument,</hi> or shewing that the Terms of it do not <hi>cohere;</hi> or, that the Conclusion does not <hi>follow</hi> out of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses. His Reason (if it be one) is grounded on an Explication of his own Doctrine, that GOD moves Matter <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately;</hi> which, unless he first establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, (as he never <hi>did,</hi> nor <hi>can,)</hi> his Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation shakes. However, that <hi>fuppos'd,</hi> he demonstrates it after his usual sort, by bringing a <hi>Parallel.</hi> His Discourse runs thus: Bodies are Stupid Things; nor could they stir at all, if GOD did not <hi>give</hi> and <hi>conserve</hi> their Motion, and all the Modes of it: And, in like manner, GOD gives and conserves <hi>Cogitation,</hi> and the <hi>Modes</hi> of Cogitation, to <hi>Angels.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as a Body does not therefore <hi>lose its Essence</hi> by Moving <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less,</hi> so an Angel does not <hi>lose his Essence</hi> by <hi>Thinking more</hi> or <hi>less.</hi> Where are we now? I am sure we are rambl'd quite out of the Purlue of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102124:51"/>
our Question. My Conclusion only <hi>says,</hi> and my Argument only aims to <hi>prove,</hi> that if the Ordinary Laws of an Angel's Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating be observ'd, it would know all it is naturally to know <hi>at once,</hi> and not <hi>succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively;</hi> but, that it would, otherwise, <hi>lose its Essence,</hi> I never said, nor thought; nor that GOD, acting Supernaturally, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not devest them of some Property they have, tho' <hi>naturally ally'd</hi> to its <hi>Essence.</hi> So that, he first <hi>Denies</hi> my <hi>Conclusion,</hi> instead of <hi>Answering</hi> my <hi>Argument:</hi> Next, brings a <hi>Parallel</hi> for an <hi>Argument;</hi> and when he has brought it, he shoots it <hi>at Rovers,</hi> and levels it at a wrong Mark: So far he is from knowing what belongs to any one Rule belonging to <hi>Disputation.</hi> Add that his pretended <hi>Parallel</hi> is the most <hi>Unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel</hi> of any he could have invented; <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> and <hi>Indivisible</hi> are the <hi>Essential,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal</hi> Differences of <hi>Ens</hi> nor can there be any <hi>Ens,</hi> but it must be either the <hi>One,</hi> or the <hi>Other</hi> of them. Are <hi>Moving more,</hi> or <hi>Moving less,</hi> Essential Differences of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</hi> Or, cannot Body <hi>be,</hi> without being <hi>either of them?</hi> Could not GOD's Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence have kept their First Matter from <hi>Moving,</hi> when he had first <hi>Created</hi> it? Or, are <hi>[Moving more,</hi> and <hi>Moving less,] Contradictories;</hi> as are the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I put, and argue from them? Or, could an Angel, which is a <hi>Pure Act,</hi> have
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102124:51"/>
been Created without <hi>Knowing at all,</hi> as a <hi>Body</hi> could without <hi>Moving at all?</hi> What a <hi>Lame</hi> Similitude then, or <hi>Parallel,</hi> is this, which has <hi>never a Leg</hi> to run on! And, yet, he will needs make it <hi>run</hi> on a Sleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Errand, and applies it to a Point which is Foreign to our Question. Add, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that our Question is not <hi>here</hi> of an Angel's Simultaneous Knowledge <hi>omnium rerum, of all things,</hi> as he puts it: 'Tis not the <hi>Quantity</hi> or <hi>Extension</hi> of the Angelical Knowledges, which I do <hi>here</hi> strive to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; but the <hi>Unsuccessiveness</hi> of them; or, that it has them <hi>all at once,</hi> (whether they are <hi>many</hi> or <hi>fewer, large</hi> or <hi>narrow;)</hi> from whence is deduc'd immediately, that 'tis <hi>naturally Immutable.</hi>

In the next place, I will produce an Instance or two, of his Great Talent of <hi>Aggravating</hi> and <hi>Pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> my Words to a <hi>Sinister</hi> and <hi>Invidious.</hi> Sense; which is an Essential Part of this <hi>New Cartesian Method,</hi> and takes up near a quarter of his Book; and, withall, gives it a Thousand times à <hi>greater Shew</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Victorious,</hi> than all his <hi>Arguments.</hi> An Honourable and Worthy Gentleman hapt to say, that the <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine did <hi>cum quodam lepôre sibi consenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, agree to one another with a certain Grace, or Prettiness;</hi> than which, I know no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression more proper. I reply'd to Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> who seem'd fond of this Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, in my <hi>Id.

Upon this,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102124:52"/>
Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> tells his Reader, that, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilissimum illum Virum spiculis suis venenatis petit;</hi> that <hi>I assault, or set upon that Noble Person with my Poyson'd Darts.</hi> His Fancy is, certainly, very fearfuly <hi>Hypochondriack:</hi> Every thing is a <hi>Spiculum,</hi> or <hi>Dart,</hi> that he dis-likes. Thus a silly <hi>Asterisk</hi> *, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually left in the Context, in my <hi>ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOD,</hi> was interpreted as a Design, <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figere ipsum quinque radiis tanquam tot Spicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis; to strike him thorow with those Five Points, as with so many Darts.</hi> Nay, he tells me, moreover, in that Preface, §. 31. that I have <hi>petulans ingenium ac Judicium pravum,</hi> for attempting to do him that Mischief with those <hi>five Darts</hi> of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterisk; and is so afraid of being <hi>transfix'd,</hi> or <hi>run thorow</hi> by them, that he complains of it sadly to the Reader (it being, as we are to conceive, a Matter of much Weight) a second time there, in §. 44. Of which, see <hi>Id. Cartes. p.</hi> 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 72. Another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his Ranting, and shameful <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggeration,</hi> shall be this: He had quoted <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> to say, that <hi>a piece of Wood was turn'd into Stone.</hi> I reply'd, That it did not appear, but Stony Particles might be <hi>interwoven</hi> with the Wooden ones, <hi>Id.

               <p n="60">60. Another Method of theirs, is, to <hi>impose</hi> upon me <hi>False Tenets,</hi> to make me look like a <hi>Monster</hi> of <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Impiety.</hi> These are great Sticklers in his, and his Friend <hi>Merry-man</hi>'s Pamphlets; and give the <hi>briskest</hi> Vigour to their <hi>Invectives.</hi> For example; He tells the Reader, <hi>(p.</hi> 42.) that I say, <hi>It is infinitely more Impossible that GOD should change an Angel,</hi> (if it were Changeable at all,) <hi>after the First Instant, than that it self, or another Angel, should do it.</hi> Now, What Man, reading these Words, thus industriousty singl'd out, would not verily think I made GOD <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely less Powerful than an Angel,</hi> or any
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102124:53"/>
other Creature; and admire at my Folly, and Impiety, both? But, read the <hi>whole Discourse</hi> there, and it is evidently quite contrary; nor could any Man more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly magnifie GOD's Attributes, than I do in <hi>that very</hi> place. My Discourse is this: An Indivisible Effect must be put in an Instant; therefore, it <hi>will</hi> be put in the <hi>first</hi> Instant, if <hi>all</hi> that is requisite to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi> that Effect be put: Those Requisites are, <hi>Power</hi> in the Cause, and <hi>Disposition</hi> to <hi>exercise</hi> that Power, and <hi>Application</hi> of the Agent to the Patient; and, that, in case the Agent be not <hi>yet</hi> Dispos'd to act, it must be <hi>Chang'd,</hi> so to be <hi>made Dispos'd.</hi> Wherefore, since 'tis <hi>Infinitely</hi> more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible GOD should not have <hi>Power</hi> to do it in the <hi>First</hi> Instant, being <hi>All-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> than that another Spirit should not have such a Power; or, not be <hi>Dispos'd</hi> of himself to act, he being <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Infinite Actuality;</hi> or, that he can be <hi>Chang'd,</hi> thus to be <hi>made Dispos'd,</hi> he being <hi>Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi> or, not be <hi>Apply'd,</hi> he being <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present;</hi> than it is, that an <hi>Angel</hi> should <hi>not</hi> have Power to do this Effect; or, be <hi>chang'd,</hi> so to be <hi>fitted</hi> to act: Or, <hi>not be</hi> Apply'd most intimately to the Patient; therefore, 'tis infinitely more Impossible GOD should not do it <hi>in</hi> the <hi>First</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, (that is, <hi>not after</hi> the <hi>First</hi> Instant,) if the Effest were feisible, than that an
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102124:54"/>
                  <hi>Angel,</hi> which falls <hi>infinitely short</hi> in every regard, should not do it <hi>in</hi> the <hi>First</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant; or, (which is the same,) should <hi>do it after</hi> the <hi>First</hi> Instant. See my Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, in my <hi>METHOD;</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 307. to <hi>p.</hi> 314. particularly, <hi>p.</hi> 313. Now, 'tis evident, that, in this Discourse, I bear up to GOD's Attributes, there mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and maintain them to be <hi>infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> those of the <hi>best Created</hi> Beings in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very regard. What do these Men? They pick out a few Words, and <hi>purposely</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the whole <hi>Tenour</hi> of my Discourse; and, by this False Dealing, endeavour to impose upon me so <hi>Wicked</hi> an <hi>Impiety,</hi> as neither any <hi>Christian,</hi> nor any <hi>Heathen,</hi> who holds a First Being, did ever assert. How he deforms this Argument, by sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out a few other Words, may be seen in his <hi>Censure, p.</hi> 49. Judge then, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whether those poor spiteful Men have not renounc'd all Shame and Conscience, who dare thus wilfully defame their Neighbour, and fraudulently abuse their Reader. Would not a Lawyer that us'd such a Dishonest Trick, in Altering the Words which concern'd the Title of an Estate, be <hi>turn'd over the Bar,</hi> and <hi>hated</hi> by all Honest Men? Something worse than this as containing the same Malice, and in far worse Circumstances, is this <hi>Other</hi> Instance. He had, in the Preface of his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102124:54"/>
former Book, §. 40. made me to say, it was <hi>Vile opus &amp; Laboriosum, for GOD to be the Immediate Cause of Motion.</hi> He put it <hi>directly</hi> upon me, as my <hi>very Words;</hi> by introducing it with <hi>Pergit, statimque ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;</hi> and, by printing the Word <hi>[Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosum]</hi> in Italick Letter, and the <hi>same</hi> with the <hi>other</hi> Words, which were truly mine. This makes me <hi>Impious against GOD,</hi> with a Witness; for, it represents my Opinion to be, That GOD makes use of the Ministery of Angels, to <hi>ease</hi> himself (forsooth!) of the <hi>Fatigue</hi> and <hi>Weariness,</hi> which, otherwise, he would have <hi>felt,</hi> had he mov'd the First Matter <hi>Himself.</hi> Hereupon, I challeng'd him to have flatly <hi>falsify'd</hi> my Words, and, to have added <hi>[Laboriosum,]</hi> to put upon me such an absurd Doctrine, as never came into the Head of any Man acquainted with Christianity, or Common Sense. I had happ'd to express it to be a <hi>Drudgery mis-becoming GOD's Essence, who is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, to be the Immediate Cause of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Change.</hi> Where, 'tis manifest, I put it upon the <hi>Mis-becomingness,</hi> or <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutableness</hi> to GOD's Nature, which is <hi>Pure Actuality of Existence,</hi> to cause Change <hi>immediately;</hi> because, <hi>Being</hi> only was the <hi>Proper Effect</hi> of Him, whose Nature was <hi>Self-Existence.</hi> Yet, in despite of all the <hi>Concomitant</hi> Words, and the whole Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102124:55"/>
of the Discourse, instead of <hi>Retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>Excusing</hi> his Fault, he stands to it stoutly, <hi>p.</hi> 44. And, why? Because <hi>Drudges</hi> do use to <hi>toyl</hi> and <hi>moyl,</hi> and <hi>sweat</hi> and <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and <hi>lead</hi> (as we say) a <hi>weary Life:</hi> As if there were not <hi>Meanness</hi> in Drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and <hi>Indignity</hi> for the Master of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to perform, it being below his Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and, as if the Concomitant Word, <hi>[Mis-becoming,]</hi> and <hi>[Vile.]</hi> join'd with it, did not restrain it manifestly to this Sense, that it was <hi>Indignum DEO;</hi> and, not such a <hi>Toilsom</hi> Business to <hi>move Matter,</hi> which every Angel can do. Could it be possibly thought by any Man in his Wits, that he who holds that GOD <hi>Created</hi> Heaven and Earth, of Nothing, in an <hi>Instant,</hi> should think he had not Power to give <hi>Motion</hi> to Bodies, without <hi>over-straining</hi> himself? Who, but a Mad man, could hold two such Inconsistent Tenets? Or, What Man, well in his Wits, could hope to obtain Belief that I held such a piece of Extravagant Nonsense? But, what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Impotent Passion <hi>feign,</hi> and <hi>pretend,</hi> when <hi>Reason</hi> is <hi>Nonpluss'd?</hi> Something was to be said when he was at a Plunge; and any thing is taken up, in that Exigence, to serve a turn; and, the more <hi>Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> it is, the better it pleases his <hi>Humour;</hi> which never lets him consider whether it be <hi>Credible,</hi> or no: It serves to bespatter,

Another piece of this <hi>New Cartesian Method,</hi> is, To cry aloud against me, and call me <hi>Proud, Self-conceited,</hi> and <hi>Arrogant,</hi> if I will not allow such Writers as himself to be most Excellent Philosophers: Or, if I hap to dissent from other Learned Men, in <hi>some</hi> Opinions, (as, Who does not?) then, presently, he complains pathetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I <hi>damn, contemn,</hi> and <hi>trample upon</hi> those Authors: Or, if I do but say, I <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate</hi> such a Point; or, that others do <hi>not</hi> demonstrate; then, presently, I am <hi>as Proud as Lucifer;</hi> and, the Lord knows what. How sincere he is in alledging this, will appear by the examining three most signal Places he makes Choice of; where he objects it, (§. 40.) In which he makes me say, <hi>[Providentiam Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, ex Aliis omnibus, me, ad Rationem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio suo restituendam selegisse:]</hi> that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence had chosen out Me, from All Others, to restore Reason to her Dominion, or Soveraignty, over Fancy.</hi> This, certainly, thus worded, sounds proudly. But, may we not fear, after so many Trials, that Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> has <hi>falsify'd</hi> my Words, tho' he puts them all for <hi>mine:</hi> and, that too, in a <hi>Distinct Character?</hi> To say, I would attempt or endeavour this, is but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102124:56"/>
that my Zeal for <hi>Truth</hi> had put me upon such a <hi>bold</hi> Undertaking, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to give an Encouragement to the Reader to weigh my Argument: Or, to say, that I apprehended GOD's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had <hi>enabi'd</hi> me to perform this, was no more than to say, I had writ a <hi>Method to Science,</hi> which the Title-Page had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd openly; for which too, I gave GOD the Glory. But, to say <hi>GOD had chosen me, out of All others,</hi> can become no body but a Proud and Imprudent Boaster. How proves he this? that is, How shews he these Words, thus put together, in my Books? Why, he cites the very places; which, if <hi>True,</hi> must <hi>shame</hi> me; if <hi>False,</hi> must <hi>disgrace</hi> him, as a Falsifyer. The First of the Places he cites, is found in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to my <hi>METHOD, p.</hi> 27. where I find, in the Beginning of that §, these Words; <hi>I have not enumerated these Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, to boast my Performances; but, to be-speak my Reader's Pardon, if, travelling in an Unbeaten Road, I happen now and then to stumble.</hi> Which have not the least Shew of <hi>Arrogancy,</hi> but the quite <hi>Contrary.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I say, <hi>p.</hi> 27. that <hi>It is Impossible for any Wit of Man to invent any other VVay than what I have propos'd; that is, Solid and Evident:</hi> Which, I say there, is, <hi>to build on the Nature of the Thing, and frame my Discourses by Connexion of Terms.</hi> But, do
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102124:56"/>
I pretend, that what I propos'd was my <hi>own Invention,</hi> or that I am the <hi>Author</hi> of it; as the <hi>Wondrously Modest Cartesius</hi> did; who oppos'd <hi>all</hi> the present and past World, to set up his <hi>New-fangl'd</hi> Doctrine? Do not all <hi>Aristotelians</hi> pretend to it, as well as I? And, Did not all the Learned World fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, till <hi>Cartesius</hi>'s Time? With what Ingenuity, then, does he tell his Reader, in the Margin, that this is <hi>Arrogantia</hi> J. S. <hi>non aliàs audita; the Unheard of Arrogance of</hi> J. S. to propose in his Books, (in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the <hi>Ideists,)</hi> what Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand had <hi>propos'd before him?</hi> The Second Place he cites, is, from the Epistle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory to <hi>Solid Philosophy Asserted,</hi> §. 8. where I have these Words, <hi>[I must own, I have a high Opinion of my Principles, and of my Method, which Nature, and GOD's Good Providence, have laid, and establish'd.]</hi> Is it <hi>Arrogance</hi> to have a <hi>high Opinion</hi> of what <hi>GOD,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> (the Work of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdom) have done? For, it is plain, that I do not pretend I have any hand in <hi>establishing</hi> either of them. My <hi>Non Ultra</hi> has told them why I have a high Opinion of my <hi>Principles,</hi> because they are built on the Metaphysical Verity of Things, establish'd by the Ideas in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Understanding: And of my Method, or <hi>Way</hi> of Discourse; because Nature, or (which is the same) GOD, as Author of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102124:57"/>
Nature, has made our Soul such an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour sort of Spirit, that it works by <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract</hi> or <hi>Inadequate</hi> Notions, which we <hi>compound</hi> or <hi>connect</hi> into Propositions, (in which all Truth formally consists;) and then <hi>connect</hi> those Propositions into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Discourses. These, then, being by me ascrib'd to <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> I assume nothing to my self, but my <hi>Conclusions;</hi> and, of these I deliver'd my self thus, in the Words immediately following: <hi>[But, as for my Conclusions, and my Deductions, as I will not justifie them with the same Firmness as I did the others, so I should not think I ought to propose them to Learned Men, unless I judg'd them Demonstrative.]</hi> And, now, where is all this <hi>Unheard of Arrogancy?</hi> Where is my Bragging that GOD had <hi>Selected</hi> me so particularly, <hi>from All Others,</hi> which he most expresly puts upon me; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to shew them, <hi>[tribus ex locis,] from three Places;</hi> of which, these are <hi>Two,</hi> where not a Word is found savouring of <hi>Arrogancy,</hi> or any thing like it; but, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the direct <hi>Contrary?</hi> Would it be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil, on this Occasion, to ask of Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> whether he has not <hi>forsworn</hi> all <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi> and <hi>Common Honesty?</hi> To <hi>stander</hi> is too great a <hi>Crime</hi> for a good <hi>Christian</hi> to be Guilty of; but, to <hi>falsisie</hi> his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's <hi>Words,</hi> and <hi>Slander</hi> him too; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to <hi>pretend</hi> falsly he says <hi>thus,</hi> or <hi>thus,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:102124:57"/>
in such Determinate Places, (which Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularizing makes it look Credible,) on purpose <hi>that he may slander him,</hi> is so vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and wilful a Complicated Crime, that the Tenderest, and most Indulgent Charity is at a loss to invent an Excuse for it.</p>
               <p n="62">62. The Third Place to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his Reader, is taken out of the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory to <hi>Solid Philosophy Asserted;</hi> where there are, indeed, some of those Words, but not one of those <hi>haughty</hi> ones he here expresly and distinctly fixes upon me. My Discourse in the two fore-going Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, was, concerning the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Ideas</hi> made use of by <hi>Cartesius,</hi> and others; which, I made account, did delude their good <hi>Reason;</hi> and, by making them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard the <hi>Nature of the Thing,</hi> led them into <hi>Fancies,</hi> and <hi>Imaginary Conceits:</hi> I gave there for the Reason why I writ Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, That <hi>I apprehended GOD's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had fitted and enabl'd me to redress such great Mischiefs, (viz.</hi> that <hi>Fancies</hi> should <hi>beat down</hi> Reason and Truth;) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>I thought it became me to Re-instate Reason in her Sovereignty over Fancy; and, to assert to her the Rightful Dominion Nature had given her, over all our Judgments.]</hi> Which amounts to this, That I thought my self <hi>able</hi> to confute his <hi>Way of Ideas,</hi> and to shew it to be <hi>Opposite to True Reason.</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:102124:58"/>
Is it such a piece of Arrogancy to pretend to be able to confute a piece of <hi>Novelry,</hi> so Opposite to the Way of all the former World, (especially, ascribing, as I did, that Ability to GOD?) Or rather, (if there be any Arrogancy <hi>at all</hi> on either side,) Is it not more like Arrogancy <hi>in them,</hi> to blame the Methods of so many <hi>Thousands</hi> of Learned Men, who writ <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them;</hi> and, by introducing <hi>New</hi> Ways of Philosophizing, to <hi>accuse,</hi> by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>all</hi> the <hi>former VVorld</hi> of <hi>Ignorance?</hi> Is it not rather <hi>Arrogance</hi> in him, to be so haughtily and rudely Stiff in maintaining <hi>Ideas</hi> (as he says) <hi>Elicited,</hi> or produc'd by <hi>Himself,</hi> without even attempting to bring any one Demonstration, or Conclusive Proof for them? Can there be any <hi>Self-Conceit</hi> more Enormous, than to be thus <hi>Ravingly Earnest</hi> to maintain that he has this Invisible Gift of <hi>Producing Ideas</hi> out of his own Head, or <hi>ex se,</hi> (as he expresses it;) which he holds to be the only <hi>Ground</hi> of all True Knowledge, without bringing <hi>any one</hi> Argument that is able to evince it; and, then, because we will not <hi>believe</hi> him without Proof, to foam thus at the Mouth with the foulest Language the most Transported Rage could dictate? See his Words at the End of this §. <hi>[Quis a</hi> Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feri <hi>lapsu, superbiùs unquam de Seipso sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit! VVhat Man, since the Fall of</hi> Lucifer,

But, in the Name of Wonder! How comes it that <hi>no body</hi> but <hi>himself</hi> ever thought me thus <hi>damnably Arrogant!</hi> I do confess, I write briskly, and smartly, when I think it Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I write for Truth. It is my Duty: And, I have given my Reasons for it in my Preface to <hi>Solid Philosophy;</hi> which he, instead of Answering, tells us here only, <hi>he cannot read them without Horrour:</hi> No, nor my <hi>Arguments</hi> neither; for, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers them both <hi>just alike.</hi> In what, then, consists this <hi>Arrogancy</hi> of mine? The plain Truth is this; and, his Carriage confesses it: I had challeng'd him to bring <hi>one Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> or <hi>one Conclusive Proof,</hi> for his <hi>New VVay</hi> of Philosophy: He has <hi>none;</hi> and, therefore, I must be <hi>Intolerably Arrogant,</hi> because he is <hi>Obstinate in his Errours,</hi> and <hi>pitifully Ignorant;</hi> as also, because I follow the <hi>Way,</hi> which builds Truth on the <hi>Nature of Things,</hi> and on the <hi>Connexion of Terms;</hi> which all the <hi>Learned</hi> Men in the <hi>VVorld</hi> had <hi>so long</hi> embrac'd, and <hi>Unperverted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> teaches every Man.</p>

63. But, we have lost our Third Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I beseech my Reader to re-view it, and then to consider whether there be one Word there, that <hi>GOD had Selected me from All Others;</hi> which he here, §. 40. puts upon me, as my Express Words; and prints in a distinct Character, as <hi>mine.</hi> That I have truly represented the Three Places he relates to, will appear by the <hi>Preface</hi> to his former Book, §. 26. where he puts them down at large. This, then, being evident to Eye-sight, I charge him with Three Wilful Falsifications <hi>here,</hi> in citing <hi>Three Places</hi> in my Books for these haughty Words; <hi>viz.</hi> that I said, <hi>I was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from All Others, &amp;c.</hi> whereas, I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, that <hi>I apprehended my self Able</hi> to confute his <hi>Ideas.</hi> I demand of him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to shew me the Words in my Books, or, to acknowledge his Errour. But, I do not expect from him the Candour to retract any of his Slanders, whatsoever he professes here, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. For, this would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to make Satisfaction; against which, as I have sufficiently experienc'd, he is (I know not by what Case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science) <hi>Church-Canon-Proof.</hi> This, then, is Another Branch of the <hi>New</hi> Cartesian <hi>Method of Arguing, and Answering; viz.</hi> to <hi>falsifie,</hi> and <hi>impose</hi> on his Adversary, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>VVords</hi> he pleases: And, he is very Constant, and Diligent, in pursuing that <hi>Useful</hi> Method.</p>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:102124:59"/>
64. Another Branch of this <hi>New Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> is, Without so much as <hi>one VVord</hi> to abet his Saying; nay, in despite of <hi>many VVords,</hi> and, even, <hi>Avow'd Demonstrations</hi> to the <hi>contrary;</hi> to impose upon me False, Invidious, Incredible, and Unchristian Tenets. Thus, <hi>p.</hi> 78, 79. he makes me deny that <hi>the Soul exists when it is separated from the Body:</hi> Nay, he is afraid I deny it is <hi>Created,</hi> but is <hi>ex Traduce;</hi> and, that it is <hi>Extinguish'd with the Body, and Rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the Last Day.</hi> Nor is this all; but, (that we may see how his Suspicions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict one another,) he calls into Doubt, <hi>p.</hi> 78. whether I <hi>acknowledge a Resurrection.</hi> I see, it is a great Favour he will let me hold <hi>some few</hi> of the Articles of my <hi>Creed;</hi> for, he has debarr'd me from holding most of them. His Reasons, (such as they are,) as well as I can collect them, or make them look like Aiming at any Sense, are these. First, I made her <hi>incapable</hi> of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existing</hi> before the Body, of which she is the <hi>Form;</hi> (of which Opinion he seems here an Earnest Asserter:) Whence he concludes, I deny she can exist when <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi> from the Body <hi>afterwards:</hi> And, yet, <hi>p.</hi> 78. <hi>l.</hi> 4. himself uses my Words; which affirm, that, after she is separated, <hi>ex se existere apta est, she is able to exist of her self.</hi> Next; What says he to my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: <hi>Ens</hi> is only that which is <hi>capable of</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:102124:60"/>
                  <hi>Existing:</hi> But, as the Council of <hi>Vienna</hi> has told him, the Soul is <hi>Forma hominis;</hi> and, therefore, she cannot, of her self, exist <hi>here;</hi> but the <hi>Totum</hi> only, of which, she is a <hi>Part.</hi> Again, I argue thus; That which is <hi>Indeterminate</hi> in any kind, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>exist;</hi> but the Soul, <hi>before</hi> she had Knowledge in the Body, was a meer <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia Cognoscendi,</hi> or (as some express it) <hi>Rasa Tabula:</hi> Therefore, she could not exist before the Body. The <hi>Major</hi> is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The <hi>Minor</hi> must be granted by Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> himself; for, the Soul can have no Actual Knowledge, without <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas;</hi> and, he denies she has any <hi>Innate Ideas,</hi> but only an <hi>Innate Power</hi> of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them; that is, she has, according to him, none at all before she had <hi>elicited</hi> them <hi>out of her self:</hi> Therefore, she <hi>was,</hi> according to <hi>some Priority,</hi> before she did elicit them, or, before she had any Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and, consequently, she was, <hi>of her self,</hi> only a <hi>Power</hi> to have them; or, a meer <hi>Power</hi> to have Knowledge; which is, to be utterly <hi>Indeterminate, in Ratione Cognoscitivi:</hi> But, what is <hi>Indeterminate</hi> in any kind, is neither <hi>This,</hi> nor <hi>That;</hi> nor, consequently, <hi>can exist:</hi> Therefore, there can be no Pre-Existence of Souls. What answers he to these Arguments? We must excuse him; 'Tis not his Custom to do such trifling Work, as to answer any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102124:60"/>
at all: 'Tis enough for him to stand stiff to his <hi>Cartesian</hi> Tenet, that the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> are <hi>Two Things;</hi> I, that they are, let Arguments say what they will. However, he will do better than Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments: And, <hi>How is that?</hi> Why, he'll make them all Bad Christians, and Hereticks, that speak against <hi>Cartesius;</hi> which no sooner said, but, in his wise O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <hi>down they go</hi> to the Pit of Hell, like so many Imps of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> as they are: They deny the Immortality of the Soul, and the Resurrection; and there is an end of them. And, Is not this Confutation enough in all Conscience!</p>
               <p n="65">65. His Follies here were tedious to Enumerate. He yields, <hi>with much ado,</hi> what the Council of <hi>Vienna</hi> told him 'twas <hi>Heresie to deny;</hi> but he yields it very <hi>faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> in these Words; <hi>Anima</hi> (says he) <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis Forma aliquando dici potest: The Soul may sometimes be call'd a Form of Man.</hi> The Council is much bound to him for his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Complement; and <hi>Cartesius</hi> is their most <hi>humble</hi> Servant, but not so <hi>Obedient</hi> to its Decrees of <hi>Faith</hi> as he ought. But, <hi>What kind</hi> of <hi>Form</hi> is the Soul then? The Council said, it was such, <hi>verè &amp; essentiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> and, if it were <hi>Truly</hi> such, why may not a Truth, that belongs to Faith, be spoke at <hi>all times?</hi> Why, only, <hi>[dici po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, It may be said;]</hi> as if it were some
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102124:61"/>
                  <hi>Improper</hi> and <hi>Unusual</hi> Phrase, and not <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> Language, in which <hi>Declarations</hi> of Faith use to be worded? Why <hi>aliquando</hi> only? May not <hi>Truth</hi> be spoke <hi>Always,</hi> as oft as there is Occasion? Well, but, all <hi>this</hi> while, what kind of <hi>Form</hi> is it? He tells us here, <hi>p.</hi> 78. <hi>l.</hi> 18, 19, 20. Is it neither an <hi>Assistant,</hi> or Extrinsecal <hi>Form;</hi> nor an <hi>Informing,</hi> or Intrinsecal one? Now, <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> means <hi>Not-Extrinsecal:</hi> We should be glad, then, to see this <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of a <hi>Form,</hi> that is neither <hi>Extrinsecal,</hi> nor <hi>Not-Extrinsecal.</hi> What is this <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> Form then? He gives us no Account of it, but that 'tis <hi>alterius Generis, Of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Kind; quo fit, ut Hominis Formam Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitatem esse strictiùs asseramus; By which it comes to pass, that we more strictly call the Form of Man Humanity.</hi> What Gibberish is this? Is the Soul a <hi>Form</hi> at all, or <hi>no?</hi> If not, then he must say the Council errs: If it be, what is the <hi>Matter</hi> to this Form? Or, Is it neither <hi>Intrinsecal,</hi> nor <hi>Not-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal</hi> to it? A Form that is not Intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to the Matter, or <hi>Informs it,</hi> is a <hi>strange</hi> kind of <hi>Form.</hi> Again; What Sense is it, that <hi>Humanity</hi> is, by the Soul, <hi>more strictly</hi> made the Form of. Man! One would think, that this being the <hi>Abstract</hi> Notion of <hi>Man,</hi> its <hi>Concrete,</hi> and that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses his Total Essence, should be so <hi>more strictly</hi> ally'd to it, by the very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102124:61"/>
of it, (as <hi>Whiteness</hi> is to that which is <hi>White,)</hi> that nothing could make a Man <hi>more strictly</hi> call'd a <hi>Man,</hi> than <hi>Manhood,</hi> or <hi>Humanity,</hi> can do of it self. So that, <hi>Insignificant Words</hi> and <hi>Contradictions</hi> are obtruded upon us, instead of <hi>Solid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi> and we must be content with them, when no better can be had.</p>
               <p n="66">66. As for his pretending I hold, the Soul is <hi>ex traduce,</hi> and not <hi>Created,</hi> he goes against the Light of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: For, whoever reads my Fourth <hi>Preliminary</hi> to <hi>Solid Philosophy,</hi> § §. 8, 9. (as 'tis evident he <hi>has,</hi> since he <hi>cavils</hi> at that Book,) will see, I make the Soul come <hi>immediately</hi> from GOD, and <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> tho, indeed, the whole <hi>Man</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly <hi>Created,</hi> but, in part <hi>(viz.</hi> according to its Body) <hi>Generated,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of the Soul is call'd by the Schools, not simply <hi>Creation,</hi> but <hi>Concreation;</hi> meaning, that the Soul is <hi>then</hi> Created, when, by <hi>Generation,</hi> the Bodily Part is brought to that Perfection, as to be fit, in some degree, to work with it. This, then, is another piece of their <hi>New Cartesian Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod;</hi> and would serve for <hi>Arguing</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering</hi> both, and do mighty Execution in <hi>Running down</hi> their Adversary, if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to meet with Ignorant and Credulous Readers, who are so weak, as not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that Imputations of the <hi>Largest Size</hi>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102124:62"/>
Angels, That there was some <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> or some kind of State, whence they fell, is certain, and undeniable. The Question is, <hi>VVhat</hi> this State was? I took him to mean it was to <hi>see God;</hi> (and so did the Learned <hi>Merry-man</hi> too;) for, to say they were in Heaven, is the same, in Christian Language, as to say they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd the <hi>Beatifical Vision.</hi> Nor do I think any Man living will deny, but that our Saviour's Words, <hi>In the House of my Father are many Mansions,</hi> (one of which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions he assign here, <hi>p.</hi> 47. <hi>l.</hi> 25. as a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Habitation</hi> to the Devils, before their Fall,) was meant of the <hi>Stations,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi> of <hi>Essential Happiness,</hi> in the Sight of GOD; for, no Man will deny, but that 'tis <hi>there</hi> he told his Disciples, <hi>he went to prepare a Place for them.</hi> Now, since Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> calls the <hi>House</hi> which our Saviour calls here <hi>his Father's, [Heavenly,]</hi> what I want to know, is, what he means by this <hi>House,</hi> if it be not the Heaven of the Blessed Saints, who enjoy GOD. He makes it another thing; and says, that they are <hi>thence promoted,</hi> and <hi>admitted more fully to the Beatifical Vision.</hi> What means [promoted, and admitted <hi>more fully</hi> to see GOD,] but, that they saw him <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> tho' not <hi>so fully?</hi> If so, and, that this was really his Tenet formerly, as I suspected, then my Argument proceeds
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102124:63"/>
against it thus: <hi>If they saw GOD,</hi> they were <hi>Happy;</hi> If <hi>Happy,</hi> they had all they <hi>could wish;</hi> If they had all they <hi>could wish,</hi> they could wish <hi>no more,</hi> nor love any Created Good <hi>inordinately;</hi> nor, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Sin,</hi> nor be <hi>Damn'd:</hi> Therefore, they did not absolutely <hi>stare;</hi> that is, they were not absolutely <hi>in Termino,</hi> or <hi>in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> I am half afraid, that, from the Words <hi>Mansion, Domicilium,</hi> and such like, which they <hi>left,</hi> he conceits there are certain kinds of <hi>Upper-Rooms,</hi> and <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Rooms,</hi> in Heaven; and, that <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and his Adherents, dwelt in some of the <hi>Lowest;</hi> and were there <hi>besieg'd,</hi> and <hi>driven thence</hi> by St. <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels. Some may think this is too much <hi>strain'd,</hi> and looks as if I spoke <hi>in Jest:</hi> But I am <hi>very Serious;</hi> and, can see no Reason in the World that is <hi>Solid,</hi> or taken out of the Nature of our Subject, <hi>Angels;</hi> why he, who assigns to them, <hi>[Before</hi> and <hi>After,]</hi> which are the Proper Differences of <hi>Time,</hi> should not assign to them <hi>Local Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> too: And, I should be much oblig'd to that Man, who would shew me, <hi>out of the Nature of the Thing,</hi> why Angels, which are <hi>Pure Acts,</hi> should not have the <hi>One,</hi> as well as the <hi>Other;</hi> or, why they should not be <hi>Contain'd</hi> in, or <hi>Commensurate</hi> to <hi>Place,</hi> which is <hi>Perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Quantity;</hi> as well as their Operations,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102124:63"/>
by being <hi>one after another,</hi> should be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate to <hi>Time,</hi> which is <hi>Successive Quantity; both</hi> of them being equally <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite,</hi> nay, <hi>Contradictory</hi> to the Nature of <hi>Indivisible</hi> Beings.</p>
               <p n="68">68. To clear this Point, which is much blunder'd by Metaphorical Words, which are <hi>Equivocal;</hi> First, It is Certain there was some Condition, State, or <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> from which they <hi>fell.</hi> Secondly, That Words which signifie <hi>Place,</hi> when apply'd to <hi>Spirits,</hi> are, and can only be meant, of <hi>States,</hi> or <hi>Conditions;</hi> that is, of Exalted <hi>Knowledge;</hi> Ignorance of what they long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>wish to know;</hi> of Extreamly <hi>Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Griefs, Blissful Joys,</hi> or <hi>Suspended Hope,</hi> which is also very <hi>Penal.</hi> Thirdly, That <hi>Aquinas (Pr.

               <p n="69">69. But, does Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> imagine there goes no more to the Interpretation of Scripture, than a <hi>hasty Fancy</hi> of our own? I know he is resolv'd to like no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that comes from me: However, I will acquaint the Readers with my Thoughts, hoping it make some of them more Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, than to <hi>Censure</hi> highly, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> one another, because they interpret Scripture otherwise than themselves do. I conceive then, that in Passages belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Faith,</hi> Scripture is to be interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Mr. <hi>Thorndike (Just VVeights and Measures, p.</hi> 37.) also holds, <hi>by what the Church, from the Beginning, has receiv'd by</hi>

                  <hi>their</hi> (the Pastors) <hi>Hands.</hi> In Matters that belong to <hi>Natural</hi> Subjects, <hi>True Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is the best Means to interpret it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, <hi>VVords</hi> (in a Book intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Faith and Good Works, and not for Natural Speculation) may be <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous;</hi> but a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> if truly such, cannot deceive us. Thus, when 'tis said, that GOD made <hi>Two Great Lights,</hi> the Words would make us think that the <hi>Moon</hi> is the <hi>Greatest,</hi> next to the <hi>Sun,</hi> in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament; but the Science of <hi>Astronomy</hi> corrects that Thought, and assures us, it is the <hi>Least</hi> within our Ken. Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>True</hi> Science of the Natures of Things enlightens us to know when Words that relate to them are to be taken in a <hi>Literal,</hi> when in a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Sense; but, most especially, when the Speech is of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures; which, if we should understand <hi>Literally,</hi> it would make us entertain a thousand <hi>Frantick Conceits,</hi> unworthy GOD Almighty, or Angels either; as every one knows. This determin'd, and that 'tis once known the Words are meant <hi>Literally,</hi> then <hi>Criticism,</hi> which acquaints us in what Sense they us'd to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by those who liv'd about the same <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> will give us great Light.

thing to <hi>another;</hi> and, to gather by the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> or <hi>Consequence</hi> of the Discourse, the Sense of the whole Passage. Nor is <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> useless in what concerns the <hi>Congruity</hi> of the Words which compound the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Context. This, and such other Considerations, if Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> would please to lay to heart, he would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately pronounce, and conclude, that every Interpretation that sutes not with his <hi>Fancy,</hi> or with the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Cartesius,</hi> (the Agreeableness or Disagreeableness to which seem to be his <hi>Rule</hi> of Interpreting Scripture,) to be such heinous Sins (as he does, <hi>p.</hi> 15.) against <hi>Moses,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Jude,</hi> nay, against <hi>GOD himself,</hi> and (which is an odd Addition) against the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> too. (Had I said so, he would have objected, that 'tis a Clear Case I do not hold the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to be GOD.) By which Method, he assumes to himself a Prerogative to make more <hi>Decrees of Eaith</hi> in a <hi>Moment,</hi> than all the <hi>General Councils,</hi> since the Christian Church stood, have made in Sixteen Hundred Years, with all their <hi>Disquisitio Magna.</hi> But, I doubt, he will find few that will subscribe to his New <hi>Symbolum Fidei,</hi> or his <hi>New Articles of Faith,</hi> no better grounded; nor believe (however their <hi>Science,</hi> according to <hi>Malbranche,</hi> comes by <hi>Divine Revelation)</hi> that their <hi>New Faith</hi> hath such a Supernatural and Sacred Original.</p>

70. I had forgotten a very smart Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of his, put down largely, <hi>p.</hi> 125. which is the more Victorious, because my <hi>own Words</hi> are brought to tell me to my Face, that I <hi>eat</hi> them. The Point was this: A <hi>Syllogism</hi> being the most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act of Discourses, out of which some <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate</hi> Conclusion follows, from the <hi>placing</hi> of the <hi>Terms;</hi> hence, in my <hi>ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOD, B.</hi> 3. <hi>L.</hi> 1. where I treated of the <hi>Figure</hi> of a Syllogism, which consists in the <hi>Placing</hi> the <hi>Two Extremes</hi> with the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,</hi> so that some <hi>Determinate</hi> Conclusion might ensue thence, I advanc'd this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that therefore the two last Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures were Unnatural, and Illogical. My Reason given there, § §. 10, 11, 12. was, because the Place of the <hi>Predicate</hi> being that which belongs to <hi>Superiour</hi> Notions, and the Place of the <hi>Subject</hi> (as the Word imports) being that which sutes best with <hi>Inferiour</hi> ones; and, it being <hi>Natural,</hi> that that which <hi>conjoins Two,</hi> should be placed in the <hi>Middle,</hi> between them; it was most Unnatural, that the Middle-Term should be plac'd so as to be <hi>Predicated,</hi> or <hi>Above them both,</hi> as 'tis in the Second Figure, where 'tis <hi>twice Predicated;</hi> or <hi>Below them</hi> both, as in the Third, where 'tis <hi>twice the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:</hi> whence, the Middle-Term is, in neither of those Figures, <hi>in the Middle.</hi> Hence, in my §. 15.

Consequence; [Hence, no <hi>Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Conclusion can follow in either of the <hi>last</hi> Figures, <hi>from the Disposal of the Parts in the Syllogism:]</hi> Which I repeat again, and farther explicate, in the next Page; concluding thus, (The <hi>Indeterminate</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion <hi>follows not from the Artificial Form of the Syllogism,</hi> but meerly from the <hi>Material Identity</hi> of all the Terms; or from this, that their Notions were found in the <hi>same Ens.]</hi> And, in Conformity to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, I put <hi>Two</hi> Propositions <hi>only</hi> in each of those Figures, (which I did no where else when I came to make <hi>Syllogisms,)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>no Determinate</hi> Conclusion follows thence; as I declare my self, expresly, in the last Line of that Page. By which, any Man of Common Sense may see clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Question</hi> is this, Whether any <hi>Determinate</hi> Conclusion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the two last Figures; and this, from <hi>the Disposal of the Parts in the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism.</hi> Whence, <hi>(Id.

That they would shew, out of the</hi> Nature of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>we are treating of,</hi> (as they ought;) <hi>that is, out os the Artificial Frame of a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism; which would not be such as it ought to be,</hi> (that is, <hi>Artificial,) unless all the three Terms had a</hi> Determinate <hi>Place in it; but, chiefly, out of the</hi> Placing of the Middle-Term,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102124:66"/>
                  <hi>and the Laws of Predicating; why</hi> One <hi>of the Extremes ought, in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to be Subject or Predicate, rather than the</hi> Other: <hi>Or, (which is the same,) why a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Determinate</hi> Conclusion <hi>follows from such a Placing of the Terms.</hi> This is the Point truly stated from <hi>my Words,</hi> over and over repeated: This, then, he is to answer to, and to shew, that out of such a <hi>Placing</hi> of, the Middle-Term, any <hi>Determinate</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, that is, <hi>One of them rather than the Other,</hi> does follow. Now, let us see his Answer, and reflect upon his Method.</p>
               <p n="71">71. 'Tis found in his <hi>Censura, p.</hi> 125, 126. Where we may observe, First, That there is not <hi>one VVord</hi> of either a <hi>Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Conclusion following thence, nor of following out of the <hi>Placing</hi> the <hi>Extremes</hi> with the <hi>Middle-Term</hi> in the Premisses; concerning which only the whole Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion proceeds, as I over and over repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whence follows that he has not spoke <hi>one VVord</hi> to the purpose, in his <hi>whole An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi> 2. He says, <hi>Turpiter lapsus est, He has fallen into a filthy Errour.</hi> That is to be try'd, and determin'd, by the Solidity of his Answer. In the mean time, if my Position was an Errour, he has never so much as <hi>touch'd</hi> it, much less <hi>confuted</hi> it; since, 'tis evident, he has prevaricated from the whole Question. 3. He says, I do <hi>calcare Aristotelem, trample upon Aristotle.</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:102124:67"/>
Poor spiteful Trifler! Cannot I dissent from <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or any other Author, in <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one thing,</hi> but I must presently <hi>calcare, spernere contemnere, damnare</hi> those very Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors themselves? Did <hi>Cartesius calcare, damnare, spernere, &amp;c.</hi> all the former World, when he introduc'd this <hi>New</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his, so <hi>Different,</hi> and, in most things, so <hi>Opposite</hi> to them all? 4. He says, I do <hi>calcare Porphyrium, trample upon Porphyrius;</hi> he means, in putting a <hi>Sixth Predicable,</hi> or Manner of Predicating: And, in case we allow <hi>Identical Propositions,</hi> without doing which, we must (as <hi>Non Ultra</hi> has demonstrated) renounce <hi>First Principles,</hi> it is Evident, that the Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>VVhole,</hi> formally and expresly, of the <hi>VVhole,</hi> is another Sort or Manner of Predicating, from <hi>his Five.</hi> Let him know then, once for all, that I am so far from standing Corrected, as to my <hi>Luciferian Pride</hi> and <hi>Arrogancy,</hi> notwithstanding his <hi>Casvigations,</hi> (as he calls them,) that I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue not a Pin what either <hi>Aristotle, Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> or any other Philosopher says, when I see an Evident Reason to the contrary; Since, 'tis only the Goodness of their <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> that gave them all their Credit and Authority. 5. I had alledg'd I had <hi>produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> no Syllogisms there at all; since a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism consists of <hi>Three</hi> Propositions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, I had manifestly put but <hi>Two;</hi> because
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102124:67"/>
no <hi>Determinate</hi> Conclusion follow'd; and, I challeng'd him that himself had added a <hi>Third.</hi> What says he to this? Does not <hi>Eye-sight,</hi> and my <hi>express Words</hi> in that place, put this out of all Doubt, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil? He reflects on it thus, <hi>Quae haec homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Impudentis Confidentia, &amp;c. VVhat a strange Confidence is this of this Impudent Man, whose Mouth can by no other means be stopp'd, but by citing his own VVords in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish!</hi> And, immediately he puts down my very Words, in which are only <hi>Two</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and <hi>not Three;</hi> without which <hi>last,</hi> there can be no Syllogism. His Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I pass over, and only desire the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to find a Word (if he can) to express fully the Humour of this Mad-man, who strives thus to <hi>cut-face</hi> Men's <hi>Eyes;</hi> and puts down my very Words here, which evidently <hi>confute himself.</hi> 6. He cites my Words in his <hi>Censure, p.</hi> 126. that the Conclusion may either be <hi>This,</hi> or the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and, as far as I can guess, (for I am loath to fix upon him absolutely such a prodigious piece of Nonsense) he thinks that, by these Words, I signifie, some <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate</hi> Conclusion follows. Can any Man be so weak, as not to know that [Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the One, or the Other,] means, <hi>[Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the One, nor the other, Determinatery?]</hi> I see a thing a far off, and I say, <hi>'Tis either a Man, or a Horse:</hi> Do I, in saying so, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102124:68"/>
that it is <hi>determinately</hi> a Man, or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately</hi> a Horse; when as my Words expresly speak <hi>Indifferency,</hi> or <hi>Indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> to either? Every Conclusion that is deduc'd, is some <hi>One;</hi> and, what is <hi>One,</hi> is <hi>Determinate;</hi> and, if it be not <hi>Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> or <hi>One,</hi> 'tis <hi>None;</hi> for, <hi>None</hi> signifies <hi>No One:</hi> Whence, I told him, <hi>(Id. Cart. p.</hi> 26.) <hi>[Consultò abstinui ab</hi> ullâ Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione <hi>inferendâ, eò quòd nullam</hi> Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam <hi>(seu quod tantundem est</hi> Nullam) <hi>inde deduci aut sequi tum ostendi, tum disertè pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessus sum.]</hi> What replies he to this, in which the Force of my Answer consists? Not <hi>one VVord,</hi> nor so much as mentions it; but rambles on, after his own fashion; that is, <hi>Concealing</hi> all that is <hi>to purpose,</hi> or else <hi>Perverting</hi> it; and, then, making a wide Mouth over it, and Railing against it. Lastly, He will needs do Feats, and put the Syllogisms, <hi>[clariùs &amp; distinctiùs,] more clearly and distinctly</hi> than I did: Which is Ridiculous Bragging, and Nonsense to boot; for, (as Eye sight attests,) I put no no Syllogisms at all; neither <hi>Clearly,</hi> nor <hi>Obscurely;</hi> neither <hi>Distinctly,</hi> nor <hi>Confusedly.</hi> I know he will still be <hi>doing</hi> twenty things he <hi>should not do,</hi> to avoid the doing what he <hi>should do.</hi> If he will be <hi>doing.</hi> let him shew that any <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Determinate</hi> Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion follows out of Terms no better pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Premisses; and this, <hi>from the</hi>

                  <hi>Disposal of the Parts of the Syllogism;</hi> which are my very Words, §. 15. But this he has <hi>not done,</hi> nor <hi>Attempted to do,</hi> nor so much as <hi>mention'd,</hi> or <hi>taken Notice</hi> of it, tho' it be the only Point; and, therefore, he has done nothing at all but <hi>prevaricate, fool</hi> and <hi>rail,</hi> and given no kind of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. To make this clearer; Let the three Terms be A B and C; of which, A is the <hi>Majus Extremum;</hi> B, the <hi>Middle Term;</hi> and C, the <hi>Minus Extremum.</hi> If A be predicated of B, that is, be <hi>Above it;</hi> and B be predicated of, or <hi>Above</hi> C; then it follows, <hi>à fortieri,</hi> out of the very Placing the Terms, that A, being the Supreme Notion, must be <hi>above</hi> C, or the Predicate in the Conclusion; and, so, a <hi>Determinate</hi> Conclusion follows, out of the Situation of the Terms: But, if A and C stand on the same Level, and be both of them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Above</hi> B, or both of them <hi>Below</hi> it; neither has any Title, <hi>by virtue of their Place,</hi> to be <hi>above,</hi> or <hi>below;</hi> that is, to be Predicate, or Subject, in the Conclusion; and, therefore, the Conclusion remains <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate,</hi> or <hi>No One;</hi> that is, <hi>None.</hi> The rest is <hi>Empty Vapouring, [turpissimè lapsus est,]</hi> and such like stuff; his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Assistant, when he is at a <hi>Nonplus.</hi> If any one have a Mind to have a List of his Swaggering and Ranting Vapour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occasion, he may read them in

This Errour (forsooth!) was shewn me long ago, by his Friend, and Tutor, Mr. <hi>Bisset,</hi> after my Book was printed; who, out of his own won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Kindness to me, told me, he was sorry I had so strangely mistaken; and, as I am inform'd, he has objected it since, to some of my Friends; as a great Lapse: To rectifie whom, I have been something larger, in case he be not <hi>past Rectifying.</hi> But, of him, and all that has pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, more hereafter, as Occasion presents.</p>
               <p n="72">72. I cannot omit another Method of Solving my Demonstrations, 'tis so very pleasant. I had demonstrated in my <hi>ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOD,</hi> that all Intrinsecal Differences were nothing but <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Notion; for, if they be <hi>Intrinsecal,</hi> or keep <hi>within</hi> the Precincts of that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Notion; that is, if they be not fetch'd from another Head, (which is, to be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal,)</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:102124:70"/>
then, in case they did <hi>equally</hi> partake the <hi>Genus,</hi> the <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Species</hi> (they being, both of them, constituted by their Differences) would have in it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>particular to it self;</hi> or, have nothing in it, but <hi>just the same</hi> the Other had; and, so, they could not <hi>differ Intrinsecally</hi> from one another: Whence follows, that the Intrinsecal <hi>Differences,</hi> by which they formally <hi>differ,</hi> can be no other but an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal</hi> Participation of the Common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is, <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi> of it. What says he to this Clear Demonstration? Not a Word. 'Tis his Prerogative, never to regard the <hi>Argument.</hi> He <hi>denies</hi> my <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi> as he does almost <hi>always,</hi> quite thorow his whole Answer; and, he never fails of having something or other to say against <hi>That:</hi> And, to let the Reader see here it cannot stand, he brings no less Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery than <hi>Omnipotence</hi> against it: <hi>VVhat!</hi> (says he,) <hi>Is it Impossible, then, for GOD, whose Power he is not VVilling to Obey,</hi> (that Unchristian Slander must come in of Course,) <hi>to make two Species, or Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duums, that Equally participate their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Notion? Is it Impossible for GOD to cause two Things, or Modes, or two Eggs, not to be Essentially unequal, since they all depend on GOD.</hi> Now, there is not one Word in my Argument, that relates, in the least, to GOD's <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> more than there is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102124:70"/>
in any of <hi>Euclid</hi>'s Demonstrations, or any other Argument whatsoever, brought by any other Philosopher: So that, this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is <hi>equally</hi> applicable to <hi>them,</hi> as to <hi>this</hi> of <hi>mine.</hi> And, is not this a most <hi>Formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Method,</hi> and, withall, very <hi>Expedite,</hi> to Answer all the Arguments in the World! <hi>viz.</hi> If they who alledge them, offer to say they <hi>conclude,</hi> he tells them, in short, that <hi>they deny GOD's Omnipotence,</hi> that <hi>they are not willing to obey his Power—</hi> on which all things <hi>depend;</hi> and, therefore, are Impious against GOD, if they will not grant, their Argument may, possibly, <hi>not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,</hi> or be Good for Nothing! What Man living dares deal with such an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, who has <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> in all Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, still at hand, to befriend him? This is their constant Topick; and, tho' he uses it never so oft, it will never be worn thread-bare. Certainly, that <hi>Sacred</hi> Attribute was never so <hi>Prophan'd,</hi> as by these Men, who make it perpetually an <hi>Excuse</hi> for their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and a <hi>Cloak</hi> for their <hi>Malice. Cartesius</hi> could <hi>dare</hi> Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence to do his <hi>worst,</hi> to <hi>deceive</hi> him, <hi>Med.</hi> 2. <hi>Nunquam</hi> (says he) <hi>efficiet Deceptor ille</hi> summè Potens <hi>ut nihil sim, quamdiù me aliquid esse cogitabo;</hi> and, yet, is <hi>Applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> for it: But others cannot bring a Plain Demonstration, but we are presently bob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the Mouth with <hi>denying Omnipotence.</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:102124:71"/>
But, the Question is not, whether <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> can <hi>solve</hi> it; but, whether Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> can. In the mean time, What An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer does he himself give to my Argument, which, in short, is this, If the <hi>Species</hi> do not partake the Generical Notion <hi>Unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, One</hi> has nothing in it under that <hi>Genus,</hi> but what the <hi>Other</hi> has: If it has nothing in it, as under that <hi>Genus,</hi> but what the <hi>Other</hi> has, it does not <hi>differ from</hi> it, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Genus:</hi> If it do not <hi>differ from it</hi> under that <hi>Genus,</hi> then 'tis <hi>One and the same</hi> with it under that Consideration, and not <hi>Two; v. g.</hi> Two Yards being <hi>Equal</hi> under the Notion of Quantity, they do <hi>not Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> that is, they are the <hi>Self-same</hi> under the Notion of Quantity, <hi>precisely:</hi> Which is as certain as this Identical, into which it is refunded, <hi>viz. A Yard is a Yard.</hi> Now, would I give something to be present when Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> puts on his Considering. Cap, and bethinks him what to say to this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration: I expect he will laugh at it, as meer Gibberish; (that we may be sure of,) for, he has a perfect Antipathy against all <hi>Connected Discourse;</hi> and, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion be <hi>Close,</hi> he falls into a Paroxysm of <hi>Railing;</hi> but, if the Evidence of it be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Identical Propositions,</hi> then his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son falls into a <hi>Swoon,</hi> and is perfectly <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranc'd;</hi> nor can any thing <hi>cure</hi> him, or furnish him with any kind of Answer, but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102124:71"/>
to have recourse to the Divine <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> for Relief; and then he is <hi>Enchanted,</hi> and <hi>Proof</hi> against all the Demonstrations in the World; and, will either pretend an <hi>Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Proposition may be <hi>False;</hi> or tell his Adversary, that GOD's Omnipotence can make his Argument not conclude; and, that he is <hi>Unwilling</hi> to acknowledge and <hi>obey GOD's Power,</hi> if he will needs stand to his Argument, Was ever Man so Nonpluss'd, and Baffl'd.</p>
               <p n="73">73. Another most remarkable Instance of his <hi>Exactness</hi> in Solving my Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, (and 'tis a very <hi>Compendious</hi> and <hi>Admirable</hi> one,) shall be, his <hi>Skipping</hi> over Multitudes of them, very <hi>Nimbly,</hi> at <hi>one Leap.</hi> In my <hi>Appendix,</hi> which confuted his false Pretence of holding <hi>Formal Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> (without which, all Physicks and Metaphysicks are meer Nonsense,) I had shewn how he spoke <hi>Contradictions</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Step he took; <hi>v. g.</hi> How he made <hi>[In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal]</hi> to be <hi>[Extrinsecal;] [Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,]</hi> or <hi>[Esseutial,]</hi> to be the same as <hi>[Accidental;]</hi> The Producing a new <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> or <hi>Ens,</hi> call'd <hi>[Generation,]</hi> to be meerly <hi>[Location,]</hi> or <hi>[Situation]</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things orderly together, which belong to another Head, or Predicament; and, consequently, is <hi>no Generation.</hi> How he makes <hi>[Unum,</hi> or <hi>One,]</hi> to be <hi>[Non-U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> or <hi>Multa;]</hi> that is, <hi>Not-One,</hi> but

How he made <hi>Completum,</hi> and <hi>Incompletum,</hi> to be the self-fame. How he confounds the Commonest Notions of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus</hi> and <hi>Potentia,</hi> and destroys both their Natures; which contradicts all <hi>Learned,</hi> and, even, all <hi>Common</hi> Discourse. How he makes what is] <hi>Divisible,]</hi> to be <hi>no way</hi> Divisible, or, <hi>[not-Divisible.]</hi> How he puts that to be <hi>Physical,</hi> (which belongs to a <hi>Distinct Science</hi> from the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,) to be <hi>Mathematical;</hi> that is, <hi>Not-Physical.</hi> How he makes <hi>[meer Matter,]</hi> which, as such, is contradistinguish'd to <hi>Form,</hi> (as the Principle of <hi>Potentiality</hi> and <hi>Indetermination</hi> is to that Principle which is <hi>Actuating,</hi> or <hi>Determinative,)</hi> to be <hi>[In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;]</hi> and that too <hi>Essentially.</hi> How he makes <hi>[Suppositions]</hi> (on which <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> proceeds) to be <hi>[Principles,]</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies on them as <hi>such;</hi> which are not only <hi>No Principles,</hi> but <hi>Contradictorily Opposite</hi> to the whole Nature and Essence of <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> All which, and much more, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and prov'd, against him, (at least, all but this last) by <hi>Mediums,</hi> fetch'd from <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> which are <hi>next to Self-evident,</hi> and <hi>border</hi> upon the very <hi>First</hi> Principles of all; or, on <hi>Identical Propositions,</hi> to which

also I did, by the way, reduce some of them. What Answers he to this large Discourse, consisting of thirty five Pages, which demonstrates how he had stumbl'd into <hi>Flat Nonsense,</hi> every Step he took? Read, Gentlemen; and admire the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Learning of my Adversary, and his Dexterity in Solving my Arguments. He answers all those Demonstrations (O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful!) in less than a <hi>Page and a half.</hi> But, <hi>How?</hi> Does he shew they proceed upon <hi>Unevident Principles,</hi> or <hi>False</hi> and <hi>Unprov'd Suppositions;</hi> or, that the Terms I use in my Discourse, are <hi>Unconnected?</hi> No, no; all these are <hi>meer Fooleries</hi> with him: This is none of his Methods. How, then, does he Answer them? Why, First, <hi>(Censura, p.</hi> 128.) he <hi>prefaces</hi> confidently, (which is no small Part of his Method of Answering,) and says, <hi>Expectandum erat, ut Vires suas omnes in eâ</hi> (he means his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix) <hi>confutanda eliceret: It was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he would have exerted his whole Force, in Answering my Appendix.</hi> Well! But, does <hi>he</hi> reply to my Answer, tho' never so <hi>negligently</hi> and <hi>carelesly</hi> written? that is to be yet examin'd. Secondly. He proceeds, <hi>At proh hominis Ignavi Imperitium! hic, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè, si usquam, nugatur egregiè: Oh, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulness of this Slothful Man! Here, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he trifles egregiously.</hi> These are, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, but <hi>Bold Sayings.</hi> What is his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer?</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:102124:73"/>
Why, he says, that I bring a <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Discourse to the <hi>Ten Predicaments; to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus and Species;</hi> to <hi>Ens</hi> and <hi>Unum, Abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> and <hi>Logical Trifles.</hi> Indeed, in <hi>one</hi> Page, (235.) where I am stating the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, I make a small Logical Discourse, to shew under what a precise Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we speak of our Subject; thus to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Distinct</hi> Conception, what Forms or Modes are <hi>Intrinsecal,</hi> what <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal:</hi> But, my Reader will see, that all my <hi>Mediums</hi> are either taken from Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks, or from Metaphysicks. And, 'tis to these <hi>Mediums,</hi> we would have an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. Does he shew that I deviate from the Nature of the Thing in hand? Do I not hold to the Notions of <hi>Ens, Unum, Matter, Form? &amp;c.</hi> Alas! he never minds such frivolous Considerations. Thirdly, He says, I tell my Reader, my <hi>Peripateti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Assertions are not suppos'd gratis, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.</hi> Does he go about to prove the <hi>Contrary?</hi> He not so much as attempts it. To what end, then, does he bring such <hi>Stuff?</hi> Oh! 'tis a necessary Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of his Method, to tell us at large <hi>what I say;</hi> for, that makes a Shew, as if he were about to <hi>confute</hi> me; and, when he has done, he lets it all alone, and slides away to another thing; which is his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Trick, all over. He is true to <hi>one</hi> part of his Title, which is, <hi>Censura;</hi> for,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102124:73"/>
he <hi>Censures</hi> very <hi>Notably:</hi> But, he never promis'd he would give a Reason, <hi>Why;</hi> and, he will not go beyond his Promise, or his Bargain. Fourthly, He says, I would have the Readers believe that the Words <hi>[Divisibility, Physical, Matter, &amp;c.]</hi> are <hi>Abus'd</hi> by him. He mistakes; I would not have any Readers of mine <hi>believe</hi> any Tittle, upon my <hi>Word;</hi> but, <hi>see</hi> with the <hi>Eye</hi> of their <hi>own Reason,</hi> that my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>prove</hi> what I pretend, to be True. But, were it so; Does he even <hi>attempt</hi> to shew that my Arguments do <hi>not conclude;</hi> and, by doing so, to preserve my Readers from the Mischief of Assenting to my <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious</hi> Doctrine? Methinks, his Charity to his Neighbour should oblige him to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi> this, at least: But, he begs their Excuse; he must not run to <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome</hi> Methods, and leave <hi>his own,</hi> which never yet fail'd him, and is, withall, so <hi>Easie.</hi> By which, every one will see, that his <hi>Policy</hi> is much greater than his <hi>Charity.</hi> After this, he surceases his Impugnation of my Arguments; and ends with calling them <hi>Cavils,</hi> which, he says, he has <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd formerly;</hi> but he neither <hi>tells</hi> his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor <hi>can</hi> tell him, <hi>Time,</hi> nor <hi>Place,</hi> when or where, he thus satisfy'd the Debt he ow'd him; and, therefore, the Obligation remains yet <hi>in Force.</hi> Then he says, I neglect his <hi>Observations,</hi> (the worthy Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102124:74"/>
of his profound <hi>Note-Book-Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,)</hi> which may sometimes (if they be Pertinent, and Authentick) be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a <hi>Conclusion;</hi> but can, with no Sense, be pretended fit to <hi>solve Arguments,</hi> or shew the Terms <hi>Unconnected.</hi> Besides, I have laid open, how Insignificant the Way of Observations or Experiments are, (when we are <hi>laying Grounds</hi> of Philosophy,) at the End of my Preface to my <hi>METHOD.</hi> He brings up all, with sounding his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Triumph over my Demonstrations, and then concludes it with a little Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Foolery, which are great Embelish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments through his whole Books; and, tells his Reader, like a right Solid Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, as he is, that the <hi>Mountains</hi> Brought forth, and were Deliver'd of a <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculus Mus.</hi> Yet, tho' he has, with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Agility, <hi>skipp'd over</hi> all those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations against his <hi>Appendix,</hi> at once, without either <hi>touching</hi> or <hi>mentioning any one</hi> of them; yet, he tells us, for all that, <hi>(p.</hi> 20.) very briskly, and confidently, <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicem meam, ab omnibus ejus ictibus sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam tectam, tuebor: I will defend my Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, safe and sound, against all his Assaults.</hi> And, in one Sense, he says very true; for, certainly, never did Man, in the World, make <hi>such</hi> a Defence against so many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations: One would think that, to <hi>avoid</hi> them all, and <hi>run away</hi> from them all,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102124:74"/>
is a strange Way of <hi>Defending</hi> them all. But, these <hi>Cartesian</hi> Methods of theirs can do more than <hi>Miracle.</hi> This Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his from <hi>performing</hi> one <hi>jot</hi> of what he had so <hi>largely promis'd,</hi> would be enough to make any Writer, but himself, lose his Credit utterly; and so it would <hi>his</hi> too, but that he is Proof against it, having <hi>none to lose:</hi> For, he has us'd us to it so often, that none now expects it. By the same <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Method,</hi> he leaps over my whole 4th <hi>Indication,</hi> without replying one Word to those most Important Objections: See his <hi>Censura, p.</hi> 36. where he gives them their Quick Dispatch, in <hi>Ten Lines,</hi> by virtue of the <hi>same</hi> Method; which deserves to be call'd, <hi>The New</hi> Cartesian <hi>Method of EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEDITION.</hi>

               <p n="74">74. In the self-same Method he answers my Demonstration, <hi>(Id. Cart. p.</hi> 127, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> which prov'd, the <hi>Cartesians</hi> had <hi>no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Knowing;</hi> my Five Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which shew'd their <hi>First Principle of Knowing</hi> (consisting in this, That <hi>the Soul had a Power to Elicit Ideas out of her self)</hi> was <hi>Contradictory</hi> to the <hi>First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of our Understanding; and <hi>Three</hi> more against the Insignificancy of the <hi>Occasional</hi> Impression upon the Nerve, whence, as they say, those <hi>Ideas</hi> come to be <hi>Elicited;</hi> and yet <hi>Three</hi> more, against the Pretence of Annexing such and such <hi>Ideas</hi> to such

                  <hi>Motions</hi> made upon the Nerve, by GOD's <hi>meer Will,</hi> as they <hi>pretended,</hi> but never yet <hi>prov'd.</hi> Now, this <hi>Expedite</hi> Way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering serves them as well for These, as it did for the Former; and is <hi>equally fit</hi> to solve all the Demonstrations in the whole World: 'Tis but calling them <hi>Trifles, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous Mice;</hi> and, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the Connexion of Terms in them, and all the Consequences deduc'd from them, tho' never so <hi>Strict,</hi> and <hi>Close,</hi> will fly quite <hi>asunder,</hi> and they are all <hi>shatter'd</hi> into <hi>Loose, Incoherent Talk,</hi> by the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Virtue of this All-answering, All-confuting Method.

But, What is become of these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegorical Propositions, all this while, into which I had reduc'd his <hi>Loose Ramble,</hi> as into the <hi>Principles</hi> which, I saw, lay at the bottom of his Respective Discourses, and grounded the several parts of them. I had collected them with much Exactness, and referr'd to the Places where it would appear, that they were the <hi>Foundations</hi> on which he built all his Incoherent and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificial Superstructures.

I was so far from <hi>Imposing</hi> them, that <hi>(Id. Cartes. pag.</hi> 111, 112.) I left it at his Choice, either to <hi>Grant</hi> or <hi>Deny</hi> them: If he <hi>Granted</hi> them, then he was to <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> them; If he <hi>Deny'd</hi> them to be his Sense, then I undertook to <hi>shew</hi> that he would, by <hi>doing so, overthrow</hi> all his <hi>own</hi> Doctrine which was <hi>Grounded</hi> on them: But, he will not so much as take Notice of <hi>any one</hi> of them; only, he tells his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they are <hi>Theses Fictitiae,</hi> and <hi>Fidelitate</hi>

However, if <hi>none of his,</hi> and, that therefore he could not <hi>Grant</hi> them, he might have <hi>Deny'd</hi> them: But he fore-saw the Consequence, and, that I could easily fix them upon him; and, that those Positions he had made use of for his Principles, were such <hi>Shameful Nonsense,</hi> that nothing could be more Opprobrious to him, than to be Convicted to have built all his Doctrine upon such Chimerical Grounds. He fore-saw too, that these scurvy <hi>Categorical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi> use to have some kind of <hi>Coherence</hi> in them, and so might hap to bring our Dispute into that abominable Way of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion;</hi> and, thence, might oblige him to bring <hi>Arguments</hi> to <hi>prove</hi> them; which would require much more Trouble, and Pains, than <hi>meer Saying</hi> would do; and, withall, would put him quite out of all his <hi>Friendly Methods,</hi> which had supported him hitherto, and were still his <hi>only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge:</hi> And, therefore, he very fairly and and prudently let them <hi>all</hi> alone; only, he tells us they are <hi>Fictitious,</hi> and <hi>Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Collected;</hi> and there's an end of them.

               <p n="77">77. Well, But the Question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there can be abstracted a Common Notion of a very notable Rationality from some <hi>Sort,</hi> or <hi>Kind</hi> of Men, which agrees to all <hi>them,</hi> and does not to another Sort, which are not, by their very <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> or <hi>Essential</hi> Constitution, near so Rational! If so, is not this all that is requisite to make a Sub-species? This being so, What says Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> to the Reason of it? Not a Word. Yet, he is never <hi>out,</hi> in <hi>his</hi> Way: For, as in the <hi>Preface</hi> to his former Book,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102124:79"/>
he did, upon this Occasion, instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to the Argument, give us a most Learned Discourse of all sorts of <hi>Dogs;</hi> of <hi>Generous</hi> Dogs, <hi>Clownish</hi> Dogs, <hi>Degenerate</hi> Dogs, <hi>Hunting</hi> Dogs, <hi>Hawking</hi> Dogs; which he says, (contrary to the Notion of all Mankind,) that they differ only in some <hi>Qualities,</hi> and not in <hi>Kind;</hi> So, he tells us here, of <hi>Lunar</hi> Men, <hi>Planetary</hi> Men, and <hi>Men before Adam.</hi> For which he had two Reasons; One is, to talk <hi>something,</hi> lest Men should think he is <hi>Nonplus'd,</hi> tho' it be not one tittle to the purpose, or, in the least concerns my Argument. The other is, Because he had laid up in Laven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those Pretty Collections in his <hi>Note-Book;</hi> and it was a thousand pities the World should die in Ignorance of them, or himself lose the <hi>Credit</hi> due to the <hi>great Sweat of his Brain,</hi> and most profound Learning, in <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Transcribing</hi> them.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102124:79"/>
we ought to <hi>believe</hi> them; and, in <hi>this</hi> Sense they condemn'd them, as they clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signify'd in their <hi>Censure.</hi> Now comes Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> and tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 130. <hi>Error ab Authore isto dicitur quicquid non exhibuit damnata illa olim</hi> Parisiis <hi>Terminorum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexio:</hi> J.

They condemn'd <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of Terms,</hi> even in the Mysteries; for, then they must condemn the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of Christian Faith: What they condemn'd, was, most <hi>expresly,</hi> the <hi>Necessity</hi> of our <hi>seeing</hi> this Connexion of the Terms in the Mysteries <hi>themselves,</hi> ere we ought to believe them; for, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, or evacuates, the <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> in which only, and by relying on which, we see such Propositions to be <hi>True,</hi> or, their Terms to be Connected. Again; Does he think there is no Connexion of Terms in other things, but only in these? Does not all the Truth in all the Sciences in the World; nay, all the Truth, even, in all our Discourses, consist in this, that the Terms of the Propositions do cohere in Sense, or are Connected? Does he think that I account all these to be Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours? Which if I do, I must deny all my own Arguments, and all my Thoughts, which are True. No, no; that's not the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102124:80"/>
Business. This would be a most prodigious piece of Ignorance. But, his cruel Feud against <hi>All Connexion,</hi> and, particularly, that in my <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> is so <hi>Deadly,</hi> and <hi>Implacable,</hi> that he would persuade the Reader that those <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>All</hi> Connexion of Terms <hi>whatsoever;</hi> nay, the very <hi>Way</hi> of Discoursing <hi>Connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly;</hi> that is, all the Deduced Truths, writ by all Scientifical Men in the whole World. This, I must confess, would be (tho' <hi>Shameful</hi> to them, yet) of <hi>vast Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> to himself; for, then he need not stand <hi>Solving</hi> my Demonstrations, for, in that Case, they would be <hi>solv'd</hi> to his hand; or rather, they were never <hi>Ty'd, Knit, or Connected.</hi> And, it would be a Second Advantage to him, that, in that happy Case, his Fancy might ramble at random, without any <hi>Control,</hi> or without being <hi>fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd</hi> and <hi>shackl'd</hi> by this cruel Tyrant <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,</hi> and by the severe Laws of <hi>Logick;</hi> which <hi>improve,</hi> and, by virtue of <hi>First</hi> Principles, <hi>shew</hi> this Connexion to be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such, and reducible to <hi>Self-Evidence.</hi> By which we see the Reason why his Friend <hi>Merry-man</hi> and himself are so uneasie, and Piqu't at my <hi>METHOD to Science,</hi> which advances and builds all along upon this <hi>Enemy</hi> to all these <hi>Cartesian Methods,</hi> this most abominable <hi>Proud</hi> and Arrogant U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper over his <hi>Ideas, CONNEXION.</hi>

As if <hi>Philosophers</hi> could not understand the Meaning of the Words themselves <hi>Use,</hi> without having recourse to Lawyers. However, this helps to shew he is an <hi>Universal Scholar,</hi> and informs the Reader, he has peep'd into <hi>Law-Books</hi> too; at least, into their <hi>Indexes;</hi> and, that he has <hi>glean'd</hi> thence some few Notes, to enrich his Common-place-book; to do which, he thinks a high Point of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

Now, in our Way of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, how easily are all these Speeches reconcil'd? For, Man being <hi>One Thing,</hi> all his Operations are <hi>Corporeo-Spiritual;</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:102124:81"/>
whence, our Direct Knowledge of Things coming in by our Senses, it is natural to say when we <hi>hear,</hi> that we <hi>know;</hi> since both are done at the same time, and by the same Compound Operation. Thus, when we <hi>see</hi> a thing, we say, we <hi>know it;</hi> all Mankind, till <hi>Cartesius</hi>'s Time, holding firmly, that we ought to trust our <hi>Eye-sight,</hi> and the other Senses, when the Power is not disabl'd from perceiving, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and the Medium are well propos'd, convenient, and well circumstanc'd. He has a worse Criticism upon the Word <hi>[Conceptus,] Conception;</hi> and this, for two Reasons; One, because we rather <hi>Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,</hi> than <hi>Comprehend;</hi> as if we did not hold our Conceptions to be <hi>Inadequate;</hi> and, by doing so, declare, that we do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by any one Conception, comprehend the <hi>whole Thing.</hi> The other Reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a <hi>Conception in the Womb is, Touch'd and Comprehended by it:</hi> Whence, he says, <hi>Visio</hi> sutes better with our Knowing a Thing, than <hi>Conceptio.</hi> I wish he would reflect on that Known Maxim, that the <hi>Common Use</hi> of Words gives them their Signification, whatever their <hi>Radix,</hi> or <hi>Derivation,</hi> Grammatically imports; and, that to be <hi>Conceiv'd</hi> by our Understanding, is the same as to be <hi>seen</hi> by it: So that <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio</hi> and <hi>Conceptio</hi> fall into the self-same Notion. What a Coil does he keep with

his Incoherent Criticism upon <hi>Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Lepor.</hi> Now, it signifies, Elegancy of Speech; then, Liberal Arts; then, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and Ridiculous Sports; then, Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility.

as we use it, when we say, We <hi>direct</hi> our Prayers to GOD, or a Letter to a Friend: But, Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> who is so little acquainted with any kind of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that he reflects not that the First Principle, that governs the <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>all Words,</hi> is the <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Obvious Use</hi> of them, which <hi>stamps</hi> the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, and makes it <hi>Current</hi> and Proper, finds strange Mysteries in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Word; and, as he formerly fear'd a silly <hi>Asterisk,</hi> or <hi>Star,</hi> left casually in the Context, was a Plot of mine, <hi>to run him thorow with those five Darts;</hi> so, now he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends I have some Stratagem upon him, for taking <hi>[Directus]</hi> in that <hi>plain Sense:</hi> Whereupon, he tells the Reader here, that I am <hi>Vir subdolus,</hi> a <hi>Crafty,</hi> or <hi>Subtile Man;</hi> and have some pernicious Meaning; but, let him alone, he will, in the end, turn it upon my self. Now comes his most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Criticism: First, he brings in the Phrase of <hi>Plautus,</hi> the Comedian; <hi>Abi di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte; Go your Ways, straight.</hi> Thence, he carries it on still <hi>farther,</hi> I know not how, to <hi>[Dierectè;]</hi> which Adverb comes not from <hi>Dirigo,</hi> but from an odd Obsolete Word, <hi>[Dierectus,]</hi> which his Brother-Criticks will tell him, comes from <hi>sub Dio erectus;</hi> that is, <hi>set up in the open Air,</hi> or <hi>Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beted.</hi> Where are we now? for, we are quite got out of the Signification of the Word
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102124:83"/>
                  <hi>[Directus,]</hi> which signifies <hi>[Directed.]</hi> But our Critick is not got half way to his Journey's end: For, from <hi>[Dierectus,]</hi> he carries it on to the Adverb <hi>[Dierectà;]</hi> which signifies, in English, <hi>[With a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief:]</hi> And, <hi>[Ito dierectà,]</hi> is an old Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression for <hi>[Go, and be hang'd.]</hi> Having brought it to <hi>Dierectus,</hi> the next thing he does, is, to bring <hi>Dierectus,</hi> by the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Letter, and putting in Another, to <hi>[Diarrectus:]</hi> whereas, no such Word is to be heard of in our Common Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, nor in the <hi>Lexicon Latino-Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:</hi> Yet, he had a Learned End in it, we may be sure; and 'tis this; He remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd there was a Greek Word [<gap reason="foreign">

who, Jokingly (as the Fashion was then, at some certain times,) would needs prove his Adversary, whose Name was <hi>Cooper,</hi> to have been Lineally Descended from King <hi>Pepin,</hi> by the like Gradation of Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms; alledging, that he was call'd <hi>[Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> quasi <hi>Hooper; Hooper,</hi> quasi <hi>Haper; Haper,</hi> quasi <hi>Naper; Naper,</hi> quasi <hi>Diaper; Diaper,</hi> quasi <hi>Napkin; Napkin,</hi> quasi <hi>Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin; Pipkin,</hi> quasi King <hi>Pepin.</hi> This, I say, is its only Parallel; only, this Youth did not ramble from one <hi>Language</hi> to another; nor did this, but only when <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Wit</hi> were expected: But, that a Grave Man (as he would be thought) should, in a Treatise where Philosophy and Solidity were expected, let so many pretended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations lie at his Door, <hi>demanding,</hi> and <hi>calling-out</hi> to him for an <hi>Answer;</hi> and spend a considerable part of his Reply so unseasonably, in such <hi>Fooleries;</hi> and, which is worse, (as appears by his Carriage,) think himself very Learned in Criticism all the while, (which shews he does it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,) makes him not reachable by that Sophister, or by any; but, to be a <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix,</hi> and only <hi>Self parallell'd.</hi> By this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Criticism, the Reader will easily see what a rare Interpreter of Scripture this Man would make, with his Acute Art of Criticizing, which can wire-draw <hi>quidli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet è quodlibet.</hi>

83. So far concerning his <hi>Criticisms:</hi> His other Fooleries, which, I believe, take up the fourth part of his Book, are Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: The best of them are so ridiculous, that it is a kind of Foolery in me to take notice of them. However, since I am to lay open all the <hi>New Cartesian Methods,</hi> I am oblig'd to give my Reader some few Instances of them, by which he may guess at the rest. A Friend of his told him, a <hi>Terrible Answer</hi> was coming out against him: This slight Occasion serves him for an Ironical Expression all over his Book; and, <hi>Terribilis Author, Terribile Responsum, Terribiles Falsificationes, Terribile Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> comes over and over, I believe, at least, a <hi>hundred</hi> times, in his <hi>Censura:</hi> Which I can liken to nothing so well as to some little, apish, wanton School-boy, blowing a Feather up and down in the Air, to make himself Sport. Yet, this does him more Service than all his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers. But, give me leave to tell him, that the Way of shewing it <hi>not Terrible,</hi> is, boldly to come close up to my Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, and solve them: But, he is so far from shewing any such <hi>honest Courage,</hi> that whoever reflects how he <hi>avoids</hi> them all, or <hi>over-leaps them,</hi> will see, that, tho' my <hi>Ideae Cartesianae</hi> was not <hi>so terrible</hi> as to <hi>fright</hi> him quite <hi>out of</hi> his Wits, yet, it has put him quite <hi>beside them;</hi> and, has made
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102124:85"/>
him skip aside into twenty <hi>Bogs</hi> and <hi>Quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> and <hi>Hiding-holes,</hi> to escape meeting with them. Should a Gentleman, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd to the Field, instead of <hi>Meeting</hi> and <hi>Grappling</hi> with his Adversary, run about, into all Companies, flouting at him for a <hi>Terrible Fighter,</hi> a <hi>Terrible Hector,</hi> a <hi>Terrible Swash-buckler;</hi> I fear, every Man would conclude, he was <hi>really,</hi> and indeed, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible</hi> to him, however he call'd him so in <hi>Mockery;</hi> and, that this <hi>Flouting</hi> him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving him the Satisfaction <hi>due,</hi> and <hi>expected,</hi> would scarce serve his Honour, or save him from the Imputation of a Coward. Then, every Errour in the Printing is charg'd upon me, as if I knew not how to write true Latin. Upon which, I am told, I <hi>break Priscian's Head,</hi> am an <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> and many such Civil Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Did I think such Toys worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I could requite him with enow of such Observations, in his late <hi>Scabrous,</hi> and (in some places) Unintelligible Piece. Then comes in <hi>Horace,</hi> to prove all my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are but <hi>Ridiculous Mice.</hi> Then, <hi>Arto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trogus,</hi> an Idle Fellow in <hi>Plautus,</hi> the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Comedian, is cited, to prove me <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd; [Perjuriorem hoc homine, &amp;c.

To understand which thorowly, and, that the Reader may see I neither flatter him, nor injure my self, upon whom he has laid so many false Aspersions; I am to give him Information of one main Point of <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>'s Doctrine; which is, That (no Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit being to be given to our Senses, but only to the <hi>Ideas</hi> which the Soul frames in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102124:86"/>
her self) our Judgment is not therefore <hi>True,</hi> because 'tis conformable to the <hi>Things</hi> without us; but, the Things are then to be judg'd <hi>True,</hi> or to be really <hi>thus</hi> or <hi>thus,</hi> when they are conformable to our <hi>Ideas:</hi> Whereas, the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> say, That we then judge <hi>True,</hi> when the <hi>Things</hi> are <hi>such</hi> as we judge them <hi>to be;</hi> and, that our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, except in some odd Circumstances, do not deceive us. Wherefore, since to <hi>Lye,</hi> is not barely to <hi>say</hi> a <hi>Falshood;</hi> for, a Man may do so very innocently, and yet, since he spoke to the best of his Judgment, be an Innocent and Good Man: but, to Lye, is to go against his own Thoughts, or Judgment: This being so, hence Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> may think, and say, (as he does in his Preface to his Reader,) that I spoke <hi>false</hi> when I objected that he had said I was <hi>in DEUM impius, Impious against GOD;</hi> for, his <hi>Ideas</hi> might inform him so: Whereas, <hi>I,</hi> neglecting his Way of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,</hi> and relying on this <hi>Fallacious Sense</hi> of mine, <hi>Eye-sight,</hi> seem'd to read those Words very plain in his former Preface, <hi>p.</hi> 38. <hi>l.</hi> 4. Thus he might read in my Books, by the Light of his <hi>Ideas,</hi> that I deny'd GOD was <hi>Primaria Causa,</hi> or the <hi>First Cause of Motion;</hi> whereas, I believing these false Senses of mine do find that I only deny'd he is the <hi>Immediate</hi> Cause of it; and, that he must therefore be the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:102124:87"/>
Cause, because he moves Matter by <hi>Second</hi> Causes, the <hi>Angels.</hi> Thus my Ears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming my Common Reason, of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage amongst Charitable and Good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, told me, that to call one <hi>Asinus ad Lyram, Talpa Caecior, Blasphemus, delirus, facie non satis honesta;</hi> and, that I <hi>spit at Heaven,</hi> and twenty such like Contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, were <hi>Virulent</hi> Expressions; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which, his <hi>Ideas</hi> might, for all that, tell him that they were (as he calls them here) <hi>Modest.</hi> So, my Eyes inform me, that I only put <hi>two Propositions</hi> in that place lately cited, and said <hi>expresly, No</hi> Determinate <hi>Conclusion could follow, out of them, from the Disposal of the Terms in a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism:</hi> But, his <hi>Ideas</hi> might tell him, I put <hi>three</hi> Propositions in both places, and, that there are no such Words as those now mention'd, which directly told him the true State of the Question; and, that therefore he had no reason to take notice of them. Lastly, By the same means it may come about, that his <hi>Ideas</hi> might tell him that I had said those very Words, <hi>[Providentia Divina me, ex Aliis omnibus, selegit.]</hi> And, the like may be said of all the other Falsifications I had <hi>Charg'd</hi> on him, and Multitudes of others, which (proceeding only by <hi>Instances)</hi> I had omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; whereas, these <hi>False</hi> and Fallacious <hi>Eyes</hi> of mine told me, there were no such
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102124:87"/>
Words in the places he cited for them, but quite <hi>contrary.</hi> So that, he and I might both of us <hi>mean</hi> to speak <hi>Truth;</hi> but, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>my Senses,</hi> or <hi>his Ideas,</hi> might <hi>delude,</hi> and <hi>deceive</hi> us: Which we ought to believe, is left to the Reader's Judgment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin. Besides, perhaps, he might think, as is <hi>Malbranche</hi>'s Method, (whom he so zealously defends,) that he saw all these things I object, in the <hi>Ideas</hi> which <hi>he sees in GOD,</hi> or fancies that he has a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> of it; and therefore, it had been <hi>Impious against GOD,</hi> not to believe, and do, as he did. Whence results this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary, That 'tis hard to fix any Ill In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention upon any High-flown, Seraphick <hi>Cartesian,</hi> lest we judge rashly of what he thinks he is assur'd of by Divine Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102124:88"/>
Execution, than any <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> Arguments they can hope to bring against me. Their Design (as their Managery of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test shews) is not to instruct the Reader, or <hi>Confute</hi> me; but, meerly to <hi>Despite,</hi> and <hi>Disgrace</hi> me: And, a Censure of my Doctrine by the <hi>Sorbon-Doctors,</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, back'd with <hi>Authority</hi> of the Chief Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Governors in that place, will, (as they hope) lay such a Load upon a Single Man's Credit, that it must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>sink</hi> under it. And, tho' the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Censure were in a Matter <hi>quite different</hi> from that of <hi>Cartesianism,</hi> (which was at first, and still ought to have been, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Question,) and therefore, is nothing at all to the <hi>Right</hi> purpose; it is, for all that, very much to <hi>their</hi> purpose; which is, to defame me; which blessed Project at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiev'd, they hope, by this Means, to raise such a Hubbub, and Noise, that the <hi>Quiet</hi> Force of my <hi>Intrinsecal Arguments</hi> will never be <hi>heard,</hi> or <hi>regarded;</hi> but, put to <hi>Silence,</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> by their <hi>Clamorous Out-cry.</hi> Besides; They judg'd, nothing could make their Calumny more <hi>Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> than to relate it confidently, as <hi>Plain Matter of Fact;</hi> and, to represent it as <hi>such</hi> a Matter of Fact, as already <hi>transiit in rem judicatam:</hi> Nor are they much concern'd whether it be <hi>True,</hi> or <hi>False;</hi> that is Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to such Resolute Men; so long as it

87. To understand more fully how this Business pass'd, we are to premise, that nothing is easier than to extract Words out of <hi>any Book,</hi> writ by a Christian; and then <hi>disguizing</hi> them, (by concealing the <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Tendency</hi> of the <hi>whole Book,</hi> the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Question,</hi> and the Immediate <hi>Antecedents</hi> and <hi>Consequents</hi> in those very places,) to make those Words, <hi>thus Extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>Exhibited,</hi> to speak perfect Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or worse. Take an Example: If, out of that Verse in the <hi>Psalmist, [The Fool hath said in his Heart, There is no GOD,]</hi> any one should extract those Words, <hi>[There is no GOD,]</hi> and propose them in a Paper, thus singl'd out, to any Learned Man, for his Judgment, not telling him they were found in a Book, where the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant</hi> Words, or the Circumstances, might, perhaps, give them quite <hi>another</hi> Sense; but, that it was in <hi>Theses,</hi> where every single Proposition stands alone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assisted by its Fellows, as to the declaring its Sense: Would any Christian, thus sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, stick to declare, that such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position was flat <hi>Atheism,</hi> and <hi>could not be explicated in a Christian Sense?</hi> This was my very Case. A certain Great Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick, who was of good Parts, but (as we are not all of us of the same Temper) of a High Spirit, Turbulent, (for which Reason, 'tis thought, he had been dismiss'd
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102124:90"/>
out of his Order,) and, withall, a Great Pretender to <hi>Policy,</hi> hapt to be at <hi>Paris,</hi> when I was also there. He pretended great Friendship to me, and extoll'd my Books highly; (as another Gentleman, now my greatest Adversary, has also done formerly,) and this in Print. But, it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately happen'd, that a certain Great Person, on whose Esteem he had set a high Value, did, very imprudently, to his Face, prefer my Writings before his; with some Undeserv'd Aggravations of the One, and Reflexions on the Other. This, tho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my being Accessary, in the least, to that Affront, quite Alienated his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship from me; and, he would needs make all those Books of mine, tho' of late so highly prais'd by himself, to be <hi>Heretical.</hi> At which time, some certain Gentlemen, who love to <hi>fish in Troubl'd Waters,</hi> and were not over-friendly to me, (one of whom, as I am told, had a Hand in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Merry-man</hi>'s <hi>Libel,)</hi> struck in with him; knowing, that a more fitting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to make Bustles could hardly be found. To carry on this Project then, Three Propositions were pick'd out of my Books; and so politickly contriv'd, that, partly by <hi>stifling</hi> the Knowledge that they were in any Book at all, partly by <hi>Adding</hi> to, and <hi>Altering,</hi> my Words, they plainly signify'd, that <hi>None was to believe,</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:102124:91"/>
unless they saw the Connexion of Terms, or (which is the same) had a <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>Science,</hi> of the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of Faith themselves: And, <hi>in this Sense,</hi> two <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> Doctors, thus cheated, <hi>condemn'd</hi> them; as my self, had I been thus over-reach'd, should have done; that Sense being both manifestly Heretical, and point-blank con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>my</hi> constantly avow'd Doctrine; as I shew'd manifestly, out of many signal and most express places, cited in my <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciae.</hi> This Censure being, by Stratagem, obtain'd, he flew about the Town, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Censure, and amplifying mightily upon my Imaginary Heresies: But, no Sollicitation could obtain of him a Copy of the Censure it self; lest it might come to my hands, and so enable me to defend my self, and detect the <hi>Falsity;</hi> so, being incapacitated to say any thing in my own Vindication, I never troubl'd my self at that which I could not help. About ten Days after, during which time his Envy took its full Swing, the two very Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Persons, Dr. <hi>Godden,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,</hi> Principal, or President, of the <hi>Scotch</hi> College, came to my Chamber, and thus, with some Resentment, accosted me: <hi>Sir, What do you mean? Are you stupid, that you sit studying here, Unconcern'd, when you are proclaim'd a Heretick all over the Town?</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>When I can get the Censure, and know</hi>

                  <hi>what is Objected, I am sure I can defend my self: In the mean time, 'tis Defence enough to let People know I cannot obtain the Equity of him to know my Fault.</hi> They reply'd, <hi>Tho' you dis-regard your Credit, we, that are known to be your Friends, resolve to be more careful of ours.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Barklay,</hi> taking Monsieur <hi>St. Amour,</hi> a <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctor, with him, to make his Quality known, went to the Chamber of Monsieur <hi>de S.

He, all amaz'd, reply'd, <hi>That he had Censur'd no Proposition in any Book, nor</hi> could <hi>in Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or Honesty, unless he had perus'd the Book it self; to be satisfy'd, by comparing it with the Scope of the Discourse, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining VVords, what Sense it must clearly and necessarily have.</hi> In the Nick comes in my Adversary, with the Censure in his Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket: <hi>VVell met, Mr.</hi> Barklay, says he; <hi>now your great Friend, Mr.</hi> S. <hi>is condemn'd of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, by this Learned Man. My Lord,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies Mr. <hi>de St. Beuve, I neither Censur'd his Person, nor any Proposition of his, unless he maintain'd those Propositions thus singl'd out, and exhibited, as you propos'd them in your Paper.</hi> Then Mr. <hi>Barklay</hi> begg'd he might have a Sight of the Censure; which was
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102124:92"/>
something unwillingly granted; yet, it could not be deny'd in such a Presence. Having perus'd it; <hi>Now, my Lord,</hi> says Mr. <hi>Barclay, to let you see, I am neither a Heretick, nor a Favourer of them, I will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe this Censure: More than that, I dare swear, Mr.</hi> S. <hi>will, at first sight, subscribe it too: For, the Sense here condemn'd, is quite Different from the whole Scope of his Books; which treat only of Demonstrating</hi> Praevia ad Fidem, <hi>and not at all of Demonstrating the</hi> Mysteries, <hi>or</hi> Points of Faith; <hi>nay, 'tis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly Opposite to his Doctrine, to say, they</hi> can be <hi>Demonstrated.</hi> At these Words, Monsieur <hi>de St. Beuve</hi> grew warmer with him; telling him roundly, <hi>Domine, calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dè &amp; artifieiosè mecum egisti, adeò ut suspicer <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

Doctors were astonish'd at this furious Transport; but, Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> being a Man of great Prudence, and never in Passion, <hi>Nay, my Lord,</hi> says he, <hi>I do not love to hear my self abus'd.</hi> So he takes a short Leave, and brings away the <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> with him; while the other, being in a high Passion, had forgot to re-demand it: Yet, he lingerd, unseen, not far off, till he saw my Adversary gone by; and return'd to the Doctor. and told him, he had got the <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Censure;</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to go to the Archbishop of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. He was heartily glad it was got from him, promising to go thither immediately, and to do me all the Right I could desire; and, affiaring him, the <hi>Censure</hi> should never come into his hands again. So my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest was granted, and I set to write my <hi>Vindiciae.</hi> In the mean time, we sent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to my Adversary; desiring to see the <hi>Censure;</hi> telling him, they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve such a sinister Report concerning me, unless they saw it with their own Eyes. Which put him (loath to say, his Passion had made him lose it) to a great Nonplus how to answer, and gave us much Divertisement.

The next Stratagem of our Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, (for, we expected new ones every Day,) was, to pick out of my Books no less than 37 Propositions, (with the same Honesty, we may be sure, as they did the former,) which they carry'd to the then.

Knaves did, who are said to have laid their Heads together, to pen this Libel: And therefore, pressing to have them sent to the highest Tribunal, to be Condemn'd with all speed, because my Heresie (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth!) spread far and near in <hi>England,</hi> and infected the whole Country. The Nuncio took them; but, being a Man of Wisdom, apply'd to my Lord Abbot <hi>Montague</hi> the next Morning, to know what strange Heresie this was, which, like a Cancer, spread so fast in <hi>England.</hi> Who, smiling, acquainted him at large with the Undeserved Feud of my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and my Innocency. The Nuncio sends for me the next Day, receiv'd me very kindly; told me, he understood how I was persecuted by some Adversaries of mine, and deliver'd me their <hi>Objections;</hi> desiring me to write an <hi>Answer,</hi> and he would do m the Equity to send up <hi>both together.</hi> Both which are printed in the Second Part of my <hi>Vindiciae.</hi> So this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Plot was defeated; and my Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners came off as shamefully as they did in the former: For, they could never gain the least Advantage upon me, if they did not surprize Great Men with False Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and prevent my Answering for my self.</p>

Their Friends there press'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of them with such a hurry, as if the whole Church had totter'd if it were not done quickly. To expedite the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, they earnestly sollicited him, that only that one Book <hi>(viz.</hi> Chancellor <hi>Hyde</hi>'s) should be read; and then, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin whether all the Books writ by such a pernicious Author, ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd. The Cardinal, without naming me, delivers them to a worthy Divine,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102124:99"/>
who understood English; bidding him <hi>Keep the rest, till call'd for, and read only this one;</hi> (pointing to that of the Chancellors, which they had signally particulariz'd to him,) and give him an Account of it as speedily as was possible; for, by that one, they could judge of the rest. What Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy now? Would not any Man swear now that all was Cock-sure? But, there is no Policy against God's Providence; which directed thither an <hi>English</hi> Divine, who had lately come out of <hi>England,</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the now Earl of <hi>Derwent-water,</hi> and his Brother, in their Travels. He being of Acquaintance with this Divine, came to visit him in the very nick of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and finding him very busie in reading that Decretory-Book, went to his Table, and took up some Books that he saw lie there together: Finding, to his Astonishment, they were <hi>mine,</hi> he ask'd him how they came by all Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s Books? The other told him, he was much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; and said, they <hi>could not</hi> be <hi>mine;</hi> telling him, they had a far other Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of me; whereas, the Book he was reading, which was (said he) writ by the <hi>same</hi> Author; could not possibly be writ by a Man of Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s Principles. Mr. <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> (for, that was my Friend's Name) knew the Book, and avow'd it was writ by another Author, whom he nam'd to

him. At which, the <hi>Roman</hi> Divine held held up his Hands with Admiration, at such a Knavish Contrivance. So, they agreed that Mr. <hi>Midford</hi> should go with him the next Morning, to Cardinal <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berin,</hi> to inform him what a Cheat was put upon him, to <hi>hasten</hi> him to judge of all <hi>my</hi> Books, by the Book of another, who was of another Judgment, and went upon different Principles. This was so <hi>Shameful,</hi> and <hi>Horrid,</hi> that, after this, not an Enemy of mine <hi>durst appear.</hi> Besides my <hi>Clypeus Septemplex,</hi> and <hi>Vindiciae,</hi> I had sent divers <hi>Apologeticks</hi> thither, explaining my Doctrine; which the <hi>Roman</hi> Divines examining, desir'd Mr. <hi>Midford</hi> to know of me, if my Occasions would let me come thither, to teach the same Doctrine there, I had printed in <hi>England.</hi> If I would, they would petition for a good Pension to maintain me. But, I was a greater Lover of my Studies in my <hi>Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> than I was of <hi>Courts.</hi> However, Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> and my then Opposers, may see by this, how I am <hi>Notus in Gallia,</hi> and <hi>in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi> The Malice of my Enemies (as GOD had order'd it) having done me more Kindness, and gain'd me more Honour, than all my Friends could ever have done.

                              <hi>A soft Answer breaks Anger; Harsh Speech stirs up Fury,</hi> says the Wise-Man. The Prophet also, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in GOD's Name, exhorts us <hi>to love TRUTH and PEACE.</hi> Both these Sayings, Honoured Sir, we ought to apply to our selves; at least, I account it my Duty to do so. Again, then, I return to you; again, I set upon you; not with a Mind full of Resentments, but, of real Friendship: Not out of an earnest Desire, and, perhaps, too sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Concern, to defend my own Fame; but, most ready to renew and repair Charity and Friendship a-fresh, already (alas!) too much violated. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, it struck me, and shock'd me exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, (and, no wonder,) that you should, without the least Offence done to your Person, who (as I thought) was still my Friend; but, out of a too fervent Zeal for the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Doctrine, which I impugn'd, and, perhaps, too easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded by others transported with the same Zeal, break out, in Print, into Contumelious Words, more than was Decent, against my Person, and my Christian Reputation. That Saying of King <hi>David, (Psal.</hi> 55.) came into my
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102124:103"/>
Mind; <hi>[If my Enemy had revil'd me, I could have born it—But, thou, my Friend and Acquaintance—who didst walk with me unanimously, in the House of GOD.]</hi> Thus, causlesly provok'd, I set to write my <hi>Defence:</hi> And, I wish I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd my self within the Bounds of a <hi>meer Defence,</hi> or <hi>Vindication:</hi> For, 'tis very hard for any Man who is <hi>roughly handl'd,</hi> and (as far as he was conscious to himself) <hi>without Cause,</hi> to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self within an <hi>Exact Mean.</hi> You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd; and, in your <hi>CENSURA,</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did your former Self, in Affrontive Language. What is now to be done? Must we still throw away our precious Time, and blur Paper with Angry <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partees,</hi> reciprocated endlesly? 'Twere most Ridiculous! At length, then, let us grow wiser, and return to our Right Temper. We are, both of us, Men; that is, <hi>Frail,</hi> and tainted with Original Sin; but, yet, (as I hope,) so pre-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd by Christian Principles that the Poyson will be thrown out before it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Vitals of our Soul. Nor, let our Readers laugh at us; Themselves too have some of the <hi>same Pitch</hi> sticking to them, and are made up of the <hi>same Mass</hi> of Corruption. And, perhaps, there are Few, who had not done the same we did, had they been in the same
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102124:104"/>
Circumstances, and had had the same Thoughts and Affections. None but the Enemy of Mankind (and his <hi>Imps)</hi> can have just Occasion to laugh at us; who hates Peace, and delights to sow and foment Dissension. Let us, in <hi>our</hi> turn, laugh too at that Wicked Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary; that he who digg'd a Pit for for others, may fall into it himself. Whatever Metaphysicians talk of their <hi>First Principles,</hi> and <hi>Highest Causes</hi> or <hi>Reasons,</hi> I am sure we are taught by far <hi>more Certain Principles,</hi> and <hi>Higher Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> establish'd, and commended to us by the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> that Brotherly Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is infinitely to be preferr'd before Philosophical Contests, or the Tenets of any Master, let him be who he will. We are <hi>Men,</hi> I say; and, thence, have suffer'd some <hi>Humane</hi> Imperfection: But we will let the World see, that we are <hi>such Men,</hi> as can correct in themselves whatever makes them <hi>less Men,</hi> or <hi>less</hi> Governable by <hi>Reason.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>You see then, my much-Honoured Friend, that even while I speak of <hi>Peace,</hi> I <hi>impugn</hi> you a-fresh, and renew my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test with you. Wherefore, look to your self; for, I denounce a <hi>New War</hi> to you, and send you a <hi>New Challenge;</hi> in which I will never yield the Victory. I am fully resolv'd to Attack you, not with
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102124:104"/>
                              <hi>Imaginary Darts,</hi> but with <hi>Fiery</hi> ones; to wit, with those of <hi>Charity;</hi> with which I will maintain the Combat, to my last Breath: Whatever your Friends talk of my <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Arrogancy,</hi> I bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proclaim, and boast, that I <hi>will</hi> have the <hi>Advantage</hi> in this Christian Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nay, I do openly brag, that (as far as yet appears to me) I have <hi>already</hi> won the Victory; by getting the <hi>Start</hi> of you in this War, (the Guerdon of which is a Crown, not of <hi>Aiery,</hi> but of <hi>Solid</hi> Honour,) by making thus the <hi>first Step</hi> to a Reconciliation: Unless, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, your self also had intended the <hi>same,</hi> had you not thought me to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory. If you profess you had the <hi>same</hi> Thoughts, then I must, indeed, confess, the Victory <hi>hovers</hi> doubtfully between us: But, if <hi>not,</hi> the Whole and Entire Triumph will be justly <hi>due</hi> to <hi>me.</hi> If you ask me the Reason of this forward Condescension; take for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that most Famous, and most Wise Saying, <hi>['Tis a greater Victory to conquer one's self, than to subdue the strongest Forts.]</hi> In which Sense, I shall not be <hi>asham'd;</hi> but, shall think it a <hi>High Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> to be call'd by your self, or any other, a <hi>Pyrgopolynices.]</hi>

95. I do not believe there is any Man in the World, who reads this Charitable Overture of mine, and considers all the Circumstances, but will both <hi>commend,</hi> and <hi>admire</hi> at, such an <hi>Unexpected,</hi> and <hi>Extravagant Condescension,</hi> and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on my part. Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> had been the <hi>Unprovok'd Aggressor;</hi> for, I had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him <hi>one</hi> Unhandsome Word, but only oppos'd some <hi>Cartesian</hi> Tenets, by way of <hi>Argument;</hi> when he, in requital of my Civility, fell upon me with the the most <hi>Virulent Language</hi> that ever was heard gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by (I will not say <hi>any Christian,</hi> but) even by any one <hi>Heathen,</hi> to <hi>another</hi> Tho' my Defence was <hi>Smart,</hi> yet I confin'd my Resentments, to oppose him only as an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious</hi> and <hi>Weak Writer;</hi> without imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, by blackening him as <hi>Impious against God,</hi> or <hi>Unsound in Faith;</hi> but still <hi>excus'd</hi> him in such Occasions. He had printed Infamous Slanders against my Books, writ for the <hi>Absolute Certainty of Faith;</hi> making my Doctrine in them <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd</hi> by <hi>Scrbonists, Retracted</hi> and <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd</hi> by <hi>my self;</hi> and, what not? He abetted a Known Libel, as a <hi>most True Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story;</hi> which makes me guilty of <hi>Twenty Heresies</hi> at least. Lastly, He had given me more <hi>Advantages</hi> against him, as a <hi>Scholar,</hi> in his <hi>Censura,</hi> than even my self could have <hi>wish'd.</hi> Yet, I was willing to pass by
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102124:105"/>
all these <hi>Highest Provocations,</hi> and <hi>lose</hi> all these <hi>Advantages,</hi> and <hi>(Unconstrain'd)</hi> to make the <hi>First</hi> Charitable Step to a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Accommodation; Requiring only, that he would make some Publick Satisfaction, not for any Reviling Words, or Slanders, against <hi>my Particular Person,</hi> (all which I was ready to pardon;) but, to wipe off the False Aspersions he had laid upon my <hi>Books</hi> writ for <hi>Faith,</hi> which reflected upon the <hi>Common Cause</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> to do which is the precise Duty of every Good Man: To promise which, notwithstanding, (by the way,) I could never learn he was <hi>Willing,</hi> or <hi>Inclin'd;</hi> Nor could I ever get any certain Light what he would do, or how far he would comply <hi>on his part.</hi> I had now finish'd about a Third Part of this <hi>Healing</hi> Reply, and had communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this <hi>Exordium</hi> of it to some Friends of his; who, I dare say, had acquainted him with my <hi>Peaceful</hi> and <hi>Friendly</hi> Intentions; when, as if done <hi>on purpose</hi> to <hi>prevent</hi> it, out comes <hi>Merry-man's LIBEL,</hi> contriv'd and fram'd by some <hi>Achitophel,</hi> (I leave it to the Reader to guess whom,) to render all Reconciliation <hi>Impossible;</hi> and, <hi>Tim'd</hi> so, as to be Publish'd just in the Nick, when I was expecting that <hi>Half-Sheet,</hi> which (as I had requested in my <hi>Non UL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRA)</hi> was to decide the whole Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, by way of <hi>PRINCIPLES.</hi> This made
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102124:106"/>
me see, that my Charity was requited with such a <hi>Rude Affront,</hi> that all the Malice in the World, put together, could scarce have invented any thing more <hi>Rancorous;</hi> and, that I was to content my self with my own good Intentions, and prepare for a <hi>Vigorous Defence.</hi> Which, also, was the reason why (putting a Stop to my <hi>Latin</hi> Treatise) I became oblig'd to reply in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> into which their Slanders were now brought; that so my <hi>Answer</hi> might be as Universally <hi>Read,</hi> and <hi>Understood,</hi> as Order had been taken their <hi>Calumnies</hi> should be: And, indeed, both Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> and the Libeller, very Brotherly conspire to slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Doctrine, as <hi>Condemn'd;</hi> or, which is the Word they do both of them affect, <hi>[Damn'd;]</hi> Whence, I saw plainly, that <hi>this</hi> Writing in English was Absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Necessary,</hi> and most proper to spread my Vindication, and make it more taken notice of.</p>
               <p n="96">96. I am to expect, that Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> and his Inspirer, will stoutly deny that they are <hi>Accessary</hi> to this Libel, or knew of it: 'Tis their <hi>Interest,</hi> as well as their <hi>Credit,</hi> to do so. That they did not <hi>pen</hi> it, I am apt to believe: Nor, is it Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to charge them positively with their <hi>Knowing</hi> it, <hi>Liking</hi> it, or (in their Way) <hi>Abetting</hi> it; unless I had Positive Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for it. But, yet, I must beg the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102124:106"/>
of them, to leave Thought <hi>Free:</hi> 'Tis best, in such Cases, to give my Reasons, and remit the <hi>Decision</hi> to the Judgment of <hi>Prudent</hi> Readers: For, First, I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learn, that any one Man in <hi>England</hi> spoke the least Word against those two Books of mine, till Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> and his Governor did so; and, this Libel visibly <hi>abets</hi> them, and carries on the same Cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Defaming</hi> of me: And, 'tis very hard to conceive, that one who <hi>assists</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, should not let him <hi>know</hi> what Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he is doing him; or, that the <hi>Assisted</hi> Person should not <hi>contribute</hi> to his Power, and <hi>help</hi> those who were so kindly helping <hi>him;</hi> or, that a <hi>Journey-man</hi> should go to work without the Knowledge of his <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal;</hi> especially, when he uses <hi>his</hi> Tools all the while, as <hi>Merry-man</hi> does Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi>'s <hi>Censura;</hi> out of which, the whole Libel is Extracted. Secondly, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, ere the Libel came out, by a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman (Mr. <hi>F. H.)</hi> that Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> had <hi>struck in</hi> with a certain Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick, who would joyn with him, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing me; which, all things consider'd, especially, their sympathizing in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both of them, of a Light, Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Genius,</hi> and, in their Aversion against me; makes it very Wonderful, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of, that <hi>Confederates</hi> should not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> their Designs, or <hi>confer</hi> their
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102124:107"/>
Notes, how to carry on their <hi>Common Cause.</hi> Thirdly, That Ecclesiastick spoke of, as siding with Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Person who is universally said to be, at least, the <hi>Parcel-Author</hi> (if not the only one) of that Libel. Now, that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in <hi>Affections</hi> (that is, in Disaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the same Person) should not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Concurrence in <hi>Action,</hi> when that Person is upon the Anvil, when they are both striking at him, and when the Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to run him down is already evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Taken by <hi>both;</hi> let any Man believe that <hi>can.</hi> Fourthly, 'Tis evident, that they do <hi>Mutuas operas tradere,</hi> or friendly assist one another. Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> (I fear, in this, made <hi>Foot-of-Whelp)</hi> hazards his Credit, in defaming my Books, as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd;</hi> and crying up <hi>Lominus</hi>'s Libel; so, to retrieve the Credit which was lost by a <hi>former Defeat:</hi> And, the Libeller, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Matter out of his <hi>Censura,</hi> and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choing aloud all those Slanders in <hi>English,</hi> manifestly <hi>abets him,</hi> and requites his Kindness; and yet, we must believe (to the Forfeiture of Common Sense) that all this <hi>lights by Chance,</hi> and not by <hi>Design,</hi> or <hi>Agreement.</hi> Sure, they think all Men are Fools, but themselves; or else, they <hi>Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly</hi> imagin, that while they <hi>hood-wink</hi> themselves, none <hi>can see</hi> them. Fifthly, The Opposing <hi>Cartesius</hi> would not bear
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:102124:107"/>
the weight of an Accusation in the High Court; whereas, the Magnifying <hi>Albius,</hi> who had given Disgust to them above, would easily, as they hop'd, if well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, and manag'd, be made Criminal, if they could but catch me in that Snare: But, it light unluckily to their Project, that (resolving to live quietly with my Neighbours, if I could; and, to carry on <hi>Truth,</hi> without giving <hi>Offence</hi> to <hi>any)</hi> I had not, so much as <hi>once, nam'd</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> in either of those two Books the Libeller is is so angry at; nor have I any Position there, <hi>peculiar</hi> to him alone; as I can easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew, when put to it. Wherefore, it was plotted to bring me, by <hi>Stratagem,</hi> to name Mr. <hi>White,</hi> with some handsome Character. To this End, Mr. <hi>Le-Grand,</hi> in his Railing Preface, <hi>p.</hi> 39. (by which we may see 'tis an <hi>Old Project,)</hi> challeng'd me, that I did <hi>[eradere Albium-ex albo Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophorum, &amp; in ludibria vertere;]</hi> that is, that I did <hi>blot Mr.</hi> White <hi>out of the Roll of Philosophers, and make a Mockery of him:</hi> And, I was blam'd by them, as proudly dis-regarding all others, and assuming all to my self. I might have smelt a <hi>Design</hi> in it, it being such Nonsense, that I should make a <hi>Mockery</hi> of a Man I had not so much as <hi>spoke of:</hi> But, I was too <hi>Candid,</hi> to give easie way to <hi>Suspicions.</hi> Upon which, hating to be held Guilty of such
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102124:108"/>
an <hi>Ungentileness,</hi> I made mention of him in my following Books, tho' under no other Character, but only that of a <hi>Great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,</hi> which his worst Enemies cannot refuse him. No sooner had I done so, and that he had drawn me into the Noose, but the <hi>Cloak</hi> was immediately pull'd off; and, the <hi>same</hi> Man who had lately seem'd so <hi>zealous</hi> for the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Albius,</hi> presently profess'd himself his greatest Enemy: He sets up, and abets <hi>Lominu</hi>'s Libel, which makes him Guilty of half the Heresies that have pester'd the World, from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Church; and, a Mark is set on every Man who has any Esteem for him, as a <hi>Scholar:</hi> And, I was told by a Right Reverend Bishop, that <hi>I had done my self a greater Injury, by speaking well of</hi> Albius, <hi>than I could imagin;</hi> as fore-seeing the Malicious Use they intended to make of this Fraudulent Trappan. All which, laid together, shews the Intimate Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence between Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> and the Libeller; and, to think that his Old Friend, who began all this <hi>Stir,</hi> would not joyn with him in this, and gather a few <hi>Twigs</hi> to help to <hi>lash</hi> me, were, to break the Sacred Bond of Friendship between them, and disoblige them both. Add, that Mr. <hi>Le Grand,</hi> according to his small Politicks, to gratifie his New Friend, picks Quarrels with me, in his behalf, by
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:102124:108"/>
making me say of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> (an Author he much esteems,) Bellarmine, <hi>Rationis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris, mentiris.</hi> Which, and divers such Passages, are too plain Evidences of their strict Confederacy; and, consequently, that he could not be ignorant of this Prop of his Cause, this Libel. His Hopes were, that the Libeller would bring in divers. Friends of his, to increase the Cry, and assist him with their Interest: But, I will not think them to have so little Charity, or so little Regard to Religion; or, to be so Imprudent, as to oppose a <hi>Veteran Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> for <hi>Faith,</hi> who meddles not with them; against whom they have nothing to say, <hi>Justly;</hi> and, who has already given good Proof, that, in case he be attack'd <hi>Unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> he is able to defend himself; nay, who is before-hand with them too, should they attempt it.</p>
               <p n="97">97. Against all these strong Proofs of their being <hi>Conscious</hi> of, and (in what they could) <hi>Abetting</hi> to this Libel, what can they bring for themselves? Oh! they <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> it: As if, either <hi>Affirming,</hi> or <hi>Denying,</hi> were such most Valid Arguments for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons speaking in their own Cause! Or, as if I (who was the Person concern'd) ought, in Prudence, to give any Credit to to the Words of those Men; one of which <hi>smil'd in my Face,</hi> and pretended great <hi>Friendship,</hi> when he was doing me all the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102124:109"/>
Mischief he could: The Other so falsifies my Words, and publishes such False and and Scandalous Slanders against my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Whence, that Objection is Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, which (for want of something else to say) is lately given about, that Things were about <hi>Composing,</hi> and I, upon Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion unjustly taken at this Libel, flew off; and, so <hi>continu'd</hi> the Difference, when it might have been <hi>heal'd.</hi> These Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are either <hi>Ill-inform'd,</hi> or <hi>very Partial;</hi> For, 1. <hi>He</hi> never offer'd Peace <hi>at all:</hi> 2. <hi>I</hi> offer'd it (as a Judicious Friend, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my Thoughts, had advis'd me) <hi>on these Terms; viz.</hi> Heartily to pardon and pass over all his Causless Revilings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>my Particular;</hi> only desiring, that the Injury done to the Common Cause should be <hi>Repair'd;</hi> to which I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear he would yield. Some cry <hi>[Pax, Pax; ubi non est Pax.]</hi> I had never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd the least <hi>Ingenuity</hi> on their side; and, I had been false to my self, to print my Condescending Treatise, and be laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at for my Foolish Charity; and, Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages be made of it, against my self. Nay, I ever reply'd, to those Good Men who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd it of me, that I would do any thing that could be thought reasonable; but, that I much fear'd, all our Charity would be lost, thro' Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi>'s being ty'd up by this New Engagement, and govern'd
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:102124:109"/>
by a Man who was an Enemy to all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>

It bears

for Title, <hi>[De Existentiâ Dei, &amp; Humanae Mentis Immortalitate, secundum</hi> Cartesii &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotelis <hi>Doctrinam, Disputatio.]</hi> This A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and Learned Author is thorowly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>Cartesius;</hi> and has so perfectly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested <hi>Aristotle;</hi> that he seems to have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him <hi>in Succum &amp; Sanguinem.</hi> He tells us, <hi>Cartesius</hi> attempted to Demonstrate <hi>these two</hi> Points, because he was (I believe, Unjustly) suspected to hold <hi>neither of them.</hi> He refutes his Definitions of <hi>[Cogitatio, Idea, Sustantia, &amp; Mens:]</hi> As also, his Notion of <hi>[Corpus, Materia, Extensio, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sica, &amp;c.]</hi> He shews his <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> to be Faulty; and, his Notion of <hi>Real Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,</hi> to be Groundless. He sifts all his Seven <hi>Postulatums,</hi> his Ten <hi>Axioms,</hi> and all his pretended Demonstrations of those Two most Important <hi>Theses;</hi> and, shews them to be <hi>Shallow,</hi> and <hi>Spurious.</hi> Lastly, In his Second Part, he <hi>Domonstrates</hi> those main Points, by the Principles of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Tho' a School-man, (indeed, the Best of our Modern ones, I have seen,) and, for being such, ought to have some Grains of Allowance granted him; yet, he avoids School-Terms as much as is possible. His Style is Concise, and yet Clear. His Oppositions and Solutions (generally) <hi>Forcible,</hi> and <hi>Full.</hi> He lights, frequently, into the same Arguments I do; and, very often falls into my Abominable

Sin, (which so mads my two <hi>Cartesians,)</hi> of telling his Reader, and <hi>shewing,</hi> that the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Doctrine is strangely FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATICAL. I thought fit to acquaint our Country-men with the Just Character of that Learned Book; than which, I know none more Proper for those of our Universities, after they have pass'd their <hi>First Studies;</hi> as well for the Excellency of the two Noble Truths it demonstrates, as for giving them great Light to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Nature</hi> of True <hi>Demonstration,</hi> and and into the Right Understanding of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>'s Genuin Doctrine; so much mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by most of our Unskilful Modern Commentators.</p>

I did not seem to deny even <hi>This,</hi> but upon Supposition that it would put an Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute in GOD, which was unworthy of <hi>Him.</hi> 3.

Du Hamel;</hi> the <hi>Best</hi> Philosopher of the <hi>Cartesian</hi> School, tho' he be none of the <hi>Fierce,</hi> or <hi>Furious</hi> ones; who, in <hi>Tom</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 8. says, <hi>Substantiae An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibilatio aliquid Inconstantiae in ipso rei Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditore testari videtur: The Annibilation of a Substance</hi> (or Thing) <hi>seems to testifie some Inconstancy in the Maker of the Thing, Himself:</hi> Which, certainly, is a <hi>Dishonour,</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection;</hi> and, cannot be attributed to GOD. The Sense of that Position, as far as concerns the Generality of Christians, who are no Speculators, is, that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures should not be held, to subsist of themselves; but, to depend entirely, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Moment, on GOD, for their <hi>Being.</hi> Now, let us consider how I had exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all other Writers, in Asserting that <hi>Substantial Truth.</hi> Others use to say, that the Nature of Creatures is <hi>Indifferont</hi> to <hi>Being,</hi> and <hi>Not-Being:</hi> Whereas, <hi>(Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to Science, p.</hi> 304.) I maintain, that, <hi>[Were there any Inclination in Creatures, rather to One, than the Other, it seems to be, rather to</hi> Not-Being, <hi>than to</hi> Being;] And, that <hi>[the</hi> Nothingness <hi>of Creatures is so radicated in their Natures, and sticks to them, that it inclines them to</hi> Not-Being,

Whether this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of mine be more for the Honour of our Great Creator, and for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Dependence on <hi>Him;</hi> or Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi>'s, in his <hi>Censura, p.</hi> 71. who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that Creatures would, out of their own <hi>Defectiveness,</hi> or <hi>Indigent</hi> Condition, fall to <hi>Nothing,</hi> or be Annihilated; and says, that <hi>every thing,</hi> as far as is <hi>of it self, would remain in the same State;</hi> let In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Divines judge. Nay, he says this, in Opposition to me, when I affirm, that all Creatures depend on GOD, for their <hi>Continuance in Being.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there needs many Grains of Salt, to make such Doctrine as this sound well to a Christian's Ear: For, this destroys the Doctrine of <hi>Suspension</hi>'s being the Cause of Annihilation; in regard he makes the Creature <hi>still,</hi> of its <hi>own Nature,</hi> able to <hi>Exist alone,</hi> after it is once put to be; which, I am sure, takes away its <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Dependence on GOD, for its Being;</hi> which is both against the <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> Yet, I doubt not, but his Intention is very <hi>Orthodox,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his <hi>Ideas</hi> are.</p>
