            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT
honourable, Edward, Lord
Russell, Earl of Bedford,
grace and peace be
multiplied.</head>
            <p>RIGHT honourable, if you consider
what is one of the cheife ornaments
of this noble state, vnto which God
hath aduanced you: It will appeare, that
there is none more excellent, then the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of grace and praier. For what doth your
heart affect? would you speake the langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?
Behold, by praier you may speake the
most heauenly toung that euer was, euen
the language of Canaan. Would you haue
the valor of knighthood? By praier you may
stand in the place where Gods hand hath
made a breach, and do as much as all the
Chariots &amp; horsmen in a kingdome. Would
you enjoy Gods blessings which you want?
By praier, you may (as it were) put your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
into the cofers of Gods treasures, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riche
your selfe. Do you desire the fauour of
Monarks and Princes? By praier you may
come in presence, and haue speeche with
<hi>Iehoua</hi> the King of heauen and earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lastly,
<pb facs="tcp:14012:3"/>
would you knowe, whether now liuing, you
be dead, that being dead you may liue for
euer? By praier a man may knowe, whether
he be dead to sinne, dead to the world, liue
to God, liue to Christ, and liue eternally.</p>
            <p>Praier then, being so excellent a point of
Religion: I am imboldened to commend
this small treatise your honour: not so
much for itselfe, as because it doth set out
the matter and true maner of inuocation
of Gods holy name. And I hope for your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
in accepting of it: the rather, because
I doubt not but your desire is to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to your most honourable, and for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
most worthie ancestors, in the care of
maintaining and countenancing any good
thing, that may any whit serue for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of the gospell of Christ.</p>
            <p>Now Iesus Christ our Lorde, and God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the Father which hath loued vs and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs euerlasting consolation, and good
hope through grace, stablish your Honor in
euerie good word and worke to the end.</p>

               <bibl>Matth. 6. ver. 9.</bibl>
               <q>After this maner therefore pray yee,

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He occasion, and
so also the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
of these
wordes with the
former is this.
The Evangelist
Matthew, setting
downe the Sermons and sayings
of our Sauiour Christ, keeps not
this course, to propounde euery
thing as it was done or spoken:
but sometime he settes down that
first, which was done last, and that
last which was done before: accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14012:4"/>
as the spirit of God directed
him. Which thing is verified in
these wordes; where the praier is
mentioned, yet the occasion wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
our Sauiour Christ taught his
disciples to pray, is not here speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
But in Saint Luke. 11. verse 1.
the occasion of these wordes is
euident. For there it is said, that
the disciples of our Sauior, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Iohn taught his disciples
to pray, made request to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
that he would do the same to
them likewise.</p>
            <p>These few words, set before the
praier are a commandement; and
it prescribes vnto vs two duties;
the first, to praie, the second, to
pray after the manner following:
Touching the first point, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
verie fewe among the people
know how to pray aright, we must
learne what it is to pray.</p>
            <p>To make praier, is to put vp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
to god, acording to his word
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14012:4"/>
from a contrite hart in the name
of Christ, with assurance to bee
hard.</p>
            <p>For the better opening of these
words, we are to consider six que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.
The first is, to whome wee
are to pray. The answer is to God
alone: Rom. 10. 14. <hi>Howe shal they
cal on him in whome they haue not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued,
&amp;c.</hi> Marke how inuocation
and faith are linked together; And
Paules reson may be framed thus.
In whome we put our affiance or
beleif, to him alone must we pray;
but we beleue only in God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee must onely praie to him.
As for Saints or Angels, they are
in no wise to be called vpon: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not the least title of Gods
worde prescribes vs so to doe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot heare our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and discerne what are the
thoughts and desires of our harts:
and because invocation is a parte
of diuine worship, and therefore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14012:5"/>
peculiar to God alone.</p>
            <p>The second question is, what
kinde of action prayer is? <hi>Answer:</hi>
it is no lip-labour, it is the putting
vp of a sute vnto God, and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is peculiar to the verie hart
of a man. Rom. 8. 26. <hi>The spirite
makes request for vs:</hi> But how? <hi>with
grones in</hi> the hart. Exod. 14. 15. The
Lord said to Moses, <hi>Why criest thou?</hi>
Yet there is no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made that
Moses spake any word at all: the
Lorde no doubt, accepted the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
mourning and desire of his
hart for a crie.</p>
            <p>The third question is, what is
the forme or rule, according vnto
which we are to pray. <hi>Answer.</hi> It is
the reueiled wil and word of God.
A man in humbling his soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, is not to pray as his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
carrie him, and for what
he list<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all is to be done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the expresse worde. So as
those things which God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14012:5"/>
vs to ask, wee are to aske,
and those thinges which hee hath
not commanded vs to ask, we are
in no wise to pray for. 1. Iohn. 5.
14. <hi>This is the assurance vvhich vvee
haue of him, that if wee aske any thing
according to his will hee heareth vs.</hi>
This then is a speciall clause to be
marked, that men must praye in
knowledge, not in ignorance. Here
weigh the case of poore ignorant
people: they talke muche of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for themselues &amp; others, they
imagine that they pray verie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutlie
to God, but alas, they doe
nothing les: because they knowe
not what to ask acording to Gods
will. They therefore must learne
Gods worde, and pray according
to the same; else it will prooue in
the end, that all their praying was
nothing but as mocking and flat
dishonoring of God.</p>
            <p>The fourth question is, with what
affection a man must pray. <hi>Answer.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:14012:6"/>
Prayer must proceed from a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and contrite hart. This is the
sacrifice which God accepteth.
Psalm. 51. verse. 17. When Ahab a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based
himselfe, though he did it in
hypocrisie, yet God had some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
vnto it. 1. King. 21. verse 29.
Saith the Lorde to Eliah, <hi>seest thou
how Ahab is humbled before me?</hi> This
contrition of heart stands in two
thinges. The first of them is a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feeling of our own sinne, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and wretched estate; howe that
we are compassed about with inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
enemies, euen with the
Deuill and all his Angels, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a bound, even with huge seas of
wants and rebellious corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
whereby we most grieuouslie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
God, &amp; are vile in our own
eies. Being therefore thus beset on
euerie side, wee are to be touched
with the sense of this our gret mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.
And he that wil pray aright,
must putte on the person, and the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14012:6"/>
verie affection of a poore wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
begger: and certainely not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grieued with the rufull condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in which we are in our selues,
it is not possible for vs to pray ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.
Psalm. 130. verse 1. <hi>Out of
the deepes I called vpon thee, O Lord:</hi>
that is, when I was in my greatest
miserie, and as it were, not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the gulfes of hell, then I cried to
God. Isai. 26. 16. Lord, in trouble
haue they visited thee: they pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out a prayer when thy chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
was vpon them. 1. Sam. 1. 15
<hi>I am a woman</hi> (saith Anna) <hi>of an hard
spirite:</hi> that is, a troubled soule, <hi>and
haue powred out my soul before the lord</hi>
Hence it appeareth, that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
praiers of most me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greuously
displease God, seing they ar made
for fashion only, without any sense
and feeling of their miseries: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
men come with the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
in ostentation of their integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and they take greate paines
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14012:7"/>
with their lips, but their harts wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the Lorde. The second
thing required in a contrite hart,
is a longing desire and hungring
after Gods graces and benefites,
whereof we stand in need. It is not
sufficient for a man to buckle as it
were, and to go crooked vnder his
sinnes and miseries; but also, hee
must haue a desire to be eased of
them, &amp; to be enriched with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
needefull. Thus Hezekias the
king, and the Prophet Isaiah the
Sonne of Amos praied against Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacharib,
and cried vnto heauen,
2. Chron. 32. 20. Where wee may
see what a maruelous desire they
had to obtaine their request. So
also Rom. 8. 26. <hi>The spirite maketh
request with grones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so greate, that they
cannot be vttered,</hi> as they are felte.
Dauid, Psalm. 143. 6. saith, that <hi>hee
desireth after the Lorde, as the thirstie
land.</hi> Now we know that the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
partched with heat, opens it selfe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14012:7"/>
in rifts and cranies, and gapes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heauen, as though it would
deuoure the cloudes for want of
moisture, and thus must the hart
bee disposed to Gods grace till it
obtaine it. The people of Israel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in grieuous affliction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How do
they pray? <hi>They powre out their souls
like vvater before the face of the Lord.</hi>
Lam. 2. vers. 19.</p>
            <p>The fift question is, in whose
name praier must be made. <hi>Answer</hi>
It must not be made in the name
of any creature, but onely in the
name and mediatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ. Ioh.
14. ver. 14. <hi>If yee ask any thing in my
name, I will do it.</hi> A man is not to
present his prayers to God, in any
worthines of his own merites. For
what is hee? to make the best of
himself, what can he make of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?
by nature he is no better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the verie firebrand of hell, and of
all Gods creatures the most out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
rebell to God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14012:8"/>
cannot be heard for his own
sake. As for Saints, they can be no
mediators, seing euen they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in heauen, are accepted of
God not for themselues, but only
for the blessed merites of Christ.
<hi>If any man sinne</hi> (saith S. Iohn. 1.
Epistle. chap. 2. verse 1.) <hi>Wee haue
an Aduocate with the Father, Iesus
Christ:</hi> But how proues he this? It
followes then, <hi>And hee is the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
for our sinnes.</hi> His reason
stands thus: he which must bee an
aduocate, must firste of all be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
for vs: no Saintes can
be a reconciliation for vs: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no Saints can be Aduocates.
Therfore, in this place is manifest
an other faulte of ignoraunt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
They cry often, Lord help me,
Lorde haue mercy vpon me. But
in whose name pray they? poore
soules like blinde bayardes, they
rush vpon the Lord; they know no
mediatour, in whose name they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14012:8"/>
should present their praiers vnto
him. Little do they consider with
themselues, that God is as well a
most terrible Iudge, as a mercifull
Father.</p>
            <p>The sixt question is, whether
saith be requisit to prayer or not.
<hi>Answere.</hi> Praier is to be made with
faith, whereby a man may haue a
certaine assurance to be heard. For
he that praieth, must stedfastly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that God in Christ will gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
his petition. This affiance being
wanting, it maketh praier to bee
no praier. For how can be pray for
any thing effectually, who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
whether he shall obtaine it or
noe. Wherefore, it is an especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
pointe of prayer, to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that God to whome praier
is made, not onely can, but also
will graunt his request. Marke 11.
24. Whatsoeuer yee desire vvhen yee
praye, beleeue that yee shall haue it,
and it shall bee doone vnto you.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14012:9"/>
Here we see two thinges required
in praier; the first, a desire of the
good thinges which we want, the
second is faith, wherby we beleue
that God will grant the thinges
desired. The ground of this faith,
is reconciliation with God, &amp; the
assurance thereof. For vnlesse a
man be in conscience, in some me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
perswaded, that al his sinnes
are pardoned, and that hee stands
reconciled to God in Christ, hee
cannot beleeue any other promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
reuealed in the word, nor that
any of his praiers shall be heard.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the definition of
praier; now let vs see what vse may
be made of this commandement,
<hi>Pray yee thus.</hi> Seeing our Sauiour
commandeth his Disciples, and so
euen vs also to praie to God; it is
our dutie, not only to present our
praiers to God, but also to doe it
cheerefully and earnestlie. Rom.
15. 30. Also, brethren I besech you
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14012:9"/>
that yee woulde striue with me by
praiers to God for me. What is
the cause, why the Lord doeth oft
defer his blessings after our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
No cause, but that hee might
stirre vs vp to be more feruent, &amp;
more earnestly to crye vnto the
Lord. Exod. 32. 10. When Moses
praieth to God in the behalfe of
the Israelites, the lord answers, <hi>Let
me alone,</hi> as though his praiers did
bind the Lord, and hinder him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
executing his iudgments. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is good aduise, for all
Christian men to continue and to
be zealous in praier. If thou be an
ignorant man, for shame learne to
praie; seeing it is Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
make conscience of it. We
see that there is no man vnlesse he
be desperatly wicked, but wil mak
some conscience of killing &amp; stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
and why is this? because it is
Gods commandment; Thou shalt
not kill, thou shalt not steale. Well
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14012:10"/>
then; this also is Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
to pray. Let this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
breed in thee a conscience
of this dutie: and although thy
corrupt nature shall drawe thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from it, yet striue to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and know it certainely, that
the breach of this command, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
thee as well guiltie of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
before God as any other.
Furthermore, this must be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
to prick thee forward to this
dutie, that as God commandes vs
to pray, so also he giues the spirite
of praier, whereby the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
is made easie vnto vs. If
the Lord had commanded a thing
impossible, then there had bene
some cause of discourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but
commanding a thing through the
grace of his spirite, verie easie and
profitable: howe much more are
we bound to the obedience of the
same? Againe, praier is the key
whereby wee open the treasures
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14012:10"/>
of God, and pull downe his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
vpon vs. For as the preaching
of the word, serues to declare and
to conuey vnto vs Gods graces:
so in praier we come to haue a liue
lie feeling of the same in our harts.
And further, this must moue vs to
praier, seeing in praier we haue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie
with Gods Maiestie. It
is an high fauour for a man to bee
familiar with a Prince; howe much
more then, to be familiar with the
King of Kings, the mightie Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah?
This then can bee no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
or trouble vnto vs, being one
of the many prerogatiues that
God bestowes on his Church. For
in the preaching of the worde, it
pleaseth God to talke to vs; and
in praier, God doth vouchsafe vs
this honour, to speake, and as it
were, familiarly to talk with him,
not as to a fearful Iudge, but as to
a louing and mercifull God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
also, that praier is a worthie
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14012:11"/>
means of defence, not onely to vs,
but also to the Church, and them
that are absent. By it Moses <hi>stood in
the breache,</hi> which Gods wrath had
made into the pepill of Israell, and
staied the same, Psalm. 106. ver. 23
by this Christian men fight, as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
champions, against their own
corruptions and all other spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
enemies. Ephes. 6. vers. 18. Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
were it to shewe, howe many
blessings the Lord hath bestowed
on his seruaunts by prayer. In a
worde, Luther, whome it pleased
God to vse as a worthie instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
for the restoring of the Gospell,
testifieth of himselfe, that hauing
this grace giuen him; to call vpon
the name of the lord, he had more
reuealed vnto him of Gods trueth
by praier, then by reding &amp; study.</p>
            <p>The second point of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
is to pray after the maner
following in the Lordes prayer.
Where it is to bee noted, that the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14012:11"/>
Lords prayer is a direction, and as
it were, a sampler to teach vs, how
and in what maner wee ought to
praie. None is to imagine that we
are bound to vse these words only
and none other. For the meaning
of Christ is not to binde vs to the
words, but to the matter and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and to the like affections in
praying. If this were not so, the
praiers of Gods seruants set down
in the bookes of the old and newe
Testament, should be al faultie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they ar not according to the
wordes of the Lords praier. Also,
by reason of this, diuers in our
church, ignorantly perswade them
selues that it is vnlawfull to vse the
wordes as they are set downe for a
praier. First (say they) it is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore not to be vsed
as a prayer. I answer, that the same
thing may be the scripture of god,
and also the praier of man; else the
praiers of Moses, Dauid and Paul,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14012:12"/>
being set downe in the scriptures,
cease to be praiers. Againe (they
say) that in praier we are to expres
our wantes in particular, and the
graces which wee desire: nowe in
these wordes all things to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for, are onely in generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
I answer, that the maine
wants that are in any man, and the
principall graces of God to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
are set downe in the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this praier, in particular.
Thirdly, they pleade that the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
to make al praiers by, should
not be vsed as a praier. I answere,
that therefore the rather it may
be vsed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a praier; and sure it is,
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ancient and worthie diuines
haue reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced it as a praier; cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
rather to vse these words then
any other, as <hi>Cyprianus sermone de o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.
Dominic. And Tertullian lib. de
fuga in persequutione. And Augustine
sermone</hi> 126. <hi>de te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pore.</hi> Wherfore, the
opinion is ful of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; error.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:14012:12"/>
Well, whereas our Sauiour first
giues a commaundement to pray,
and then after giueth a direction
for the keeping of it, this he doeth
to stiree vp our dulnes, and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
vs by all meanes to this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
exercise of praier: Wherfore
still I say, imploy your selues in
praier feruently, and continually;
and if you cannot do it, learne to
praye. Thus much of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of our Sauior Christ:
nowe followe the wordes of the
praier.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Our Father which art &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THese wordes containe three
parts, 1. a preface, 2. the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
it self, containing six petitions.
3. the testification of faith in the
last worde: <hi>Amen.</hi> Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be short, yet it doth not
containe the smallest point in the
praier: It is (I say) a testification
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14012:13"/>
of our faith, whereas the petitions
that go before, are only testificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our desires. Nowe of these
three parts in order.</p>
               <p>We must consider how our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ, doth not set downe
the petitions abruptly, but he first
beginnes with a solemne preface.
Whereby we are taught this lesso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
that he which is to pray vnto God
is first to prepare himselfe, and not
boldly without consideration, as
it were, to rushe into the presence
of God. If a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be to come before
an earthly Prince, hee will order
himselfe in apparel, gesture, and
words, that he may do all thinges
in seemelines &amp; dutiful reuerence:
how much more are men to order
themselues, when they are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before the liuing God? Eccle.
5. 1. Be not rash with thy mouth, &amp;
let not thine hart be hastie to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a thing, before the Lord. And
Dauid Psal. 26. 6. <hi>Washed his hands
<pb facs="tcp:14012:13"/>
in innocencie,</hi> before he came to the
Altar of the Lord to offer sacrifice.</p>
               <p>The meanes whereby men may
stir vp their dul and heauie hea<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,
and so prepare themselues to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
are three. The first is, to read di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
the word of God, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
those matters, about which
they are to pray; and what then?
this will be a meanes not onely to
direct him, but also to quicken the
heart more feruently to deliuer
his praier. This is euident by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.
The beames of the sunne
descending, heat not before they
come to the earth, or some solide
body where they may reflect; and
then by that means the earth and
aire adjoyning is made very hote:
euen so the Lord sends downe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs his blessed Worde, euen as
beames and the goodly sunshine,
&amp; thereby he speaks to our harts:
now, when we make our praiers of
that which we haue reade, Gods
<pb facs="tcp:14012:14"/>
worde is as it were reflected, and
our heartes are thereby warned
with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable heat of Gods
holy spirit, to powre out our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God more feruently. The
second meanes is to pray to God,
that hee would strengthen vs with
his spirit, that we might be able to
pray, as it is practised. Psalme 143.
1. The third meanes, is the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Gods most glorious
maiestie; wherin we are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
first, his fatherly goodnes and
kindenes, whereby he is willing, &amp;
secondly his omnipotencie, where
by he is able to grant our requests
One of these emboldned the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par
to pray. <hi>Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thou wilt, thou
canst make me cleane.</hi> Mat. 8. 2. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
both together are more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall.</p>
               <p>Nowe let vs come to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
it selfe, <hi>Our Father vvhich art
in heuen.</hi> It contains a descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
the true <hi>Iehoua,</hi> to whom we pray;
<pb facs="tcp:14012:14"/>
and that by two arguments, the
first is drawen from a relation, <hi>Our
Father:</hi> the second is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
subiect or place, <hi>Which art in heuen.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">

               <div n="interpretation" type="subpart">
                  <head>1. The meaning.</head>
                  <p>IN the opening of this word, or
title of God, two questions are
to be opened.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether by this title <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
is signified the whol Trinitie,
or some one person thereof. <hi>Ans.</hi>
Otherwhiles this name is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to all the persons in Trinitie,
or any of them. Malac. 2. 10. <hi>Haue
we not all one Father, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 3. 38.
<hi>Which was the sonne of Adam, which
was the sonne of God.</hi> And in Isai. 9. 6
christ is called the <hi>father of eternitie</hi>
because al that ar truly knit to him
and born a new by him, they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
made the sons of God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
oftentimes it is giuen to the
first perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in trinitie, as in those pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces,
where one person is conferred
<pb facs="tcp:14012:15"/>
with another. And so in this place
principally for some speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
this title agrees to the first
person. For first he is the father of
Christ, as he is the eternall worde
of the father, and that by nature,
because hee is of the same essence
with him: Secondly, he is father to
Christ, in respect of his manhood,
not by nature or adoption, but by
personall vnion, because the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature doeth subsist in the
person of the word. Thirdly, hee is
a father to all the faithfull by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
in Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Question.</hi> Whether we are to
pray to the Sonne and holy Ghost
as to the Father. <hi>Ans.</hi> Inuocation
belonges to all the three persons
in Trinitie, and not only to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Act. 7. 59. Steuen praieth, <hi>Lord
Iesus receiue my spirit.</hi> 1. Thes. 3. 2.
<hi>Now God our father, and our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, guide our iourney vnto you.</hi>
2. Cor. 13. 13. <hi>The grace of our Lord
<pb facs="tcp:14012:15"/>
Iesus Christ, the loue of God, &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the holy Ghost be vvith you.</hi>
Some say, this praier is a perfect
platforme of all praiers: and in it
wee are taught to direct our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to the Father, not to the Son
or holy spirit. I answer, the Father,
Sonne, and holy Ghost are three
distinct persons, yet they are not
to be seuered or diuided; because
they al subsist in one and the same
Godhead or diuine nature. And
further, in all outward actions, as
in the creation and preseruation
of the world, and the saluation of
the elect, they are not seuered or
deuided, for they al work together
onely they are distinguished in the
maner of working. Now if they be
not deuided in nature or operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then they are not to be seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in worship. And in this place
we direct our praiers to the father
because he is the first in order; yet
so, as then we imploy the Son and
<pb facs="tcp:14012:16"/>
holy Ghost. For we pray to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the name of the Sonne, by
the assistance of the holy Ghost.
And to what persone soeuer the
praier is directed, we must alwaies
remember in minde and heart to
include the rest.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>2. The Vse.</head>
                  <p>THe vses of this point are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde.</p>
                  <p>1. First, whereas we are taught
to com to God, as to a father, and
therefore in the name of his Son
our Sauiour Christ, wee learne to
lay the first ground of all our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
in the holding &amp; maintaining
of the vnion and distinction of the
three persons in Trinitie. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the lowest and the first founda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of praier, it is requisite that al
which woulde pray aright, should
haue this knowledge, rightly to
beleeue of the Trinitie, &amp; to know
how the three persons agree, and
<pb facs="tcp:14012:16"/>
how they are distinguished: &amp; the
order of them, how the Father is
the first, the Sonne the second, the
holy Ghost the third: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
how the father is to be called
vpon in the name of the Sonne, by
the holy Ghost. Hence it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that ignorant and sillie people
which do not so much as dreame
of the vnion, distinction and order
of the persons in Trinitie, mak but
cold and slender kind of praying.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, we may learn here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that we are not in any wise to
inuocate Saintes and Angels, but
onely the true Iehoua. The reason
stands thus. This praier is either a
perfect platform for all praiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
not: to say it were not, were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie
to our Sauiour Christ: to say
it is so, is also to grant, that it doth
fully set downe, to whome al prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are to be made. Papistes that
are the great patrons of invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saints, in their reformed bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiaries
<pb facs="tcp:14012:17"/>
and missales deal very fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
for, first they pray to Mary, that
she would pray to Christ for them;
and when they haue so done, like
Iuglers they come to Christ, and
pray vnto him that hee would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Maries praier for them.</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly, we learne that there
can be no intercessour betweene
God and vs, but onely Christ. For
here we ar taught to come to God
not as to a Iudge, but as to a kind
and louing Father. Now he is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to vs onely by Christ: as for
Angels and Saints, &amp; al creatures,
they are not able to procure by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
meanes, that God shoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a father, no not so much as
to one man.</p>
                  <p>4. Againe, if the God to whom
we pray be a father, we must learn
to acquaint our selues with the
promises which hee hath made in
his word, to quicken our hearts in
praier vnto him. For this word Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:14012:17"/>
implies redines and willing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
in God to heare, and be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to our praiers. And a father
cannot but must needs mak some
promises of fauour to those that
be his children: and therefore it
cannot be, that he should call God
truly his father, which hath not in
his heart this assurance, that God
will fulfill his promises vnto him.
Promises made to praier; these and
such like are to bee marked as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

all that call on him.</hi> Iam. 4. 8. <hi>Drawe
neere vnto God, and he will draw neere
vnto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. If God be a father who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vpon, then praier is the note of
Gods Child. S. Luke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and S. Paul set
out the faithfull seruants of God
by this note. Act. 9 14. <hi>He hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to binde al that cal on thy name</hi>
1. Cor. 1. 2. <hi>To them that are sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Iesus Christ saints by calling, with
all that call on the name of our Lorde
Iesus Christ.</hi> And contrariwise, Psal.
14. 4. It is made one of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of an Atheist, <hi>Neuer to cal on the
name of God.</hi> And such persons, as
neither wil, nor can, or vse not har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tely
to pray to God, they may say,
that they are perswaded there is a
God, but in their doings they bear
<pb facs="tcp:14012:18"/>
themselues as if there wer no God.</p>
                  <p>6. He which would pray aright,
must be like the prodigall childe,
that is, he must not onely confesse
his sin, saying, Father I haue sinned
against heauen and against thee,
&amp;c. but also haue a ful purpose ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
after to offend his Father. For
how can a Childe call him father,
whome hee cares not continually
to displease through his lewd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions?
He cannot do it; neither
can any Father delight in suche a
child: therefore, in praier we must
call to minde our lewdnes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
against our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and with the Publican, in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
of soule, say, <hi>Lord be mercifull
to me a sinner.</hi> He which can truly do
this, is a kind child. If we consider
our selues as we are by nature, wee
are the children of the deuill: noe
childe so like his Father as wee are
like him, and in this estate, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
rebel against God; for the
<pb facs="tcp:14012:19"/>
Deuill hath al the heart, our whol
joy is to serue and please him. A
man that is to pray must think on
this, and be heauy for it. And hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
yea a thousand times happy ar
they, who haue grace giuen them
to see this their state &amp; to bewaile
it. And further, it is not sufficient
to confesse our sinnes against our
mercifull Father, but wee must set
downe with our selues, neuer in
such sort to offend him againe; and
to leade a newe life. This point is
very profitable for these times; For
many there be, when any crosse or
sicknes comes on them, they will
pray and promise repentance and
all obedience to Gods worde, if it
shall please God to deliuer them:
but this vsually is but in hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
they dissemble with God and
men. For when their sicknes is past
like a dogge that hath bene in the
water, they shake their eares, and
runne streight with all greedinesse
<pb facs="tcp:14012:19"/>
to their former sinnes. Is this to
call God father? No; hee that doth
this, shall not haue God to be his
father; but the man that is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his soul for his offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces past,
and carrieth a purpose in his heart
neuer wittingly and willingly to
offend God againe.</p>
                  <p>7. Lastly, here we ar to obserue,
that he which would pray, must be
indued with the spirit of adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
the workes whereof in the matter
of praier are twofold. The first to
moue him to crie and call on God
as a father. It is no easie thing to
pray. For to a man of himselfe, it is
as easie to mooue the whole earth
with his hand; how then comes it
that we pray? It is a blessed worke
of the spirit. Rom. 8. 15. <hi>Wee haue
receiued the spirit of adoption, whereby
vve crie Abba, that is, Father,</hi> and
Rom. 8. 26. <hi>Likewise the spirit helpeth
our infirmities: for wee knowe not what
to pray as we ought: but the spirit it self
<pb facs="tcp:14012:20"/>
maketh request.</hi> And. Zach. 12. 10.
the holy Ghost is called <hi>the spirit of
grace and deprecations or praiers.</hi> Wel
then, the man that woulde pray,
must haue Gods spirite to bee his
schoolmaster, to teach him to pray
with grones and sighes of the hart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for the wordes make not the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but the grones &amp; desires of the
hart; and a man praies for no more
then he desires with his heart, and
hee which desires nothing, praies
not at all, but spends liplabor. The
second work of the spirit, is to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
vs in our consciences, that we
are in the state of grace, reconciled
to God. Rom. 8. 16. <hi>The spirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
beareth witnes with our spirits,
that we are the children of God.</hi> And
this inward certificate of the spirit
in all exercises of invocation is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
necessarie: for hee which wants
this assurance, if hee be secure, and
benummed in his sinnes, will not,
and if he be touched in conscience
<pb facs="tcp:14012:20"/>
for them, for his life hee dare not
cal God Father. Also, this confutes
the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church of Rome
which teacheth, that a man must
doubt whether hee be adopted or
no. For howe can a man trulie cal
God Father, when he doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be the child of God or no.
It is a miserable kinde of praying,
to call God Father, and to doubt
whether he be a father. Indeede it
is true, that doubts will often rise,
but it is our dutie to striue against
them, and not to yeeld vnto them.
Yea, but (say they) to be certain of
Gods mercy is presumption. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
if it be presumption, it is an
holy presumption, because God
hath bidden vs call him father.</p>

                  <p>THus much of the argument of

It is further said, <hi>Our Father. Quest.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14012:21"/>
Whether may it bee lawfull for vs
in praier to say, not our father, but
my father? <hi>Ans.</hi> A Christian may
in priuate praier say, <hi>My Father.</hi>
This is warranted by the example
of our Sauiour. Mat, 26. 39. <hi>O my
Father if it be possible, let this cup passe
from me.</hi> And Mat. 27. 46. <hi>My God,
my God, whie hast thou forsaken mee?</hi>
The meaning of Christe is not to
binde vs to these wordes, but to
teache vs that in our praiers wee
must not haue regard to our selues

therefore when we pray for them
in our priuate praiers as for our

               </div>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>2. The Vses.</head>
                  <p>1 VVHen we pray, we must
not make request on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
for our selues &amp; our own good,
but for others also, as the Church
and people of GOD, perswading
<pb facs="tcp:14012:21"/>
our selues, that we also are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of their praiers, and for the
better clearing of this point, let vs
search who they are for whome we
are to pray. Of men there be two
sortes; some liuing, some dead. Of
these two kindes, the liuing are to
be praied for, and there is no pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the dead. A man that is
dead knowes what shall be his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
eternally: if he died a wicked
person, his state shall be according
in eternall torments, if hee died
godly, then he shall rest with God
in his kingdom. Apoc. 14. 13. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are they vvhich die in the Lord, for
they rest from their labours, and their
vvorkes follow them.</hi> Gal. 6. 10. <hi>While
vve haue time let vs do good to al men.</hi>
Where we may note, that there is
a time, namelie after death, when
we cannot.</p>
                  <p>Againe, of the liuing, some are
our enemies, and some our frends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Our frends are they which are of
<pb facs="tcp:14012:22"/>
the same religion, affection, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
Foes are either priuate or
publike: publike foes, are either e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to our country, as tyrants,
traitors, &amp;c. or enemies to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as Iewes, Turks, Papists, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
Atheists. Nowe towards all
these, how ought a man to behaue
himselfe in prayer? <hi>Ans.</hi> Hee is to
pray for them all. Mat. 5. 44. <hi>Praie
for them vvhich hurt you and persecute
you,</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 1. <hi>I exhort that praiers,
intercessions, &amp;c. Be made for all men,
for kinges &amp;c.</hi> Yet when Paul gaue
this commandement: we read not
that there wer any Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kings,
but all Infidels. And the Iewes are
commanded to pray for Babylon,
where they were captiue. Ieremie
29. 7. <hi>And seeke the prosperitie of the
Cittie, whither I haue caused you to bee
carried captiue, and praie vnto the lord
for it. Quest.</hi> Howe, and in what
maner are we to pray for our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
<hi>Ans.</hi> We are to pray against
<pb facs="tcp:14012:22"/>
their sinnes, counsels, enterprises,
but not against their persons. Thus
praied Dauid against Achitophell.
2. Sa. 15. 31. <hi>Lord, I praie thee, bring
the counsell of</hi> Achitophell <hi>to foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
And thus did the Apostles pray
against their persecuters. Act. 4. 29
<hi>O Lord, behold their threatnings, and
graunt vnto thy seruants with all bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Question.</hi> Dauid vseth impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against his enemies, in which
he praieth for their vtter confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as Psal. 59. &amp; 109. &amp;c. the like
is done by Paul. Gal. 5. 12. 2. Tim.
4. 14. And Peter Act. 8. 20. though
afterwards hee mitigates his exex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.
But how could they do it?
<hi>Ans.</hi> 1. They were indued with an
extraordinarie measure of Gods
spirit; and hereby they were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to discerne of the estate of
their enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; certainly to judge
that their wickednes and malice
was incurable, and that they shuld
<pb facs="tcp:14012:23"/>
neuer repent. And the like praiers
did the primatiue Church co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue
against Iulia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostata, because
they perceiued him to be a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and desperate enemie. 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
they were indued with a
pure zeal against their enemies in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tending
nothing else but the glory
of God. Now, for vs it is good that
we should suspect our zeal, because
sinister affections, as hatred, enuie,
emulation, desire of reuenge, wil
mingle themselues with our zeal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Question.</hi> How far forth may we
vse those Psalmes in which Dauid
vseth imprecations against his ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies?
<hi>Ans.</hi> They are to be read and
song with these caueats. 1. Wee
are to vse those imprecations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely
against the enemies of
God and his Church: for wee may
perswade our selues, that alwaies
there be some such obstinate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
but we must not apply them
particularly. 2. Secondly, wee must
<pb facs="tcp:14012:23"/>
vse them (as Augustine saith) as cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine
prophetical sentences of the
holy Ghost, pronouncing the last
sentence of destruction, of final &amp;
impenitent sinners, which oppose
themselues against Gods kingdom
Thirdly; they may be vsed against
our spiritual enemies the flesh, the
deuil and his Angels, &amp; the world</p>
                  <p>2. Furthermore, whereas we ar
taught to say, <hi>Our father;</hi> this serues
to put vs in minde, that in praying
to God, we must bring loue to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with vs. We must all be as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of one father, louingly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
one to another. For how shuld
he call God his father, who wil not
take the child of God for his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Mat. 5. 23. <hi>When thou art to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thie gifte vnto God, if thou haue
ought against thie brother, first be recon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciled,
and then come and offer thy gift.</hi>
So also Esay 1. 15. the Lorde saith,
that when they pray vnto him hee
will not heare. Why? <hi>because their
<pb facs="tcp:14012:24"/>
hands were ful of blud.</hi> In these times
many men can be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to praie; but yet they will not
leaue bribing, oppression, deceit,
vsurie, &amp;c. The common song of
the worlde is, euerie man for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and God for vs all: this is the
common loue and care that men
haue eche to other. The praiers of
such are abhominable, euen as the
sacrifice of a dog, as Esay saith, For
howe can they call God their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that haue no loue to their bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren?</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly, hence we may learn
that God is no accepter of perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
For this praier is giuen to all men
of what state or degree soeuer. All
then, aswell poore as rich, vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as learned, subjectes as rulers,
may say, <hi>Our father.</hi> It is not with
the Lord as it is with the worlde,
but all are his Children that doe
beleeue. The poore man hath as
good interest in Gods kingdome,
<pb facs="tcp:14012:24"/>
and may call God Father as well
as the King.</p>

                  <head>2. The Vse</head>
                  <p>1. HEereby first we learn that
Romish pilgrimages, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
men went from place to place
to worship God, are vain and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.
The God to whome wee must
pray is in heauen: Nowe let men
trauell to what place or countrey
they will, they shall not come the
neerer to heauen or neerer to God
by traueling; seeing the earth is in
euerie part alike dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from heuen</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, this ouerthrowes
popish Idolatrie, as woorshipping
of Crosses, Crucifixes, Roods, &amp;c.
to put vs in mind of God &amp; Christ.
Wee are taught to lift vp our eies
to heuen; seeing God is there: and
how can we do this, as long as our
mindes and eies are poring vpon
an image made by mans arte?</p>
                  <p>5. Againe, wee are here admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
to vse the action of praier
with as great reuerence as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
may be. Wel reasons Salomon:
<pb facs="tcp:14012:25"/>
Eccle. 5. 1. <hi>Be not rash with thy mouth
to speak a vvord before God.</hi> Why? <hi>he
is in heaven, thou art in earth: therfore
let thy vvords be few.</hi> This reuerence
must appeare in holines of minde
and affection and in al comlines of
gesture. And for this cause, al wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
bythoughts and all vaine
babling is to be auoided. But how
goes the case with vs, that on the
times appointed come to the asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
to pray? Many, by reason of
their blindenes, pray without vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
Many, when they are
present at praier, yet haue their
hearts occupied about other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
about their goods and world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
busines: such men haue no joye
or gladnes in praying; it is a burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to them. Many come to the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
for custom only, or for fear of
punishment; if they might be left
free, they could find in their harts
not to pray at all. But let all suche
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know, that this maner of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:14012:26"/>
is a very greenous sinne; nay,
greater then mocking of father or
mother, killing or stealing; for it is
directly against God, the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
men. This sin, because it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the first Table, and therfore,
more hard to bee discerned, it is
lightly esteemed, and it lesse trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the consciences of ignorant
men: yet as it is indeede, so it is to
be esteemed as a disgrace &amp; plaine
mockerie of Gods majestie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
seeing God is in heuen, away
with al drowsie and dead praying,
let vs come with reuerence in our
hearts before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>4. Againe wee are here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that our harts in praier must
mount vp into heauen, and there
be present with the Lord. Psal. 25.
1. <hi>Vnto thee O Lord lift I vp my soule.</hi>
The litle childe is neuer well, but
when it is in the fathers lap, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the fathers wing: and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God are neuer in better
<pb facs="tcp:14012:26"/>
case, then when in affection &amp; spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
they can come into the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of their heauenly father, and by
prayer, as it were, to creep into his
bosome.</p>
                  <p>5. Lastly, this preface sheweth,
that God is all sufficient, as in al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, so in granting our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests:
God is willing to hear our
praiers, in that hee is our father, &amp;
able to performe them, because he
is in heuen &amp; therefore almightie.</p>

                  <head>1. The coherence.</head>
                  <p>THus much of the preface: now
follow the petitions. They be
six in number: the three first, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
God, and his glorie: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
three concern our selues. The
three former petitions, are againe
deuided into two partes: the firste
concernes Gods glorie it selfe, the
other two, the meanes, whereby
Gods glory is manifested, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
<pb facs="tcp:14012:27"/>
among men. For God his
name is glorified among men, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his kingdome doth come, and his
will is done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Question.</hi> Why is this petition,
<hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> set in the first
place? <hi>Answere.</hi> Because Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
must bee preferred before all
thinges: because it is the end of all
creatures, and of all the counsels
of God. Prou. 16. 4. <hi>The Lord hath
made all thinges for his owne sake; yea,
euen the vvicked for the day of euill.</hi>
And from the order of the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
heere ariseth a worthy instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
namely, that euery one in all
thinges they take in hande, are to
propound to themselues, and to
intend the glory of God. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is this. The end which God
hath appointed to all our doings,
we are to propound to our selues:
but God hath appointed that the
highest end of all our doings shuld
be his glorie: therfore, our hearts
<pb facs="tcp:14012:27"/>
must be set to seeke it first of all.
That God will haue his name glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by vs, appeareth in this; that
he punisheth those which of obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie,
set themselues to dishonour
him, or by negligence did not san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
him, when they should haue
done so. Herod sitting in his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie,
made such an oration that
the people cried, the voice of a
God and not of a man: and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
the Angel of the lord smote
him, because he gaue not the glory
to God. Act. 12. 23. And Moses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he did not sanctifie the Lord
in the presence of the children of
Israel, therefore, he came not into
the land of promise; yet he did but
faile in doing of it. Thus wee may
see by these punishments, and also
by the order of the petitions, that
it is our duties to prefer the glory
of God before all things else.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether are we to prefer
the glory of God before the salua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:14012:28"/>
of our soules? <hi>Answer.</hi> If the
case stand thus, that Gods name
must be dishonoured, or our soules
condemned: we must account the
glory of God more pretious than
the saluation of our soules. This is
manifest in the order of the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The petition that concernes
Gods glory is first, and the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that concerne directly our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
are the fift and sixt. Where
by we are taught, that before God
should want any part of his glory,
we are to let soule and all go, and
let God haue all his glory. This af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
had Moses. Exod. 32. 32.

if thou vvilt not, blot my name out of
thy booke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this petition, as also in the

graces of god, that ar to be desired</p>

and mercie, which appeares
in thy titles, worde, creatures, and

               <div type="section">
                  <head>3 The vvantes which are to
be bevvailed.</head>
                  <p>1 THe wants, which we in this
place are taught to bewail,
are especiallie foure. The first is,
<pb facs="tcp:14012:30"/>
an inward and spirituall pride of
our hearts: a sin that none, or very
few can see in themselues, vnlesse
the Lord open their eies. When
our first parentes were tempted in
Paradise, the deuil told them, they
should be as Gods: which lesson
not onely they, but we haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
and we conceiue of our selues
as litle gods, though to the world
we shew it not. This hidden pride,
when other sinnes die, it begins to
get strength and to shewe it selfe:
and it appeares in vaine thoughts,
continuallie on euery occasion as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
in the minde. As maye
appeare in the Pharisie, whose
thoughts were these, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thus within himselfe: <hi>O God, I
thank thee that I am not as other men,
extortioners, vniust, adulterers, or euen
as this Publican, &amp;c.</hi> And as this
was in him, so it is in vs till God
giue grace: for so that men may
haue praise &amp; glory in the world,
<pb facs="tcp:14012:30"/>
they care not for God his glorie,
though it be defaced. Wee must
therfore learn to discerne this hid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den
corruption, and to mourn for
it: for it doeth poison &amp; hinder al
good desires of glorifying God, so
long as it may preuaile in the hart.</p>
                  <p>2 Secondly, we are taught here
to bewaile the hardnesse of our
hearts: whereby we are hindred
from knowing God aright, and
from discerning the glorie of God
in his creatures. Mark. 6. 52. The
Disciples through the hardnesse
of their hartes could not see Gods
power, in the miracle of feeding
many thousands with a few loues,
though themselues were instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of it, and the food did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in their hands. Our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what a wonderfull work is it,
but how few consider of it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
it? If wee see a man haue
more wit, wealth, or honour than
we haue, wee straight woonder at
<pb facs="tcp:14012:31"/>
him: but beholding Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
we see nothing in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we do not goe higher to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the loue, power, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and iustice of the Creator.
And this is the cause why Gods
name is so slenderly honoured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men.</p>
                  <p>3 The third corruption, is our
great ingratitude: for the Lorde
hath made heauen and earth, and
all other creatures to serue m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n:
yet he is the most vnthankful of al
creatures. Bestow manie iewels, or
a kinges ransome on a dead man,
he wil neuer returne anie kindnes;
so men being dead in sinne deale
with God. Commonlie, men are
like the swine, that run with their
groines and eat vp the mast, but
neuer looke vp to the tree from
whence it falleth. But the godlie
are with Dauid, to feele this want
in themselues, and to beseech God
to open, and as it were, to vnlocke
<pb facs="tcp:14012:31"/>
their lippes, that they may inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to be thankfull to God. Psal.
51. 15.</p>
                  <p>4 The fourth, is the vngodlines
and the innumerable wantes that
be in our liues, and the sinnes com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted
in the world. Psal. 119. 136
<hi>Mine eies</hi> (saith Dauid) <hi>gush out with
riuers of waters, because men keepe not
thy lawes.</hi> The reason is, because he
which liues in sin reproches Gods
name: euen as an euill child disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
his father. Now some wil say,
that this cannot be, because our
sinnes cannot hurt God. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> Yet
they are a cause of slandring Gods
name among men: for as we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him by our good workes, so
we dishonour him by our offences.
Mat. 5. 16. <hi>Let your light so shine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, that they may see your good
workes, and glorifie your father which is
in heauen.</hi>

                  <p>1 The graces to be desired, and
<pb facs="tcp:14012:32"/>
to be prayed for at Gods hand, are
three. The first is, the knowledge of
God: that is, that we might know
him, as he hath reueiled himself in
his word, works and creatures. For
how shal anie glorifie God before
he know him? Our knowledge in
this life is imperfect. Exo. 23. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
may not see Gods face, but his
hinder partes. 1. Cor. 13. 12. Wee
may see God as men doe, through
spectacles, in his word, sacraments
and creatures. And therefore, as
Paule prayed for the Colossians,
Col. 1. 10. that they <hi>might increase
in the knowledge of God,</hi> so are wee
taught to pray for our selues in
this petion.</p>
                  <p>2. A zeale for Gods glorie. Psal.
69. 9. <hi>The zeale of thine house hath ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
me vp.</hi> Psal. 45. 1. <hi>My heart shall
vtter, or cast vp a good matter. I vvill
speake in my workes of the king.</hi> Here
the Spirit of God borrowes a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parison
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men thus. As he which
<pb facs="tcp:14012:32"/>
hath somewhat lying heauie in his

                     </gap>cke, is neuer at quiet till hee
haue cast it vp: euen so the care &amp;
desire to glorifie Gods name, must
lie vpon a mans heart as an heauie
burthen: and he is not to bee at

be disburdened, in sounding forth
Gods praise. Luther saith wel, that
this is <hi>sancta crapula:</hi> that is, an holy
surfet: and it is no hurt, continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to haue our harts ouercharged
thus.</p>
                  <p>3 A desire to lead a godlie and
syncere life, as before Gods Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie.

                  <p>[<hi>Thy</hi>] This word doth put vs in
mind that there is two kingdoms:
one Gods, &amp; that is the kingdome
of heauen: the other the deuils,
called the kingdom of darknesse.
Col. 1. 13. For when all had sinned
in Adam, God laid this punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
on all, that seeing they could not
be content to obey their Creator,
they should be in bondage vnder
Sathan: So that by nature we are
<pb facs="tcp:14012:33"/>
all the children of wrath, and the
deuill holds vp the scepter of his
kingdome in the heartes of men.
This kingdome is spirituall, and
the pillers of it are ignorance, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
impietie, and all disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God, in which the deuill
whollie delights; which also are,
as it were, the lawes of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Blind ignorant people can
not abide this doctrine, that the
deuill should rule in their hearts:
they spit at the naming of him, &amp;
say that they defie him with all
their heartes: but whereas they
liue in sinne, and practise it as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
is offered, though they can
not discerne of themselues, yet
they make plain proofe, that they
line in the kingdome of sinne and
darknes, and are stat vessels of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
&amp; shal so continew, till Christ
the strong man come and binde
him, and cast him out. And this is
the estate of all the children of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb facs="tcp:14012:34"/>
in themselues. Wherfore, our
sauiour in this petition, teacheth
vs to consider our naturall estate,
and to pray that he would giue vs
his Spirit, to set vs at libertie in the
kingdome of his owne Sonne.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Kingdome</hi>] Gods kingdome in
scriptures, is taken two waies. First
generallie, and so it signifieth that
administration, by which the Lord
gouerneth all thinges, yea, euen
the deuilles themselues, of which
kingdome mention is made in the
end of this prayer, and in Psal. 97.
vers. 1. <hi>The Lorde raigneth, let the
earth reioice.</hi> Againe, it is taken
more speciallie, and then it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the administration of Christ,
the head of the Church, in which
hee frameth men by his worde
and Spirit, to the subjection of the
same worde. And so it is taken in
this petition.</p>
                  <p>In a kingdome there are foure
things to be noted. 1. There must
<pb facs="tcp:14012:34"/>
bee a king. 2 There must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes.
3 There are lawes. 4 Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>
                  <p>In this kingdome, Christ is the
king, it is he to whome the father
hath giuen all authoritie in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and earth.</p>
                  <p>In this kingdom, al are not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
but such as ar willing to giue
free and frank obedience to Gods
word; or at the least, though their
hearts be not sound, make an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
profession of it.</p>
                  <p>The lawes of this kingdome, is
the word of God, in the books of
the old and new Testament. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is called <hi>the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi>
Mat. 13. <hi>The Gospell of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
Mar. 1. 13. <hi>The rod of his mouth.</hi>
Isai. 11. 4 <hi>The arme of God.</hi> Isai. 53.
1. As a King by his lawes bringes
his people in order, &amp; keeps them
in subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so Christ by his word,
and the preaching of it, as it were
by a mightie arme, drawes the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb facs="tcp:14012:35"/>
into his kingdome, and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
them to all holie obedience.</p>
                  <p>The power and authoritie is, that
whereby Christ conuerts effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
those which are to be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and glorifies himselfe in the
confusion of the rest.</p>
                  <p>The kingdom being taken thus
specially is also twofold. The first,
is the kingdome of grace, of which
mention is made, Rom. 14. 17. <hi>The
Kingdome of God stands not in meat &amp;
drink but in righteousnes,</hi> that is, the
assurance of our justification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, in the righteousnes of
Christ: <hi>Peace</hi> of conscience, which
proceeds from this assurance; <hi>and
ioy in the holie Ghost,</hi> which comes
from them both. In this kingdom
all men liue not, but onelie those
that ar subject to Christ, obedient
to the lawes of his kingdome, and
ruled by his authoritie, &amp; are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
taught in his word by his
spirit. But those that refuse to liue
<pb facs="tcp:14012:35"/>
according vnto the lawes of this
king, and choose to liue at their
owne libertie, are in the kingdom
of darknesse, sinne and Sathan.</p>
                  <p>The second is the kingdome of
glory in heauen, which is the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
estate of al Gods people there,
when God shal be al in al in them.
And the former kingdom of grace
is an entrance and preparation to
the kingdome of glorie.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Come</hi>] Gods kingdome comes,
when it is established and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in mens hearts, and made ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifest
to all people, the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
being remoued. <hi>Question.</hi>
This comming implies a stopping
but howe should Gods kingdome,
be hindered? <hi>Answer.</hi> Kingdom in
this place is not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God, whereby hee rules all
things, for that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be hindred:
but for the kingdome of grace,
which in the vsing of the outward
meanes, as ministers, word, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
<pb facs="tcp:14012:36"/>
may be hindered by the
deuill, the world, and mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>

                  <head>3 The vvantes which are to
be bewailed.</head>
                  <p>THe wantes which wee in this
petition are taught to mourn
for, are of two sorts: some concern
our own selues: some, others. That
which concernes our owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
is a bondage and slauerie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
sinne and Satan. This bondage
indeede is weakened in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
but none is whollie freed
from it in this life. Paule complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
that he is sould vnder sinne,
and cries pitifullie. O miserable
man that I am, who shal deliuer me
from this bodie of death? <hi>Question.</hi>
What difference then betweene
the godlie and the wicked? <hi>Answer</hi>
The euil and vngodlie man, in the
verie middest of his bondage hath
a mery hart, sinne is no trouble to
<pb facs="tcp:14012:36"/>
him, nay, it is meat and drinke to
him. But the godly man is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
minded. For, considering the
power of the deuill, and his craft
in manifold fearfull temptations,
and seeing the prooffes of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
nature, euer and anon to
start away from God, he is grieued
and confounded in himself, &amp; his
heart bleedes within him, that hee
doth offend so mercifull a Father.</p>
                  <p>Manie men liue in this world &amp;
that manie yeares, and yet neuer
feele this bondage vnder Satan &amp;
sinne. Such vndoubtedlie cannot
tel what the Lords prayer meanes;
But he that would haue the right
vse of this petition must bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it, and bee touched
in his conscience, for that the flesh
and the deuill beare such sway in
him: As the poore captiue is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
creeping to the prison dore,
alwaies labouring to get off his
bolts &amp; fetters, &amp; to escape out of
<pb facs="tcp:14012:37"/>
prison, so must we alwaies crie to
the Lord for his Spirite, to free vs
out of this bondage and prison of
sinne and corruption, and everie
day come neerer the prison doore,
looking when our blessed Sauiour
will vnbind vs of all the fetters of
sinne and Sathan, and fullie erect
his kingdome in vs.</p>
                  <p>2. The wantes which concerne
others, are twofold. The former is
the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the good means, which
serue for the furthering of the
kingdome of Christ, as preaching,
sacraments and discipline. When
we shal see a people without know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge,
and without good guides,
and teachers, and when we see one
stand vp in the congregation not
able to teach, here is matter for
mourning: This petition puts vs
in mind to bewaile these wantes.
Our Sauiour, when hee sawe the
Iewes, as sheepe without a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
he had compassion on them,
<pb facs="tcp:14012:37"/>
and hee wept ouer Ierusalem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they knewe not the thinges
which belonged to their peace.
Luk. 9. 11. Therefore, when prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
want, to hold vp the scepter
of God before the people, and to
hold out the word, which is, as it
were, the arme of God, to pul men
from the bondage of the deuill to
the kingdome of Christ: Then it is
time to say, <hi>Lorde, let thy kingdome
come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The third want which we are
to bewail, is, that there be so many
impediments, and hinderances of
the kingdome of grace, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
and al his Angels, their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Pope, the Turke, and all
the rest of the professed wicked of
the world, which by subtile intise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and tyrannie, keep back &amp;
repell the means, whereby Christ
ruled as a king in his Churche.
When the deuill sees one that was
sometime of his kingdome, but to
<pb facs="tcp:14012:38"/>
cast a looke toward the heauenly
Ierusalem, he straightway regeth
against him, and labours quite to
ouerthrow him. Wherfore, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of al these impediments, wee
must pray, <hi>thy kingdom come.</hi>

                  <head>4. Graces to be desired.</head>
                  <p>1. IN this petition we are taught
first, that we are to haue a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
desire, and to hunger, that
God of his mercie would giue vs
his Spirite to raigne and rule in
our hearts, and to bow them to all
obedience and subjection of his
will, &amp; further, whereas our hearts
haue bene, as it were, filthie sties
and stables of the deuill, that hee
would renew them, and make of
them sit temples, to entertaine his
owne spirite. Psal. 51. 10. <hi>Create in
me a cleane hearte, O God, and renew
a right Spirit in me, &amp;c. Stablish mee
with thy free Spirit.</hi> If we shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the conuersation of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:14012:38"/>
and the Godly and their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
hearts together, wee shall see
litle difference, but in this, that the
wicked is delighted and glad to
sinne, but the godlie do wrastle, as
for life and death, with their temp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations,
and do resist the deuil, and
doe desire, and crie to heauen, to
be freed from his bondage, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
their hearts are alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
against God.</p>
                  <p>2 Forasmuch as the kingdome
of grace is erected in Gods church
here vpon earth: here in this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wee are commanded to pray
for the church of God &amp; the parts
therof. Psal. 122. 6. <hi>Pray for the peace
of Ierusalem, they shal prosper that loue
thee.</hi> Esa. 62. 7. <hi>Ye which are the Lord
his remembrancers, giue him no rest,
vntill he set vp Hierusalem the praise
of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that Gods Church may
flourish &amp; be in good estate, we are
to pray for Christian Kinges and
<pb facs="tcp:14012:39"/>
princes, that God wold blesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and increase the number of them.
For they are as <hi>nursing fathers, and
nursing mothers to the Church.</hi> And
wee especiallie are bound to pray
for the Queenes moste excellent
Maiestie, as also for the Frenche
King, that they may bee blessed,
and Gods kingdome by them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced.</p>
                  <p>And againe, because Ministers
are the Lordes watchmen, in the
Church, wee are also here put in
mind to seeke their good, and to
pray that their hearts may be set
for the building of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
for the beating down of the
kingdome of sin and Satan, &amp; for
the sauing of the soules of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And the rather, because the
deuill laboureth night and day, to
ouerthrow them in this glorious
work, and to resist them in their
ministerie: as appeareth in Zach. 3
1. When Ioshua the high Prieste
<pb facs="tcp:14012:39"/>
stood before the Angel of the lord
<hi>Satan stood at his right hand,</hi> namely,
to resist him. Therefore, also we ar
to pray for them, that the Lorde
would keepe them, and furnish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with giftes, and withal, make them
faithfull, for, <hi>Where vision faileth, the
people are left naked,</hi> saith Salomon.
2. Thes. 3. 1. <hi>Brethren pray for vs, that
the vvord of the Lord may haue a free
passage, and be glorified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, wee must pray for all
Christian Schooles of learning.
Howsoeuer some think but basely
of them, yet they are the ordinarie
means to maintaine the ministery,
and so the Church of God. A man
that hath diuers Orchards, wil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
haue a feminarie full of young
plantes to maintaine it. Schooles
they are as feminaries to God his
Church, without which the church
falles to decay: because they serue
to make supplie of Ministers.</p>
                  <p>3 Thirdly, we are to desire, that
<pb facs="tcp:14012:40"/>
the Lord would hasten the second
comming of Christ, as the Saintes
in heauen pray, <hi>Come Lord Iesus,
come quicklie:</hi> and therefore, the
godlie are said to <hi>loue the comming
of Christ.</hi> 2. Tim. 4. 8. A penitent
sinner so abhors his owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the yrkesome temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Sathan, that in this respect
he desires that Christ wold hasten
his particular comming to him by
death, for no other cause, but that
he might make an end of sinning
and displeasing God.</p>

Gods worde, written in

the whol wil of God, ther be three

this, that our hearts are so

to Gods commandements.
Put a match to an heape of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,

as a man that hath a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease

                  <p>2 Againe, we must here bewaile
the sinnes of the world, as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
heresies, schismes, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
pride, ambition, contempt of
Gods worde, couetousnes, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
want of loue of God and his

vvith the vncleane conuersation of the

our soules to bee vexed and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
continuallie, at the wickednes
of our time: and further, in this
griefe we are to send vp our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God for them, that they
may be brought to the obedience
of Gods will, Ezech. 9. 4. In a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon

Gods will, that we should suffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
Our Sauiour prayed, that
the cup might be taken away, but
with submission to his fathers wil,
Luke. 22. 42. And this Dauid had
learned, when he said, <hi>But if he thus
say, Beholde, I haue no delight in thee,

                  <p>1 THe first thing which we are
here to desire, is, that wee
may haue grace to denie our
selues, wils, and affections: because
herein wee are vnlike to God, and
like the Deuill. This is the first les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that our Sauiour doeth giue
<pb facs="tcp:14012:42"/>
his Disciples, that they must denie
themselues, and follow him.</p>
                  <p>2 The second thing, is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods will: for otherwise,
how shal we do it? How shall that
seruant please his maister, which
cannot tell what hee would haue
done of him? Most men will haue
bookes of statutes in their houses,
and if they be to deal in any great
matter, they will do nothing vntil
they haue looked on the Statute.
In like maner, men must haue the
Bible, that is, the booke of Gods
statutes in their houses; the lawes
of God must bee the men of our
counsel: Before euerie action, wee
are to searche what is the will of
God, and then to doe it. Here the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wee are taught to vse the meanes,
and to pray for knowledge.</p>
                  <p>3 Againe, we are here taught to
haue a desire in our hearts, and an
indeuour in our liues in all things
to do obedience to Gods word.</p>

strength, when it shall please God
at anie time to exercise vs with the

the same degre of perfection with
with Angels; but a similitude or
the like maner of obeying; it may
be said, in what maner do the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
obey God? <hi>Answer.</hi> They doe
the wil of God willingly, speedily,
and faithfully; and this is signified,
in that they are saide in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

to make glad the heart of man: and oyle
to make his face shine.</hi> And Iohn 12.
3. Our Sauiour Christ allowed of
the fact of Mary, which tooke a
pounde of ointment of spikenard
very costly, and annointed his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
feete, so that all the house was
<pb facs="tcp:14012:46"/>
filled with the smell; though Iudas
did esteeme it wast. But yet if the
Lord shall graunt but breade, that
is, so much as shal but holde bodie
and soule togither, wee must bee
content therewith. 1. Tim. 6. ver. 8.
<hi>Therefore, vvhen vvee hauue foode and
raiment, let vs be therewith content.</hi>
This contentation was in Iacob.
Gene. 28. 20.</p>
                  <p>A second cause is, to teache vs
that there is a particular proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
All men confesse that there
is a generall prouidence of God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all thinges, but here wee must
acknowledg an other more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
euen in the least thinges that
be: because euery morsell of bread
which we eate, wold no more nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
vs, then a peece of earth, or a
stone, vnlesse God gaue his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vnto it.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Daily</hi>] The worde in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
is thus much in effect, <hi>Bread
vnto our essence or substances:</hi> then
<pb facs="tcp:14012:47"/>
the meaning is; Giue vs such bread
from day to day, as may nourishe
our substances. Thus praieth Agur
Prou. 30. 8. <hi>Feede me with food con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
for me.</hi> Some there ar which
put an Angelical perfection in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting:
But we are taught in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that as aboue all thinges,
we are to seeke for life eternall, so
wee must in this life, sustaine and
maintaine our naturall bodies, so
long as we liue in this world. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
in it selfe, as it is abstinence,
is no part of Gods worship; but in
it own nature a thing indifferent:
and therefore, it is to bee vsed so
farre forth, as it shal further vs in
prayer, and no further. For seeing
we ar taught to pray for such food
as shall preserue nature, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the vitall blood, we must not
vse fasting to the hindrance or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of nature.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Our bread.</hi>] 1. <hi>Question.</hi> How
is bread ours? 1. Corinth. 3. 22.
<pb facs="tcp:14012:47"/>
                     <hi>Ye are Christes, and all things ar yours.</hi>
So then, by meanes of Christe,
bread is called ours. For God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
giuen Christ to vs, doeth in
him and by him, giue all thinges
els to vs. 2. <hi>Question.</hi> Howe may
I knowe that the thinges I enjoy,
are mine by Christ, and that I doe
not vsurpe them? <hi>Answere.</hi> 1. Tim.
4. 4. Paule saieth, that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God are good, and that
the vse of them is sanctified to vs,
by the word and prayer. Then, if
we haue the word of God, to tel vs
that we may enjoy and vse them:
and also, if we pray to God for the
right and pure vse of them, wee
are no vsurpers, but indeed right
owners of them. 3. <hi>Question.</hi> If
the creatures must be made ours
by Christ, howe comes it to passe,
that the vngodlie haue such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of them? <hi>Answer.</hi> We lost
the title and interest of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in Adam: yet God of his
<pb facs="tcp:14012:48"/>
mercie bestowes temporarie bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
vpon the vniust aswell as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the iust: but for all that, vnlesse
they be in Christ, and hold the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of them by him, they shal in the
end, turn to their great conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas we cal it, <hi>our bread,</hi>
wee learne, that euery man must
liue of his owne calling, and his
owne goods. Here also is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all oppression, stealing, lying,
cogging, and other such deceitfull
meanes to get wealth and goods.
Many think it no sinne to prouide
for their familie in such order, but
in saying this petition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
themselues. 2. Thes. 3. 10.
<hi>Hee vvhich laboureth not, let him not
eate.</hi> Ephes. 4. 28. <hi>He vvhich stole let
him steale no more, but rather labour
vvith his hands the thing that good is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[<hi>This day</hi>] We say not heere this
weeke, this month, this age, but
this day, what meanes this? may
yee not prouide for the time to
<pb facs="tcp:14012:48"/>
come? <hi>Answere.</hi> It is lawfull, yea, a
man is bound in good maner to
prouide for time to come. Act. 11.
28. The Apostles prouide for the
Church in Iudaea, against the time
of dearth, spoken of by Agabus.
And Ioseph in Aegypt, in the years
of plentie, stored vp against the
yeares of famine. Wherefore, in
these words, our Sauiour his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
is only to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demn al distrust
full care, and to teach vs to rest on
his fatherlie goodnes from day to
day, in euerie season: this is noted
vnto vs, Numb. 11. where the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelits
wer commanded to gather
no more Manna, than would serue
for one day, &amp; if they did, it putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
Wherby God taught them, to
rest on his prouidence euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
day, and not on the means.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Giue vs</hi>] Not me. This serues
to teache vs, that a man must not
onelie regarde himselfe, but also
be mindfull of others. For a man
<pb facs="tcp:14012:49"/>
that hath welth, is made a steward,
to distribute his goods to the
poore, and the good of Gods
Church. True loue seekes not her
owne things: the branches of the
vine are loaded with clusters of
grapes, not for themselues, but for
others: the candle spends it self to
giue others light.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Giue</hi>] If bread be ours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are we to ask it? It may seeme
needles. <hi>Answer.</hi> Not so, for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are taught very worthie les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
1. First, those that are in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie,
are taught to wait on God,
who is the fountaine and giuer of
al blessings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men vsuallie driuen
to this estate, vse euill meanes, as
robbing, deceiuing, consulting
with wisards, &amp;c. 2. Againe, here
we learne, that thogh a man had al
the wealth in the world, all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without Gods blessing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> The rich need not say, Giue
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, &amp;c. for they haue aboundance
<pb facs="tcp:14012:49"/>
already, and what neede they aske
that which they haue? <hi>Answer.</hi> Let
a man be neuer so rich, and want
nothing that can be desired, yet if
hee want Gods blessing, in effect
he wants al. Wherfore, euen kings,
and the greatest personages that
be, are as much bounde to vse this
petition, as the poorest. <hi>Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
is riches,</hi> saith Salomon. Pro. 10
22. Thou maiest eat, and not haue
inough, be clothed and not warm,
earne wages, and put it in a broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
bagge. Hag. 1. 6. If God do not
blesse thee. This blessing of God,
is called the <hi>staffe of bread.</hi> Esay. 3. 1
In bread there be two thinges, the
substance, and the vertue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods
blessing: this second, that is, the
power of nourishing, is the staff of
bread. For take away from an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
man his staffe, and he falls: &amp;
so take away Gods blessing from
bread, it becomes vnprofitable, &amp;
ceaseth to nourish. Lastly, here wee
<pb facs="tcp:14012:50"/>
see, that all labour and toyle taken
in any kind of calling, is nothing,
and auailes not, vnlesse God still
giue his blessing. Psal. 127. 1.</p>

                  <head>3. The wants to be bewailed.</head>
                  <p>OVr corruptions against this
petition, are two especially. I
Couetousnesse, a vice which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
ingraffed in euery mans
heart; it is, when a man is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with his present estate. This
desire is vnsatiable, for men wold
be euer hauing of more. Wherfore
hee which shall vse this petition,
must be grieued for this sinne, and
pray with Dauid. Psalm. 119. 36.
<hi>Incline my hearte to thy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and not to couetousnesse.</hi> And
hee must sorrowe, not so much for
the act of this sinne, as for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of nature in this behalfe.
Couetous people will plead, that
they are free from this vice, but
mark mens liues, and wee shall see
<pb facs="tcp:14012:50"/>
that this is a common disease, in
the most, as it is noted. Psal. 4. 6.
<hi>Who vvill shew vs any good?</hi> This then
is a common sin that we ar taught
to mourne for.</p>
                  <p>2. The second want, is our diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and distrustfulnes, for the
thinges of this life. Men also will
shift this off, and say, they wold be
sorie to distrust God. But if wee
looke to our corrupt nature, man
is wonderfull prone to this sinne,
for being in prosperitie, we ar not
troubled: but if once wee be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with aduersitie, then we houle
and weep, and as Paul saith, 1. Tim.
6. 10. <hi>Men pearce themselues throgh
vvith many sorrowes.</hi> If any shall lose
a parte of his goodes, what then
doth hee? straight hee goes out to
the wise man: is this to beleeue in
God? No, it is to distrust God, and
beleeue the deuill.</p>

in all estates, to rest on

our labour, wee must be content:

Now for this cause, wee are further
to pray to God, that hee would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
our eies, &amp; by his spirit, teach
vs in all his good creatures to see
his prouidence, and when meanes
faile and are contrary, then also to

that the care for our soules

                     <hi>DEbts</hi>) By debts sins  ar meant,
so it is in Luke 11. 4. and they
<pb facs="tcp:14012:53"/>
are so called, because of the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance

a debt doth bind a man, either to

to satisfie Gods iustice, or els to

                  <p>[<hi>Forgiue.</hi>] To forgiue sinne, is to
couer it, or not to impute it. Psal.
32. 1. And this is done, when God
is content of his mercie to accept
the death and passion of Christ, as
a sufficient paiment and ransome
for mans sinnes; and so to esteeme

                  <p>1. HEre we may learn many
lessons; the first is, that
seeing we must pray thus, <hi>Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue,
&amp;c.</hi> We must hold, that there
<pb facs="tcp:14012:53"/>
is no satisfaction to Gods iustice
for sinne by our workes; no not in
temporary punishments: but that
the doing away of our sinnes, is of
Gods meere fauour: for, to forgiue
and to satisfie be contrary: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the doctrine of humain satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions,
taught in the Church of
Rome, is vile and diuelish.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, we are taught thus
to pray continually, from day to
day: where we note the great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and long suffering of God: in
that we offending daily, yet he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
and forbears still, and doeth
not powre out his confusion vpon
vs. This teacheth vs, like patience
towards our brethren: we cannot
put vp the least iniury, and forbear
but one day, yet we desire that god
wold forgiue vs all our liues long.</p>
                  <p>3. Againe, we may obserue, that
there is no perfect sanctification in
this life, seeing we must euery day,
to the end, craue the pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our
<pb facs="tcp:14012:54"/>
sinnes. Therefore, wicked is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the Catharists or puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
which hold that men may be
without sinne in this life.</p>
                  <p>4. And when we say, <hi>forgiue,</hi> not
me, but <hi>vs:</hi> we are put in minde to
pray, not onely for the pardone of
our owne sinnes, but likewise for
our brethren and enemies. Iam. 5.

was a meanes of the conuersion
of Saule.</p>
                  <p>5. Also we note, that before prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for pardon of sinne, must go a
confession of sinne: for whereas
we say, <hi>forgiue our debts,</hi> we confes
before God, that we ar stat banck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>routs,
and not able to discharge
the least of our sinnes; this appears
1. Ioh. 1. 9. <hi>If vve confesse our sinnes,
he is faithful to forgiue vs:</hi> And it was
practised by Dauid, Psalm. 51. and
<pb facs="tcp:14012:54"/>
32. 5. The maner of making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is this; knowen sinnes, and
those which troble the conscience,
are to be confessed particularlie:
but vnknown sins generally. Psa. 19</p>
                  <p>6. Lastly, hence it is manifest,
that there is noe iustification by
workes. Our sinnes are debtes: &amp;
so also are all workes of the lawe.
Now, how can any man discharge
one debt by another?</p>

Zacha. 12. 10. It is that

A man may, I graunt, babble and

debt that is ciuill, and comes by
lawfull bargaining, but of hurtes
and dammages; which ar done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs in our bodies, goods, or good

a man may exact them, so he doe it
with shewing of mercie.</p>

forgiue trespasses, seeing God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

trespasse which anie do to their
neighbours, ther be two offences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
one to God, another to man. In the
<pb facs="tcp:14012:56"/>
first respect it is called a sin, which
God onlie forgiues: In the other
respect, it is called an injurie or
dammage: &amp; so man may forgiue
it. When a man is robbed, the law
is broken by stealing, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie
that is done, is against a man
that hath his goods stolne. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie,
as it is an injurie, a man may
forgiue: but as it is a sinne, he can
not, but God onlie.</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether may a man
aright pray this petition, and yet
sue him at the law, who hath inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him. <hi>An.</hi> Yea, for a man may
in an holie maner sew another for
an injury: and as a souldier in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
warre may kill his enemie, and
yet loue him: so may a man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
an injurie, and yet seeke in a
Christian maner the remedie: but
in doing of this, wee must obserue
fiue thinges. 1. We are to tak heed
of all priuate revenge and inward
hatred, which if we conceiue, wee
<pb facs="tcp:14012:57"/>
doe not forgiue. 2. We must take
heed of offence, and haue care that
our doinges bee not scandelous to
the Church. 3. Our sutes must be
taken in hand to maintaine godly
peace: for, if all injuries were put
vp, there would bee no ciuill state
or gouernment. 4. It must be, that
the partie offending may bee cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised,
and bee brought to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for his fault: for, if many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
were not repressed, they woulde
growe worse. 5. Law must bee the
last remedie: as Physitions vse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
remedies, when weaker wil
not serue: euen so must we vse law,
as the last meanes, when all other
faile. The dealing of the worlde in
this case, is no example for vs to
follow. For through rage and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
they will abide no priuate
agreement: and therefore, they vse
the law in the first place, so did the
Corinthians, but what saith Paule
1. Cor. 6. 7. <hi>It is vtterlie a fault a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14012:57"/>
But if the Lawe bee vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
a Christian may sue at Law,
and loue the partie sued; for there
is difference betweene dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a man before a Magistrate,
and the dealing of one priuat man
with another. For priuate dealing
is commonlie reuenge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vnlawfull.</p>

Consider these comparisons. A

an impression or marke like it

know that ther hath bin a seale, the

so it is in euery one, that hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse

our sauiour did not teach vs thus

Because forgiuenesse of sinnes, and
wonderfull temptations, bee inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable
companions in this life:
which thing wee finde to be true,
both in Gods word, and in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

in this world so beaten and buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with temptations, as the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

for the pardon of his sins. This
is the estate, that fewe men in the
worlde are acquainted with, for
they ar neuer troubled with temp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation,
but liue in all peace &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes,

<pb facs="tcp:14012:59"/>
Luke. 11. 21. When <hi>the strong man
armed keepes his hold, the thinges that
he possesseth are in peace.</hi> Euen so, the
wicked of the world, being posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of Satan, are not a whit mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by him with any temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s;
Neither need he, seeing hee hath
them at commandement, to doe
what he wil. But when a man once
begins to make conscience of sin,
and to sue vnto the Lord for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of his offences, and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
in dislike of sinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than:
then the enemie bestirs him,
and vseth all means to bring that
man to famine: he offereth all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of temptations to molest him,
and neuer affoord this poore sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
anie rest. Hereupon, hee for
feare of being ouercome, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
must pray vnto the Lord, that
he may not be led into temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                  <p>Here some christian conscience

Therefore, I am not in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,

the latter being a declaration of
the former, <hi>Lead vs not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
how is that done? by deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vs from euill.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Temptation.</hi>] Temptation is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els, but the entisement of
the soul or heart, either by the cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption
of mans nature, or the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
<pb facs="tcp:14012:60"/>
of the world, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
to any sinne. Iam. 1. 13. <hi>God
temptes no man.</hi> That is, God moues
no man to sinne.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Lead vs not</hi>] Or carrie vs not
into temptation, to be led, is to be
ouercome of the temptation, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it preuailes and gets the victorie.
Then the meaning is this. When
wee are mooued or entised to sin,
Lord keepe vs, that wee be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome:
and giue thou an issue
with the temptation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Question.</hi> God is iust, and cannot
sinne: but if he lead men into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
shall he not be the authour
of sinne? <hi>Answer.</hi> Indeed many fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to charge God with sin, read
the wordes thus, <hi>suffer vs not to be
led,</hi> but the text is very piaine, <hi>leade
or carrie vs not.</hi> And the scriptures
elsewhere, vse the like phrases of
God. Exod. 7. 3. God is said to <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Pharaos heart.</hi> 2. Sam. 24. 1. The
Lorde <hi>mooued Dauid to number the
<pb facs="tcp:14012:61"/>
people.</hi> 2. Thes. 2. 11. <hi>God sent strong
delusions, that men might beleeue lies.</hi>
These and such like places haue a
woorthie meaning, thus to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.
There is no action of man
or of the deuil, absolutely euil: but
although in some respects it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
yet in some other it is good:
for we are not thus to think, that
as there is a maine good, so also
there is a maine euill. Thus then,
temptation being an action, it is
not in euery respect euill: but in
some good, in some euill. And so
farre forth as it is good, the Lord
workes it: but as it is euill, he doth
not worke it, but willingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
it to be done by him &amp; Satan.</p>
                  <p>1. And there be foure respects
in which God may be a worker in
temptations, and yet be free from
sinne. 1. First, he tempteth by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
occasions and objects, to trie
whether a man will sinne or not. A
maister suspecting his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that
<pb facs="tcp:14012:61"/>
in worde professeth fidelitie, layes
a purse of money in his way, to try
if he will steale it: which if he steal,
he hath found by watching him, a
secreete theefe; and so hath laide
him open, for deceiuing any more.
Nowe, this trying o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him is no sin,
though he sinne in stealing. In the
same manner tempteth God his
owne seruants to prooue and trye
them. Deut. 13. 3. <hi>Tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rd your God with al your hart</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, God leades into
temptation, by withdrawing his
grace. Neither can this be a sinne
in God: because he is bound to no
man to giue him grace. And heere
is a difference betweene the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of God &amp; Sathan. God holds
backe grace, when hee tempteth,
the Deuill suggesteth euill mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14012:62"/>
3. Euery action so far foorth as
it is an action, is good, &amp; of God.
Act. 17. 28. <hi>In him we liue, mooue, and
haue our being.</hi> Therfore, God is a
worker in temptations, so far forth
as they ar actions. One man killes
another: the very mouing of the
body, in the doing of this villanie
is of God: but the wickednes of
the action, is from man and the
deuill. Againe, a man rides vpon
a lame horse, and stirres him: the
rider is the cause of the motion,
but the horse himselfe of the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
motion. So God is the author
of euery action, but not of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
of the action.</p>
                  <p>4. The fourth way, is in regarde
of the end. God tempts his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
only to correct and humble them
for their sinnes, and to trye howe
they will abide the crosse, and to
moue them the more to loue him.
Deut. 8. 2. God afflictes the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israell, <hi>to trie them whether
<pb facs="tcp:14012:62"/>
they would keepe his commandements.</hi>
2. Chron. 32. 31. <hi>He trieth Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,
to see what was in his hart.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
end in tempting, is onely to
bring the partie vnto destruction.
Thus we neede not for to say, that
God in some respectes doth leade
his seruants into temptations.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Deliuer vs from euill</hi>] that is, free
vs from the power of the flesh, the
deuill and the world. Some take e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
in this place, only for the deuil,
but wee may take it more largely,
for all spirituall enemies. 1. Iohn.
5. 19. <hi>The vvhole world lyeth in euill.</hi>
vz. Vnder the power of sinne and
Satan. These words (as I haue said)
are a proofe and explanation of
the former; for when a man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from euill, he is not led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
temptation: the cause being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, the effect ceaseth.</p>

is, that can work an euill action, &amp;

                  <p>2. Whereas we say, <hi>Lead vs not,
&amp;c.</hi> We note, that the deuil in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
can go noe further, then
God permits him.</p>
                  <p>3. Wee are not to pray, that
temptations be quite taken from
vs, or that we be whollie freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
them: but that they doe not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
vs. For it is the Lordes wil,
that his Church should be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Nay, Dauid desired some kind
of temptations. Psal. 26. 1. <hi>Prooue
me O Lord.</hi> And Iames saith, <hi>account
it for exceeding ioy, when ye shall fal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

betwene Gods kingdome,
power, and glory; &amp; those of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kings, it is said, thine is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
&amp;c. that is, God hath all
these in himself, and from himself,
and they from him.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>The kingdome</hi>] These wordes. 1.
Chron. 29. 11. at fully expounded.
<hi>Thine, O Lord, is greatnesse, power, and
<pb facs="tcp:14012:64"/>
victorie, and praise: for al that is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
&amp; earth is thine: thine is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
&amp; thou excellest as head ouer al,
&amp;c.</hi> The kingdome is said to bee
Gods, because hee is absolute pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor,
and owner of al things that
are; and also hath soueraigne rule
ouer all things at his will. Nowe
out of this first propertie of God,
we may gather a strong motiue, to
induce vs to pray vnto him alone.
For seeing all thinges are his, both
in heauen and earth whatsoeuer;
therefore, wee must come to him
for the graces and blessings which
wee desire.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>The power</hi>] Oftentimes, earthly
princes haue kingdomes, yet want
power: but God hath kingdom, &amp;
power also: yea, his power is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
and he can do al that he wil, &amp;
more then hee will: as for those
things which come of impotencie;
he cannot do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for if he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

should not be omnipotent. And as
<pb facs="tcp:14012:65"/>
he is omnipotent in himselfe, so all
the power which any creture hath,
is from him alone. <hi>Question.</hi> Howe
can this be, seeing the deuill hath

God? <hi>Ans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

but rather a want of power: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
all the strength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that Satan hath, is of God.</p>
                  <p>And from this second property,
is taken another motiue, to moue
vs to pray vnto God. Because all
power being his, wee can neuer do
any of the thinges which we aske,
but by power receiued from him.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Thine is the glory.</hi>] This thirde
propertie of God ariseth from the
two former, for seeing the title &amp;
interest in all things, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
whereby they are disposed and
gouerned, is of God: therefore it
followes, that all glory is his: yea,
in him is fulnes of glory, and the
glory of the creature is all of him.
To sinfull men <hi>belonges nothing, but
<pb facs="tcp:14012:65"/>
shame and confusion.</hi> Dan. 9. verse 7.</p>
                  <p>This third propertie ministreth
a thirde motiue to induce men to
pray vnto God alone. For seeing
all glory by right is his: therefore
wee must invocate his holy name;

                  <p>[<hi>For euer,</hi>] The words in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall

signifies the space of an hundred
years: but here it is taken for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;
because eternitie is nothing
but the multiplication of ages.
And as eternitie is heere noted by
ages: so on the contrary we reade,
that eternitie is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a certaine

here the part is put for the whole,

                  <p>1. HEre wee learne in praier,
to abase our selues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and vtterly to deny all
that is in vs. Kingdome, power, &amp;
glory, is all his, not ours: wee are
no better then rebels and traitors
to him: if we haue any good thing,
it is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, euen the grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we pray. And hee that in praier
will not confesse this, shal no more
be heard, then the insolent begger
that wil not acknowledg his want.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, againe in praier
we learne, that we must be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of two things, and build vpon
<pb facs="tcp:14012:66"/>
them, Gods power and will: his
power, in that he is able, his wil, in
that he is careful to performe our
requests, as it was noted in the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>face:
the first of these, is set out in
his kingdome, and power. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is noted, in that glory is his,
2. Cor. 1. 20. <hi>For al the promises of God

of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. And hence wee gather, that
praier and thanks-giuing must go
together; for as in the six petitions
wee made request to GOD; so in
these wordes, we giue him thanks
and praise him. Phil. 4. 6. <hi>But in al
thinges, let your requests be shevved to
God in praier and supplication, vvith
thanksgiuing.</hi> There is none, but in
want he will be ready to pray: but
when we haue receiued, we ar slack
in giuing of thanks: but hee which
wil pray aright, must join the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both
together. And the sum of all Gods
praise stands in these three points.
<pb facs="tcp:14012:67"/>
1. That he is an absolute King. 2.
Secondly, that hee hath absolute
power to rule al thinges. 3. That
hauing power and a kingdome, he
hath glory also, which appears in

                  <p>Thus muche of the vse of these
words altogether. Now let vs mak
vse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> particularly. First, where
as we say, <hi>Thine is the kingdome.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
and rulers must knowe,
that all the authoritie and rule
which they haue is from the Lord;
&amp; therefore they must remember
to order themselues as gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents,
vsing their power to bring
men in subjection to Gods lawes:
<pb facs="tcp:14012:67"/>
and referring all their callings to

Wee are admonished, when we
are to performe anie worke, as to
doe seruice to God, to walk in our
callings, that we haue no power of
our selues: and for this cause wee
must ask power at Gods handes,
that we may be enabled to walke
vprightly before him, and doe our
duties.</p>
                  <p>3 In saying, <hi>Thine is the glory,</hi> we
learn, that if we wold haue a good
report and praise among men: wee
must aboue all things, seeke Gods
glorie, not regarding so much our
own. If he giue thee praise among
men, giue him thankes: if not, be
content, because al glorie is his.</p>

what they are: Now followeth the
third part, which is the assent or
testification of faith, required in
prayer, in this word <hi>Amen.</hi> And it
containes more than men at the
first woulde imagine: It signifies
<hi>Certainlie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so be it,</hi> or, <hi>it shal be so.</hi> 2.
Cor. 1. 20. It is often taken for a
bare assent of the people, saying
<hi>Amen</hi> to the Minister: but in this
place it containes more: for euerie
point in this prayer, is not onlie a
direction for publike prayer, but
for priuate also, and must be saide
as well of the Minister, as of the
people. Nowe then, there being
two principall thinges in prayer:
the first a desire of grace: the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
faith, whereby wee beleeue that
God will grant things desired. The
first is expressed in the sixe petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
The latter is set forth in this
worde <hi>Amen,</hi> carrying this sence
in effect. As we haue craued these
thinges at thy handes, O Lord, so
<pb facs="tcp:14012:68"/>
we doe beleeue, that for Christ his
sake, in good time thou wilt grant
them to vs. Therefore, this part is
more excellent than the former,
by howe much our faith is more
excellent than our desire. For in
this word is contained the testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of our faith, whereas the
petitions are onlie testifications of
our desires. And as it is in the end,
so also it is the seale of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to make them authentical, and
it is to be vsed (as I take it) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
for this end, to answer the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
but also to testifie our faith,
for the things desired.</p>

not filled with faith, but with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.

til faith come into a man.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, we see what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
worke prayer is, in which,
two moste excellent graces of a
Christian man bee shewed foorth:
hungring after mercy &amp; faith: this
might moue men to learn to pray,
praier being the exercise of grace.</p>

               <head>Of the vse of the Lords praier.</head>
               <p>THe principal vse of the Lords
prayer is, to direct God his
Church, in making their praiers in
all places, at al times, and vpon all
occasions, though their praiers
should be innumerable: and vnles
they be framed after this, they can
not be right.</p>
               <p>In the vsing of it for direction,
there be three thinges required. 1
The first is, the knowledge of the
Lordes prayer, and al the partes
thereof. He that would pray by it,
must vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the meaning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the wants therein to be bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and the graces to bee desired,
for which end it hath bin expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
2. Knowing this, there is in
the seconde place required thus
much skil, that he be able to referr
euerie want &amp; grace to one of the
sixe petitions: for example: feeling
in himselfe pride of heart, he must
be able to say, this is a want in the
<pb facs="tcp:14012:70"/>
first petition: and feeling a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; slownes in doing Gods com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandment,
he must be able to say,
this is a sin to be prayed against in
the 3. petition. Thus, euery want
he must refer to his proper hed; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
he must refer euery grace to
be desired, to one of the sixe peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
is stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth in temptation to
the sixt; assiance in Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to the fourth; knowledge of
God to the first, &amp;c. and so in the
rest. 3. In the third place, he must
before he pray, consider what bee
his wantes and imperfections,
which moste trouble him, as also
the graces which he wold obtain:
then, for the helping of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
he must goe to the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and he must set those thinges
first in his mind, which do concern
the first petition; and those which
concern the second petition, must
haue the second place in his mind
and so he must proceed in order as
<pb facs="tcp:14012:70"/>
shall haue occasion. Thus a man
keeping in minde the order of the
petitions as they stand, shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by referring euery grace and
want vnto his proper head, to mak
a distinct prayer, and to varie it as
time, place, and other occasions
shall moue him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Must we of necessity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
al the petitions in conceiuing
a praier? <hi>An.</hi> No, but only those
which doe principallie belong to
the time, place &amp; occasion; as Paule
maketh a prayer, Col. 1. 9. 10. and
all the points of it may be referred
to the third and last petitions.</p>
               <p>Againe, a Christian man may
mak an excellent confession of his
sins by this praier, if he shal, keping
the order of the petitions, confesse
and bewaile the sins which euerie
petition requires vs to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst:
&amp; it serues to mak a thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing
to God: Thus, let a man
remember all the graces which he
<pb facs="tcp:14012:71"/>
hath receiued from God: let him
then refer them to the petitions,
and giue thankes to God after the
order of them, turning euery peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into a thanksgiuing.</p>
               <q>Of the circumstances of prayer.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Whether a man is to
vse a voice in prayer? <hi>Ans.</hi> In publik
praier it is requisite that there bee
a voice, for the Minister is the
month of the people, and to the
prayer which hee conceiues, they
giue assent. For priuate prayer, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of a voice is conuenient: yet
so, as it may be done in silence. 1.
the Lord gaue vs the voyce, as well
as the heart to blesse him withall.
Iam. 3. 9. 2 God created the tong
as wel as the heart, and so will bee
praised by both. 3 The voice often
stir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vp the heart; and againe, the
veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of affection doth often
draw out a voice: the voice then in
priuate prayer is requisite, yet in
some cases may bee omitted, for it
<pb facs="tcp:14012:71"/>
is not absolutely necessarie. Moses
and Anna prayed in silence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. What gesture is to bee
vsed in prayer? <hi>An.</hi> The word doth
not affoord any certain direction.
Our Sauiour &amp; his Disciples prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in diuers gestures, kneling, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
groueling, looking to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
looking downe to the earth,
sitting, lying, &amp;c. Luk. 11. 41. Act. 7
God respectes not the gesture, but
the affection of the heart; yet two
thinges must be alwaies in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture:
1. that it be comelie. 2. that
it do fitlie expresse the affection of
the hart; as when we ask mercie, to
look to heauen, when wee bewaile
our sins, to look downward, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi> 3. What place must we
pray in? <hi>An.</hi> The place is set down,
1. Tim. 2. 8. we may pray in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
of which ther is no difference:
Some will say, that in the time of
the Law, the Tabernacle and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were places for diuine prayer.
<pb facs="tcp:14012:72"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Temple and Tabernacle
wer types of Christ, &amp; his Church,
and the vnitie of it: but now, wee
hauing the thing it selfe, signified
thereby, may pray in al places. Our
Sauior prayed in the wildernes, on
the Mount; Peter on the house top
Paule by the sea shore: yet so, that
publik praier must be vsed in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
places, as Churches, chappels,
&amp;c. not because in them is more
holinesse, but for orders sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. What is the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for praier? <hi>Ans. Praie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie.</hi>
1. The 5. 7. that is, vpon al
occasions, or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man begins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
busines, whether it be in word,
or deed, Col. 3. 17. or as Daniel,
who <hi>praied thrise euerie daie.</hi> Dan. 6.
11. or as Dauid, who <hi>praied at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
morning, and noontide,</hi> Ps. 55. 18
and <hi>seuen times a daie.</hi> vz. many. Psa.
119. 140. Thus we shal pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie.
Euery day affoords three
especial occasions. 1. The entrance
<pb facs="tcp:14012:72"/>
to our callings in the morning. 2.

at noonetide. 3. the going to rest

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Why doth God defer
to hear the praiers of his seruants?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. to prooue them by delay.
<pb facs="tcp:14012:73"/>
2. To exercise their saith. 3. To
make them acknowledge, that the
things which they receiue, ar gods
gifts, and not from themselues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.
That graces quickly giuen might
not be lightlie estemed 5. That an
hungring after grace, might bee
sharpened and increased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> After what maner doth
God hear his seruants prayers. <hi>An.</hi>
Two waies. First, by granting the
thing which was asked according
to his will. Secondly, by denying
the thing desired, and by giuing
somthing proportional to it. Thus
God denies temporary blessings,
and in the roome thereof, giues e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
in heauen. Thus he refuseth
to remoue the crosse from his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes,
and giues in stead thereof
strength and patience. Christ prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the cup might bee remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
It was not remooued, but hee
in his manhood was enabled to
beare the wrath of God. When</p>

               <p>THese wordes containe two
partes, a praier, and a thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.
In the praier these pointes
are to be marked. First, the gesture;
<hi>I bowe my knees,</hi> whereby Paul signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
his humble submission vnto
God in praier. Secondly, To whom
<pb facs="tcp:14012:74"/>
he praies. To the father; who is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by two titles: the first, <hi>the
Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> and
that by nature, as he is God, and
as hee is man, by personall vnion.
The other title: <hi>Of vvhome the whole
familie which is in heauen and earth, is
named:</hi> In which words, is set down
a description of the Church, first it
is a <hi>Familie,</hi> because it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Gods elect children, vnder
the gouernment of one Father: 1.
Timoth. 3. 15. It is called the <hi>house
of God.</hi> Ephes. 2. 19. They that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
are saide to be of the house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
of God: Secondly, the partes
of the Catholicke Church are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
namely, the Saintes in heauen
departed, and saintes liuing on
earth: Thirdly, it is said to be <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the Father of Christ,</hi> because
as the Father of Christ, is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of this familie; so also this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie
is called by him. Genes. 6. 2.
Dan. 9. 18. Thirdly, the matter of
<pb facs="tcp:14012:74"/>
the praier standes of foure moste
worthie points.</p>
               <p>The first, is strength, to bear the
crosse, and to resist spiritual temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
vers. 16. where this strenth
is sette out by diuers arguments.
First, that it is the meere gifte of
God, <hi>that he wold grant you:</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the cause of strength, <hi>by his spirit:</hi>
Thirdly, the subiect or place, wher
this strength must bee, <hi>in the inner
man:</hi> that is, in the whole man, so
farre foorth, as hee is renewed by
grace. Ephes. 9. 24. The second is,
<hi>the dwelling of Christ, by faith in their
hearts:</hi> Faith is, when a man beeing
seriously humbled for his sinnes,
is further in conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce perswaded,
and resolued of the pardon of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and of reconciliation to god. Now
where this perswasion is indeede,
there followes necessarilie, Christs
dwelling in the heart, which stands
in two thinges; the first, is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and ruling of the thoghts,
<pb facs="tcp:14012:75"/>
affections and desires of the heart,
according to his will, as a maister
rules in his house: the second, is
the continuance of his rule. For
hee cannot be saide to dwell in a
place, who rules in it but for a day.</p>
               <p>The third, is the knowledg, and
the acknowledgement of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite greatnes of God his loue in
Christ, an effect of the former, vers.
18. 19. the wordes are thus expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<hi>Rooted and grounded.</hi> Here the
loue of God, wherewith hee loues
the elect, is as a roote and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Gods benefits; election,
vocation, iustification, and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
Men ar rooted and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in loue, when Gods spirite as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
their hearts of Gods loue, &amp;
doth giue them some inward sense
and feeling of it. For then they are
as it were sensiblie put into the
roote, and laid on the foundation:
<hi>With al Saintes:</hi> Paule desires this
benefite, not onely to the Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb facs="tcp:14012:75"/>
but also for all the faithfull
with them. <hi>What is the length, the
bredth.</hi> Here is a speech borrowed
from Geomitricians, and it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the absolute greatnes, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitenes
of Gods loue, and that it
is like a worlde, which for length
bredth, height &amp; depth, is endles.
Heere note the order of receuing
grace. First, Christ dwelles in the
hart by faith: Secondly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comes
a sense and feeling of Gods loue,
as it were, by certain drops there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
Thirdly, after this, ariseth a ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifull
knowledge, and apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods loue, and as it wer the
powring out of a sea into a mans
heart, that for greatnes, hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bottome nor bank. <hi>And knowe
the loue of Christ,</hi> these wordes (as I
take it) are an exposition of the
former, for to comprehende the
loue of God, is nothing else, but
to knowe the loue of Christ: consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
that all whome the father
<pb facs="tcp:14012:76"/>
loueth, hee loueth them in Christ:
<hi>Which passeth knowledge:</hi> That is,
which for the greatnes of it, noe
man can fullie know.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing, is the fulnesse
of Gods graces. verse 19. Here the
<hi>fulnesse of God,</hi> doth not signifie the
fulnes of the Godhead, or deuine
nature, but the perfection of the
inner man, which shall not be till
after this life, Nowe followes the
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ksgiuing, or the praise of God,
ver. 20. 21. containing these points
1. The matter of praise, his power
and bountifulnes, <hi>whereby he canne
worke exceeding aboundantly, aboue all
we ask or think:</hi> and both these are
not only to be conceiued in mind,
but also may be felt in the heart,
<hi>according to the power that worketh in
vs.</hi> 2. the forme of praise, <hi>glorie vnto
God by Christ,</hi> as all benefits are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
from the father by Christ.
The proper place of true praise of
God <hi>the Church.</hi> 4. The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb facs="tcp:14012:76"/>
of his praise, <hi>through all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for euer.</hi>

parts. In the first, Paul praieth
for increase of loue in the Philip.
whether it be to God or to men,
verse 9. and he shewes the meanes
of increase, which ar two: <hi>knowledg</hi>
and <hi>sense</hi> or feeling. For (to goe
backeward) the more a godly man
feeles Gods loue, and hath expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb facs="tcp:14012:77"/>
of Gods word in himselfe,
the more he knowes Gods word,
and perceiues his loue vnto him:
the more hee is assured of Gods
loue, the more he loues god again,
and his neighbour for his sake.</p>
               <p>The second thing praied for, is
the gift of discerning, whereby me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
know what is true, what fals, what
is to be done, what to be left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done:
the ends of this gift ar two.
The first, that by meanes of it, they
may bee pure or sincere: that is,
keepe a good conscience before
God and men, in their liues and
callings. The second is, <hi>to be without
offence:</hi> that is, innocent, giuing
no occasions of euill to any, and
not taking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offered by others:
and the continuance of these is no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>to the daie of Christ,</hi> which is the
time in which he commeth to vs,
either by our death, or by the last
judgement.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he praieth, that they

might abounde in good workes,
which ar described by a similitud;

and a thankesgiuing. In the

of Gods</hi> reueiled <hi>vvill</hi> in his worde,

<hi>Wisdom,</hi> which is not only to know
Gods word, but also to apply it to
