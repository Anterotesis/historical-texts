         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and other ſuperſtitious Orders of the Popiſh pretended Cleargie, moſt diſloyally,
treacherouſly and wickedly conſpired to ſurprize His Majeſties Caſtle of Dublin, his
Majeſties principall Fort in this Kingdome, the Citie of Dublin, and all other Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Fortifications in this Realm, to maſſacre Vs the Lords Iuſtices and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
to deſtroy and roote out all the Proteſtant Brittiſh, and all other Proteſtants in
this Realm; and finally, to deprive His Majeſtie of this His antient and rightfull
Crowne, and Soveraignty of this Kingdome, and to poſſeſſe themſelves thereof, all
which was by the ſaid Conſpirators plotted, and intended to be acted on the 23. day
of October in the yeare of our Lord God 1641. A Conſpiracie ſo inhumane, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and cruell, as the like was never before heard of in any age or Kingdome, and
if it had taken effect in that fulneſſe which was intended by the Conſpirators, it had
occaſioned the utter ruine of this whole Kingdome, and the Governement thereof.</p>
            <p>And howſoever it pleaſed Almighty God in his unſearchable Wiſedome and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
as a juſt puniſhment and deſerved correction to us for our ſinnes, and the ſins of this Nation, to permit then,
and afterwards, the effecting of a great part of that deſtruction complotted by thoſe wicked Conſpirators, whereby
many thouſand Brittiſh and Proteſtants have been maſſacred, many thouſands of others of them have been affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and tormented, with the moſt exquiſit torments that the malice of the Divell could ſuggeſt to the miſchievous
Rebells, and all mens eſtates (aſwell thoſe whom they trayterouſly ſlue, as all others) are utterly waſted, ruined,
and deſtroyed, yet as his Divine Majeſtie hath in all ages ſhewen his power and mercy in the miraculous and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Deliverance of his Church, and in the protection of Religious Kings and States, ſo even in the midſt of his
Iuſtice, he was graciouſly pleaſed to extend mercie to His Majeſtie, and to this His Kingdome and good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
therein, not onely in miraculouſly diſcovering to Vs the Lords Iuſtices, that hideous and bloudy Treaſon, not
many houres before the appointed time for the execution thereof, but alſo in preſerving the ſaid Caſtle and Cittie of
Dublin, and ſome other Citties, Townes and Caſtles in the Kingdome, from the bloudy hands of the barbarous
Conſpirators, as alſo in thereby rendring Deliverance to the Lives of Vs the Lords Iuſtices and Councell, and of
all the Brittiſh and Proteſtants in Dublin, and in the ſaid other Citties, Townes, and Caſtles preſerved, and of
ſundry other Brittiſh and Proteſtants, falne even into the hands of thoſe Rebellious Conſpirators, and likewiſe in
ſending Vs ſuccours, (whereby with Gods bleſſing) We have hitherto continued ſafe under his mighty protection,
notwithſtanding the unexampled rage and implacable fury and malice of thoſe mercileſſe enemies of Gods truth.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as We doe moſt humbly and juſtly acknowledge Gods Iuſtice in Our deſerved puniſhments, in thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
which from the Councells and actions of thoſe Conſpirators &amp; their Adherents, are falne upon Vs, and this
Nation in generall, ſo We doe in like manner acknowledge, that even in exerciſing of that his Iuſtice, he remembred
mercie alſo, and magnified his mercie to Vs, in thoſe great bleſſings which We humbly confeſſe to have proceeded
meerely from his infinite goodneſſe and mercy, and therefore to his moſt holy Name We doe aſcribe all Honor, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Remembrance, that all ages to come may yeeld praiſes to his Divine Majeſtie for the ſame, and have in memorie
<hi>This joyfull day of Deliverance.</hi> We doe ordaine and eſtabliſh by this Our Act of Councell (in the meane time untill
by Authority of Parliament it ſhall be made a Law to be delivered over to poſterity) that all and ſingular Miniſters

ſhall alwayes upon the 23. day of October ſay Morning Prayer, and give Thankes unto Almighty God for
this moſt happy and miraculous Deliverance, and for our preſervation hitherto, farre above the expectation of
thoſe wretched Conſpirators. And that all, and every perſon and perſons, inhabiting within this Realme of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
ſhall alwayes upon that day diligently and faithfully reſort to the Pariſh Church or Chappell accuſtomed, or to
ſome uſuall Church or Chappell where the ſaid Morning Prayer, Preaching, or other ſervice of God ſhall be uſed,
