            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Heweth, that notwithſtanding his Majeſties gracious Anſwer to the humble <hi>Petition</hi> of his Loyall Subjects in ſummoning this preſent Parliament, with the great care, and endeavoured paines, taken by both Houſes for the removing the heavie Grievances in Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, whereof the <hi>Petitioners</hi> have already received ſome fruit; for which they deſire to returne their moſt humble and utmoſt thankes, yet nevertheleſſe, they are inforced with all Humility to repreſent to this moſt Honourable Aſſembly, ſome of theſe Obſtructions which doth ſtill hinder that Freedome and fulneſſe of Trade in this <hi>City</hi> they have formerly had, and with conſidering the numerous Multitude thereon depending, they conceive it not able comfortably to ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>As the unſetled Condition of the Kingdome, even ſince the Troubles in <hi>Scotland</hi> hath cauſed both ſtrangers, and alſo of our owne, who did furniſh great ſummes of money to uſe to call it in, and remit much of it by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change unto Forraigne parts, and ſtands now in Expectation of what the iſſue of things may bee.</p>
            <p>The ſtopping money in the <hi>Mint,</hi> which till then was accompted the ſafeſt place, and ſureſt ſtaple in theſe parts in the world, ſtill doth hinder the importation of Bullyon, the <hi>Scots</hi> now diſabled to pay ſuch debts as they owe to the <hi>Petitioners</hi> and others in the City, and by reaſon of the oppreſſions exerciſed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> their debts alſo are detayned there.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade by reaſon of our generall diſtractions and feares is ſo much decayed, that Countrey Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cannot pay their debts in <hi>London</hi> as formerly.</p>
            <p>The great ſummes of money unduely taken by his Majeſties Officers and Farmers, for impoſitions upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize exported and imported, and the want of reliefe in Courts of Iuſtice againſt them.</p>
            <p>The drawing out from the City great ſummes of money (which is the life and ſpirit of Trade) for his Majeſties ſervice in the North, and being there imployed is not yet returned.</p>
            <p>Beſides all which from what ſtrong and ſecret oppoſition the Petitioners know not, they have not receiv'd what ſo much time and paines might give and cauſe to hope, but ſtill incendiaries of the Kingdomes and other notorious offenders remaine unpuniſhed, the affaires of the Church notwithſtanding many Petitions concerning it and long debate about it remaines unſettled, the Papiſts ſtill armed, the Lawes againſt them not executed, ſome of the moſt Active of them ſtill at Court, Prieſts and Jeſuites not yet baniſhed, The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Popiſh army not yet disbanded, Courts of Iuſtice not yet reformed, and the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who as now appeares, hath counſelled the plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this City, and putting it to fine and ranſome, and ſaid <hi>it would never be well, till ſome of the Aldermen were hanged up,</hi> becauſe they would not yeeld to illegall leavies of moneyes, hath ſo drawne out and ſpent his time in his buſineſſe to the very great charge of the whole Kingdome, and his endeavour to obtaine yet more; all which makes us feare there may be practices now in hand to hinder the birth of your great endeavours, and that we lye under ſome more dangerous plot then we can diſcover.</p>
            <p>All which premiſſes with their feares and diſtractions growing there-from, and from things of the like nature, the Petitioners humbly offer to the moſt grave conſideration of this moſt Honourable aſſembly, as being the true cauſes of decay of Trade, diſcouragement of Tradeſmen, and of the great ſcarcity of monies, with the conſequences they labour under.</p>
            <p>And doe humbly pray that their ſaid grievances may be redreſſed, the cauſes of their feares removed, Iuſtice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted upon the ſaid Earle and other incendiaries and offenders, the rather in regard till then, the Petitioners hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, neither Religion nor their lives, liberties or eſtates can be ſecured.</p>
