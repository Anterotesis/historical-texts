            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the Apoſtles moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo much: Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth now his reaſon; where, firſt, the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>I haue a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in all things:</hi>] Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Euidence and confirmation, <hi>I am perſwaded:</hi>] ſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, <hi>I deſire to liue honestly.</hi> The points we note are two: Firſt, the Apoſtle ſecures the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6265:4"/>thing <hi>(a good Conſcience.)</hi> Secondly, hee reſts in the confirmation of it.</p>
            <p>From the firſt this:</p>
            <p>Euery Chriſtian ſhould ſo order the matter, that hee may truly ſay, <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
               <hi>I haue a good Conſcience:</hi> This the thing that muſt be made good, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured; to wit, <hi>a good conſcience.</hi> Here, leſt it be objected, that the point holds in ſuch as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was, (Preachers) who muſt be men of Conſcience, not in all; Wee, muſt doe two things; firſt, ſee what warrant we haue for the raiſing; next, for practizing of the point. Our warrant for deducing a generall from this particular, is fetcht; firſt, from the end and vſe of the word in generall, namely, our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as appeares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>Euery Chriſtian ſhould ſo order the matter, that hee may truly ſay, <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
               <hi>I haue a good Conſcience:</hi> This the thing that muſt be made good, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured; to wit, <hi>a good conſcience.</hi> Here, leſt it be objected, that the point holds in ſuch as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was, (Preachers) who muſt be men of Conſcience, not in all; Wee, muſt doe two things; firſt, ſee what warrant we haue for the raiſing; next, for practizing of the point. Our warrant for deducing a generall from this particular, is fetcht; firſt, from the end and vſe of the word in generall, namely, our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as appeares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from that generall precept of this Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8, 9. <hi>Furthermore, brethren, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer things are true, whatſoeuer things are honeſt, whatſoeuer things are iuſt, whatſoeuer things are pure, whatſoeuer things pertaine to loue, whatſoeuer things are of good report, if there be any vertue, if there be any praiſe, thinke on theſe things, Which yee haue both learned, and receiued, and heard, and ſeene in mee: thoſe things doe, and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, from the like preſident, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5, 6. <hi>Let your conuerſation be without couetouſneſſe, and be content with thoſe things that yee haue: for hee hath ſaid, I will not faile thee, neither forſake thee: So that we may baldly ſay, The Lord is my helper, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6265:4"/>will I feare what man can doe vnto me.</hi> Whence the inference is to all from one, <hi>Ioſhuah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, from Reaſon, though examples (as examples) ſimply binde not, yet reaſon and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept (that is to ſay, the Law of Nature and of God) doe binde: and therefore, when the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is grounded vpon common equity, and hath nothing priuate in it (vnleſſe haply for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree onely) and is backt by precept, then it's binding. Now thus ſtands the caſe here: Firſt, A man, as he is rationall (much more as he is a Chriſtian) is to regard his Conſcience. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Apoſtle, not onely in his Miniſtery, but in all other Relations and paſſages of life, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1. &amp; 24.16. nay, further, as his life was rifled into by the aduerſaries, with his Doctrine; ſo he Apologizes for that, with this, and grounds his perſwaſion, as much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Chriſtian liuing, as his faithfull preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Laſtly, the precept reaches all, as well as Preachers: and there's as good reaſon, why we as well as they, ſhould aſſure conſcience. For the firſt, the precept is no leſſe large, then plain; <note place="margin">

By this little ſaid, you ſee how it imports vs all, as well as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to conno this leſſon, and to ſay readily, I, and I, and I, and euery I, haue a good conſcience. But all that can be ſaid, is but an empty diſcourſe, and a contemplation farre off from the matter; for the truth is, no man can tell what the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of a good, what the miſery of a bad conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, but he who hath felt both; that man is but a ſtranger to himſelfe, and to conſcience, that doth not apprehend a thouſand times more, then hee can vtter in this kinde.

            <p>A ſecond ſort; They labour the matter of Conſcience much, but how? Their worke is not to perſwade their owne hearts with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> but other mens. A ſtrange folly, for a man to be more carefull of others then himſelfe; to feare others, to prize others aboue himſelfe: yet this is ordinary: Men ſtudy rather to ſeeme, then to be conſcionable; labour more to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue themſelues to others; then to their owne hearts; and this appeares thus: Firſt, in that they ſtand more vpon the forme, then the power of godlineſſe. Secondly, in that they ſet the beſt ſide outward, be more in profeſsion then in action; better abroad then at home; <note place="margin">Satis eſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipem externa ſpecie pium—Videri, &amp;c. de princ. c. <hi>18.</hi>
               </note> a farre off then at hand. To theſe I ſay but this: Firſt, this is but <hi>Machiauels</hi> Diuinity: They haue not ſo learned Chriſt. Secondly, this is but the Hypocrites guiſe; He makes cleane the outſide, he iuſtifies himſelfe before men onely.

Laſtly, this is a poore remedy, to couer a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken arme with a braue ſcarfe: Alas, thou muſt anſwere Conſcience, when all friends bee abſent: time will be, when death will ſnatch thee from men, and Conſcience will follow thee to Chriſts barre; then if thou canſt not ſtand before thine owne heart, how wilt thou ſtand

As for thoſe who make bold to father all vpon Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and vpon God, who wipe their impudent mouthes with the Harlot, and ſay, What haue we done? Who appeales to God with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Paul, Iudge me, O Lord:</hi> I lye not, my conſcience beareth witneſſe, God knowes my heart: I take on my conſcience, that I am vniuſtly ſlandered, when tis neither ſo, nor ſo; what will become of theſe men? with what faces will they looke vpon that conſcience, that Iudge, whom they haue made partakers, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Iudges, reuengers of their damned hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and more then diuelliſh impudency!

For the firſt, they haue (yea that they haue) as good Conſciences as any of them all. But what's their proofe? They are perſwaded ſo. But vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what reaſons? Why, they hope ſo. But vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6265:9"/>what ground? Why, their minde giues them ſo. Firſt, poore men!

            <p>Secondly, for an ill conſcience; What more terrible and hatefull to Nature, then death? yet death is ſweet to a wounded Conſcience; did hee thinke that death would end his torments, he would not liue; nay, though he apprehends a iudgement, a hell at the heeles of death, yet many times hee ruſhes vpon it, and concludes, that certainly hell can be no worſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably better then an ill conſcience.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Seconly, thou muſt make the Conſcience cleane; it muſt be pure and cleare, before it will be good: there ſtickes to the conſcience of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man naturally a great deale of guile and filth; It is much diſabled and maimed, loſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6265:13"/>much of its ſight and life, it hath learned to be idle, falſe, dumbe, &amp;c. It hath contracted ſo much guilt, foulneſſe, brawnineſſe by trading in ſinne, that there's do roome for peace, till it hath a new conſtitution, and be wholly reſined: now the way to haue it cleanſed, is to flye to bloud: as in the Law all things were purified with bloud, ſo here the bloud of Chriſt is that, that cleanſeth from all ſinne, that waſheth the Conſcience from dead workes; this bloud is both healing, and will cloze all our ſcarefull gaſhes; and purging and will take off all ſtains, an will make vs as white as ſnow. O goe to this Refiner, this Fuller, this Phyſitian, this high Prieſt, as the Word entitles him; nothing will ſerue, but his bloudy ſacrifice, and that will doe it; goe to him as to an All-ſufficient Sauiour, reſt in his bloud without further mixtures; plead his bloud ſhed for ſinners quite lost and vndone; beg that of God, asd <hi>Rahel</hi> did children of her husband, Giue me bloud or elſe I dye; apply that to thy bleeding ſoule, and ſay, I bleed; but Chriſt bled too for me; my ſinnes are bloudy, and his woundes are bloudy too; my bloud, if ſpilt, cannot make God that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that his bloud hath, and therefore Ile reſt in his bloud that ſpeakes peace, not venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as <hi>Abels</hi> did, and in him who quiets Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences as well as Seas and windes, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.39.

From a naturall Conſcience, and a Conſcience that is enlightened by the Word, we muſt proceed to a ſanctified Conſcience, and therefore we muſt labour to feele the power of Chriſts Bloud, and of Chriſts Life and Reſurrection in our ſoules, (who is King of righteouſneſſe and peace both, <hi>Heb</hi> 7.2.) quickning vs in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man, and ſtamping on vs our firſt impreſſe of wiſedome, holineſſe, righteouſneſſe, that we may be throughout ſanctified, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. and haue a beauty ſet vpon the ſoule and conſcience in all points, as the Apoſtle ſayes, and freed from dead workes by repentance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. and when the Conſcience is filled in ſome due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with light, and freed from ſinne, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with poſitiue grace, then (out of all) reſults that goodneſſe of Conſcience that now we ſpeake of, whereby its fitted for its ends and offices, and enabled to giue vs a good word and countenance.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6265:14"/>Similitude or Allegory. The Conſcience is a Clocke or Watch in the boſome; look what you would doe to keep that in frame, that muſt be done heere.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, If the Watch be amiſſe, who ſo fit to amend it as hee that made it? So heere, if any thing trouble Conſcience, that it goes not at all, or too faſt, or out of order, goe to Chriſt, and goe quickly, pray him to ſet theein ioynt againe, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, a Watch muſt be charily kept, the leaſt duſt, hayre, iogge almoſt diſtempers it; ſo the Conſcience, a little duſt in this eye marres both ſight and peace, a little ſinne crept in betweene the wheeles, ſets all at a ſtand: if euer thy Conſcience ſhall hold its comfort, and doe thee acceptable ſeruice, keepe it cleane, giue no allowance to any the leaſt ſinne: a man may liue and dye in ſome ſinne, and yet haue peace, when Conſcience is not priuy to it, and not conuinced of it: But there can bee no true comfort, where ſinne vnderhand is maintained and allowed, be it neuer ſo ſmall a one: let thy Conſcience haue this to ſay for thee: I can beare him witneſſe, that he bore his ſinnes as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and bid none of them welcome.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, a Watch muſt be daily lookt to (and thorowly too) if one pin be amiſſe, all is out of order: ſo the Conſcience; hee that makes not conſcience of all (according to his light) makes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6265:15"/>conſcience of none, and wil come to naught; and he that doth not looke vpon his conſcience eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and winde it vp, and ſet it in frame, will haue no conſcience in time: euery day thou muſt talke with thy ſelfe, and know what the Watchſaith, I meane, what report Conſcience makes of thy dayes worke, what it hath to ſay for or againſt thee. 'Tis with conſcience, as with Bay liffs and Stewards; if you call them to a daily reckoning, they will be carefull and vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but if you let things runne on, and reckon once at the hundreds end, they will not watch, or they will not be able to remember: ſo tis with conſcience; therefore often looke vpon it, and euery day conſult with it.</p>
            <p>The Watch muſt be vſed, elſe it ruſts, furres, and firſt begins to ſlacke its pace, and after ſome time will not goe at all: ſo conſcience, tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by vſe, as the ſtomacke is, and all things elſe; for euery thing is perfected and preſerued by its proper operations; as water is kept ſweet by running, the Conſcience by motion ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens it ſenſe, and ſooner feeles its weight: by motion it is facilitated and that's as good as oyle to the wheele of a Clocke; therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Conſcience, and that in all good duties, whether perſonall or locall.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Corſcience muſt haue its full walke, and thats very large; for a Conſcience is to bee obſerued in all religious and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6265:15"/>acts; and whoſo will preſerue his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, muſt firſt keepe himſelfe pure and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. Firſt, in Gods worſhips: Secondly, in workes of righteouſneſſe towards man: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in his owne place, he muſt make conſcience of his particulat calling and relation, and dwell vpon that: and ſecondly, for others, hee muſt remember <hi>Pauls</hi> aduice, Keepe thy ſelfe pure, be not partaker of other mens ſinnes. In ſhort, of all things hee muſt feare God moſt; of all men, feare himſelfe moſt and his owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; of all men out of himſelfe, feare his friends moſt, and his other mens ſinnes. Many a man waſhes his heart at home, and defiles his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience abroad; when he hath gotten his owne acquittance, hee intangles himſelfe in other mens debts by conniuence, ſilence, conſent, &amp;c. Take heed of this, for tis a hard matter to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge conſcience in company and to come off well. Well, let conſcience haue its perfect worke towards God and man, alone, and in company, and like a good fountaine, twill worke out its owne corruption and mudde, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord ſomething towards the waſhing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too, as it runnes along.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> One thing more, and then an end: As a Watch muſt be made, ſo ſet by rule: you muſt ſet it by the Sunne and time of day: So Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt haue its rule (though a ſubordinate rule it ſelfe) and this alſo muſt be ſet and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6265:16"/>by the Heauens: the great God hath onely power ouer his great office, and he in his Word is the iuſt meaſure of it: we muſt not ſay that's lawfull which he prohibits, that's ſinfull which he commands, that's arbitrary which hee holds neceſſary, that's neceſſary (for its nature) which he holds arbitrary: in ſhort, wee muſt neither widen nor ſtraiten the rule, but bring home our ſelues to that. Its hard to ſay where wee ſhall land, if we ſayle not by the Compaſſe, and looke not to the Heauens, and whether bee worſe to ſwallow all, or ſcruple all, is more then I can tell! This is once, he that either tyes vp, or lets out his Conſcience, more then God would haue him, makes worke for himſelfe, and way for temptation. In practice, tis good to bee of the reſtraining hand, where we are left to ourſelues: but for Opinion, Conſcience, and Iudgement, tis beſt to hold ones ſelfe free where the Word frees him, and bound, where the Word bindes him, elſe Conſcience will ſuffer wracke.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, by not vſing Conſcience, wee ſhall come in time to loſe, not onely the comfortable ſeruice of it (for enformation, reformation, conſolation, inſtigation, &amp;c.) but indeed all manner vſe, and ſence of it: Vſe legges (wee ſay) and have legges; ſo, vſe Conſcience, and haue Conſcience; for by vſe, the heart is kept ſoft, and will ſoone ſmite vs, as <hi>Danids</hi> did: by vſe our inward light is exercifed and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and wee made able to diſcerne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. Nay, vſe and exerciſe doth both facilitate and delight; for what's done ordinarily and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, is done with no, ſmall content, ſure with no great contention and reluctancy: cuſtome and exerciſe make the hardeſt of works at leaſt ſufferable. On the other ſide, difuſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and though it continue in the roote, yet the fruit will downe. Firſt, the light of it will more and more decay, like the fire that is not blowne. Secondly, the life of it will alſo weare, (as the dull ſluggard liues not halfe ſo much as the diligent doth) and this appeares, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe acts and euidences of life (Senſe and Motion.) For Senſe, a Conſcience vnconſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vnexerciſed, vnexamined, becomes like a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6265:19"/>ſleepy legge: when a man hath ſate long, hee feeles not his limbes, the bloud and ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes frozen and arreſted with cold, ſometimes intercepted in their paſſage by too much ſuppreſsion of that part: ſo tis with the Conſcience; firſt load it, and then let it lye ſtill without motion, and in fine it will not feele it ſelfe, but be as dead and ſenceleſſe, as brawned, yea ſeared fleſh: And this experience iuſtifies in many, whoſe conſciences lye bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridden: and looke how ſome (in that caſe of ſickneſſe) voyd much filth and feele it not: ſo theſe ſpue forth abhorred blaſphemies and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and diſcerne them not. As for Motion, euen as the limbs by long ſitting grow ſtiffe and ſtarke, that we cannot goe: ſo the conſcience vnfrequented, twill ruſt like a Clocke which ſleepes a winter or two, and ſo loſes its tongue, not once telling you where you bee either in the day or night: iuſt ſo a ruſty Conſcience, twill neither counſell nor comfort, checke nor excuſe, twill ſpeake neither to matters paſt nor to come, but lie as dead within a man, as the dead childe doth within a woman: Oh tis a moſt comfortleſſe thing for a liuing woman to beare death in her bowels! ſuch a burden fils her with many feares for the preſent, at leaſt makes her too too heauy and vnweldy, and puts her to great extremity in the cloze, there being more adce with one dead birth, then with two
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6265:19"/>liuing children tis no better with a dead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; the leſſe that trauels, the more we muſt with feares and anguiſh; and therefore as wee call vpon women, to ſtirre, that their fruit may be ſtirring too: ſo muſt we ftirre vp our ſelues, that Conſcience may be doing; for a dead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeience makes but a dead eſtate, a dead heart, a dead man, a dull life; and dead it will be, vnleſſe we put it to vſe.</p>
            <p>Now before we can proceed to exhortation, <note place="margin">Vſe <hi>I.</hi>
               </note> we cannot but bewayle and controll two ſorts of men firſt, ſuch as vtterly diſuſe, ſecondly, ſuch as ſearefully miſuſe their Conſciences. How many bee there of the firſt fort, who liue and dye ſtrangers to themſelues? They dare not for their eares aske their own hearts: What is our caſe? In what tearmes ſtand we with God? Children are we or enemies? In the wayes of life or death? Where are we? What are wee? Which way goe we? What will be the iſſue of our courſes? But looke how bankrupts put off reckonings, ſo theſe allreaſonings with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And as they keepe their ſpirituall eſtate cloſe from their owne conſciences, ſo doe they in particular actions: for, firſt, in ſhings to be done, they rather conſult others then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felues, which is, but to ſel ones eies, and buy ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, which ſee no more then the eye enables them. Secondly, in things already done, they rather ſmother then conſult conſcience: when
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6265:20"/>Conſcience takes the aduantage of ſolitarineſſe, and beginnes to queſtion them, they runne from it into company, and hide themſelues in the croude; when Conſcience beginnes a little to open its eyes and mouth after the reading of ſome booke, the hearing of ſome Sermon, the ſeeling of ſome inward or outward pinches, they ſtoppe their eares, diuert their thoughts, ſing, whiſtle, drinke, game, and doe any thing to out-talke and drowne Conſcience. This the practice of hundreds, but how ill this practice is, firſt the Cauſes, ſecondly, the Conſequences will ſhew.</p>
            <p>The Cauſes hereof, <note place="margin">The cauſes of this diſuſe.</note> Firſt, Pride: Man would be ſomebody with himſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is loth to looke vpon his owne ſtaines, and to ſee his owne face in the face of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Secondly, Hypocriſie: Man hath ſuch a deſire to coozen, that hee would (if he could) coozen himſelfe, and would faine make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe beleeue that tis not ſo bad with him, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is. Thirdly, Vnbeliefe: He lookes for no mercy, in caſe he peach himſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore places all his ſafety in ſecrecy; and ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret would he be, that by his will, his left hand ſhall not know what his right hath done. Theſe are the cauſes: and what fruit can you in reaſon expect from ſuch a roote?</p>
            <p>Surely the iſſue cannot but bee bitter: <note place="margin">The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</note> For, Firſt, by diſuſing Conſcience, men come to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6265:20"/>loſe conſcience, and conſequently their armour againſt ſinne: take away Conſcience, and you can hardly ſet downe Atheiſme. Secondly, by this meanes ſinne is exceedingly aggrauated; (for no man can neglect ſo neere a Monitor as Conſcience is, without great preſumption and wilfulneſſe:) and ſecondly, a mans reckoning no way furthered; for (doe what we can) wee muſt come to an account, and Conſcience will know vs at laſt, whether we acknowledge it or not; nay, by how much the leſſe we regard it now, by ſo much the more it will ſhake vs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and riſe vpon vs like a flame with ſo much the greater fury, by how much the more it was (for the preſent) kept downe and ſtifled.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort reproued, <note place="margin">Vſes. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> are ſuch as abuſe conſcience, and this is done (as ſometimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe) ſo moſtly thus:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, when Conſcience is ſet loweſt, and bound apprentice to the outward man, I meane thus; when men doe not receiue all blowes that let driue at conſcience, vpon their name, eſtate, skinne, &amp;c. but contrarily, rather ſuffer Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be wounded, then the outmoſt skinne rayſed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when Conſcience is thruſt from its ſeate, depoſed, degraded, gag'd; ſo violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that it muſt not ſpeake, though friends, God, man, call vpon vs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, when conſcience is made a cloke 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6265:21"/>for all vnwarranted, both opinions and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that is, when men will put the name of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience vpon the baſeſt things: Opinion ſhall bee Conſcience; Errour, Conſcience; the ſwallowing of widowes houſes, Conſcience; as twas with the Phariſees.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, when Conſcience is made a knight of the poaſt, and muſt beare witneſſe to any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, to any villany: thus when men cannot tell what to ſay, they appeale to God and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. God knowes, their hearts, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience beares them witneſſe, they'le take it on their Conſcience, tis ſo, not ſo. O the feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe practices! how terrible haue Gods ſtrokes bin vpon ſuch in all ages? and what can we looke for leſſe, then miſery in this courſe? Firſt, a man muſt be an old and bold offender, before he can dare thus to affront Conſcience. Secondly, it cannot be ſafe thus to abuſe ſo great an Officer as conſcience is. Thirdly, who can expreſſe the terrours of ſome Saints, now vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on record, who (notwithſtanding) neuer were ſo daring? and if they did ſweare vnder ſmaller abuſes of Conſcience, how ſhall theſe bleed?</p>
            <p>I now come to perſwade euery man to make good vſe of a good thing, <note place="margin">Vſe <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> a good Conſcience; for the abuſe of beſt things is euer worſt: and a good Conſcience is in the ranke of beſt things, It is a wonderfull mercy in God, to match vs with ſo neere a friend, ſo true a Counſellor: let
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6265:21"/>vs thankefully conſider to what vſes a good conſcience may be put, and accordingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue it. We will not runne into the road of conſcience in generall, but confine our ſelues to a good Conſcience, which is ſo tearmed in a double ſence.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Its good formally in its conſtitution. <note place="margin">Conſcience how tearmed good.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, effectiuely in its execution: as a Clocke is good when it is made well and goes well: firſt, the Conſcience is good in its ſelfe, when it is fitted for its proper acts and vſes: the proper and immediate act and vſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is to know that it knowes, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes to <hi>Shimei,</hi> and as wee vulgarly ſay, I know what I know well enough. This the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. The particulars of this knowledge are, firſt, conſcience knowes what we be: ſecondly, what we doe: what we be ſpiritually (not naturally) and in what tearmes we ſtand with God; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we beare his Image, be in his fauour, yea, or no? what we doe either for ſubſtance or quality, good or bad, either in times paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or to come: theſe things Conſcience was made for, and theſe the conſcience, when it is good, doth know, to wit, both tree and fruit in the inward and outward acts thereof: and hence it is, that we are ſo often inuited to talke with our ſelues; and hereof growes that inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and enioyment, that the ſoule hath of it ſelfe, wherein it reſembles its Maker, who
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6265:22"/>takes full contentment in himſelfe from his full vnderſtanding of himſelfe. The ſecond act of a good Conſcience is ſpeaking or manifeſting good to vs, being good in it ſelfe, it giues vs due information touching our ſelues; as a cleere glaſſe repreſents a true face: and heere are two acts alſo: Firſt and more immediately it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports things as they be, which is called witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or giuing in euidence: thus the perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnder mercy, it tels him ſo much, hauing already done well, or hauing good things in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, it ſaith ſo.</p>
            <p>Contrarily, when things be not right, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpeakes as it finds them, and heerein it doth well; for we ſpeake of a Morall, not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall good: and morally that Conſcience is good, that ſpeakes the truth how-euer it be: as thats a good glaſſe that reports blemiſhes (if ſuch) as well as beauties; a good Witneſſe that ſpeakes the truth, though not what pleaſes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Conſcience ſtrikes vpon the affections, and doth ſome execution vpon the offender; for from information of eſtate, ariſes either certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of hope or deſpaire: as the euidence comes in guilty or not guilty, and from information of workes, different affections and motions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their different natures: from things well done, comes comfort, ioy, boldneſſe, &amp;c. ill done, ſhame, feare, ſorrow, remorce: from things well intended, courage, reſolution, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6265:22"/>&amp;c. ill meant, (for the future) iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, repining, recoyling, as an horſe that would and would not leape a ditch. In the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, Conſcience is compared to a Witneſſe, in this, to a Iudge and executioner.</p>
            <p>Now this being the vſe of Conſcience, wee muſt employ it to theſe vſes; namely, repaire to Conſcience, aske its aduice, receiue its report touching our perſons and actions, heare what it can ſay for or againſt vs now; for once it muſt paſſe a verdict vpon vs; and when we haue its teſtimony, wee muſt either appeale to an higher Court (if we can ſhew an errour) or ſit downe by its ſentence, ſtop, where it ſayes ſtop, worke, where it ſayes worke, feare, where it ſaies feare, hope, where he giues hope, reſtore, where it ſayes, reſtore.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">VVhen and in what caſes conſcience muſt moſt be conſulted.</note> Howbeit, that our ſpeech may be more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, know we that in foure caſes eſpecially, we are to conſult and vſe Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when wee are in conſultation about things to be done, or beleeued; in this caſe it is not amiſſe to aduiſe with others, but in no caſe muſt Conſcience be omitted.</p>
            <p>I may eaſily deceiue others by ill ſtating of the queſtion, adding, or altering, or ſuppreſſing, as affection leads me: againe, a man may finde ſo many men, ſo many mindes oftentimes, ſo different are their apprehenſions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But a good conſcience is one and the ſame,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:6265:23"/>and that vprightly conſulted, can ſay more to my affections and intentions, more to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall part, then all the world.</p>
            <p>Therefore vſe others if you pleaſe, but make vſe of your owne hearts, elſe your practice may be corrupt, when others counſell is good. Here forget not theſe rules: Firſt, pretend not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, where Conſcience is not the matter. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, be reſolued of what thou doeſt in thy ſelfe, or elſe forbeare till taught, if thou mayeſt. Thirdly, walke by thine owne light, not other mens; ground thy practice vpon Conſcience, Conſcience vpon Word, not vpon Man. As for caſes here incident, we paſſe them now.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when we are vpon a ſelfe-triall, and the queſtion is, either of our ſtate, or our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or opinions, conſult conſcience; for that is the beſt created examiner. And here let the maine worke be, to ſinde out the maine point; Am I Gods childe, in ſtate of grace, yea or no? This much imports vs; for as Satan founds all particular temptations vpon this (If thou be the tonne of God) ſo all our particular comforts and aſſurances hang on this pinne. Therefore, here, houer not, but hold Conſcience to it, Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am, or am not Gods. What am I? What am I? Leaue not this vnreſolued by Conſcience, as many doe, who hearing of a certainty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineable, and of ſome generall notes of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Word; preſently build conſidence
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:6265:23"/>to themſelues, ſometimes vpon weake principles, ſometimes vpon falſe applications, neuer conſulting Conſcience, and then when Conſcience is awakened, they are miſerably plunged. Beloued, it is not ſo eaſie a matter to aſſure ſaluation as moſt men thinke; we are not all out of their mindes, who deny it poſſible, without extraordinary reuelations, and who hold it ſawcineſſe to auouch it; yet wee muſt tell you, that the difficulties are more then a few, and it concernes vs much to deale much with Conſcience about this point.</p>
            <p>For faith whereby wee beleeue ſaluation is one thing, and euidence whereby wee feele it another; there we muſt cleaue to the promiſe, but here we muſt conferre with Conſcience, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth, he was ſtrongly perſwaded (by the <hi>leſuites</hi> leaue) of his ſaluation and vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but what are his grounds? Firſt, his Conſcience was and had beene good in all: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his bent and resolution for the future was right; hence he did, hence we muſt aſſure our eſtates.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as we muſt examine Conſcience about our eſtate, ſo alſo about actions paſt; was this well? did I well? ſaid I well? otherwiſe there may be deceit: For firſt, many matters lye hid from men, with their circumſtance: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the motiues that ſet the wheele a going vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doe; here then happy is he who condemnes
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6265:24"/>not himſelfe in what he hath done.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when ſlandred, cenſured, or accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whether by men or diuels. Thus <hi>Iob,</hi> when Satan accuſeth, when friends doe, foes doe, when good men doe, and bad men doe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires homeward, caſts vp his bookes, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all right, hee triumphs in his Conſcience, and weares their libels as a Crowne. Like vſe muſt we make of our Conſciences, when accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; firſt, ſee whether the charge be iuſt; if ſo, reforme, amend: ſecondly, if not ſo, cleare thy ſelfe to men, if worth while, and if they will be ſatisfied; if not, enioy thy ſelfe, and thine owne innocency. Here the rules be two: firſt, if thine owne heart condemne thee, reioyce not againſt the truth, though all the world applaud thee: ſecondly, if (vpon a true ſearch) thy heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit thee, neuer for ſake thine owne innocency: Let not men, nor diuels, nor frownes, nor cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures robbe thee of thy comfort, but ſet this wall of braſſe againſt all, as <hi>Paul.</hi> Say what you will, my conſcience is good, and I make this good by theſe and theſe proofes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, when wee become ſuiters to God and man for aſſiſtance, being affronted by men and diuels, and ſeemingly deſerted of God and man, then we muſt flye to Conſcience, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, and <hi>Dauid,</hi> and all the Saints; now calling vpon God, as <hi>Hezekiah, O Lord, thou knoweſt I haue walked, &amp;c.</hi> Now vpon Chriſtians, as <hi>Paul,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6265:24"/>Pray for me, for I haue kept a, &amp;c.</hi> Now vpon our ſelues, with <hi>Dauid, Why art thou caſt downe, O my ſoule, &amp;c.</hi> There is truth in thee, beare vp. And this not onely for the preſent, but for future times, when we are threatned as the Apoſtles were, with many ſtormes, with much hardſhip: firſt, make good thy Conſcience: ſecondly, reſt in the comfort thereof; for come what will come, if we bring a good conſcience to a good cauſe, theſe two bladders will hold our heads aboue water. My brethren, till wee haue tryed, we cannot conceiue what the comfort, courage, ſtrength and reſolution of a good conſcience is; make vſe of it, enioy it, and enioy your ſelues, your eſtate, all perſons, all things, all times; onely be ſure, firſt, that Conſcience be regular, that is, that it ſpeake Law, and ſentences all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word written. Secondly, that it ſpeake the whole truth written, and nothing but the truth: Conſcience hath nothing to doe with ſecret counſels, that muſt ſpeake to the action or preſent eſtate; but for reprobation or finall deſtruction; that conſcience can ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to, as not reuealed; it hath nothing to doe either with abſolute condemnation, or abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let it keepe it ſelfe within its Spheare, and let me keepe my ſelfe to my time.</p>
