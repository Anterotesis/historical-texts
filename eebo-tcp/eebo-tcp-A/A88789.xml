            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

was brought out of
the houſe of <hi>Obed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edom</hi>
the Gittite, with
muſick and great joy,
into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there placed,
2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">2 Reg. 6. 17</note> The learned are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>David</hi> compoſed this Pſalm,
and delivered it to be ſung at this
ſolemnity. Before this, the Arke
was in <hi>Gibeah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Reg. 6. 2, 3.</note> a high place in the
City <hi>Baalah</hi> of <hi>Judah, 2 Reg.</hi> 6. other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115067:5"/>
called <hi>Kiriathjearim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joſh. 15. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Joſh.</hi> 15. 9.
But now the preſence of it made the
City of <hi>David, Domicilium religionis,</hi>
the houſe of Religion, as well as
<hi>Regni,</hi> of the Kingdome. It is <hi>Domus
Dei,</hi> the houſe of Religion, Gods
houſe,<note place="margin">Ver. 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and the laſt of this
Pſalme. And it is the houſe of the
Kingdome too:<note place="margin">Ver. 5.</note> for there is the ſeat
of Judgement, and there is the houſe
of <hi>David, ver.</hi> 5. And it is fit, very
fit it ſhould be ſo; The Court, and
the great Temple of Gods ſervice
together; That God, and the King
may be neighbours: That as God is
alwayes neere to preſerve the King,
ſo the King might be neere to ſerve
God: and God and the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
meet in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> without a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.</p>
            <p>Now this Pſalme was not fitted
by <hi>David</hi> for the people onely, when
the Arke was brought to, and placed
in, <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> but alſo for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
at their ſolemne feaſts to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
to which they were bound
thrice a yeere by the Law,<note place="margin">Ex. 23. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.
For then (ſome thinke) they ſung
this Pſalme, either in their journey
as they came up; or elſe on the ſteps
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115067:5"/>
as they aſcended to the Temple: So
the comming to the Temple was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
with joy; And they were
glad when the ſolemnity came. At
this joy the Pſalme begins: I was
glad when they ſaid unto me, We
will goe into the Houſe of the Lord.
Glad they were, but no vanity in
the mirth. For as they went up with
joy,<note place="margin">Ver. 1.</note> 
               <hi>ver.</hi> 1. ſo did they with prayer
here at the 7.<note place="margin">Ver. 7.</note> And the prayer is for
the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, but in <hi>Davids</hi> time the
Temple was not built; and how
then this Pſalme compoſed by him
for this ſolemnity? Yes, well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
for though the Temple was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
not then built, yet the Tabernacle
was then up,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 6. 17.</note> 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 6. according
to which patterne the Temple was
to be built. So all the ſervice was
there: and therefore the ſolemnity
too. Beſide, the eye of the Prophet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
was cleare, and ſaw things farther
off, than the preſent. For firſt it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
evident, <hi>Qui non videbat, praevide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat:
David</hi> that ſaw not the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
built, foreſaw it was to bee
built by his Sonne,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 7 13.</note> 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 7. And
ſo fitted the Pſalme both to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115067:6"/>
Tabernacle, and a future Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And it is not improbable, but that
he ſaw farther; or if he did not, the
Spirit of God did; and ſo fitted his
pen, that the ſame Pſalme might
ſerve the Jewes at their returne
from <hi>Babylon,</hi> to reedifie the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of both City and Temple: For
then the people aſſembled as one
man to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſra. 3. 1, 2</note> and kept their
wonted ceremonies, <hi>Eſra.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Nay, I make no queſtion but that
he ſaw farther yet. For what ſhould
hinder the Prophet, but that hee
might looke quite thorow the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which was but the figure, or
ſhadow, and ſo ſee Chriſt, his
Church, and Kingdome at the end
of it? So the Pſalme goes on
for both Jew, and Chriſtian; Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and Church; that ye, as well as
they, might pray for the peace of
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
that love it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The words containe two things;
an Exhortation both to Princes and
People, to <hi>pray for the peace of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi>
and the Prophets owne
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> prayer for it, <hi>Let them proſper that

love thee: Peace be within thy walls,
and prosperity within thy Palaces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Exhortation to both Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and People, that they pray for
the Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
three particulars. The Body,
for which he would have us care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
that is, <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Action
by which we ſhould expreſſe our
love to it, Our care of it; that is,
Prayer. And the Bleſſing which
our Prayers ſhould intreat for it;
and that is, Peace.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, here is the Body, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
which, and all the members of it, he
would have them pray, and that is,
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was at
this time (as I told you) made <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
religionis &amp; regni,</hi> Gods Houſe,
and the Kings. And ſo it ſtands not
here for the City and the State only,
(as many of the Antient name the
City onely) nor for the Temple and
the Church onely:<note place="margin">S. Hierom. Baſil. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. Hilar. Arnob. Euthym. Ibid.</note> but joyntly for
both. For both: Therefore when
you ſit downe to conſult, you muſt
not forget the Church; And when
we kneele downe to pray, we muſt
not forget the State: both are but
one <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115067:7"/>
There are ſome in all ages, (too
many in this) which are content to
be for the State, becauſe the liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
both of them and theirs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon it: but it is no matter
for the Church, they can live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that. And there are ſome, which
are all, at leaſt in their out-cry, for
the Church: as if <hi>Templum Domini,</hi>
the Church, the Church, might ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
up Kingdomes, &amp; State-affairs.
But there is no Religion in the one;
And neither that, nor Civill Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in the other.</p>
            <p>Both then were commended to
the Jewes, and both are to us; And
both under one name, <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
One name, and good reaſon for it.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, becauſe the chiefe houſe of the
Common-wealth, the Kings houſe;
and the chief houſe of Gods ſervice,
the Temple; were both in one <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And ſecondly, becauſe they
are as neere in nature, as in place:
For both Common-wealth, and
Church are collective bodies, made
up of many into one; And both ſo
neer allyed, that the one, the Church,
can never ſubſiſt but in the other, the
Common-wealth; Nay ſo neere,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115067:7"/>
that the ſame men, which in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
reſpect make the Common-wealth,
doe in a ſpirituall make the
Church: ſo one name of the mother
City ſerves both, that are joyned up
into one.</p>
            <p>Now though in nature the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
goe firſt; firſt men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
religious and faithfull men;
and the Church can have no being
but in the Common-wealth: Yet in
grace the Church goes firſt; religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and godly men, better than men;
and the Common-wealth can have
no bleſſed and happy being, but by
the Church. For true Religion ever
bleſſes a State: provided that they
which profeſſe it, doe not in their
lives diſhonour both God, and it.
And it bleſſes the State, (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
two waies. One by putting a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
reſtraint upon the audaciouſneſſe of
evill. And this the wiſe men among
the Heathen ſaw:<note place="margin">L. 2. Nat. Q<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 42.</note> For <hi>Seneca</hi> tells
us, that this placing of an armed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger,
God, over the head of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
men, (which is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of Religion) is a great
reſtraint, becauſe againſt him, <hi>Nemo
ſibi ſatis potens videtur,</hi> no man can
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115067:8"/>
thinke himſelfe able enough, either
to ſhun, or reſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other way by which it bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the State, is by procuring Gods
bleſſings upon it.<note place="margin">Pſa. 68. 32.</note> So it is, <hi>Pſal. 68.
32. Sing unto God, O ye kingdomes of
the earth;</hi> there is exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
And then it follows,<note place="margin">&amp; ver. 35.</note> 
               <hi>ver. 35.
God will give ſtrength and power unto
his people;</hi> there is the bleſſing. And
it is plaine in my Text: for heere
prayer is to obtaine bleſſing for
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the State. But it is
expreſly ſaid to be <hi>propter domum
Domini,</hi> for the Houſe of Gods
ſake,<note place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> 
               <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Now I would all
States would remember this; that
they have a reſtraint from evill by,
and a bleſſing for, Religion: It
would make me hope, that yet at
laſt, Religion ſhould be honoured
for it ſelfe, and not for preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we are come from
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Body,</hi> as it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
both State and Church, to
that which the Prophet would have
us doe for it. That is, <hi>Prayer.</hi> Pray
for <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Pray for it. Why,
but is that all? Can a State be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115067:8"/>
or a Church governed, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>Prayer?</hi> No: the Prophet
meanes not ſo. You muſt ſeeke,
and endeavour the good of both, as
well as pray for the good of both.</p>
            <p>And this is in my Text too: For
the word in the <hi>Septuagint</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
aske and inquire after the good
of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> labour it. And yet,
it is often read in Scripture for <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
pray for it. Both then. And
the Fathers beare witneſſe to both,
in this place.<note place="margin">S. Hierom. Aug. Hilar. Prosp. ibid.</note> For S. <hi>Hierome, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.
Hilar.</hi> and <hi>Prosp.</hi> are for the

ſeeke it,<note place="margin">S. Baſil. Theod. &amp;c. ib<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d.</note> follow it. Saint <hi>Baſil,
Theod.</hi> and moſt of the latter Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
are for the borrowed ſenſe,
<hi>Orate,</hi> pray for it. And ſurely God
would have the great Miniſters of
State, and the provident Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
of the Church, doe both; ſeek,
enquire, conſult, doe all good to
both: And yet when they have done
all, hee would have them pray
too.</p>
            <p>And there is good reaſon for this;
for nothing more needfull for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
for State and Church, than
Prayer. For the State nceeſſary.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115067:9"/>
For God is Preſident of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of State; and ſhall he not be ſo
much as called to Counſell, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to ſit? And for the Church
neceſſary too. For the Son of God,
Chriſt Jeſus, is Head of the Church;
and can the Body doe any thing
well, if the Head direct it not?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And yet of the two, the Church
hath moſt need to be prayed for:
And that both becauſe the conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Church have more
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> immediate reference to God; And
becauſe the Enmity of the world is
more ſet againſt the Church, for
God. And while Chriſt tels Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> that the gates of hell ſhall not
prevaile againſt the Church, <hi>Math.
16.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18</note> He inſinuates withall, that thoſe
open gates, gape not wider for any
thing, than for it: therefore prayer
for the Church very neceſſary. And
certainely, ſo much danger over it,
and ſo little prayer for it, agree
not.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Rogate,</hi> pray for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
reacheth every man in particular;
and all men when they are aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
together: For what can a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
conſult upon orderly, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115067:9"/>
providently, if God be not
called into the Aſſembly? If there
be not <hi>Deus ſtat,</hi> God ſtandeth in
the congregation of Princes?<note place="margin">Pſal. 82. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.
82.</hi> And ſuch a ſuperiour cannot be
called into the Aſſembly mannerly,
but by Prayer.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſolemne State-Aſſemblies,
(becauſe if they erre, they erre not
lightly) have greateſt need of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
both in, and for them. Hence
is that antient Chriſtian cuſtom,
that Parliaments aſſemble not for
the State; Councels meet not for the
Church; but they begin both the
firſt dayes worke, and every dayes
worke with Prayer. And the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
which knew not the true God,
knew that this duty was owing to
the true God, to pray unto him
moſt ſolemnly, in their greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations;
and therefore <hi>Caeſar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to enter the <hi>Senat,</hi> ſacrificed
firſt:<note place="margin">L. 2. Bell. Civil. p. 100<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> And <hi>Appian</hi> ſpeakes of that
Act, as of a thing of cuſtome. And
it cannot be thought they did ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
without prayer: Since <hi>Litare</hi>
which is to appeaſe by Sacrifice, is
to pleaſe by prayer too. But I leave
them. My Text is more antient,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115067:10"/>
and more full than their practice:
For heere <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. the Tribes are no
ſooner gone up to the ſeats of
Judgement,<note place="margin">Ver. 5.</note> to the houſe of <hi>David,</hi>
but they are followed cloſe by my
Text, that they pray for <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi>
So prayer the firſt worke, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation
after. And doubtleſſe the
Spirit of God ſees Prayer wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
neceſſary for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that he
makes that, as it were, the doore of
entrance, both into the Seates of
Judgement among men, and the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of divine worſhip, and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We have done with the Action,
<hi>Prayer.</hi> Thirdly then, here is the
Bleſſing which we are to beg and
deſire at Gods hands for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
for both the State, and the Church:
and that (if you will beleeve the
Prophet) is <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Peace is one of the greateſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
bleſſings, which a State, or a
Church can receive: For where
God himſelfe deſcribes the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of government, he deſcribes
it by Peace,<note place="margin">Eſa. 37. 12</note> 
               <hi>Eſa.</hi> 37. The worke of
Juſtice ſhall be Peace; And my
people ſhall dwell in the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115067:10"/>
of peace. I will not load you
with a long diſcourſe of Peace, and
the benefits it brings. It hath the
ſame fate, that ſome other of Gods
bleſſings have, It is better knowne
by want, than uſe; and thought
moſt worth the having, by them
that have it not. Looke therefore
not upon your ſelves in peace, but
upon a State in blood, upon a
Church in perſecution; Aske them
which are divided by the ſword,
which are roſting at the flame,
conceive your caſe theirs, That is
the touch-ſtone which deceives not,
Then tell me whether it bee not
good counſell, <hi>Rogare pacem,</hi> to
pray for the Peace of both. And I
doe ill to call it barely <hi>Peace;</hi> Our
Prophet calls it the <hi>bleſſing of Peace,
Pſalm.</hi> 29.<note place="margin">Pſal. 29. 10</note> And doubtleſſe it is to
teach the world, that all earthly
benefits are, as it were, <hi>unbleſſed,</hi> till
Peace be upon them: for till then,
no injoying of any.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Rogate pacem,</hi> pray for the
peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſeemes but a
plaine and a naked <hi>Exhortation</hi> for
Peace. I muſt finde more in it then
ſo, and yet offer my Text no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115067:11"/>
nor bee buſie with any thing
above me, or out of my profeſſion.
Obſerve then; When <hi>David</hi> made
this <hi>Exhortation</hi> to pray for Peace, it
was <hi>Tempus Pacis,</hi> A time of Peace;
For he compoſed the Pſalme when
hee carried the Arke to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
and before that, hee had ſmote the
<hi>Philiſtims</hi> twice, and made all at
peace,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 5.</note> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. A time of <hi>Peace?</hi>
Why then a man ſhould thinke
there is leaſt need to pray for it. Yea
but the Prophet thinkes not ſo. He
was pleas'd the State and Church
under him ſhould injoy Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
longer; And therefore calles
for, not <hi>Peace,</hi> which they had, but
continuance of <hi>Peace,</hi> which they
could not tell how long they might
hold; To give thankes to God for
the peace he had given, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Ver. 4.</note> and
to pray for the continuance of it,
<hi>ver.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">Ver. 6.</note> And certainly it is one great
degree of unworthineſſe of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
to grow weary of it.</p>
            <p>Why, but there is a time for
<hi>Warre,</hi> as well as for <hi>Peace,</hi> is there
not?<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3. 8</note> Yes, there is, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. And
this time is in God to fit, <hi>I make
Peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 45. 7.</note> 
               <hi>and create evill, Eſa.</hi> 45. And
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115067:11"/>
in the King to denounce and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame.
But it is not <hi>Dies Belli,</hi> the
day of warre it ſelfe that can make
voyd this duty <hi>Rogandi pacem,</hi> of
praying for Peace: For ſince the eye
of nature could ſee, that the end of
all juſt warre, is, but that men may
live in a more juſt and ſafe Peace,
This <hi>Rogate pacem,</hi> pray for Peace,
muſt bee in the heart, even when the
ſword is in the hand.</p>
            <p>I will not meddle with the State:
but there are many times, in which
God will puniſh and afflict his
Church, And may wee then <hi>Rogare
pacem,</hi> pray Peace for it? Yes, wee
may, nay, wee muſt, even then pray
for Peace, when his will is not to
give it. For firſt, ſo much of his will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
as is revealed, is here expreſſed to
pray for Peace; And that is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
warrant to us, even againſt
that of his will which is not revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
ſo long till he reveale it: For
the will of God bindes us no longer,
nor no farther to <hi>Action,</hi> than it is
revealed; The ſecret things belong
to the Lord our God, but the things
revealed, belong to us, and our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that we may doe them,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115067:12"/>
               <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.<note place="margin">Deut. 29. 29.</note> And againe, Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> diſputes it at large, that a
man may,<note place="margin">Enchir. c. 101.</note> 
               <hi>etiam voluntate bona,</hi> with
a will that is good, will that which
God will not. And whatſoever hee
may will <hi>voluntate bona,</hi> with a
good will, that he may pray for; ſo
he ſubmit to his will, and reſt when
his will appears.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Beſides, who knowes (ſo long as
the ſecret of his will is to himſelfe)
whether it be any more than <hi>Rogate
pacem,</hi> pray for Peace, and have it?
For many times that which God
will not give without prayer, he
will give with it. And then the
cauſe of <hi>Non pax,</hi> is <hi>non rogant;</hi> no
peace, becauſe not prayed for: And
in that caſe, the State and Church
have not more miſery, in that there
is not Peace, than they have ſin, in
that they might have had Peace for
asking, and would not pray for it.</p>
            <p>Now this rule varies not, We are
never to neglect that which God
hath revealed (which here in our
caſe is to pray for Peace) upon any
preſumption of that which remaines
ſecret. Therefore the objection of
the <hi>Puritan</hi> againſt our Church
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115067:12"/>
               <hi>Letany,</hi> in which we pray to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from <hi>Famine,</hi> and from
<hi>Battell;</hi> And againſt the prayer
which followes it, <hi>that we may bee
hurt by no perſecution;</hi> as if it were
an unlawfull prayer, becauſe it is
ſomtimes Gods will to puniſh and
afflict his Church; is as ignorant as
themſelves: For in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
here is <hi>Davids</hi> call upon us,
<hi>Rogare pacem,</hi> to pray for Peace;
And in the new there is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
charge, to pray that we may leade a
quiet and peaceable life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2</note>
And hath the Church of England
ſuch ill lucke, that it cannot doe as
<hi>David</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bids it, but it
muſt anger the Puritan?</p>
            <p>Againe, while you follow the
Prophets exhortation, and pray for
Peace, every kind of falſe worldly
peace will not ſerve the turne. For
as Chriſt was at <hi>Pacem do vobis, ſed
meam;</hi> Peace, but it is My peace
that I give unto you,<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 27.</note> S. <hi>John</hi> 14. So
<hi>David,</hi> the type of Chriſt, would
have you pray for Peace, but His
peace for <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this relation, the words
are generall; <hi>Rogate,</hi> pray for the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115067:13"/>
peace of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> of the whole
State, of the whole Church: It muſt
not be broken in any corner of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
if it may be preſerved. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
or a ſchiſme in a corner, in a
Conventicle, (which is the place
where they are uſually hatched) will
fier all if it be ſuffered. For the State,
none doubts this, and it is as true
for the Church. But where peace
is truly laboured for, and not had,
there the Apoſtles limitation,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.
12.</hi> will helpe all; <hi>Have peace with
all men</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) but it
followes, <hi>ſi poſſibile, if it be poſſible;</hi>
and <hi>Quantum in vobis,</hi> as much as
lies in you.</p>
            <p>When we therefore pray for
peace with all men, and cannot get
it; Heatheniſme, and Turciſme, and
Judaiſme, and Hereſie, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
and Schiſme, will not repent,
and come in; we are quit by <hi>ſi poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi>
if we doe what is poſſible for
their converſion. And againe, when
any of theſe that have changed the
truth of God into a lye, would have
us come over and make peace with
them, we are quit, though we doe it
not, by <hi>quantum in nobis,</hi> as much
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115067:13"/>
as lies in us. For God hath not left
it in our power, to be at peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his truth: And therefore here
is never a <hi>rogate,</hi> no Counſell to
pray for that. Indeed peace againſt
truth is not <hi>Pax Jeruſalem,</hi> a peace
fit for the Church. The Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> challengeth us for breach of
this peace in our ſeparation from
them: But we ſay, and juſtly, the
breach was theirs, by their ſeparation
not onely from diſputable, but from
evident truth. Nor are we fallers
out of the Church, but they fallers
off from verity. Let them returne
to primitive truth, and our quarrell
is ended. In the meane time it is
<hi>poſſibile, &amp; in nobis,</hi> both poſſible,
and in us, to pray, that God would
in his time, fill the Church with truth
firſt, and then with peace.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>rogate pacem,</hi> pray for peace,
is a very full circumſtance in the
Text; I cannot leave it yet: For
when I conſider that he that calls ſo
earneſtly for peace, is <hi>David,</hi> it fills
me with wonder. For <hi>David</hi> was a
ſword-man with a witneſſe. One of
the greateſt warriers that ever was,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">2. Reg. 7. 9.</note> and moſt victorious. Nay,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115067:14"/>
though God had anoynted him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the Kingdome; yet the
meanes which firſt made him known
to <hi>Saul,</hi> and afterwards famous in
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> was firſt his conqueſt of
<hi>Goliah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 17.</note> 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 17. and then his
ſword againſt the Philiſtims. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if <hi>David</hi> be come in upon <hi>roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
pacem,</hi> pray for Peace; it cannot
be accounted onely the Gowne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
or the weak mans prayer; but
it is the wiſe, and the ſtout mans too:
for <hi>David</hi> was both. And certainly
it is not cowardize to pray for
peace, nor courage to call for trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
That is the ſpirit of <hi>David,</hi> that
can ſing before the Arke of God,
<hi>rogate pacem</hi> pray for peace. But if
the Philiſtims will diſturbe Gods
peace, and his, then, and not before,
he will dye them in their owne
blood.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Rogate pacem,</hi> pray for peace,
looks yet another way upon <hi>Davids</hi>
perſon. For at the firſt, <hi>David</hi> was
King onely over the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi>
where he reigned ſeven yeeres, and
ſix moneths,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 5. 5</note> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. The other
eleven Tribes followed <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> the
ſonne of <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Reg. 2.</note> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. But he did
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115067:14"/>
not compoſe this Pſalme, till the
carrying of the Arke to Jeruſalem,
at which time he was King over all,
both <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> So <hi>Rogate
pacem,</hi> pray for peace, was not <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
counſell onely, when his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
were leſſe, <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Hebron;</hi>
but after the great acceſſe of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Tribes too; when he was ſtrong;
when God had divided his enemies
before him, even as water is divided
aſunder: as himſelfe praiſeth God
and confeſſeth,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 5. 20.</note> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
either <hi>Davids</hi> example is not
worth the following, or elſe, a King
in honour, and a King in plenty, and
a King that hath added <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to
<hi>Hebron,</hi> eleven Tribes to one, may
make it his high honour <hi>Rogare pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem
Jeruſalem,</hi> to pray to God, and
perſwade with men, for the peace of
Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>And <hi>David</hi> had good reaſon to
bee at <hi>Rogate pacem,</hi> pray for peace:
For though hee ſcarce tooke any
warre in hand, but with Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
and againſt Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
yet we finde, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.<note place="margin">1 Chron. 22. 8.</note> that
his Battels and his Blood were the
cauſe, why God would not ſuffer
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115067:15"/>
him to build his Temple. He might
ſing before the Ark; he might ſerve
him in the Tabernacle; but no <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
would he have built by hands in
blood. <hi>Solomons</hi> hands, Hands of
peace muſt doe that. What is the

to God and my Text, but that I
muſt fit one circumſtance more to
<hi>Rogate pacem,</hi> pray for peace. And
it is, Pray for it this day: Why this
day? Why? Why <hi>David</hi> brought
up the Arke with this Pſalme, and
would have built the Temple; But

<hi>But behold, a ſonne is borne unto thee,
which ſhall be a man of peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I will

then great reaſon to call upon his

for that Peace, which God would
give by <hi>Salomon?</hi> And ſurely we
have a <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a State, and a

And this day was our <hi>Salomon,</hi> the

is drawne from proſperity;

potent with men in all things elſe:
why then ſhould it not be prevailing
in this, to make men pray both for

ſhall men proſper that do ſo indeed?
Yes: you have no probable cauſe

ſhall proſper.</hi> And if you take them
for an earthly promiſe, you have a

you have a <hi>Prophets</hi> word for it.
Would you have any man teſtifie

Pray for the Peace of Jeruſalem:</hi> For
there is great example to move you

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115067:19"/>
goes before you; he askes no more
of you, than he doth himſelfe. He
would have you pray for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
and ſo doth he: <hi>Let them proſper
that love it.</hi> The Prophet is not of
their humour, that care not what
burthens they bind upon other mens
ſhoulders, ſo themſelves may eſcape
the load. No, he prayes too; And
no marvell:<note place="margin">Serm. 1. de Ieju. 10. Men.</note> For (as Saint <hi>Leo</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)
Prayer is one, and the firſt,
of the <hi>three things,</hi> which doe moſt

            <p>He prayes then, and in his prayer
this is remarkable, <hi>Prius orat pro

for them that pray for <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
before he prayes for <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> it

               <hi>v.</hi> 7.
And there is a great deale of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
wiſdome in this too: For while
his prayer ſtrengthens them that
pray for <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> both his, and
their prayers meet, and goe ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to God, than if any (be it <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid)</hi>
prayed for it alone.<note place="margin">Epiſt. 7. ad Smyrnen.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Ignatius</hi> tells his people at

               <hi>Smyrna,</hi> that their prayers reached as
far as <hi>Antioch,</hi> (who no doubt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, as <hi>David</hi> prayes, as
well as he would have others pray:
ſo prayes he alſo for the ſelfe ſame
thing, for which he exhorts others
to pray; That is, for peace. <hi>Peace
be within thee.</hi> And it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that his exhortation came
heartily from him, becauſe he falls to
it ſo cloſe himſelfe. And it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
thing full of honour to God
and themſelves, when <hi>Rex &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheta,</hi>
the King, and the Prophet,
goe firſt in prayer for the States and
the Churches peace.</p>
            <p>Now he prayes not for the peace
of it alone, but for that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
peace, the proſperity of it
too. He well knew, that <hi>God hath
pleaſure in the prosperity of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi>
Nor doth he ſo pray for the
temporall peace of the State, as
that he forgets the ſpirituall peace
of the Church. Nor doth he ſo pray
for the externall peace of either,
but that he preferres the inward,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115067:20"/>
and <hi>ſoul-peace</hi> of both. Not peace
without vertue: for that is but a <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
peace;</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Hilar. Ibid.</note> and therefore Saint <hi>Hil.</hi>
will have them together. Peace and
Vertue <hi>Connexa ſibi ſunt,</hi> muſt be
knit together in <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> For
Vertue is the ſtrength and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Peace; And whereſoever
Vertue is not, there Peace will bee
the firſt that will abuſe it ſelfe. Not
Peace without Faith: For that is but
a profane Peace;<note place="margin">S. Hierom. Ibid.</note> and therefore
Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> tells us, it is <hi>Dominus
Chriſtus,</hi> our Lord Chriſt, that is the
true Peace of both State and Church.
As if he ſo long before had foreſeen
and prayed for (in theſe words,
<hi>Peace be within thee)</hi> the comming
of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> And foreſee it (no
queſtion) he did. And I will not
deny, but that he prayed for it:
ſince neither <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> peace could,
nor our peace can, be firme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him. But then if you aske me
why ſo many States, and Churches,
are divided for, and about Chriſt,
and ſo not at peace; the cauſe I
muſt tell you, is the ſinne of men:
They divide and tear Chriſt firſt, and

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, here is his prayer for
peace and proſperity for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
for the State, for the Church: but
whereabouts would he have theſe
excellent bleſſings ſeated? Where?
Why every where, but eſpecially in
<hi>Muris &amp; Palatiis,</hi> about the Wall
and the Palace. And they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
fitted. He would have
them ſpread all over <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> But
<hi>Loca Dominii,</hi> the places of their
exaltation, are theſe in my <hi>Text,
the Wall, and the Palace:</hi> For <hi>Peace</hi>
that keeps at the wall, and ſo works
inward, to calme the City; But the
child of peace, <hi>Prosperity,</hi> that is
borne after in the Palace, and comes
outward, to inrich to the very
Wall.</p>
            <p>The ſtrength of a City is in the
Walles. In Walles that are fenced
and fortified with Turrets, (as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymius</hi>
renders it:)<note place="margin">Euthym. Ibid.</note> therefore if a
tempeſt of warre beate upon the
walles of it, poſſeſſe the ſtrength of
it, there cannot be peace. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Prayer is fit: <hi>Sit pax in
muris,</hi> peace be within the walles.
And <hi>Davids</hi> prayer is as full as fit:
For the Church hath the ſame walls,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115067:21"/>
that the State hath. It is in my
<hi>Text.</hi> For it is in <hi>Muris Jeruſalem,</hi>
in the walles of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the
<hi>Temple</hi> ſtood within it. And by
reaſon of the knot which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
hath knit between the bodies,
(which is, that the ſame men, which
in reſpect of one Allegiance make
the Common-wealth, doe in reſpect
of one Faith, make the Church) the
walles of the State cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but the Church ſuffers with it;
nor the walles and fences of the
Church trampled upon, but the
State muſt be corrupted by it: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Prayer is full; that Peace
may ſit upon the Walls, that Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
may fill all that is within them.</p>
            <p>Now neither the Walles of the
State, nor the Walles of the Church,
can keepe or defend themſelves, or
that which they compaſſe; There
muſt be Men, and they muſt keepe
both the Wall, and the Palace, and
the Peace: <hi>Viri-Muri,</hi> Men-Walles.
And among theſe, all are not bound
to equall care in preſerving the
Peace.<note place="margin">Nihil fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, aut utilius, aut celſius, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus.</note> But as the greateſt ſtrength
of the dead Walles is in <hi>Turribus,</hi>
in the Towers and Bulwarks; ſo the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115067:22"/>
greateſt care in the living Walls lyes
in <hi>Turribus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Hilar. Ibid.</note> in the Towers too; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe that are eminent in State
and Church.<note place="margin">S. Hierom. Ibid.</note> Now S. <hi>Hierome</hi> tells us
plainly, that for the State, the Noble,
&amp; the wiſe, &amp; the Valiant men, they
are the Towers. And for the Church,
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 9.</note> the Apoſtles were
the Pillars,<note place="margin">S. Chryſoſt.</note> 
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. And Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſt.</hi>
that the Prieſts are <hi>Muri Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hom. 10. in S. Mat.</note>
the Walls of the Church. Here
therefore the Prayer muſt goe
home; <hi>Davids</hi> did; Peace be in theſe
walls too: For if theſe ſhall ſhake
upon their foundations; If theſe
knock one againſt another; there
can be no firme Peace in either Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
A wall-palſie is ever dangerous.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, when there is Peace in
<hi>Muris &amp; Palatiis,</hi> in the Wall and
the Palace, ſtayes either the Prayer
for it, or the benefit of it, there?
No ſure; The benefit ſtayes not:
For the Peace of the <hi>Wall</hi> and the
<hi>Palace,</hi> is very diffuſive; All <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
is the better for it preſently.
Not the meaneſt in the body of the
State, not the loweſt in the Body of
the Church, but they are the better,
or may be, for this Peace. And it is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115067:22"/>
implyed in the <hi>Text:</hi> For in <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis,</hi>
in the Palaces, names indeed the
Kings houſe, but under that greater,
comprehends the leſſe.<note place="margin">S. Hierom. Ibid.</note> And S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
expreſſeth it ſo, and reades <hi>in
Domibus,</hi> proſperity in the Houſes:
For the houſes of Subjects cannot
be empty of Peace, when the Palace
of the King is full. This for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit;
and Peace is no niggard of it
ſelfe. Then the rule is; Where the
benefit goes on and multiplies,
there muſt not be a ſtop in the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
that muſt goe on too, as <hi>Davids</hi>
did; <hi>Peace be within the walls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, The forme of this prayer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <hi>Sit pax in muris,</hi> Peace be within the
walls, and Proſperity within the
Palaces, tells us, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
had both theſe. And no doubt
can be made, but that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
that State, that Church, had both.
And to this day as little doubt there
is of civill States, <hi>muros habent &amp;
Palatia,</hi> they have both Walles and
Palaces. But for the Church, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
(in many places) makes all
the haſte it can, to fruſtrate this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that there may be nor Palaces,
nor Walles, for Peace, or Plenty, to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115067:23"/>
be in. Doubtleſſe, this ceremoniall
Church will riſe in Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the pillage of Chriſtendome:
For the children of that Church
left not their Mother without
Walles for defence, not without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
for honour. Ye ſee it is plaine
in my Text. But many Children of
the ſubſtantiall Church, have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves baſe and unnaturall.
<hi>Palaces?</hi> no, Cottages are good
enough; As if it were a part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that Chriſt and his Prieſts
muſt have leſſe honour in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
than they had in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
And yet when I conſider better,
I begin to thinke it is fit the Prieſts
houſe ſhould be meane, where the
Church, which is Gods Houſe, is
let lye ſo baſely: For he that hewed
Timber afore out of the thicke
Trees, was known to bring it to an
excellent worke; but now they
have beaten downe all the carved
worke thereof with Axes and Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.<note place="margin">Pſal. 74. 5, 6.</note> So that now I doubt
we muſt vary the Prayer, from <hi>Sit
pax,</hi> to <hi>Sint muri,</hi> not preſume
to pray, there may be peace and
plenty within the Walls, but that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115067:23"/>
the very walls themſelves may ſtand.</p>
            <p>But yet I will doe the People
right too. For as many of them are
guilty of inexcuſable ſinne, both by
cunning and by violent ſacrilege:
ſo are too many of us Prieſts guilty
of other as great ſinnes as ſacrilege
can bee; for which, no doubt, we
and our poſſeſſions lye open to the
waſte. It muſt needs be ſo. For the
hand of ſacrilege it ſelfe, though
borne a Theefe, could never touch
<hi>Palatia Eccleſiae,</hi> the Palaces of the
Church, as long as God kept the
wall of it: But while our ſins make
God out of Peace with the Walles;
while he is at <hi>Diruam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 5. 5.</note> I will breake
the wall thereof, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 5. it is in
vaine to ſhift off by humane poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
for the Palaces cannot ſtand.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I may not omit, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
while the Prophet prayes here, for
the State and the Church, and them
that pray for both; yet his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is not, <hi>Pro orantibus,</hi> but <hi>Pro
diligentibus;</hi> not for them that pray
for it, but for them that love it:
Let them proſper that love it, and
wiſh it good.<note place="margin">Euthym. Ibid.</note> So the prayer (as
<hi>Euthym</hi> obſerves) did not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115067:24"/>
the <hi>Jewes</hi> onely, but as many
of other nations too, as were <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentes,</hi>
lovers of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And
indeede theſe two, to love, and to
pray for the State, and the Church,
make one in my Text: For no man
can pray heartily for them, but hee
that loves them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And no man that
truly loves them, can abſtaine from
praying for them, and the peace of
them. This is certaine, neither love,
nor prayer, can ſtand with practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
againſt either; nor with ſpoile
and rapine upon either.</p>
            <p>Nor is <hi>Diligentibus te,</hi> that love
thee, an idle or an empty ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in the prayer of the King:
For as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had, ſo hath every
State, and every Church, ſome falſe
members, whoſe hearts are nearer
the enemy, than <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>ſit Pax, ſed diligentibus,</hi> let
there be peace, but to them that
love thee. But if any man have a
falſe heart to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> let him
have no portion in the proſperitie of
it.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, the Prophets care
is for <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For this State and
Church he would have you pray. In
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115067:24"/>
this prayer he would have you beg
for Peace. That which he would
have others doe, he doth himſelfe,
He prayes both for <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and
for them that pray for it. That
which he alſo prayes for, is peace
and proſperity. This peace he
would have in the Walls, and this
proſperity in the Palaces. From
thence he knowes it will diffuſe it
ſelfe to meaner houſes. Yet it ſeems
by the way, that that ceremoniall
Church had both Walls and Palaces.
And laſt of all, that this Peace, this
Proſperity, might be the reward
onely <hi>Diligentium,</hi> of ſuch as love
both State and Church.</p>
            <p>And now there is a little behind.
For my <hi>Text</hi> is an <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and
preacheth it ſelfe. <hi>Rogate Pacem,</hi>
pray for the Peace of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
Pray for it? Why, it ſeemes ſtrange
to me that any age ſhould be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Peace, or need an exhortation
to pray for it, either in Church or
Common-wealth. Yet the age in
which <hi>David</hi> lived, was ſuch. For
though the inſtant time of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
of this Pſame, was a time of
Peace; yet it was but a time picked
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115067:25"/>
out, in an age that loved not Peace.
<hi>David</hi> tells us ſo himſelfe a little
before my <hi>Text,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 100. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal. 120. My
ſoule hath long dwelt among them that
are enemies unto Peace: I labour for
Peace, but when I ſpeake unto them
thereof, thy make them ready to battel.</hi>
So there he ſpeakes for peace; And
in my text he exhorts to pray for
Peace; And after that, himſelfe
prayes for peace: And all this is
little enough among them that love
not peace.</p>
            <p>Howbeit take this with you:
They beare not the beſt mindes,
<hi>(Caſes of neceſſity, and honourable
ſafety,</hi> alwayes excepted) that deſire
the waters, either of the Church, or
the Common-wealth, ſhould runne
troubled, that they may have the
better fiſhing.<note place="margin">Pat<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rc. L. 2.</note> And the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi>
ſets his brand upon them; Who are
they whom peace cannot pleaſe?
Who? Why? <hi>Quibus peſſima eſt, &amp;
immodica cupiditas,</hi> They whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
are worſe than naught, in their
<hi>Object,</hi> and void of all moderation
in their purſute.</p>
            <p>This I am ſure of, ſince <hi>David</hi> at
the placing of the Arke, exhorts all
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115067:25"/>
ſorts of men <hi>Rogare pacem,</hi> to pray
for the peace of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he did
not intend to leave out the Prieſt,
whom it concernes moſt to preach
peace to the people; neither the
High-Prieſt, nor the reſt, but they
ſhould be moſt forward in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
This for the Prieſthood then.
And Chriſt himſelfe, when he ſent
out the Seventy to preach, gave
them in charge, to begin at every
houſe in which they entred, with
<hi>Peace.</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Luk. 10. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Peace be to this houſe,</hi> S. <hi>Luk.
10.</hi> And he that preacheth not
peace, or labours not for it, muſt
confeſſe one of theſe two; Namely,
that he thinkes <hi>David</hi> was deceived,
while he calls to pray for peace;
Or that himſelfe is diſobedient to
his call.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> is of opinion,<note place="margin">Calv. Ibid.</note> that he
which will order his prayers right,
muſt begin, not with himſelfe, but
at <hi>Dominus Eccleſiae corpus conſervet,</hi>
That the Lord would preſerve the
Body of his Church. It is juſt with
the Prophet, Peace for <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
For if any man be ſo addicted to his
private, that he neglect the common
State, he is voyd of the ſenſe of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115067:26"/>
and wiſheth Peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to himſelfe in vaine. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he be, he muſt live in the Body
of the Common-wealth, and in the
Body of the Church; and if their
joynts be out, and in trouble, how
can he hope to live in Peace? This is
juſt as much as if the exterior parts
of the body ſhould think they might
live healthfull, though the ſtomack
be full of ſick and ſwoln humours.</p>
            <p>To conclude then: God hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
this State and Church with many
&amp; happy yeers of Peace and plenty.
To have had peace without plenty
had been but a ſecure poſſeſſion of
miſery. To have had plenty (if it were
poſſible) without peace, had been a
moſt uncertaine poſſeſſion of that,
which men call happineſſe, without
enjoying it. To have had both theſe,
without truth in Religion, and the
Churches peace, had been to want
the true uſe of both. Now to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of peace, eſpecially peace in Truth,
is to ſlight God that hath given us
the bleſſing. And to abuſe peace and
plenty to <hi>Luxurie,</hi> and other ſins, is
to contemn the bleſſing it ſelfe. And
there is neither of theſe, but will
call apace for vengeance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:115067:26"/>
My exhortation therefore ſhall
keepe even with S. <hi>Pauls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 1.</note> 1 <hi>Tim. 2.
That prayers and ſupplications be
made, especially for Kings, and for all
that are in authority, that under them
we may live a quiet, and a peaceable
life, in all godlineſſe and honeſty.</hi> Here
S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have you pray for
the <hi>King;</hi> And in my Text the <hi>King</hi>
would have you pray for the State,
and the Church: His peace cannot
be without theirs; And your peace
cannot be without his. Thus have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made my <hi>Text</hi> my <hi>Circle,</hi> I am
gone round it, and come backe to

poynt where I began: <hi>Pray for the

that love it: Peace be within the
walls of it, and prosperity within the
Palaces:</hi> That the Peace of God
which paſſeth our underſtanding
here, may not leave us, till it poſſeſſe
us of eternall Peace. And this, <hi>Chriſt</hi>

            <p>The Pſalme in Generall is a

thought a fit Pſalme to be recited
when the King hath recovered

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> us order in proceeding. The firſt is
the <hi>Meanes,</hi> by which God layes
honour upon the King. Not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
onely, which they all have
as Kings: but that great honour in
his ſalvation, which attends good
and gracious Kings. And the <hi>Meanes</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are two-fold in the Text: <hi>Dando
&amp; Laetificando,</hi> By Giving, and by
Joying. By giving the <hi>King</hi> as a
<hi>Bleſſing</hi> to the people; <hi>Thou haſt</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>given him, or ſet him as Bleſſings for
ever.</hi> And by Joying the King for
<hi>bleſſing</hi> the people: <hi>Thou haſt made
him glad with the joy of thy Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is the <hi>Reaſon</hi> both
of the Honour and of the Meanes
of laying it upon the King: And
that is, <hi>Quia ſperat;</hi> Becauſe the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> King puts his truſt in the Lord. The
third is the <hi>Succeſſe,</hi> which his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
ſhall have by his Hope, <hi>That
in the mercy of the moſt High he ſhall
not be moved, he ſhall not miſcarrie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I begin at the firſt: The <hi>Meanes</hi>
by which God adds <hi>Honour</hi> even to
the <hi>Majeſty of Princes.</hi> And becauſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115067:29"/>
that doubles in the Text, I will take
the firſt in order, which is, <hi>Dando;</hi>
Thou laiſt great Honour upon the
King, <hi>by giving or ſetting him, as Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
for ever.</hi> In which Meanes of
laying Honour, the circumſtances
are three.</p>
            <p>And the firſt of the three tels us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
what a <hi>King</hi> is; and that's worth
the knowing: And marke the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt,</hi> how he begins. He deſcribes
not a King by any of his <hi>Humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi>
ſuch as all men have; And
no meane ones are regiſtred of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
the particular King ſpoken of:
No, that had been the way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
the King; which is no part
of Gods intention. But hee begins
at that which crownes the Crowne
it ſelfe. He is <hi>Benedictio,</hi> a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi>
and no leſſe, to the people. And
therefore in all things, and by all
men, is to be ſpoken of, and uſed as
a <hi>Bleſſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it is one thing for a <hi>King</hi>
to bee <hi>bleſſed</hi> in himſelfe, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to be <hi>given</hi> or <hi>ſet <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p,</hi> as
a <hi>Publike Bleſſing</hi> to other men.
<hi>David</hi> was both, and he ſpeakes of
both. A King then is a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115067:30"/>
or in himſelfe (as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and
<hi>Tremellius</hi> give the words, <hi>Dediſti
illi benedictiones,</hi> Thou haſt given
<hi>bleſſings</hi> to him) when by Gods
grace he is <hi>Particeps ſanctificationis,</hi>
Partaker of Gods hallowing Spirit.
For no man, <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Subject,</hi> can
be <hi>bleſſed</hi> in his ſoule without <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> And if theſe be
counterfeits, ſuch alſo is his <hi>Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a King is given as a <hi>Bleſſing</hi>
to others, when in the riches of
Gods grace upon him, he is made
<hi>Divinae Bonitatis fons medius,</hi> A me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
fountaine of Gods goodneſſe
and bounty ſtreaming to the people;
When he turnes the graces which
God hath given him, to the benefit
of them which are committed to
him. For marke the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and
the <hi>Earth</hi> will learne. God did not
place the <hi>Sunne</hi> in the heavens only
for heighth, but that it might have
power to <hi>Bleſſe</hi> the inferiour world,
with <hi>Beames,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and
<hi>Warmth,</hi> and <hi>Motion. David</hi> was
thus, and thus was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſuch
is every <hi>King</hi> in his proportion,
that ſets up theſe for his example.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115067:30"/>
It is not eaſie to match <hi>David;</hi> but
a better example than <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot
be found; And therefore when

               <hi>Alex.</hi> had deſcribed a King
indeed, One that is <hi>Beatus &amp; Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicens,</hi>
a bleſſed and a bleſſing King;
Or, if you will, as it is here in the
<hi>Abstract, Ipſa benedictio, Bleſſing</hi> it

Such as is Chriſt. There, the
perfect example of <hi>Bleſſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now while the King is ſaid to be
a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> let me put you in minde
that there is a double <hi>Benediction;
Deſcendens una, altera Aſcendens,</hi>
One deſcending, and another aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
That which Deſcends, is the
<hi>Bleſſing of Benefit;</hi> That is the <hi>Kings
Bleſſing.</hi> He above, and this drops
from him. In this, like God, whoſe
immediate Vicegerent he is: For
<hi>Gods Bleſſings</hi> alſo are ſaid to come
downe and deſcend,<note place="margin">Jaco. 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>S. Iacob.</hi> 1. The
<hi>Bleſſing</hi> which Aſcends, is that of
<hi>Praiſe,</hi> and <hi>Thankes,</hi> and <hi>faire inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of Princes Actions;</hi> and this
is the peoples <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> And they
are both in Scripture together,
3 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">3 Reg. 8.</note> For there, <hi>ver.</hi> 55.<note place="margin">Verſ. 55.</note> 
               <hi>Solomons

and <hi>ver.</hi> 66.<note place="margin">ver. 66.</note> the peoples <hi>bleſſing</hi>
goes up back againe to <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Betweene theſe two is the happy
commerce that a Prince hath with
his people; when they ſtrive to <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſe</hi>
one another. When the King
labours the peoples good; that is
his <hi>bleſſing</hi> deſcending upon them:
and the people labour his honour;
that is their <hi>bleſſing</hi> reaching up to
him. And in this ſenſe alſo as well
as the former, a King is ſaid, <hi>Poni in
benedictionem,</hi> to be ſet up as a <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi>
that is, for one whom the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ought to bleſſe. For Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<hi>Honour the King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 17.</note> 1 <hi>S. Pet.</hi> 2.
doth as much, if not more, require
the people to <hi>bleſſe,</hi> that is, to <hi>honour</hi>
the King, than it doth the King to
<hi>bleſſe,</hi> that is, to <hi>doe good</hi> to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And there is no good diviſion
between a King and his People, but
this one; That in parting of this
<hi>great good</hi> of a gracious government,
the Kings part be the <hi>Honour,</hi> the
Peoples part may be the <hi>Benefit,</hi> and
both meet again in the <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> And
it is ſo in my Text; For <hi>Ar. Mont.</hi>
renders the Originall by <hi>Pones eum,</hi>
There the King bleſſes the people;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115067:31"/>
and the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and <hi>Tremel.</hi> by
<hi>Poſuiſti ei,</hi> There God promiſes that
he will, or rather ſaith he already
hath; and ties the People that they
doe <hi>bleſſe</hi> the King.</p>
            <p>And you may obſerve too, that
while a King keeps to the two great
examples of the Text, <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> He is not onely a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi>
but he comes as hee writes, <hi>Plurall;</hi>
And ſo it is in the Text, <hi>Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones;</hi>
not one, but many <hi>Bleſſings.</hi>
And indeed the Bleſſings which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
from a King upon a people,
ſeldome come ſingle and alone: and
this, Kings keep theirhonour, that
they <hi>Bleſſe</hi> by <hi>number. Eſau</hi> could
not beleeve that his father <hi>Iſaac</hi>
(who was far leſſe than a King to
<hi>Bleſſe) had but one bleſsing in his
ſtore,</hi> Gen. 27.</p>
            <p>But be the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

which a King hath, never ſo

<hi>Worthies</hi> you know, 1 <hi>Chon. 11.
10.)</hi> yet none of them may ſhare
with him in his <hi>honour of Bleſſing the
people,</hi> nor none ought to ſteale away
the hearts of his people upon any
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115067:32"/>
popular pretences whatſoever. For
theſe <hi>wheeles,</hi> of what compaſſe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they be, move all in his ſtrength,
and therefore ought to move to the
conſervation of his <hi>Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is in the Text too: for
<hi>David,</hi> no queſtion, had a wiſe and
provident <hi>Councill, Nobles</hi> of great
worth; and theſe wanted not their
deſerved <hi>Honours:</hi> (God forbid
they ſhould:) And yet when it
came to <hi>bleſſing the people,</hi> that great
meanes of ſpecialtie of Honour to
a King, there <hi>David</hi> ſtands alone
without a ſharer. <hi>Dedisti,</hi> yea but
whom? not <hi>eos,</hi> but <hi>Eum;</hi> not

And in this caſe, every man is

            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>David</hi> is obſerv'd to have

of the true God,</hi> that is the firſt;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is, <hi>Preſervation from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine

               <hi>Life and vigor of Iuſtice and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

his <hi>Bleſſings:</hi> but if he fall ſhort in

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For if he maintaine not true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
among them; then his <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings</hi>
are not <hi>for Ever,</hi> but end in the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty of this life.</hi> If he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115067:34"/>
preſerve them not from forraine
violence; then his <hi>Bleſſings</hi> reach not
ſo far as to the <hi>Ever</hi> of this life, but
are hewen downe by the ſword of

that <hi>for Ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>In perpetuum, for ever,</hi>
was abſolute in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And yet I may not forget, that
ſome times this <hi>for ever</hi> extends the
bleſſings of Kings beyond their life,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115067:35"/>
Namely, when they bleſſe their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

and that implies <hi>Succeſſion:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Janſen. &amp; Copp. ibid.</note>
So it is a <hi>Preſent,</hi> and an <hi>after bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi>
A bleſſing in <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and a
bleſſing in his <hi>ſeede.</hi> In his <hi>perſon,</hi>
and in his <hi>poſterity</hi> a <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> And
the Text fitted <hi>David</hi> home. In
<hi>himſelfe,</hi> all his life: and in <hi>Solomon</hi>
after his life, a <hi>bleſſing for ever.</hi> And
in this the Text applies it ſelfe, and
ſo will doe, I hope, <hi>for ever:</hi> and
I will ever pray, that the King may

after him, to his people, even <hi>in

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly then, the <hi>King</hi> is a <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi>
to his people, and that <hi>for ever;</hi>
but who makes him ſo? yea, now
we are come to <hi>the great Father of
bleſſings God himſelfe:</hi> for if you
marke, the Text begins at <hi>Tu dediſti,</hi>
or <hi>Tu poſuiſti;</hi> Thou Lord haſt
given him, thou haſt ſet him for
bleſſings. And God as in other,
ſo in this particular, very gracious:
for no people can merit this at
Gods hand, that <hi>their King</hi> ſhould
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115067:35"/>
be a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to them, and continue
ſo. No, you ſee <hi>Tu dediſti,</hi> thou haſt
given him, makes him <hi>Donum,</hi> a
meere gift, no purchaſe.</p>
            <p>Againe, no King can promiſe and
performe this out of his owne
ſtrength, that he will be a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to
his people, and that for <hi>ever.</hi> No, you
ſee <hi>Tu poſuiſti,</hi> thou haſt ſet him, keeps
him at his diſpoſing, leaves him not
to his owne. And indeed in this, a
<hi>Kings</hi> felicitie is borne as <hi>Chriſts</hi>
was, by an overſhadowing power;
And you cannot, no not with a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
eye, ſearch all the Reaſons how
he is ſet for Bleſſings: becauſe God
in diſpoſing it, hath hid <hi>Lumen intra
umbram,</hi> and thickned the veile that
is drawne over it.</p>
            <p>There is much, I confeſſe, in the
<hi>King,</hi> to compaſſe the Affections of
his People; and there is much in
the People, not to diſtaſt the heart
of their <hi>King</hi> for trifles, not to urge
him with indignities: But when all
is done, and the <hi>bleſſing</hi> ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi>
ready to <hi>deſcend</hi> from the One, to
the other; yet you muſt goe to <hi>Tu da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi>
Thou Lord ſhalt give it. For if he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115067:36"/>
give it not, it will not be had:
There will be a rub where it is not
looked for, and a ſtop in the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
For is there conqueſt over ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or reſt from them? why that
is <hi>Tua gratia,</hi> Gods favour. So S.

               <note place="margin">S. Baſil. Ibid.</note> Is a King, or a State, famous

neither his help, nor his favovr: It
is all at <hi>Tu dediſti,</hi> his gift, his free

            <p>There is <hi>great Errour</hi> in the
world, I pray God it be not as
<hi>Common</hi> as <hi>Great:</hi> And it is, to
thinke that this <hi>bleſſing</hi> can be

            <p>And therefore when God gives,

meanes of <hi>Gods laying Honour

by giving him as <hi>bleſsings:</hi> And this

glad with the joy of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
The Text goes on <hi>cheerfully,</hi>
(and ſo I hope you doe in hearing
it) from <hi>Bleſsing</hi> to <hi>Joy;</hi> and here
againe the circumſtances are three.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And firſt, God layes Honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the King, <hi>Laetificando,</hi> by joying
him, while he bleſſes the people.
And the <hi>joy</hi> which God gives can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be great; and therefore the
<hi>Septuagint</hi> expreſſes it by two
words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Thou ſhalt
Joy him with Joy, that is, <hi>thou ſhalt
make him exceeding glad:</hi> and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
a King ſhould have <hi>joy,</hi> great
<hi>joy,</hi> for he cannot ſit at the ſtearne,
without a great deale of <hi>Care;</hi> And
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115067:39"/>
therefore it is fit he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with a great deale of <hi>joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if a King will not faile of
this <hi>joy,</hi> he muſt goe to the right
<hi>Owner</hi> of it, God himſelfe, that
both hath and gives abundantly. If
he ſeeke it in <hi>Himſelfe,</hi> if in the very
<hi>People which he bleſſes,</hi> it will not
ever there be found. For when a
King <hi>Bleſſes</hi> his people, if the <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi>
be as <hi>diſcreetly</hi> taken, as it is
<hi>graciouſly</hi> meant; then there is <hi>joy,
great joy,</hi> of all hands: But when a

<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty,</hi> it is hard to pleaſe
them with <hi>bleſsing</hi> it ſelfe; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little thing is a burden to them,
that in long time have felt the

pace,</hi> very learned in diſturbing the
Peace of the Common-wealth:
And the factious aime of ſuch men,
is either to hinder and divert the
<hi>bleſsings</hi> which are readie, and upon
the point of deſcending from the
King upon the People; or elſe in
miſinterpreting, or extenuating
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115067:40"/>
Bleſſings already come downe.
And theſe (let the world doat on
them while they will) are the <hi>hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of mutuall joy</hi> between the Prince
and the People.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if the King will looke
to the preſevation of his owne <hi>joy,</hi>
he muſt ſeeke it where theſe cannot
hinder it, at <hi>Tu laetificaſti, Thou Lord</hi>
haſt <hi>joy'd</hi> him. And the word in my
Text is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies a joy
that is inward, and referred to the
mind. And <hi>Tu laetificaſti,</hi> is ever at
this joy; Let the <hi>Intentions</hi> be right
and honourable, and <hi>joy</hi> will follow
them. It was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe: I will
forbeare to tell you how ſcornfully,
how unworthily, he was uſed by the
baſeſt of the people: but God kept
cloſe to him, <hi>Tu laetificaſti,</hi> and
made him <hi>joyfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, where you find <hi>Tu
laetificaſti,</hi> God joying <hi>David,</hi> there
the <hi>joy</hi> is not like <hi>Lightning,</hi> a flaſh
and gone, but a true and permanent
joy: True in regard of the <hi>Author</hi>
of it, <hi>God;</hi> for here is another <hi>Tu
dediſti,</hi> God gave this alſo; and
true in regard of the <hi>Object</hi> of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which it ſettles, which is <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:115067:40"/>
too; <hi>God,</hi> and the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
And how can it be other
than true <hi>joy,</hi> that hath <hi>God</hi> at both
ends of it, as this hath? For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
at <hi>God the Author;</hi> and it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
and ends, in <hi>God the Object.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God,</hi> but not ſimply ſo expreſſed in
the Text, but <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi>
expreſſing after the manner
of men: For a man is <hi>joyed</hi> at the
<hi>countenance</hi> he loves; And yet not
ſimply ſo neither, not this <hi>Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
onely, but the <hi>joy</hi> of his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</hi>
And a man would not ſee
ſadneſſe in the face he loves; Joy
there rejoyceth him. But no <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi>
like to <hi>Gods,</hi> an eye upon the
<hi>Beauty</hi> of his <hi>Countenance</hi> fill's with
joy.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Vultus Dei,</hi> Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
here, ſignifies <hi>Gods preſence;</hi>
So <hi>Bellarm.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellarm. Ibid.</note> It is true; yet not his
preſence onely, but his <hi>Favour</hi> and
his <hi>Love</hi> too;<note place="margin">Theodor. Ibid.</note> So <hi>Theodor.</hi> It is true,
yet not <hi>empty Love</hi> onely, but <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi>
and <hi>protection</hi> too;<note place="margin">Euthy. Ib.</note> So <hi>Euthym.</hi>
It is true, yet it is not theſe alone,
but all theſe and more.</p>
            <p>And this conſider'd, it is no great
matter how you reade my Text; <hi>A,</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:115067:41"/>
or <hi>Cum,</hi> or <hi>Juxta,</hi> or <hi>Apud vultum;</hi>
For the King needs all, and God
gives all: For when he is once come
to <hi>Tu laetificasti,</hi> this joy begins at
<hi>à vultu,</hi> from his <hi>Countenance;</hi> It
goes on <hi>cum vultu,</hi> in company with
his <hi>Countenance;</hi> It enlarges it ſelfe
<hi>Iuxta vultum,</hi> when it comes neere
his <hi>Countenance;</hi> And at the laſt it
ſhall be made perfect <hi>apud vultum,</hi>
when it comes to his <hi>Countenance,
to viſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Davids</hi> cares were great,
ſo <hi>God</hi> would anſwer them with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of <hi>joy:</hi> For had <hi>God</hi> any more
<hi>Faces</hi> than one (as <hi>Ar. Mont.</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Original <hi>Cum faciebus ejus)</hi>
he would hide none of them from
<hi>David.</hi> If any were more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
than other, he ſhall ſee that.
And indeed though the <hi>Countenance
of God</hi> be but one and the ſame, yet
it doth not <hi>looke joy</hi> upon all men:
But his <hi>Aspects</hi> to the creature are
<hi>Planetary</hi> (as it were) and <hi>various.</hi>
And <hi>David</hi> is happy, that in the
midſt of all theſe various turnes of
<hi>Gods Countenance, A,</hi> and <hi>Cum,</hi> and
<hi>Iuxta,</hi> and <hi>Apud,</hi> we find not (nor
I hope never ſhall) that <hi>diſaſterous
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115067:41"/>
Aspect of oppoſition,</hi> which is <hi>contra,</hi>
againſt; for then all <hi>joy</hi> were gone:
For if it ſhould be <hi>Rex contra vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

if it ſhould be <hi>Vultus Dei contra Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,</hi>
(both which God forbid) then
it were all puniſhment; In neither
<hi>Joy,</hi> in neither <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> It is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in my Text, if we take care to
hold it there, <hi>Cum vultu, with,</hi> or <hi>in</hi>
the favour of his <hi>Countenance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, this joy begins at the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
King; <hi>Laetificaſti eum,</hi> thou haſt made
him glad. He muſt have the greateſt
care, and therefore the <hi>joy</hi> muſt be
firſt or chiefeſt in him: and if you
will take a view of my Text, you
will find <hi>Him</hi> excellently ſeated for
the purpoſe; for I find <hi>Eum,</hi> that
is <hi>David,</hi> that is the <hi>King,</hi> ſtanding
betweene <hi>Laetificaſti</hi> and <hi>Gaudium,</hi>
as if <hi>God</hi> would have the <hi>Kings</hi> place
knowne, by <hi>joy</hi> on the right hand,
and <hi>joy</hi> on the left; here God places
the King; this is his ordinance to
ſeaſon his cares: therefore if any
<hi>attempt</hi> to diſplace him, to <hi>plunge</hi>
him into griefe, <hi>to make him ſtruggle</hi>
with difficulties, it is a kind of <hi>Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi>
him. The care of Government

            </p>
            <p>And it is fit for the people, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the <hi>greater,</hi> in their <hi>families,</hi>
to look to this, that <hi>David</hi> may keep
<hi>Inter laetificaſti &amp; gaudium,</hi> the place
where God hath ſet him: for when
all is done, and the braine weary of
thinking, this will be found true;
They cannot hold their places <hi>in

dediſti,</hi> and, <hi>Tu laetificaſti,</hi> Thou haſt
given, and, Thou haſt made glad;
where could any man faſten better?
And indeed the words are a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall
proofe, either to other: For
becauſe <hi>God</hi> gives, <hi>David</hi> hopes; and
becauſe <hi>David</hi> hopes, <hi>God</hi> gives
more abundantly, <hi>Honour, Bleſſing,</hi>
and <hi>Joy.</hi> It is in the Text, <hi>Quia spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Is <hi>Truſt</hi> then, and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon God, a matter of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
that it alone ſtands as a
cauſe of theſe? Yes, <hi>Hope</hi> &amp; <hi>Truſt</hi>
rightly laid upon God, have ever

            <p>And ſince we have found <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Hope</hi> in this action of <hi>Trusting
God</hi> (as our Engliſh well expreſſes
it) let us never ſeeke to ſhut out
<hi>Charitie;</hi> And if <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and
<hi>Charity</hi> bee together, as they love
to goe, then you may underſtand
the Text, <hi>Quia Sperat,</hi> becauſe he

               <note place="margin">Li. 8. Orig. cap. 2.</note> For (as S. <hi>Iſidor</hi>
obſerves) <hi>in all inward worſhip, which
is the heart of Religion, are theſe three,
Faith, Hope, and Charity.</hi> And in
the moſt uſuall phraſe of Scripture,
(though not ever) ſcarce one of
theſe is named, but all are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
to be preſent; and if ſo, then,
becauſe he truſts, is as much as <hi>Quia

why <hi>God</hi> ſet <hi>David</hi> for ſuch a

               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:115067:44"/>
becauſe he was ſuch a religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiper.</p>
            <p>It is in the Text then, that a
Kings Religion is a great cauſe of
his happineſſe. The greateſt <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>

to make a King a <hi>Bleſsing</hi> to his

But the matter is not great

a falſe <hi>Religion,</hi> ſo it be one. But
they are here in a miſerable errour;
for ſince they ſuppoſe a <hi>Religion</hi>
neceſſary (as they muſt) my Text
will turne all the reſt upon them;
that <hi>true Religion</hi> is moſt apt, and

whereſoever it is not prevented or

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next, <hi>true Religion</hi> breeds ever true
<hi>Faith,</hi> and true <hi>Hope</hi> in God;
which no falſe Religion can: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is more apt. Then, true

So that till Chriſtians for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake

            <p>Thirdly, Since <hi>Quia ſperat,</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Faith and Religion of a King, is
that which brings God to give him
as a Bleſſing; It muſt not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
that <hi>Truſt in God,</hi> is <hi>inter

foundations of Kings. And <hi>ſpes</hi> is

               <note place="margin">Lib. 8. Ori. cap. 2.</note> Hope (ſaith <hi>Iſidore)</hi> is the

no building can ſtand, if the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
be digg'd from under it. The
Buildings are the Bleſſings of a
State; A prime foundation of them,
is the Kings truſt in God: Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the truth of this <hi>Hope, Faith,</hi>
and <hi>Religion,</hi> and I cannot promiſe
the Bleſsings to ſtand; for then there
is never another <hi>Quia,</hi> or <hi>cauſe</hi> in

But if the cauſe ſtand (as <hi>Theodor.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And ſo I come to the laſt part of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115067:45"/>
my Text, which is the happy <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe</hi>
which <hi>David</hi> ſhall have for
truſting in the <hi>Lord.</hi> It is a <hi>Reward,</hi>
and <hi>Rewards</hi> come laſt. And it is,
That in this truſt, he ſhall not ſlide,
he ſhall not miſcary. And here
(to make all parts even) are three
circumſtances too.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe, is the <hi>Succeſſe</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
or <hi>Reward</hi> it ſelfe; and it is a great
one: <hi>Non commovebitur,</hi> He ſhall
not be <hi>moved;</hi> or at leaſt not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
not <hi>miſcarry.</hi> And this is a great
<hi>Succeſſe,</hi> To have to doe with the
greateſt moveables in the world, the
people, and not <hi>miſcarry.</hi> So that
truſt in the Lord, makes a King in
the midſt of a mighty people, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram
in mari turbido,</hi> A Rocke in a
working Sea: Ebbe, and ſlow, and
ſwell, yet inſolent waves daſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in pieces of all ſides the Rock;
and the King is at <hi>Non commovebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
He ſhall not be <hi>moved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This great <hi>Succeſſe</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
doth not attend on Kings, for either
their wiſdome, or their power, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing elſe that is ſimply theirs:
No, we muſt fall back to <hi>ſpes in
Domino,</hi> their truſt in the Lord: yea
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115067:46"/>
and this truſt too, is not ſimply up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lord, but upon his <hi>Mercy.</hi>
And indeed to ſpeak properly, Man
hath no ground of his Hope but
<hi>Mercy,</hi> no ſtay upon the ſlippery, but
<hi>Mercy:</hi> For if he looke upon God,
and conſider him in juſtice; If he
looke upon himſelfe, and weigh his
ſoule by merit, it is impoſſible for
a man to Hope, or in Hope not to
<hi>miſcarry.</hi> And therefore the Prophet
here, though he promiſe <hi>non co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur,</hi>
that the King ſhall not miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
yet he dares promiſe it no where
elſe than <hi>In miſericordia,</hi> in <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, I will not omit the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
whoſe <hi>Mercy</hi> it is that
gives ſucceſſe to Princes; and that
is <hi>Altiſsimi,</hi> the mercie of the moſt
high, which is one of Gods uſuall
Names in Scripture. Now <hi>Sperat, &amp;
non commovebitur;</hi> The Kings Hope
and his Succeſſe, doe both meete in
the <hi>Highest mercy.</hi> It is true, Hope
ſtands below, and out of ſight: For
Hope that is ſeene is no hope,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 24</note> 
               <hi>Rom.
8.</hi> yet as low as it ſtands it contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates
God <hi>qua Altiſsimus,</hi> as he is
at higheſt. And this ſhewes the
ſtrength of this vertue of Hope:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115067:46"/>
For as Hope conſidered in <hi>nature</hi> is
in men that are warme and ſpirited,
ſo is it alſo conſidered as a <hi>vertue.</hi>
And therefore give it but due foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
which is upon <hi>Mercy,</hi> and in
the ſtrength of that, it will clime to
God, were it poſſible he ſhould be
<hi>Higher</hi> than he is.</p>
            <p>The footing of Hope is low,
therefore it ſeekes Mercie; and the
Kings Hope keepes the foote of the
hill: <hi>Rex humili corde sperat;</hi> (So
S. <hi>Auguſt.)</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And the beſt hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
loweſt; not at merit, but at
<hi>mercy.</hi> But then marke how it
ſoars: For the ſame hope that bears
the ſoule of man company upon
earth, mounts till it comes <hi>ad Altiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimum,</hi>
to the moſt High in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Now in this Mercy-ſeate it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
three Grandies are met
together; <hi>Bleſſing, Joy,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi>
and yet there is no ſtrife for prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie:
For <hi>Bleſsing</hi> goes firſt; <hi>Joy</hi>
comes after, for no man ſo joyfull
as hee that is <hi>Bleſſed;</hi> and then
<hi>Hope,</hi> to ſupply the defects of both,
becauſe nor <hi>Bleſsings</hi> nor <hi>Joy,</hi> can be
perfect in this life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:115067:47"/>
And they have choſen to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
an excellent and ſafe place in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the <hi>Mercy of the most High.</hi> An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
place, and all receive vertue
from it. For, that <hi>David</hi> is able to be
a <hi>Bleſsing</hi> to the people; that he
can <hi>joy</hi> in the Bleſſing; that his
<hi>Hope</hi> can ſupport him through the
cares in ordering the bleſſing, ere he
can come to the <hi>joy;</hi> all is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mercy.</p>
            <p>And a ſafe place it is: For there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are in all times, and in all States,
<hi>Conatus impiorum,</hi> endeavours of
wicked men, and the labour of
theſe is, to turne <hi>Bleſsing</hi> it ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a curſe; To overcloud <hi>joy</hi> with
ſorrow at leaſt, if not Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
To cruſh <hi>Hope,</hi> or rather, <hi>Decolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
to behead it. No place ſafe from
theſe attempts, but that which is high,
and out of reach; And no place ſo
high, as <hi>Sinus Altiſsimi,</hi> the boſome
of the Higheſt, which is, his <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon then why <hi>David</hi> ſhall
not miſcarry; nay, not ſo much as
<hi>Nature,</hi> ſhake, (as <hi>Ar. Mont.</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it,) why the ſcepter in his
hand ſhall not be <gap reason="foreign">

while they reſt upon Gods <hi>Mercy,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And now to reach downe ſome
of the Mercies of the Higheſt upon
our ſelves: For when I reade <hi>David,</hi>
at <hi>Rex ſperat,</hi> The King truſts in the
Lord; and heare him ſpeaking in the
third perſon, as of another King,
me thinkes the prophecie is worth
the bringing home to our moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Soveraigne. For, his conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in Religion is knowen to the
world; And the freedome of his
life, argues his truſt in the Lord;
And the aſſurance of his Hope ſhall
not vaniſh. For, let him keep to the
mercy of the Higheſt, and there he
ſhall not miſcarry.</p>
            <p>And give me leave to ſpeake a
little out of my <hi>Spes in Domino,</hi> my
truſt in the Lord; me thinkes I ſee,
<hi>Non commovebitur,</hi> He ſhall not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115067:48"/>
three wayes doubling upon
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> him. Firſt, for his <hi>Private;</hi> I have
two great inducements among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in another Kingdome, to thinke
that he is ſo firme in the mercies of
God, that he cannot miſcary. The
one is as old as <hi>Novemb.</hi> 5. 1605.
The powder was ready then, but
the <hi>Fire</hi> could not kindle: The other
is as young as <hi>January laſt, the</hi> 9.
The <hi>water</hi> was too ready then, and
he fell into it. Neither of theſe <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
have any mercy, but the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Higheſt was His Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from both. In the firſt, he

               <hi>I will not

            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:115067:48"/>
Next, me thinks, I have a <hi>Non</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>commovebitur,</hi> he ſhall not miſcarry,

I am none, but my Heart is full, that
the mercy of the <hi>Higheſt,</hi> which hath

and from great dangers, hath more
work for him yet to doe: the peace
of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> is yet to ſettle. Will
God honour this <hi>Iſland</hi> in him, and

Why ſhould there not be truſt in

            <p>Thirdly, For that which is greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

            </p>
            <p>Thus you have ſeene the <hi>Kings

this <hi>Hope</hi> ſtands amidſt the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of Kings. The <hi>Succeſſe</hi> aſſured
unto him, is, <hi>Non commovebitur,</hi> he

            <p>
               <hi>Non commovebitur,</hi> drive wind
and tide, he ſhall not miſcarry. Shall
not? what? is it abſolute then for
<hi>David,</hi> or for any King? No, I ſay
not ſo neither. There is a double
condition in the Text, if <hi>David</hi> will
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not miſcarry; the one is <hi>ex parte
Davidis,</hi> on <hi>Davids</hi> ſide, and that is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115067:49"/>
at <hi>Sperat,</hi> a religious heart to God,
that cannot but truſt in him. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
other is <hi>ex parte Dei,</hi> on Gods ſide,
and that is at <hi>Miſericordia,</hi> a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
providence over the King, which
knowes not how to forſake, till it
be forſaken, if it doe then. Let us
call in the Prophet for witneſſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 94. 18</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.
94. When I ſaid, My foot hath ſlipped,
thy mercie, O Lord, held me up.</hi> Now
the foot of a man ſlips from the
condition,<note place="margin">Collat. 3. c. 12.</note> from the truſt, (as <hi>Caſſian</hi>
obſerves) <hi>Mobilitate Arbitrii,</hi> by the
changings of the will, which is too
free to ſinne, and breach of truſt;
the Holder up in the ſlip is <hi>Mercie,</hi>
therefore it is ſafeſt relying upon
the condition which is on Gods ſide,
that is Mercy, for that holds firme,
when men break.</p>
            <p>And mark my Text, Hope goes
before, and <hi>Non commovebitur,</hi> he
ſhall not miſcarry, followes after:
but yet it followes not, till the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the <hi>Higheſt</hi> be come in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene.
And indeed to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
all thoſe things which the
Scripture attributes to the Faith and
Hope of man, are due onely <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordiae
Altiſſimi,</hi> to the Mercy of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115067:50"/>
the <hi>Higheſt,</hi> which both gives and
rewards them.</p>
            <p>And yet for all this, the Hope of
the Beleever, and the Mercy of God
in whom he truſts, are happily joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in my Text: becauſe the Hope
of Faith can obtaine nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Mercie of the Higheſt; And
that Mercie and Goodneſſe will not
profit any man, that doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
and truſt in it. And Hope and
Mercie are not better fitted to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<hi>David,</hi> than Mercie and the
Higheſt are, to make him apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
of his aſſurance: For Goodneſſe
&amp; Mercie are invalid without Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
now that is ſupplyed by <hi>Altiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus,</hi>
the Higheſt. And power is
full of terrour when it ſtands apart
from goodneſſe; and that is ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by mercy: when both meet, the
Hope of man is full. So <hi>David</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but ſee all firme on Gods ſide;
and ſure he is not to miſcarry, if he
look to performance of his owne.
And though it be ſafeſt relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, yet it is never ſafe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne
them whom God hath put
together. And therefore as he is
mercifull, ſo Man muſt be faithfull,
He muſt truſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:115067:50"/>
And now to end at home, <hi>David</hi>
is gone long ſince to his <hi>Hope,</hi> the
<hi>Mercy of the Higheſt:</hi> But a King,
a gracious King, is living over us in
Peace, and Happineſſe, as our eyes

            <p>I know He remembers why God
ſet Him over this great and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

            </p>
            <p>But whatſoever the uſe of this
<hi>Pſalme</hi> was in any ſpeciall Service,
certaine it is, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtands
here in the letter for the <hi>City,</hi> and in
type and figure for the <hi>State, and
the Church of Chriſt.</hi> My Text looks
upon both; and upon the duty
which the <hi>Jewes</hi> did then, and which
<hi>we</hi> now doe owe to both. The
<hi>Temple</hi> the Type of the <hi>Church,</hi>
that's for God's ſervice. No Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
but for that. The <hi>City</hi> the Type
of the <hi>State,</hi> that's for the peoples
peace. No happy <hi>State</hi> but in that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:115067:53"/>
Both the <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>State,
God's</hi> houſe and the <hi>Kings,</hi> both are
built upon <hi>Pillars.</hi> And it is not
long ſince I told you out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.<note place="margin">Pſal. 75. 4.</note>
that there are many times of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
in which if God doe not
beare up the <hi>Pillars,</hi> no ſtrength
which the <hi>Pillars</hi> have in and of
themſelves can ſupport the weight
that lies upon them; Be they <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>
of the <hi>Temple,</hi> or <hi>Pillars</hi> of the
<hi>State.</hi> Therefore here to eaſe the
<hi>Pillars</hi> God hath built up <hi>Buttreſſes</hi>
(if men doe not pull them downe)
to ſtay the maine walls of both
buildings. The <hi>Buttreſſe</hi> and ſupport
of the <hi>Temple</hi> is <hi>Religion.</hi> God will
not bleſſe the houſe, if men doe not
honour and ſerve him in it. The
<hi>Buttreſſe</hi> and ſtay of the <hi>Kingdome</hi>
is <hi>Juſtice.</hi> God will not bleſſe the
State, if <hi>Kings</hi> and Magiſtrates doe
not execute judgement; If the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
and the fatherleſſe have cauſe
to cry out againſt the Thrones of
Juſtice.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
Gods</hi> houſe, the Temple, and
the <hi>Kings</hi> houſe, the houſe of <hi>David,</hi>
are met in my Text. And they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115067:54"/>
would ever meet, and in love no
queſtion, did not ſome diſtempered
ſpirits breath ſoure upon them. For
the <hi>Church</hi> cannot dwell but in the
<hi>State.</hi> Ye never read that ſhe fled
out of the State into the wilderneſſe,
but when ſome <hi>Dragon</hi> perſecuted
her,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. And the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>
cannot flouriſh without the
<hi>Church.</hi> For where the Church is not
to teach true Religion, States are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced,
out of neceſſity of ſome, to
imbrace a falſe; And a falſe is not a
help to make a Kingdome flouriſh.
But when they dwell together, when
the Church, the <hi>Houſe of Grace,</hi> is a
welcome inmate to the State, which
is a <hi>wiſe fabricke of Nature;</hi> then in
the Temple there's meeting: The
people goe up to bleſſe, and praiſe
the Name of the Lord. And then in
the State ther's meeting, To ſettle
the Thrones of Judgement, to make
firme the houſe of <hi>David.</hi> And
then, and never but then, <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
that is, both State and Church,
<hi>is a City as that is at unity in it
ſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Text is nothing but a moſt

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115067:54"/>
not of the particular materiall <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
alone, but of any State,
of any Church, that is as <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
then was, and that doth as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
then did. This praiſe of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
both <hi>formall</hi> in it ſelfe, and
<hi>exemplary</hi> to us, is ſet downe in

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Secondly, the Religion of it; <hi>For

is from the unity and concord

            <p>Thus it was with <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of

And they ſmarted for it.
But I pray what's the difference for

If the firſt were our <hi>Forefathers</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,

            </p>
            <p>Now there is <hi>Coagmentatio du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex,</hi>
a double buckling and knitting
of the State together. And if either
faile, the unity is broken. The one
is of the <hi>Members</hi> of the State with

which are neereſt. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is of the Members one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And this is grounded upon that
of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Cor. 12.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. where we
find ſome neceſſity of every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
not a like neceſſity of any: but

tells you <hi>ver.</hi> 25.<note place="margin">Verſ. 25.</note> It is that there
may be no diviſion in the body;
that ſtill it may be at unity in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>And it is very obſervable, that in
all that large diſcourſe of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
concerning the unity of the <hi>Body</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:115067:58"/>

            <p>Well he can conceive that; But he
doth not ſo much as ſuppoſe, that
any members would be at odds with
the <hi>Head:</hi> No, God forbid. The
<hi>Head</hi> can compoſe other members,
and ſettle their peace in the <hi>Body;</hi>
but if any quarrell the <hi>Head,</hi> all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

ſuppoſe ſo much unnaturalneſſe
that any member ſhould quarrell
the <hi>Head;</hi> not the <hi>Tongue,</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
as it is: yet he is very direct,
that there is an office, which the
<hi>Head</hi> owes the <hi>Body,</hi> and all the
<hi>members</hi> to the very meaneſt, for
the preſervation of this unity. For
the <hi>head</hi> cannot ſay to the very <hi>feet,</hi>
as low as they are,<note place="margin">Verſ. 22.</note> 
               <hi>I have no need of

            <p>And for the <hi>Church,</hi> that's as the

are the walls and the towers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115067:58"/>
of it. But be the one never ſo true,
and be the other never ſo perfect,
they come ſhort of preſervation, if
that body be not at unity in it ſelfe.
The <hi>Church,</hi> take it <hi>Catholike,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtand well, if it be not compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together into a holy unity in
Faith and Charity. It was miſerable,

And 'tis miſerable at this day, the

            <p>And as the <hi>whole Church</hi> is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the affaires of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi>
ſo is each <hi>particular Church</hi> in the
<hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>Kingdome</hi> in which it
Sojournes. If it be not at unity in it

is ready to doe hurt without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation;
and it ever lies with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
ſide to the <hi>Devill,</hi> and all his
<hi>Batteries.</hi> So both <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church</hi>
then happy, and never till then, when
they are both at unity in themſelves
and one with another.</p>
            <p>The Vulgar reads it, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is
a City, <hi>cujus participatio in id ipſum,</hi>
whoſe participation is upon the

followes the effect, the other the
cauſe. For unity in it ſelfe is the

is in charity; and charity communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
all good things. 'Tis bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

            <p>The 70. and the Vulgar have it,
To <hi>confeſſe</hi> to the name of the Lord.

the publike externall Service of

went to the <hi>Temple,</hi> as we muſt goe

Nor may the wiſdome of the

For what ever worldlings think, the

The <hi>Originall Copy of the Law,</hi> The

but was according to the Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined

For if every man may preach

this comming to the Temple to

by the <hi>Prophet</hi> an <hi>Aſcent</hi> or going

It was fitted in the <hi>Letter:</hi> For the

For how low ſoever the ſituation of

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115067:63"/>
'tis fit in regard of the whole <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

if he had not been ſinking and going

Nor can any man ſay, faine I would

what <hi>paines</hi> they then were

GOD: And notwithſtanding both
paines and charge <hi>properabant aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi>

Now, the Church is at our doores,
and we care not for going into
it; And we come up empty handed,
elſe it were not poſſible ſo many
Churches ſhould lye ſo ruinous as
they doe. Will you give me leave to
tell you the reaſon of this? 'Tis in
my Text; When this devotion was
on foote, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was at unity in
it ſelfe: For ſo goes the Text. <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
at unitie, and then <hi>aſcenderunt,</hi>

their devotion with them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And this falls in upon the <hi>Perſons</hi>
that went up to ſerve the Lord.
And they were the <hi>Tribes.</hi> Not all
the <hi>Tribes, Families,</hi> and <hi>Kindreds</hi> of
the earth; No: For the many by

               <hi>Idolatry</hi> had made themſelves ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

<hi>Tribus Domini,</hi> the Tribes of the

            <p>The 12. <hi>Tribes</hi> from the <hi>Patriarks</hi>
the ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> were then Gods
peculiar ſervants. They were
made ſo in the Covenant. The Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of it was the Law. So this
honour to be the <hi>Tribes</hi> of the Lord,
God's people, was reſerved in the
band of Religion. If they had not
beleeved, and ſerved God, they had
not beene his. They might have
beene <hi>Tribes,</hi> if you will, without
ſerving in the Temple; but not <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi>
not of the Lord, but by that
ſervice. And they might have beene
in ſome kinde of <hi>unity;</hi> but not <hi>in

union. And they might have beene
builded as a <hi>City;</hi> but not <hi>ad Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
to the Lord's honour, and
their owne ſalvation, but by that
faith. And which was the honour
of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> then in all <hi>David's</hi>

And the <hi>Law</hi> ſayes not ſimply, that

            <p>Would you have a reaſon why

<hi>For there alſo are the ſeates of

For theſe three, <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and

to him; That no man can
ſerve any one of them truly, but he
ſerves all three.</p>
            <p>And ſurely 'twas in a bleſſed fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
that Gods houſe and the Kings

too; that no man might thinke
himſelfe the farther from <hi>God</hi> by
ſerving the <hi>King,</hi> nor the farther
from the <hi>King</hi> by ſerving <hi>God.</hi> The
Kings power is Gods ordinance,
and the Kings command muſt be
Gods glory: and the honour of the
Subject is obedience to both. And
therefore in the <hi>Law</hi> the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115067:67"/>
that lay upon the people to
come up <hi>illuc,</hi> thither, to <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi>
the very ſame lay upon them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey

               <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and both them
and the King, after the houſe of

For then there was ſeated <hi>(as divers

            <p>

needs it. And 'tis not poſſible <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
ſhould be long at unity in

this leſſon Religion ever teacheth.
For it was the very end of Chriſts

            <p>This for Juſtice the preſervative <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

They which are appointed to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter

or <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tes,</hi> (call them what you will,
the thing is the ſame) out of which
they give ſentence upon Perſons or
Cauſes brought before them. And
they are ſignes of authority and
power which the Iudges have. And
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115067:68"/>
'tis not for nothing, that they are
called <hi>Seates.</hi> For Judgement was
ever given in publike, <hi>ſitting.</hi> And
there's good reaſon for it. For the
ſoule and minde of man is not ſo
ſettled when the Body is in motion.
For the Body moved moves the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;
and the Humours moved
move the affections;<note place="margin">Non cadem videntur Judicibus tratis &amp; quictis.</note> and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Seates</hi> ſtand here both

for the perpetuity and

The perſons muſt have their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

The words in my Text are plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<hi>Seates of Iudgement.</hi> And 'tis
obſervable. For the exorbitances of
men that quarrell others are ſuch
and ſo many, that one <hi>Seat</hi> of

ſufficient for any State. <hi>Seats</hi> they
muſt be, and they ſeldome want
worke. In the prime times of the
Church, <hi>Chriſtians could not hold from
going to Law one with another, and
that under unbeleevers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 6</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. To

            <p>Since this diviſion of the <hi>Seats</hi> of

            <p>The time is now come in this

as hard, if they will be ſo unchriſtian

which ſit in them will remember, or
at the leaſt, that the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>David</hi>
will not forget, That when God
himſelfe (and he beſt knowes what

erected <hi>Seates</hi> of judgement, Hee
was ſo farre from <hi>Eccleſiaſticall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie,</hi>
that he ſet the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi>

            <p>I know there are ſome that think

And ſo we are come to the laſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
the great Circumſtance of the Text,
<hi>the Houſe of David:</hi> the Guide, and
the ground too, under God, of that
unity which bleſſes <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> The
<hi>houſe,</hi> that is, not the houſe onely,
but the Government. All <hi>Regall and
Judiciary power</hi> was ſeated by God
himſelfe in <hi>David</hi> and his Poſterity,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 10. &amp; Pſal. 89. 36.</note> That He, as King over
his people, might take care, both
that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> might be <hi>at unity in
it ſelfe;</hi> and <hi>that the Tribes of the
Lord might goe thither to give thanks
to the Name of the Lord:</hi> that all the
ſervants of God among that people
might know, that God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them to the truſt of <hi>David;</hi>
that they might not promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſuccour from <hi>God,</hi> otherwiſe
than as they lived in obedience to
<hi>David;</hi> that they might not think
to alter the government, or the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
but reſt dutifully where
God had placed them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> rent ten Tribes
from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but diſtraction and miſery fell
upon that people ever after, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in the ſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:115067:71"/>
This to the letter ſtrictly. Now
to the ſenſe at large, as both Church
and State have ſubordination to the
houſe of <hi>David.</hi> For <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that's
at unity under <hi>David.</hi> And the
Tribes they goe up to the Teſtimony
under <hi>David.</hi> And the <hi>Seats</hi> of
Judgement, they have their ſeverall
miniſtrations, but all with reference,
all in obedience to the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in a State the <hi>King, obtinet
locum fundamenti,</hi> is alwayes funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.
All inferiour powers of
Nobles, Iudges, and Magiſtrates reſt
on him. And yet the holy Ghoſt doth
not ſay in my Text, that the ſeats of
Iudgement are upon the foundation
of <hi>David,</hi> but upon the <hi>Houſe</hi> of
<hi>David.</hi> And the reaſon is plaine:
becauſe there is one and the ſame
<hi>foundation</hi> of the King and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that is, God and Chriſt. But
when the houſe of the King is built
upon God, as <hi>David's</hi> was, then 'tis
to the people, <hi>&amp; domus, &amp; funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi>
both an houſe and a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all their houſes.</p>
            <p>And that you may ſee the truth
of this, looke into the Story of all
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115067:71"/>
States, and you ſhall never finde a
thunderclap upon the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
to make it ſhake, but the houſes
of all the Subjects in the Kingdome
ſhooke with it. And this is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Argument, that the houſe of
<hi>David</hi> is a <hi>Foundation,</hi> when ſuch a
mighty building as a State, is ſhaken
with it. And therefore there's no
man that loves his owne houſe, but
hee muſt love the <hi>Kings,</hi> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and ſtudie to keepe it from
ſhaking.</p>
            <p>And if you marke the Text, here's
<hi>Sedes ſuper ſedem,</hi> one <hi>Throne,</hi> or
<hi>Seate,</hi> upon another. And all well-ordered
States are built ſo by <hi>Sub</hi>
and <hi>Super,</hi> by <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
The intermediate Magiſtrates
have their ſubordinations either to
other, and all to <hi>David.</hi> But the
<hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>David</hi> that's both, <hi>Sub &amp;
Super;</hi> under the reſt in the <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
for ſo the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and the
Fathers reade it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, upon the
houſe of <hi>David:</hi> ſo the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
under, as <hi>Foundation;</hi> but over
the reſt in the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> and the

               <hi>primacie,</hi> or <hi>ſuperintendencie,</hi> or what
you will above the houſe of <hi>David</hi>
in his owne Kingdome, is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and an ill conſtruction of <hi>Super
Domum David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The houſe of <hi>David</hi> a <hi>Foundation</hi>
then; and my Text warrants both
it and mee. I have no will to except
againſt any forme of government,
aſſumed by any State: Yet this my
Text bids me ſay for the honour of
<hi>Monarchicall Government,</hi> The <hi>Seats</hi>
of judgement in it are permanent;
And I doe not remember that ever
I read <hi>Seates of Judgemens</hi> ſo fixed,
as under <hi>Regall power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doe not by this deny, but that
there may be the City in peace, and
adminiſtration of juſtice in other
formes of government, ſomtimes
aſmuch, ſomtimes more; But there
are <hi>Judicia,</hi> not <hi>Sedes,</hi> Iudgement,
not Seates of it. And Iuſtice there
may be; but it continues not halfe ſo
ſteddy. The Factions of an <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craty</hi>
how often have they divided
the City into civill wars, and made
that City which was at unity in it
ſelfe, wade in her owne bloud? And
for a <hi>Democratie,</hi> or popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115067:72"/>
               <hi>Fluctus populi fluctus

no ſafety or ſettledneſſe, till there

            <p>I'le goe no whither but to my

That people had a <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> over
them, a wonderfull wiſe and great

and the moſt expert in their Lawes
of the other Tribes. If any greater

This people were well, a man

reſtles and unquiet even with the

the diſobedience of <hi>Saul,</hi> (which can
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115067:73"/>
caſt even Kings out of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour)
that State was ſetled upon the

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> then a <hi>Foundation,</hi> and
a ſettled one too, as Mortality hath
any. The whole frame of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
underſtood here by
the <hi>Seats of Iudgement</hi> reſts upon
the ſtrength of his <hi>houſe.</hi> Upon his
<hi>houſe?</hi> therefore it muſt be built
and ſettled; elſe 'tis not <hi>domus,</hi> not
a houſe: When 'tis built, it muſt be
furniſhed, and plentifully too; elſe
'tis not fit to be <hi>domus Davidis,</hi> the
Kings houſe. If any diſaſter hath
been, it muſt be repayed; elſe <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

be no <hi>foundation</hi> of Iuſtice to friends
at home, or upon enemies abroad.
And there can hardly be a greater
miſery to a Kingdome, than to have
the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>David</hi> weake.</p>
            <p>Well then; would you have the
<hi>houſe</hi> of <hi>David</hi> as <hi>Davids</hi> was now
at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> A built, A furniſhed,
A ſtrong, an honourable <hi>Houſe?</hi> I
know you would. You are a Noble
&amp; a moſt Loyall People. Why then I
will not take upon me to teach, but
onely to remember you of the way.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115067:73"/>
The way is;—Am I out? No ſure.
The way is, to ſet <hi>David</hi> once upon
his owne feet; to make him ſee the
ſtrength of the <hi>houſe</hi> which God
hath given him; to fill him with joy
and contentment in his peoples
love; to adde of your oyle to make
him a cheerefull countenance, now
that <hi>God hath anointed him with the
oyle of gladneſſe over you;</hi> that in a
free Eſtate he may have leiſure from
Home-Cares, every way to intend
the good and welfare of his people;
and to bleſſe God for them, and
them in God.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>David,</hi> God hath bleſſed
him with many royall Vertues. And
above the reſt with the knowledge
that his <hi>Houſe</hi> is a <hi>foundation.</hi> A <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
of his people, and of all the
juſtice that muſt preſerve them in
unity, and in happineſſe. But tis <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
ejus, His Houſe</hi> ſtill, even while
tis your <hi>foundation.</hi> And never feare
him, for God is with him. He will
not depart from Gods ſervice; nor
from the honourable care of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
nor from wiſe managing of his
treaſure: He will never undermine
his owne <hi>houſe,</hi> nor give his people
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115067:74"/>
juſt cauſe to be jealous of a ſhaking
<hi>foundation.</hi> And here in the preſence
of God and his bleſſed Angels, as
well as of you, which are but duſt
and aſhes, I diſcharge the true
thoughts of my heart, and flatter
not. And now my <hi>Dread Soveraigne,</hi>
upon you it lyes to make good the
thoughts of your moſt devoted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
            <p>Thus you have ſeene as ſhort a
<hi>Mapp,</hi> as I could draw of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
She was famous for her <hi>unity,</hi> and
bleſſed too, when it was <hi>within her
ſelfe.</hi> Shee was famous for her <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
and devout too, when <hi>all the
Tribes went up to the Arke of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,
to give thanks to the name of
the Lord.</hi> She was famous for <hi>Juſtice,</hi>
and ſucceſsfull too, both at home,
and againſt forreigne enemies,
when the <hi>Seates</hi> of Judgement Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
and Civill were all, as
their ſeverall natures beare, founded
upon the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> of ours is now <hi>at

of the Tribes, and People of

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115067:74"/>
his Temple. I would to God they
were all here, that with one heart,
and one mouth, we might all pray
unto God for all his bleſſings
to come down, and dwell in the

great and honourable <hi>Councell</hi> ready

            <p>You are come up to begin at the

wholly Ceremoniall; that's not
here. But the <hi>Teſtimonie of Iſrael,</hi>
the Law, yea and a better Law than
that, the Law of Grace and of Chriſt,
that's here. Here it is, and open rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to teach <hi>the feare of the Lord,</hi>
which is <hi>the beginning of all wiſdome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 111. 10.</note>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. In this Law you can read

            </p>
            <p>To the Temple and the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
you are come up. When God
would give <hi>Moſes</hi> more ſpeciall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
he declared himſelfe from
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115067:75"/>
the <hi>Mercy-ſeat</hi> which was on the
<hi>Arke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 25. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. The <hi>Mercy-ſeat</hi>
was wholly Ceremoniall, as the <hi>Arke</hi>
was on which it ſtood; that is, the
<hi>Seate</hi> Ceremonie, but the <hi>Mercy</hi>
Subſtance. And though the <hi>Seat</hi> be
gone with <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet I hope God
hath not left, will never leave, to
appeare in <hi>Mercy</hi> to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of
<hi>David,</hi> and this wiſe <hi>Councell.</hi> If he
appeare in <hi>mercy,</hi> I fear nothing. If
he appeare otherwiſe there will be
cauſe to feare all things. And the
way to have God appeare in <hi>mercy,</hi>
is for both King and People, not
onely to come to the Temple, that's
but the outſide of Religion, but alſo
to obey the Law, &amp; the Teſtimonie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judgement</hi> went out from God
lately, and it was fierce. How many
thouſands ſtrong men, which might
have been a wall about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
hath the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> ſwept away? But
his <hi>mercy</hi> ſoone overtook his <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
For when did the eye of
man behold ſo ſtrange and ſodaine
abatement of ſo great <hi>Mortality?</hi>
A great argument, that he will now
appeare in <hi>Mercie.</hi> And I cannot
tell which hath got the better in the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115067:75"/>
vie, <hi>Your Honour</hi> or <hi>Your Religion,</hi>
that you have made ſuchhaſt to bring

over <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Reg 5.</note> as well as <hi>Juda.</hi> The
occaſion of this his ſolemne devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was, not onely the care which he
had of the world in generall, the
<hi>earth;</hi> but much more, and much
neerer the care which he took of the
Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> now committed
by God unto his Government. That
Kingdome was then filled with civil
combuſtions; and the Church (as it
uſes to be in a troubled State) was
out of order too.</p>
            <p>The Learned, both the Fathers
and the later Divines, differ much
about my Text. For ſome will reade
it <hi>Time;</hi> and ſome, <hi>The Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
And the beſt is, there's war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
authority for both. Againe,
ſome will have it, that this ſpeech
<hi>(I will judge according unto right)</hi> is
<hi>Davids</hi> promiſe to God, of his juſt
adminiſtration of the Kingdome;
and ſome, that it is <hi>Gods</hi> promiſe to
<hi>David,</hi> of his Grace and Aſſiſtance,
to inable him ſo to governe. If it be
Gods ſpeech, they are not all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
neither whether it be meant
of his temporary execution of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115067:78"/>
judgement in this life; or of his
great and finall judgement. Nor doe
they all agree, whether by the <hi>Earth,</hi>
be meant the whole <hi>world,</hi> and the
<hi>Church</hi> ſpread over it; or the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Jewes,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi>
as then conteined in it. But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is not great. For the Scripture is
not only <hi>true,</hi> but <hi>full</hi> in all theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
and all of them come in cloſe
upon the letter of the Text. And
therefore for ought I know, it is
the ſafeſt way, which ſhuts out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that the Text includes. And
my Text will eaſily take in all, if you
conſider the words, as <hi>Davids</hi> ſpeech;
yet ſo, as that one way <hi>David</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
to ſpeak in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and another way in Gods.</p>
            <p>And this is no newes. For uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> one and the ſame
ſpeech is meant of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
and one and the ſame action ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> And the
reaſon of this is plaine: For the
<hi>King</hi> is Gods immediate <hi>Lieutenant</hi>
upon earth; and therefore one and
the ſame <hi>action</hi> is Gods by ordinance,
and the Kings by execution. And
the power which reſides in the King,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115067:79"/>
is not any aſſuming to himſelfe, nor
any gift from the people,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1</note> but Gods
power, as well in, as over him.</p>
            <p>So <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> ſtand very
neere together. And it is an infinite
bleſſing both upon the King, and
the people, when the Kings heart
keeps as neere unto God, as Gods
power is to the King. For then 'tis
but reading of my Text, and you
both ſee and enjoy the bleſſing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
            <p>For then the <hi>Congregation</hi> that
comes up, the <hi>great Congregation;
great</hi> in number, <hi>great</hi> in place, and
<hi>great</hi> in power. It ſhall not loſe it's
labour: For, <hi>I will receive it,</hi> ſaith
God; and I, ſaith the King. The
Congregation, whether it be to
ſerve God, or the State, or both,
comes up at an appointed time;
and, <hi>I will make a convenient time for
it,</hi> ſaith God; and, <hi>I will take a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
time for it,</hi> ſaith the King.
<hi>When I have received it,</hi> and in this
<hi>time, I will judge</hi> in it, and by it,
<hi>according unto right,</hi> ſaith God; and
<hi>I,</hi> ſaith the King. If <hi>Iuſtice</hi> and
<hi>Iudgement</hi> be not executed, the
<hi>Earth</hi> will <hi>diſſolve,</hi> the Kingdomes
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115067:79"/>
will <hi>melt</hi> away, all things will <hi>ſinke</hi>
and <hi>fall;</hi> but <hi>I will beare up the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of it,</hi> ſaith God; and <hi>I,</hi> ſaith
the King. If the <hi>Earth diſſolve,</hi> the
Militant Church which dwells upon
it <hi>ſhakes</hi> preſently; It muſt needs
beare part with the State in which
it is; but <hi>I will beare up the pillars
of that</hi> too, ſaith God; and <hi>I,</hi> ſaith
the King. So bleſſed a thing it is,
where God and the King keepe
neere, and worke together.</p>
            <p>The Text hath <hi>Two</hi> parts. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
one is the ſtate of the <hi>Earth,</hi> of the

            <p>Now this <hi>melting,</hi> whether it be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

For the Scripture when it would

            <p>
               <hi>Melting</hi> then is a great Calamity

Religious, and peaceable Reigne of

            <p>If you aske me the cauſe of this

For as for the Kingdome, that is
made of the ſame <hi>Earth</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and is conſequently ſubject to

that dwell therein, I doubt our <hi>ſins</hi>

to heate his <hi>fire,</hi> and make it fall on

<hi>inhabit</hi> other Countreys.</p>
            <p>And though I doubt not but God
hath the ſure mercies of <hi>David</hi> in
ſtore for the King, and will never
faile him, yet if <hi>Habitatores in eâ,</hi>

<hi>ſinne,</hi> unrepented <hi>ſinne;</hi> it
will not be in the power, or wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or courage, or piety of a
King, to keepe the State from <hi>melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
For <hi>David</hi> was all theſe, and yet
<hi>liquefacta eſt terra,</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> was as
good as <hi>diſſolved</hi> for all that. And
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115067:83"/>
therefore that this Kingdome is not
a <hi>melting</hi> too, I can give no firme
reaſon, but God and his Mercy. For
he is content to give longer day for
repentance, and repentance is able
to doe all things with God. And
the time calls apace for repentance:
The Heavens they <hi>melt</hi> into unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
weather; and the Earth
<hi>melts</hi> and <hi>diſſolves</hi> her Inhabitants
into infectious humours; and there's
no way to ſtay theſe <hi>meltings,</hi> but
by <hi>melting</hi> our ſelves, in, and by true
repentance.</p>
            <p>Would you then have a ſetled and
a flouriſhing State? Would you
have no <hi>melting,</hi> no <hi>diſſolution</hi> in the

the King, and bleſſes the
people, muſt be habituall. To doe
<hi>Iuſtice</hi> caſually, though the thing

not <hi>Iuſtice.</hi> The State may <hi>melt</hi> for
all that, becauſe the <hi>Remedy</hi> is but

            <p>Again, ſince the whole State hath

his <hi>Iuſtice</hi> muſt be ſpreading over all

            <p>Why, but then muſt the King doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
all this himſelfe? No, God forbid

               <hi>Moſes</hi> was not able alone for

            <p>And hence it followes, that, <hi>Ego

but it is the engagement of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

betweene God, the King, and the

from God. The Iudges, and the

that's from the King. Both are for

they ſinne againſt three at once, and

ſinne againſt the people, by doing

Secondly, they ſinne againſt their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

but by <hi>ſentencing Good Evill,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay 5. 20</note>
and <hi>Evill Good.</hi> Thirdly, they ſinne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
againſt the King, the fountaine
of <hi>Iuſtice</hi> under God, in ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his <hi>Iuſtice</hi> to the people, with
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115067:86"/>
the adminiſtration whereof they are
truſted under him.</p>
            <p>And once againe for inferiour
Governours of all ſorts. The King
is the Sunne. Hee drawes up ſome
vapours, ſome ſupport, ſome ſupply
from us. T'is true: he muſt doe ſo.
For, if the Sunne draw up no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
it can powre downe no raine,
and the <hi>Earth</hi> may be too hard,
as well as too ſoft and too <hi>melting.</hi>
Now this Raine which deſcends,
and is firſt cauſed by the Sunne, is
prepared in the Clouds before it
falleth on the Earth. And all Great
men that are raiſed higher than the
reſt; eſpecially Iudges &amp; Magiſtrates
of all ſorts, they are the Clouds. They
receive the more immediate influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from the King; and if they be
Gods <hi>Clouds,</hi> and retaine what he
gave them,<note place="margin">Pſal. 65. 52.</note> they <hi>drop fatneſſe</hi> upon
the people. But, if they be <hi>clouds
without water,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jude v. 12.</note> they tranſmit no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.
If they be <hi>light clouds in the

               <hi>by a whirlewind,</hi> then it is paſſionate,

Clouds, I hope, are not, I am ſure,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115067:86"/>
ſhould not be thus, betweene the

            <p>There is then <hi>Ego judicabo, I will</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>judge according unto right,</hi> both for

               </note> Fathers will have this to be
Gods ſpeech, or <hi>Davids</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of God. And then whatſoever
men do with Iuſtice and Iudgement,
God comes two wayes in upon
the judgements of men to review
them.</p>
            <p>For firſt, God comes in, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the <hi>Earth</hi> is <hi>melting</hi> by violence, and
injuſtice. And then Gods <hi>Ego judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabo,
I will judge,</hi> is either in Mercy
to repaire the breaches, to ſtay the
<hi>melting</hi> of the State; or elſe in
Iudgement to puniſh the debaſers
of <hi>Iuſtice.</hi> And this God ſometimes
doth in this life. But if he doe it
not here, yet he never ſailes to doe
it at the laſt, and finall Iudgement;
to which divers of the<note n="*" place="margin">S. Baſil. Hier. Aug. Euthym. Theod. <hi>Ib.</hi> Greg. 10. <hi>moral.</hi> 31. Bern. <hi>ep.</hi> 1.</note> Fathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
this paſſage of my Text.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God comes in when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the <hi>Seats</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> ſupreme and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115067:87"/>
all are entire. And then
Gods <hi>Ego judicabo, I will judge,</hi> is
alwayes to confirme, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the proceedings of <hi>Iustice,</hi> and
to bleſſe the inſtruments. And my
Text hath it full. For it is not here
ſaid, I will judge the cauſe onely, or
the men only whoſe cauſe it is, or the
Iudges onely that ſentence the cauſe;
but <hi>Ego juſtitias,</hi> I will judge the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Iudgements themſelves, how
right, or otherwiſe thy paſſe. And
then this muſt needs be to confirme
&amp; honour them, if they be juſt; or to
condemne and <hi>diſſolve</hi> them, if they
be unjuſt, rather than they ſhal <hi>melt,</hi>
or <hi>diſſolve</hi> the State; or ſomtimes to
ſend a <hi>melting</hi> into that State in
which Iuſtice is perverted,</p>
            <p>Now, howſoever men ſomtimes
breake from their duty in <hi>judging
according to right,</hi> yet there can be
no queſtion of Gods proceedings.
He will be ſure to <hi>judge</hi> all things,
and all men, <hi>according to right,</hi> who
ever doe not. <hi>Shall not the Iudge of
all the world doe right?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 25.</note> Yes, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
And therefore even Kings
themſelves, and all mighty men of
the Earth, and Iudges of all ſorts
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115067:87"/>
have need to looke to their wayes.
For God is over them with <hi>Ego
judicabo,</hi> I will one day call for an
accompt. I will judge all the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
of Iuſtice, with which I have
truſted them. And this is the firſt
<hi>Prevention</hi> of the <hi>melting</hi> of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
the firſt <hi>Remedy</hi> when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to <hi>melt:</hi> The maintenance and
Execution of juſtice.</p>
            <p>The Second followes; and it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> of the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the
<hi>Earth. I beare up the Pillars of it. I,</hi>
ſaith God, and <hi>I,</hi> ſaith the King.</p>
            <p>Where firſt, it is not amiſſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
what theſe great <hi>Pillars</hi> of the
earth are. The Earth it ſelfe, that
hath but one <hi>Pillar,</hi> and that is the
<hi>poize</hi> and <hi>aequilibre</hi> of the Center.
And that is borne up by the Word
and Ordinance of God.<note place="margin">Pſal. 33. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandedſt,

               <note place="margin">Hexam. l. 1. c. 6.</note> And
(ſaith S. <hi>Ambroſe)</hi> it needs no other
thing to ſtay it.</p>
            <p>The kingdomes of the Earth, they
have more <hi>Pillars</hi> than one. This one,
which is Gods ordinance for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
they have; but they have
divers Adminiſtratours of this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
And theſe <hi>Pillars</hi> are Kings,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115067:88"/>
and Peeres, and Judges, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.
Not one of theſe under the
nature of a <hi>Pillar:</hi> not one; but yet
with a great deale of difference. For
though there be many <hi>Pillars,</hi> yet
there is but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus Rex,</hi> one King;
one great and <hi>Center-pillar;</hi> and all
the reſt in a kingdome doe but <hi>beare
up</hi> under, and about him.</p>
            <p>The Church, that is not without
<hi>Pillars</hi> neither. No, God forbid.
And it reſembles in this the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
among which it ſojournes.
The great <hi>Maſter-pillar,</hi> Chriſt, he is
the Foundation of all the reſt;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and

and ſo called,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 9.</note>

the Fathers of the Church in their

               </note> they came to be <hi>Pillars,</hi>
and ſo ſhall ſucceſſively continue to

as Emperours and Kings were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the Faith,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> they preſently
came into the nature of <hi>Pillars</hi> to
the Church too. If any man doubt
this truth, Ile call in the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to witneſſe it. There are two
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115067:88"/>
great <hi>Props,</hi> or <hi>Pillars</hi> of the Church,
(ſaith <hi>Leo)</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> authority,<note place="margin">Ep. 31.</note> and
the <hi>Prieſts;</hi> both theſe: and the
Pope was content then to put the
Kings firſt. And Kings (ſaith Saint
<hi>Auguſtine)</hi> are indeed great <hi>Pillars</hi>
of the Church,<note place="margin">5. De Civit. Dei. 24.</note> eſpecially if they uſe
their power, <hi>ad cultum Dei dilatan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>
to enlarge (and ſupport) the

            <p>You have ſeene what theſe <hi>Pillars</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
are: Will you conſider next what
they have to doe both in Church and
Common-wealth? The office of a
<hi>Pillar</hi> is knowne well enough what
it is. 'Tis <hi>ſuſtinere,</hi> to prop, and <hi>beare
up</hi> the Earth.<note place="margin">

buildings many <hi>Pillars</hi> ſtand onely
for ornament, but beare no weight.
It is not ſo with <hi>Pillars</hi> that are
crown'd. Honour and ornament
they have, and they deſerve it, but
they are loaded too. Kingdoms and
States, the greateſt, the ſtrongeſt in
the world, are as <hi>mouldring</hi> earth, as

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The office then of the <hi>Pillars</hi> is
to beare; but when is there uſe of
them? When? why continually,
they can be ſpared at no time: if
they leave bearing, the State <hi>melts</hi>
preſently. We reade it foure times
repeated in Scripture, but upon two
great occaſions onely, <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and
<hi>Abominable luſt,</hi>

<hi>melting</hi> and a <hi>diſſolving</hi> of the State.
<hi>Every man did what ſeem'd good in

was great. At this time <hi>David</hi> was

               <note place="margin">2 Reg. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Joab</hi> was for the
one, and <hi>Abner</hi> with the other. The
<hi>Pillars</hi> here, in ſtead of bearing, fell
a juſtling: What followed? Why
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115067:89"/>
you ſee, <hi>Liquefacta eſt terra,</hi> that
kingdome <hi>melted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pillars</hi> then can never be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from their worke, continuall
uſe of them; but yet at one time
more need than another. And the
time of the greateſt neceſſity of
theſe <hi>Pillars</hi> is, when there is any
<hi>Liquefaction,</hi> or weakening of the
Earth. And that is in the Text, the

by recourſe to the <hi>Pillars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Pillars;</hi> and therefore
they which weaken the government;
nay, which doe but offer to impaire
the honour and reputation of the
Governours, are dangerous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie
members of any Common-wealth.
For to murmure, and make

the <hi>Pillars;</hi> to diſeſteeme their

is to trouble the <hi>Earth,</hi> and
<hi>Inhabitants</hi> of it; To make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
feare a <hi>melting,</hi> where there's
none. And what office that is, you

            <p>Continuall uſe there is then of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>Pillars.</hi> But what then? Can the

               <hi>Pillars</hi> beare up the earth in a <hi>mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>

No ſure, that they cannot; not at any
time: and therefore leaſt at a <hi>melting</hi>
time. But what then? Why then
here's <hi>Ego</hi> and <hi>Ego, I beare up the
Pillars</hi> that are about me, ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi>

and their great aſſiſtants; marke
it, God doth not ſay here, <hi>I beare
up</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of
it, though he doth that too, and
they cannot ſubſiſt without him;
but as if he had quite put them over

the pillars;</hi> and then, I look and will
require of them, that they <hi>beare up</hi>

gods to your Subjects; gods, and
no leſſe: Gods; why then you

work ever ſince the Creation, is to

Therefore as God <hi>beares up</hi> you, ſo
you muſt <hi>beare up</hi> the Earth, and the

            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:115067:92"/>

becauſe this was an extraordinary

            <p>Now this great worke of God in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
ſupporting the <hi>pillars,</hi> Kings and
mighty Potentates of the Earth, is
ſo manifeſt, that no reaſon can be
brought to deny it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in that the wiſeſt, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
mightieſt Kings that ever were, have
been in their ſeverall times moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in that even thoſe kings,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and great men under them, which
have not accounted God their
ſtrength, have yet thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to beare the world in hand,
that they did relye upon God to
<hi>beare</hi> them <hi>up.</hi> And this is a full
proofe, that this principle is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115067:93"/>
printed in the heart of man,
that God is <hi>Baſis Columnarum,</hi> the

            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in that very many times,
weaker Governours both for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and courage, doe proſper, and
performe greater workes, than
ſome, which in themſelves had farre
greater abilities, and a more provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
counſell about them. A famous
inſtance of this, is Pope <hi>Julius</hi> 2. To
aſcribe this to Fortune onely, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiſdome it ſelfe would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
for folly. To give it to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinie,
is to bind up God in chaines
unworthy for men:<note place="margin">Si totum muudum Deus, qui condidit, gubernat, quo in loco, vel cui cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aturae Caſus, &amp; Fatum, &amp; Fortuna dominabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Paulin. Ep.</hi> 38.</note> For worldly
wiſdome knows this, that God in his
workes <hi>ad extra,</hi> muſt be moſt free,
or no God. To worldly wiſdome
it ſelfe, it cannot be aſcribed: For
ſhe hath openly diſclaimed many
of their Actions, which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered
beſt. Therefore of neceſſitie
it muſt be aſcribed to Gods bleſſing
and protecting them.</p>
            <p>And certainly there's no true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
can be given of it, but this. Firſt,
<hi>Ego confirmo,</hi> I eſtabliſh and <hi>beare up
the Pillars.</hi> For ſo long the world
cannot ſhake them. And ſecondly,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115067:93"/>
               <hi>Ego apto,</hi> I make fit the <hi>Pillars,</hi> (as
<hi>Tremel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tremel. ib.</note> reades it) for ſo long they
<hi>beare,</hi> even above their ſtrength. And
out of doubt, there is very much in
the fitting of the <hi>Pillars.</hi> 'Tis not the
great maſſineſſe of a <hi>Pillar,</hi> but the
cleane, and true working of him,
that makes him beare; the fitting of
him in time, and to his place.</p>
            <p>And here, as for many other, ſo
eſpecially for two things, we have
great cauſe to bleſſe and magnifie
God. Firſt, that ſince he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
our <hi>Royall Pillar,</hi> which had
ſtood now under the weight of this
Government full 22. yeeres, yet he
would not doe it, till he had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>another,</hi> and brought him to full
ſtrength, to <hi>beare up</hi> this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to Gods great honour, and
his owne. Secondly, that by Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
great bleſſing, and his <hi>Royall Fathers</hi>
prudent education, he is, and was
from the firſt houre, <hi>confirmata Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumna,</hi>
an eſtabliſhed, and a ſetled
<hi>Pillar.</hi> And I make no queſtion, but
<hi>aptata Columna</hi> too, A <hi>Pillar</hi> every
way <hi>fitted</hi> to the State he beares;
<hi>fitted</hi> to the difficulties of the time;
<hi>fitted</hi> to the State, and <hi>fitted</hi> to the
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:115067:94"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Now the Church, no queſtion,
for the externall ſupport of it, hath
need, great need of Temporall
<hi>Pillars</hi> too. At this time a great
<hi>Pillar</hi> of this Church is falne; and
doubtleſſe a great part of the edifice
had falne with it, if God had not
made ſupply of another, and a very
able <hi>Pillar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I finde <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 18.</note> that there was an
<hi>Anoynted Pillar;</hi> that it was anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Jacob.</hi> The place was <hi>Bethel,</hi>
the houſe of God. In it the Ladder
of heaven, by which the Angels goe
and come. But out of doubt this
<hi>Pillar</hi> is here. This <hi>Pillar</hi> not yet
anoynted by the hand of the Prieſt;
but anointed already to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and by the bleſſing of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
The place where <hi>Jacob</hi> left him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
is the Church of God, and he
left him a <hi>Pillar,</hi> for ſo he reſted on
him, and well he might. Old <hi>Jacob</hi>
is gone by the Angels way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but he left the <hi>Pillar</hi> here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
at <hi>Bethel,</hi> for the houſe of God.
And all the bleſſings of Heaven and
Earth be upon him all the dayes of
his life.</p>
            <p>The Church in all times of her
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115067:94"/>
diſſenſions, when ſchiſme and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
have made great Rents in her
buildings, hath ſtill had recourſe to
her <hi>Pillars,</hi> to her Civil &amp; her Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
<hi>Pillars;</hi> and ſhe goes right.
For her <hi>Pillars</hi> muſt ſupport her, or
ſhe cannot be borne up.</p>
            <p>This very time is a time of Church
diviſion. What follows upon it?
what? why the Church is become
<hi>Terra liquefacta,</hi> there's <hi>melting</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in every part of it Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
through, <hi>melting</hi> in all places,
but not at the ſame <hi>Fire.</hi> For in one
place Truth <hi>melts</hi> away from the
doctrine of the Church. In another
devotion and good life <hi>melt</hi> away
from the practice of the Church. In
a third all externall meanes, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
ſupply <hi>melts</hi> away from the
maintenance of the Church. And, but
that I know <hi>Hell gates cannot prevail
againſt it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Mat. 16. 18.</note> it <hi>melts</hi> ſo faſt ſometimes,
that I ſhould think it is, as the world
takes it for, a <hi>houſe of Butter</hi> againſt
the Sun.</p>
            <p>Well, what's the cauſe that there
ſhould be ſuch <hi>melting</hi> in the Church?
what? why ſurely there are many
cauſes, would I complaine to you
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115067:95"/>
of them. But there are two in the
very letter of my Text, and them I
cannot bank. But I ſpeak of the
Church in generall, and ſtill hope the
beſt of our owne.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The One is, that the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall
Pillars,</hi> which are the Churches
moſt immediate <hi>bearers,</hi> are in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places of Chriſtendome but <hi>hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Pillars.</hi> And there's no truſting
of <hi>hollow Pillars</hi> with ſuch a weight
as the Church is. And therefore here
where God in mercy will ſtay the
<hi>melting,</hi> 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I will
make the pillars ſolid.</hi> I will not leave
the Church any longer upon hollow,
hypocriticall, and deceitfull <hi>Pillars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other is, that the Church oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
relyes too much upon her <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi>
upon the wiſdome, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of them. And ſo farre, that
ſometimes <hi>Ego confirmavi,</hi> God that
<hi>beares up the pillars</hi> is quite forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
And then whenſoever ſhe and
her <hi>Pillars</hi> leave to reſt upon God,
they fall on <hi>melting</hi> Preſently, and
no wonder.</p>
            <p>But whatſoever the Churches
Error be, this I am ſure will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the State, and you. It is not
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115067:95"/>
poſſible in any Chriſtian Common-wealth,
that the Church ſhould <hi>melt,</hi>
and the State ſtand firme. For there
can be no firmneſſe without Law;
and no Lawes can be binding if there
be no conſcience to obey them; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
alone could never, can never
doe it. And no ſchoole can teach
conſcience but the Church of Chriſt.
For wherever you find the Church
<hi>melt</hi> and <hi>diſſolve,</hi> there you ſhall ſee
conſcience decay. Therefore be <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>
to the Church, and you ſhall be
<hi>Pillars,</hi> ſtrong <hi>Pillars</hi> to the State,
and to your ſelves.</p>
            <p>The Third and laſt Circumſtance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of the Text is, The Time, that is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
for both theſe, both for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and eſtabliſhing
the <hi>Pillars;</hi> And that is a ſet, and a
<hi>convenient time,</hi> even <hi>when he ſhall
receive the Congregation.</hi> For that
time I'le take, ſaith God, and I, ſaith
the King.</p>
            <p>The firſt inſtant of this time ſet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
or taken is Opportunity. 'Tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in the Text. And opportunity is the
beſt moment in all the extenſion
of time, loſe it, and loſe all.
The right uſe of it is one of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115067:96"/>
things that differences wiſdome
from folly.</p>
            <p>Now a man would thinke that
for theſe things in the Text, all times
were times of opportunity. For can
any time be unfit to doe juſtice, to
<hi>judge according to right,</hi> to <hi>beare up
the pillars</hi> of State and Church? no
ſure, there cannot. And yet, even
for theſe, here's both God and the
King for opportunity. For here
<hi>David</hi> promiſes both for God and
himſelfe, that he will take <hi>a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then there is a great deale of
difference betweene God and the
King in taking of it. For when the
King comes to <hi>beare up</hi> the State,
'tis ſimply <hi>cùm accepero tempus,</hi> when
I ſhall take a convenient time. For
no regall power hath any command
over time. It can neither force on,
nor draw backe, nor make ſtay of
opportunity. He muſt take it when
God offers it, or not have it. And
if it be let ſlip, he cannot promiſe it
ſhall returne to his hand againe.
Nor can this great Court make an
Act of Parliament, to ſtay or reduce
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:115067:96"/>
But when God comes to doe
<hi>juſtice</hi> and to <hi>beare</hi> up the <hi>Pillars</hi>
themſelves; then <hi>cùm accepero tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
is not ſimply the taking of a
convenient time, but the making of
it too. And it ſtands not for <hi>eligere</hi>
but <hi>statuere,</hi> not for a choice of
time, as if God muſt wait upon it;
but for appointing of time, and
making it fit to ſerve both God and
the King.</p>
            <p>For (ſaith S. <hi>Augustine) Deus
non accipit (propriè,)</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Text.</note> 
               <hi>ſed gubernat
tempora,</hi> God doth not attend op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of time, as if he could
not worke without them, but he
governes and diſpoſes of time, and
occaſion, and makes them ready for
us to take them.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Gent.</note> Otherwiſe <hi>obſequia
temporum</hi> (as <hi>Arnob.</hi> calls them) the
pliantnes of time, will not attend,
nor be commanded by us. So that
here God's taking of the time is
nothing but God's fitting of the
time to us, and us to it. And when
he is ſaid to take it, it is for us, not
for himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now though God be at this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of the time, yet it is not in men
to give it him. No ability of man or
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115067:97"/>
any creature can doe that. And
therefore where the ſpeech is of
God, it is abſolute, and ſimply <hi>Quum
Ego,</hi> when I ſhall take it. Not I
and you, not I from you; But out
of his owne wiſedome he findes it,
and out of his owne goodneſſe he
takes it, and by his owne power he
uſes it, to <hi>beare up the pillars of the
Earth.</hi> And therefore here in the
Text is never a <hi>Quum tu das,</hi> when
thou giveſt me opportunity, but
when I take and order time by my
ſelfe.</p>
            <p>And yet let me tell you, that
where mans ſtrength can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to give God an opportunity
to preſerve the Earth, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of it from <hi>melting,</hi> there his
weakenſſe can. For as weakeneſſe
is the thing that needs, ſo the time
of <hi>melting</hi> is the opportunity of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing
the <hi>pillars</hi> of the earth.<note place="margin">Pſal. 9. 9.</note>
And ſo God in mercy is often plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

them? <hi>Quum terra liquefacta eſt,</hi>
when States ſhake and ſeeme to be

            </p>
            <p>And ſince our ſufficiency can give
Gods wiſedome no opportunity,
but yet our weakneſſe gives his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
opportunity enough; it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that no one thing is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for preſervation againſt the
<hi>melting</hi> of a kingdome, then humble
and hearty prayer, that God will
come alwaies into that opportunity
which our weakeneſſe makes.</p>
            <p>And now becauſe God doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
take unto himſelfe ſecond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
meanes, and uſes them in time, to
watch over the opportunity which
himſelfe gives, here's a touch in the
Text for that too, when this fit
time of bearing up of the <hi>pillars</hi> of
the Earth comes; And that is (as S.
<hi>Baſil</hi> &amp; ſome others read it) at the
<hi>Receiving of the Congregation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Baſ. Cal. verſ. Angl. ult.</note> that
is, when the people ſhall meet in the

or, when Honourable and ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the people ſhal be ſummoned,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115067:98"/>
and gathered together in the name
of the Lord, for Counſel or Juſtice.
For no time ſo fit to honour God;
none to execute <hi>Juſtice;</hi> none to

as when the <hi>Congregation is received,</hi>
to meet, and conſider and weigh all
thoſe things which make for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and ſafety of a kingdom. And
beginning that ſervice with Gods:
For God forbid this Honourable
Councell of State ſhould ſit downe
and beginne any where elſe than at

            <p>Now the great <hi>Congregation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

And the going up of the Tribes to

be <hi>borne.</hi> I ſay <hi>beare,</hi> and be <hi>borne:</hi>
For though in the text it be, <hi>I beare
up the Pillars,</hi> That is, I at all times;
and I in ſome caſes, where none can
but I; and I when all forſake ſave I;
yet that is not ſo to be taken, as if
the people were not bound to <hi>beare
up the Pillars,</hi> as well as the <hi>Pillars</hi>
them. No, for there's no queſtion
but they are bound, and ſtrictly
bound too,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. And certaine
it is no State can flouriſh, if there be
not mutuall ſupport betweene the
<hi>Earth</hi> and the <hi>Pillars:</hi> if it faile of
either ſide, there's ſome <hi>melting</hi> or
other preſently.</p>
            <p>For <hi>the ſtrength of a King is in the
multitude of his people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. His
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115067:99"/>
ſupply, and his defence is there.
And the ſtrength of a People is in
the honour and renowne of their
King: His very name is their ſhield
among the Nations; and they muſt
make accompt to <hi>beare,</hi> if they will
be <hi>borne.</hi> And this is read in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Dictates of Nature for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For no man ever ſaw build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of State, but the <hi>Pillars</hi> which
<hi>beare up</hi> it, are <hi>borne</hi> by the <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now God and the King doe
both <hi>receive</hi> this <hi>Congregation,</hi> and
in fitneſſe of time, and yet with a
difference too: For the King <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives</hi>
the <hi>Congregation</hi> to conſult,
and adviſe with it; but God <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives</hi>
it, to direct, and to bleſſe it.
And God with his bleſſing is never
wanting to us at theſe and the like
times, if we be not wanting to Him,
and our ſelves.</p>
            <p>And thus you have ſeene in what
ſtate the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in
<hi>Davids</hi> time; and how eaſie it is
for any kingdom to be in the like; in
a <hi>melting,</hi> and a <hi>diſſolving</hi> eſtate. You
have likewiſe ſeene what <hi>Remedy</hi>
was then, and what <hi>Prevention</hi> is
now to be thought of againſt this
<hi>melting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:115067:99"/>
This both <hi>Remedy,</hi> and <hi>Preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
conſiſts eſpecially in impartiall
diſtribution of <hi>Juſtice</hi> to the people;
and in Gods gracious and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſupporting of the <hi>pillars</hi> of the
State. The <hi>time</hi> for this never ſo fit,
as <hi>when the Congregation is received</hi>
by the <hi>King</hi> to conſultation, and by
<hi>God</hi> to bleſſing.</p>
            <p>It is not much which I have more
to ſay. The <hi>Congregation</hi> is now
ready to be <hi>received.</hi> The very <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi>
it joynes it with the fitneſſe
<hi>of opportunity.</hi> For it is the <hi>Kings
opportunity</hi> to bleſſe his people with
<hi>Iuſtice</hi> and <hi>Iudgement;</hi> and it is
<hi>Gods opportunity</hi> to <hi>beare up</hi> both
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Peeres,</hi> both greater, and
leſſer <hi>Pillars</hi> of the State. My text
delivers a promiſe of both. For 'tis
<hi>Davids</hi> ſpeech for himſelfe, and
for God. I'le doe both, ſaith God,
and I, ſaith the King.</p>
            <p>Now you may not diſtruſt this
promiſe on either ſide; neither on
<hi>God</hi> nor <hi>Davids.</hi> Not on <hi>Gods</hi> ſide:
For that is infidelity. Nor the <hi>Kings:</hi>
For what hath he done that can
cauſe misbeliefe? or what hath he
not done, and that above his yeares,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115067:100"/>
that may not merit, and challenge
beliefe of all?</p>
            <p>And for the comfort of this
Kingdome, and all that dwell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
the ſervice of the day, which was
firſt deſigned for this buſineſſe,
ſeems to me to propheſie, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> a wiſe, and a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
King, hath begun his Reigne.
For the firſt Leſſon appointed in
the Church for Evening Prayer that
day,<note place="margin">4 Reg. 18. 2.</note> is 4 <hi>Reg.</hi> 18. which begins the
ſtory of <hi>Hezekiah. Hezekiah was
twenty five yeares old when he began
to reigne.</hi> There's his age. What
did he when he came firſt into the
Throne? Why one of his firſt works
was,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 29 20.</note> 
               <hi>He gathered the Princes of the
Citie</hi> (there was the <hi>receiving of the
Congregation)</hi> and ſo <hi>went up to the
houſe of the Lord.</hi> After this, what
was the courſe of his life? It follows,
<hi>He clave to the Lord, and departed not
from him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">4 Reg. 18. 5.</note> (And I hope I may make
a prophecie of that which follows.)
<hi>So that there was none like him among
the kings of Judah, neither were there
any ſuch before him.</hi> And thus is our
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> come this day to <hi>receive</hi>
this great <hi>Congregation</hi> in the Name
of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:115067:100"/>
Let us therefore end with Prayer
unto God. That he would bleſſe
both the King and the State. That
this Kingdome may never be <hi>Terra
liquefacta,</hi> like <hi>molten</hi> and <hi>diſſolved</hi>
Earth. That if at any time for our
ſins it begin to <hi>melt,</hi> and waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
the <hi>remedy</hi> may be forthwith
applyed. That <hi>Iuſtice</hi> and <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
may be given <hi>according to right.</hi>
That the <hi>pillars</hi> of the Earth may be
<hi>borne</hi> up; the inferiour and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
<hi>pillars</hi> by the King, and both
the King as the <hi>Maſter-pillar,</hi> and
they, by God. That all this may be
done in fit and <hi>convenient time.</hi>
That God would make <hi>fit</hi> the <hi>time,</hi>
and then give the King and the
State, and this great Councel, all
wiſedome to lay hold of it. That
this great <hi>Congregation</hi> may be in the
fitneſſe of <hi>time.</hi> That God would be
pleaſed to <hi>receive</hi> and bleſſe it. That
the King will be pleaſed to <hi>receive</hi>
&amp; grace it. That it will be pleaſed to
<hi>receive</hi> the King, according to his
deſert, and their duty, with love,
honour, and neceſſary ſupplie: that
ſo he may <hi>beare up</hi> this Kingdome,
and the honour of it, with comfort;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115067:101"/>
and be a ſtrong and a laſting <hi>pillar,</hi>
to ſupport both it and us, in the
true worſhip of God, and all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
bleſſings. That he may <hi>dwell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God for ever;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 61. 7.</note> &amp; that God would
<hi>prepare his loving mercy and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that they may preſerve him.</hi>
That all the bleſſings of Grace may
attend <hi>him</hi> and this <hi>Congregation</hi> in

For when did any man ſee a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>

               <note n="*" place="margin">In Octav. Judaeorum Deum fuiſſe Rom. numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus una cum gente Captivum.</note> And ſo 'twas here.

            <p>A profanation upon the <hi>Temple,</hi>
and upon all the <hi>Rites of Religion</hi>
there was. All agree upon that.
But it was yet but in <hi>Prophecie,</hi> not
come. And the learned which lived
after, and looked back upon the
<hi>Prophecy,</hi> and the <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of
it, are not agreed. For ſome ſay, the
<hi>Text</hi> refers to the firſt great deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
by <hi>Nebuchadonozor;</hi> ſome,
to the laſt by <hi>Titus;</hi> ſome, to that

the <hi>City</hi> and the <hi>Temple;</hi> the <hi>State</hi>
and the <hi>Church</hi> were threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
And I for my part ſee no great

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Pſalme</hi> as in the <hi>Letter</hi> it
lookes back upon the <hi>State</hi> and

it lookes forward upon the

            <p>Well, This danger is uſually

For all theſe may dwell in greater

Whither goes the <hi>Church</hi> then?
Whither? Why doubtleſſe to God.

And they are two things which

that he would remember how

            <p>And the Church of old often did
upon great <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> as we doe
this day, <hi>Faſt,</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> together.
That is, labour by all meanes <hi>to make
God</hi> for the <hi>State.</hi> Firſt, becauſe if
there be any <hi>evill Spirit,</hi> as you lately
heard, got in between <hi>Abimelech</hi>

the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>People,</hi>

There's no <hi>Exorciſme</hi> ſo ſoveraigne

the Church: and to fall greedily

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Well, <hi>Faſting</hi> then and <hi>Prayer</hi>'s
neceſſary. But how doth <hi>this Prayer</hi>
of the <hi>Prophet</hi> fit us? How? Why
ſure it fits us every way. And we
have as much need, every way as
much, to powre out our prayers to
God, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had. The <hi>Prayer</hi> is
<hi>Exurge Deus,</hi> Ariſe O God.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Priests</hi> of <hi>Baal</hi> had
prayed long, and were not heard,
<hi>Elias</hi> bid them cry lowder: Their

Aſleepe?</hi> Yes, <hi>dead aſleepe.</hi> And it
was in juſt ſcorne of their groſſe <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
that he bid them cry lowder

               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.
As appeares in the ſpeedy returne
which he there made to the praiers
of <hi>Elias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why but then, if the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
doth neither ſlumber nor ſleepe;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115067:106"/>
why doth the <hi>Prophet</hi> call upon him
to ariſe, and take care of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
Why? Surely not becauſe he
was laid downe to reſt: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this is one of the many ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
which are uttered of God in
Scripture, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, after the
manner of men; Not to expreſſe
any ſuch thing in God, but to make
us underſtand ſomething of God by
our ſelves. So that while the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
prayes, that God would ariſe;
here's no ſignification of any <hi>ſlumber</hi>
in God: But tis to teach us, that
God ſometimes in his providence
over us, is <hi>Dormienti ſimilis,</hi> like to
a man that ſleeps. As ſome in Saint

            <p>For as he that ſleeps muſt have

when God either for our ſinnes,<note place="margin">S. Hierom in Habac. 3. Velut ad dormientent loquitur.</note> or
for triall of our Faith and Patience,
or for ſome other cauſe beſt known
to himſelfe, ſhall ſuſpend or drawe

it appeare by the Activeneſſe of his

God is then ſaid to <hi>Ariſe,</hi> when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

tells me, both were in danger, great
danger: as they muſt ever be when
God withholds his mercy, as here he
did. For, Niſi Dominus, <hi>except the

<hi>Niſi homo,</hi> except Men have ſome <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

ſometimes doe with their leſſer chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
hide themſelves that they may

Argument they draw of their

And therefore 'tis time to call, that

               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. So can he ſleepe no

great deale, over all the Prayers we
make, than we are to make them:
Elſe we muſt deny him to be God.
For (as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us) <hi>Aures Dei
in Corde Precantis ſunt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Aug in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129.</note> The eares of
God are in the heart of him that
prayes. Not a motion in the heart,
but the ear of God hath it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And ſo of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or he cannot
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115067:108"/>
be God: So, no feare that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
is aſleepe neither</p>
            <p>And even in the time while he
carried about him our fleſh mortall,
we never read that he <hi>ſlept</hi> but once,
And that was at <hi>Sea:</hi> and at Sea
in a <hi>Tempeſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Mat. 8. 28.</note> S. <hi>Matt.</hi> 8. An ill
time choſen, you will ſay, to ſleepe
in; But that's not ſo neither. For
he tooke opportunity onely of the
<hi>Tempeſt,</hi> to ſhew his <hi>Diſciples</hi> that
his <hi>Command</hi> could lay the <hi>Sea.</hi> If
any Enemy come upon us, he muſt
come by <hi>Sea;</hi> It's therefore fit for
us to pray, that though CHRIST
now ſlumber not, yet that he would
remember where he once <hi>ſlept,</hi> but
<hi>Aroſe</hi> to make a <hi>Calme.</hi> We have
been in one <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> and we have
cauſe to feare another; Let us in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
caſe get <hi>Chriſt to Sea,</hi> and aboard
our <hi>Shippes;</hi> That no <hi>Tempeſt</hi> may
untackle them, or rent their <hi>Keeles,</hi>
or hew downe their <hi>Maſts.</hi> That
no enemie may come neere them
with ſafety; nor ſlide from them
by eſcape. This is the way, and you
are now upon it, to make <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Chriſt ariſe</hi> together. And this very
<hi>Prayer</hi> here in the <hi>Text</hi> is grounded
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115067:108"/>
upon a <hi>wonderfull deliverance at Sea,</hi>
Ver. 14.<note place="margin">Ver. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Well, wee are ſafe enough at <hi>Sea</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
and at <hi>Land,</hi> if we can but get God
to <hi>Ariſe</hi> on our part. But how ſhall
we be able to doe it? How? why
never dreame, (for it is a <hi>Dreame</hi>
indeed, and a fond one too) that
ye can ever be able without Gods
Grace, to make God yours. But
know that he hath Grace for you,
and gives it, and he is half yours
already: He will <hi>Ariſe</hi> and be all
yours, if you pray in Grace. But here
two things are eſpecially to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
heed of, if we will have our
<hi>Faſting</hi> and our <hi>Prayers</hi> prevaile.
And I doubt we are guilty of both:
and have taken heed of neither.</p>
            <p>The one is <hi>Pride:</hi> and the worſt
of it, <hi>Riſing againſt God.</hi> For, we muſt
not looke that God ſhould <hi>Ariſe</hi>
to helpe us, if we <hi>ariſe</hi> to oppoſe
and unglory him. And marke the
phraſe of Scripture. <hi>God reſists the
proud</hi> S. <hi>Jac.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">S. Jacob. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Reſiſts:</hi> therefore
that time which we would have
God ſpend to defend us, our <hi>Pride</hi>
forces him to uſe to <hi>Reſiſt</hi> us. And
certainly. <hi>Riſing againſt God,</hi> and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115067:109"/>
our ſinnes with us, even above
Mercy, were it poſſible, is not the
way to make God <hi>Ariſe for us,</hi> but
againſt us. If we will have God
<hi>Ariſe, we muſt fall low on our face
before his Footſtoole, for hee is Holy,
Pſal.</hi> 99.<note place="margin">Pſal. 99. 5.</note> And humble our ſelves as
we have begun this day, that he
which is all <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> may
be as <hi>willing,</hi> as we know him <hi>able</hi>
to deliver us.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other is <hi>Security.</hi> And the
worſt kind of that too, <hi>Security</hi> in
and under danger. For we muſt not
looke that God ſhould <hi>Ariſe</hi> and
take care of us, if we will ſleep on in
<hi>Security,</hi> without care of our ſelves.
And no deſtruction <hi>ſo ſuddaine as
that which comes when ſecurity ſings
Peace and Safety,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 3.</note> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. Nay,
which is worſe, the Apoſtle there

God threatens it ſhall come. So <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi>
is both a meanes to bring dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and a diſinabling to reſiſt it.
And therefore if you will have God
<hi>Ariſe,</hi> you muſt ariſe too. <hi>Ariſe</hi> in
ſoule by devotion; <hi>Ariſe</hi> in life by
the workes of Sanctification; And
<hi>ariſe</hi> in prudence and in provident

care to be up, and not found ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

is, or ought to be feared.</p>
            <p>I know 'tis hard to make you <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe</hi>
that you have been, or are, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>ſecure</hi> amongſt men, or <hi>proud</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God. And I am ſorry 'tis ſo.
For the very difficulty of <hi>confeſſion</hi>
makes me doubt you are guilty of
both, and ſo continue. For he was <hi>a
wiſe Man,</hi> that gave this reaſon why
a man doth not <hi>confeſſe</hi> his faults,
namely,<note place="margin">Sen. Ep. 53.</note> 
               <hi>Quia etiam nunc in illis eſt;</hi>
becauſe he continues in them ſtill.
And you know <hi>Somnium narrare,
vigilantis eſt,</hi> 'Tis a proofe that a
man is awaked, when he can tell, and
doth acknowledge how his dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fancy fool'd him while he ſlept.
But if after all this you doe not yet
ſee you have beene in a dreame, I
muſt crave leave to think you are <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi>
and <hi>aſleep</hi> ſtill. Let us therefore
<hi>confeſſe</hi> and amend theſe and all our
other ſinnes, that have made God
ſtand aloofe from us, and then God
will <hi>Ariſe</hi> before wee can call him
up.</p>
            <p>This for the <hi>Invocation.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
generall part of the <hi>Text</hi> is,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115067:110"/>
What the <hi>Prophet</hi> would have God
doe when he is <hi>Riſen.</hi> And they are
two things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is, that God when he is

are many and important.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And firſt I find acknowledged
here by <hi>the Prophet,</hi> that God hath
a <hi>cauſe</hi> in hand; not alwaies the
ſame, but ſtill a cauſe; and a cauſe
in continuall agitation among the
Sonnes of Men. So 'tis allwaies
<hi>Term</hi> with God; ſome <hi>cauſe</hi> ſtill,
and a trying. And yet the opinion
which ſome of the <hi>Heathen</hi> had,<note place="margin">Min. Foel. in Octav.</note>
that God could not worke in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
over us, but he muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet

and government of the world. But
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115067:110"/>
this <hi>worke of God</hi> is queſtioned too.
For many things in the workes of

            <p>For inſtance. They would faine

depart from Iniquity.</hi> If he doe not
that, hee is not Chriſt's; Let him
talke of Predeſtination while he wil.
And in theſe and all other cauſes of
God, try them where you will, and
how you can; <hi>David</hi> and Saint

what cauſe of his is it that's parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
meant in this place? For, if
it be <hi>Gods,</hi> 'tis worth the knowing
what ere it be; And no cauſe of his
can be here, but men owe it, as well
as him, ſome duty; And therefore
neceſſary to be known, that due
may be performed unto it.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Cauſe of God</hi> meant

any the least irreverence of a King;

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115067:112"/>

cauſe: And you cannot corrupt the

her for it, nor diſtract her from her
<hi>Vnity,</hi> nor impoveriſh and abuſe her

but he would have <hi>many Gods.</hi> Nor
make the <hi>Church baſe,</hi> but he would
<hi>pluck GOD as lowe,</hi> were God as
much in his power as the Church is.
And therefore the <hi>Churches Cauſe,</hi> is
<hi>Gods Cauſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 7. Hist. cap. 32.</note> And as <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us,
when by <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Laodicea</hi>
the ſtate of that Church was much
hazarded; it, and the meanes of
it, were mightily upheld by God
himſelfe.<note place="margin">In G. Naz. Orat 4.</note> And <hi>Elias Cretenſis</hi>

'Tis <hi>Gods cauſe,</hi> any controverſie

            <p>

Now this ever holds true, in

therefore if either <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Church</hi>

fill up the <hi>State</hi> and the <hi>Church:</hi>
and yet but one in the point of that
<hi>indiviſible Center</hi> which is <hi>himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, we have found <hi>Gods cauſe</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
as 'tis tumbled upon the earth: But
what is it the <hi>Prophet</hi> would have
God doe to it? What? Why that
followes, <hi>Iudica, Pleade</hi> it, <hi>Judge</hi>
it, <hi>Maintaine</hi> it Lord. For the
<hi>King</hi> and the <hi>State;</hi> For thy <hi>Church</hi>
and <hi>Service;</hi> For thy <hi>ſelfe</hi> and
thine <hi>honours</hi> ſake. Thou haſt made
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115067:114"/>
their cauſe thine owne, therefore
maintaine it, as thou doeſt thine
owne.</p>
            <p>Now this God is never wanting
to doe, nor never will be. So farre
as <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> make the
cauſe <hi>his,</hi> he will <hi>Plead</hi> it firſt, and
<hi>Maintaine</hi> it after. But yet he doth
not this alwayes with a Judgement
that is viſible to us; Nor with ſuch
a one as will make enemies confeſſe
that <hi>Gods maintenance</hi> is on our
part.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And therefore as <hi>Ruffinus</hi>
thinkes, theſe words are not onely a
<hi>Prayer,</hi> that God would <hi>Ariſe, and
maintaine his cauſe:</hi> but that he
would ſo plead it, that he would
make the Juſtice and Right of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to Enemies and Oppoſers;
and the maintenance evident to
friends and defenders of it. So,
<hi>maintaine thy Cauſe,</hi> is as much in
effect, as make the world know 'tis
thine, and thou wilt maintaine it.
That from Gods maintenance, the
cauſe may have lafety: And from
our hope of maintenance, we may
receive Comfort.</p>
            <p>Why, but why ſhould God <hi>plead,
judge,</hi> and <hi>maintaine his owne Cauſe?</hi>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:115067:114"/>
Is the Prayer of the <hi>Prophet</hi> juſt?
Yes no queſtion. For, the <hi>Cauſe of
God</hi> is ever juſt, and therefore ought
ever to be <hi>maintained.</hi> Nor is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
partiality in God to his <hi>owne
Cauſe,</hi> that he comes to <hi>judge</hi> it. But
he is forced, as it were, to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of it himſelfe, partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome men <hi>will not,</hi> and ſome
men <hi>cannot defend his Cauſe;</hi> And
partly, becauſe it muſt be judged at
ſome <hi>Tribunall.</hi> Now there lye ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>appeales</hi> in the cauſe of God.
And all appeale is to a ſuperiour
Court; The higheſt is Gods. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> hath
done what it can to Gods cauſe,
if his Servants do but <hi>Appeale,</hi> as
they ever doe; The Cauſe muſt in the
end revolve to God himſelfe, who
alone hath no ſuperiour. Yet his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Enemies need not feare: For he
will ſo <hi>pleade</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> his <hi>owne
Cauſe,</hi> that their <hi>owne Conſciences</hi>
ſhall tell them his Judgement's
right.</p>
            <p>Now one thing which layes a
kinde of neceſſity upon God to
maintaine his owne cauſe, is as I
told you, that ſome Men <hi>will not,</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:115067:115"/>
and ſome men <hi>cannot</hi> maintain it.
I finde both theſe touched in the
<hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, they that will not. For theſe
words, <hi>Ariſe, O God, and maintaine
thine</hi> own <hi>Cauſe,</hi> are a grievous taxe
upon all them to whom God hath
given meanes and ability, yet will
not ſtir to ſuccour his cauſe. For
'tis as if he had ſaid, Men will not
maintaine thy cauſe: If thou wilt
have it defended thou muſt do it thy
ſelfe. The <hi>Jewes</hi> it ſeemes were now
very guilty of this, elſe the <hi>Prophet</hi>
would never have runne with that
earneſtneſſe to God. He would
have prayed to God had Men been
never ſo willing; yes, God forbid
elſe; but had they done their duty,
the extremity had not beene fear'd.
And marke and tremble at the curſe
of God which was called for upon
ſome of that People for this ſinne,
<hi>Judge. 5. Curſe ye Meroz,</hi>

But yet if we come not in to helpe

that God will <hi>Maintaine his cauſe,</hi>
and leave us to <hi>maintaine our owne.</hi>

theſe words, <hi>Ariſe, O God, Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

in Man, as well as malice. For
'tis as if he had ſaid, Men <hi>cannot</hi> at

thou wilt have it defended, thou
muſt doe it thy ſelfe. And this is
true of the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> of the Sonnes
of Men, if they be left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
But this, though it puts us in
more feare, yet it makes us not halfe
ſo guilty. For <hi>Guilt</hi> followes malice
more then Impotency. And our
<hi>weakeneſſe</hi> and <hi>diſability</hi> is ſuch, that

got ſome hope of <hi>Advantage;</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
tels me, theſe <hi>Enemies</hi> were thought

but to get God to be abſent,
and then they might eaſily ſwallow
his <hi>People</hi> and his <hi>Cauſe</hi> together.
To prevent this was the <hi>Prophets</hi>
prayer, and ſo it is ours this day.
For ſo the <hi>Pſalme</hi> begins: <hi>O God</hi>
(conſidering how thy cauſe is ſtreit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
<hi>Wherefore art thou abſent from
us ſo long?</hi> And it ends at <hi>Ariſe and
maintaine thy Cauſe</hi> againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And the <hi>forme</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi>
Prayer is very confiderable too, and
a great example to the Church of
Chriſt. The <hi>Prayer</hi> is, that <hi>God would
ariſe and maintaine his Cauſe.</hi> The
firſt thing the Prophet aimes at is
the <hi>Cauſe;</hi> the equity and right that
belongs to it, not the reſpect it had
to <hi>Perſons.</hi> And this out of queſtion
is the way of <hi>Juſtice, to honour the
perſon for the Cauſe, not to eſteeme the
cauſe of the perſon.</hi> Now men for the
moſt part goe a croſſe way to this,
and therefore, when they will come
into the way of Juſtice I cannot tell.
For uſually all buſineſſe is ſided into
parties. 'Tis no matter for the <hi>Cauſe,</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:115067:117"/>
let who will <hi>maintaine</hi> that ſimply
for it ſelfe. If it make for us and
our party, ſo farre we will <hi>maintaine</hi>
it; elſe be it <hi>Gods cauſe,</hi> or whoſe it
will, whether it ſink or ſwim, it ſhall
not trouble us. And I doubt as the
<hi>practice</hi> of too many men is, ſo is
their <hi>Prayer:</hi> For the <hi>Faction</hi> and
the <hi>Party</hi> all; not the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> either
as 'tis <hi>Gods,</hi> the <hi>Churches,</hi> or the
<hi>States.</hi> And <hi>parties</hi> are ever <hi>private</hi>
ends. The <hi>Cauſe</hi> as 'tis Gods, the
Churches, or the Kingdoms, is ever
common, ever fit to be made the
Object of our <hi>Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this advantage may here be
had: If ever you may ſafely prefer
the <hi>perſon</hi> before the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and yet be
juſt, you may doe it here. <hi>God</hi> before
his <hi>owne cauſe.</hi> And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God as he can never tender an
unjuſt cauſe to his People, ſo is he
<hi>Juſtice</hi> it ſelfe: And ever juſter than
any cauſe of his that is without him.
Therefore whatſoever others doe,
<hi>Ariſe, O God, and maintaine thy ſelfe,
and thine owne cauſe.</hi> Maintaine it
even from <hi>Heaven,</hi> there's no great

            <p>The <hi>Prophet</hi> no queſtion knew theſe

And 'tis true: But <hi>Malignity</hi> againſt

ever after, without a great

And <hi>Ruffinus</hi> obſerves that this <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy</hi>
grew in the continuance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And
either it derided God in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
or it menaced men for ſerving
God. How it flatter'd it ſelfe there
while againſt both Man and God,
is thus farre apparent in the <hi>Text:</hi>
That they never durſt have beene
daily <hi>Blaspemers</hi> againſt God, if
they had not beene <hi>Opinators</hi> at
leaſt, that God could never have
<hi>maintained</hi> and made good his cauſe

            <p>It is too much to ſee the cauſe of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115067:122"/>
God <hi>oppoſed;</hi> To heare the name of
GOD <hi>Blaſphemed,</hi> were it but
once: But <hi>all the day long, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day,</hi> is a Tentation almoſt unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
to Chriſtian and religious
hearts. Yet this we muſt be Inur'd
to heare againſt <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi>
and <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, if we take not
better courſe than hitherto we have
done to keepe out the <hi>Enemy</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>Againſt this 'twas time for the
<hi>Prophet,</hi> and 'tis time for us to pray.
The <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> of an Enemie is a
very urgent Motive to make Men
pray. And the Prayer of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
here, <hi>that God would remember
the Blasphemer,</hi> was very fervent:
For he begins this Prayer, at <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Rebuke of the Enemy,
ver.</hi> 20.<note place="margin">Verſe 20.</note> And he ends his Prayer with
<hi>Remember the Blaſphemy of this Fool,

               <hi>Remember and forget it not,
ver.</hi> 24.<note place="margin">Verſe 24.</note> This was the <hi>Prophet's</hi>
Zeale for Gods Cauſe, and you may
learne by it, that <hi>cold Prayers</hi> are
not they which remove the <hi>Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
of Enemies. <hi>The Prayers indeed
of but one righteous Man doth much,
but 'tis when they are fervent.</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Jaco. 5. 16.</note> Saint
<hi>Jaco.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:115067:122"/>
But you will ſay: What needes all
this calling upon God to <hi>Remember?</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Hierom. in Thren. 5.</note>
Is it poſſible he ſhould forget? not
poſſible certainely. But then as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Though God <hi>cannot ſleepe,</hi>
Yet to awaken not him but our
poore underſtanding concerning
him the Prayer was, <hi>Ariſe, O God.</hi>
So here, though God cannot <hi>forget,</hi>
yet becauſe in his providence he
ſometimes carries himſelfe to our
ſenſe and apprehenſion, <hi>Ad modum
obliviſcentis,</hi> as if he did forget,
and threatens that he will forget,
<hi>Oblivione obliviſcar eorum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oſe 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Oſe.</hi> 1.
Forgeting, I will forget them,
Therefore here againe the Prayer
runnes after the manner of men, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
O Lord, yes, and Remember too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why? but ſince here's <hi>Enmity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Cauſe of God, and <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy</hi>
againſt himſelf, why doth the
Prophet aske no more of God, but
that he would <hi>Remember</hi> this?
Why? why certainly 'tis, becauſe
there's abundantly enough of that.
He knew if God did <hi>Remember,</hi> he
would <hi>puniſh;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And (as S. <hi>Jerome</hi>
obſerves) <hi>hee therefore Remembers,
that he may confound in Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:115067:123"/>
And indeede in Gods Language
to <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Remember,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inuocen. 3. L. 2. Miſt. Miſſ. c 6.</note> is many
times to puniſh: and <hi>not to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
is to <hi>forgive</hi> ſinne. <hi>If thou Lord
ſhouldeſt be extreme to marke and
obſerve,</hi> that is, to puniſh, <hi>What is done
amiſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 130. 3</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. And the Church
hath learn'd not onely to ſpeake,
but to pray of the <hi>Prophet.</hi> For ſo
the Church prayes in the <hi>Letany:</hi>
Not, puniſh not, but <hi>Remember not
Lord our offences.</hi> And therefore the
<hi>Prophets</hi> Prayer was home enough,
<hi>Remember Lord:</hi> Yes, doe but that,
and we either have, or ſhall have
<hi>enough</hi> and our enemies too. We,
I hope of deliverance and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and they of puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Thus you have heard the <hi>Prophets</hi>
prayer, and I hope made your owne,
that <hi>God would Ariſe</hi> and beſtir him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
And what he deſired God
would doe, both for State and
Church when he was Riſen, that
is, That he would <hi>plead and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his owne Cauſe.</hi> And <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
that is, puniſh in his owne
time <hi>the Blaſphemy of all them, that
reproach or detract from it or him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing yet remaines, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115067:123"/>
'tis fit to be thought upon this day,
every day, all the day long. And
that is, what it it is that makes God
a <hi>Protector</hi> of any <hi>King,</hi> any <hi>State,</hi>
any <hi>Nationall Church,</hi> againſt either
in-bred or forraine Enemies. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Fox</hi> at home and the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
abroad. And that certainly is,
for the State to goe on with <hi>Honour</hi>
and <hi>Iuſtice.</hi> And for the <hi>Church</hi>
to labour <hi>Devotion</hi> as much at leaſt,
if not more then <hi>knowledge.</hi> For
elſe Gods Cauſe and ours may be
two. And then God may <hi>Ariſe, and
maintaine his owne,</hi> but leave us to
the <hi>Famine,</hi> to the <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> to
the <hi>Sword,</hi> to any other <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The onely way to make God <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe</hi>
as ſoone as ever we call: Nay,
to prevent our call and come in to
helpe before we pray, is for both
King and People, State and Church,
to <hi>weave</hi> their Cauſe and Gods to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
To <hi>incorporate</hi> them ſo, that
no cunning of the <hi>Devil</hi> may be able
to ſeparate them. For then the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is apparent. God cannot <hi>Ariſe and
maintaine his owne cauſe,</hi> but he muſt
<hi>maintaine</hi> ours too: becauſe 'tis <hi>one</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:115067:124"/>
with his. And his owne (doubt you
not) he will maintaine, againſt the
proudeſt Enemy that can come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it. And certainly the greateſt
hope and confidence of Gods Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
to any Nation, to any Man,
that can precede deliverance it ſelfe,
is to make their <hi>Cauſe all one with
Gods.</hi> And that is done by <hi>uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
his, and <hi>conforming</hi> theirs.</p>
            <p>Our ſafety then is when our cauſe
is <hi>one</hi> with Gods: Our danger when
they <hi>differ.</hi> But what is it that puts
the <hi>difference</hi> between them? What?
why that which put the firſt Enmity
betweene God and Man, <hi>Sinne.</hi>
And therefore if we wil quit the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and be made friends, the onely
way to reconcile us with God, and
our Cauſe with his, is by <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Repentance</hi> to baniſh <hi>Sinne.</hi> The
ſooner this is done, the ſooner we
are ſafe: which cannot be till <hi>our
Cauſe be one with Gods. One,</hi> and yet
when 'tis one, the preheminence is
ſtill with Gods Cauſe, we muſt not
ſuffer ours to ſtep on before him.</p>
            <p>For <hi>our Cauſe</hi> as 'tis <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and
concernes our ſoules, if it be never ſo
good, never ſo cloſe joyned with
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115067:124"/>
God's, yet God's is to have the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence.</hi>
For be ours never ſo good,
I muſt beg of your <hi>humility</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that Gods Grace did both
prevent and follow, to make it ſo.
And therefore we are to put his
cauſe firſt, and to pray chiefly for
the maintenance of that which gave
worth to ours.</p>
            <p>And for our cauſe as 'tis <hi>temporall</hi>
and concernes this life onely, Our
ſafety, life, and lively-hood; <hi>Gods
cauſe</hi> is to have the <hi>precedence</hi> of that
much more. <hi>Father and Mother,
Wife and Children, Brethren and Siſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Life and all, muſt be accounted as
nothing to Gods Cauſe,</hi>

And yet our giving Gods Cauſe
the <hi>precedence,</hi> in our <hi>Love</hi> to it, and
our <hi>Prayers</hi> for it, is no excluſion of
our <hi>owne Cauſe:</hi> Nay, the <hi>preferring</hi>
of Gods before our owne, And the
making of our owne <hi>conformable</hi> to
Gods, is the way to make God as
jealous of our ſafety <hi>from all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi>
as he is to vindicate his owne

And therefore though the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>

As we have therefore now begun,
ſo let us <hi>pray</hi> on as the <hi>Prophet</hi> did,
That God even our Gracious Father
will be no longer like unto one that
ſleepes: That he will <hi>Ariſe,</hi> and
<hi>blow</hi> over theſe feares from us. 'Tis
but his <hi>Breath,</hi> and he can dry the
<hi>Cloudes,</hi> that they drop not Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe

his <hi>Breath,</hi> and he can cleare the
<hi>Ayre</hi> of <hi>Infection,</hi> as well all over
the Kingdome, as he hath, beyond

City. And 'tis but the ſame <hi>Breath,</hi>
and he can ſhake our <hi>Enemies</hi> to
peeces in the Sea.</p>
            <p>That God being <hi>Ariſen</hi> and come
neare in providence, will <hi>pleade</hi> firſt,
and after <hi>maintaine his owne Cauſe.</hi>
His owne in the hand of the <hi>King;</hi>
His own in the heart of the <hi>Church;</hi>
And his owne in the <hi>Holineſſe</hi> of his
<hi>Name.</hi> That he will give this <hi>State</hi>
and <hi>Church,</hi> and every Member of
both, ſuch <hi>grace,</hi> that our <hi>cauſe</hi> may
be his, and his <hi>Maintenance</hi> ours.
That he will <hi>remember</hi> and that's
enough, that if <hi>his Cauſe</hi> be ours,
<hi>our Enemies</hi> are his. That we may
ſo order our lives by his Grace, that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115067:126"/>
if theſe or any <hi>Enemies</hi> will <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme,</hi>
it may not be <hi>Him</hi> for our

Why, but what need was there of
this Exhortation at <hi>Epheſus?</hi> what?
why ſure very great need.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> For Saint
<hi>Anſelm</hi> tells us, <hi>Schiſma ſuit,</hi> there
was a <hi>Schiſme</hi> and a rupture there.
And <hi>Chariſmata,</hi> the eminent Graces
which God had given many of
them, was made the cauſe of the
Schiſme. For Corruption at the heart
of man breeds pride even out of
Gods graces. And they which had
theſe gifts deſpiſed them which had
them not, and ſeparated from them.
This gave occaſion <hi>to falſe teachers to
enter in, and lye in wayt to deceive,
ver.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">Verſ. 14.</note> This was the ſtate of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> How was it in
the <hi>Citie</hi> and the <hi>Common-wealth</hi>
there while? How? why, the Citie
was then a very famous Citie in
<hi>Ionia,</hi> a part of <hi>Aſia the leſſe;</hi> At this
time ſubject to the <hi>Romane Empire;</hi>
Their <hi>Proconſul and other Deputies
were over them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 19. 38</note> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> 19. But <hi>Diana</hi>
was goddeſſe there, and the Citie
heathen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epheſus</hi> then was Ethnick: No
Religion but <hi>Paganiſme</hi> avowed by
the ſtate. And the City was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Church that was in it. A
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115067:128"/>
Stranger <hi>and without as the Apoſtle
ſpeakes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 12.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Yet ſuch is the
force of Chriſtian Religion, that as
<hi>Herod and Jeruſalem</hi> were troubled
when <hi>Chriſt was borne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Mat. 2. 3</note> S. <hi>Math.</hi> 2.
So here <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Epheſus</hi>
were troubled when the name and
Religion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was borne and
nurſed up among them: <hi>For the
word of God did no ſooner grow and
prevaile at Epheſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 19. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Acts 19. 20. but
by and by there aroſe no ſmall trouble

               <note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> 
               <hi>ver.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>The <hi>City</hi> and the <hi>State Heathen,</hi>
yet troubled when <hi>Religion</hi> came in:
Therefore, A <hi>City</hi> and a <hi>State Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
muſt needes be more troubled
when <hi>Religion</hi> goes out. And the
ready way to out <hi>Religion,</hi> is to
breake the <hi>Vnity</hi> of it. And the
breach of the <hi>Vnity of Religion</hi> will
be ſure to trouble the <hi>City</hi> firſt, and
hazard the <hi>State</hi> after. For the State,
whether <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> hath
ever ſmarted more or leſſe, as the
Church hath crumbled into Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> I know wrote this <hi>Epiſtle</hi>
to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> not the
<hi>City.</hi> And hee called for <hi>Vnitie bound
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115067:128"/>
up in peace</hi> for the Churches good,
without any expreſſe mention ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of City or State. Yet he well
knew that the good both of the
State and the City would follow
upon it. For <hi>Vnity</hi> is a binder up;
And <hi>Vnity of Spirit,</hi> (which is religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's
unity) is the faſteſt binder that
is. And leſt it ſhould not bind faſt
enough, it calls in the <hi>bond of peace.</hi>
So that no man can exhort unto,
and endeavour for the <hi>Vnity of the
Church,</hi> but at the ſame time, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
for the <hi>good of the State.</hi> And
if it were ſo at <hi>Epheſus</hi> where the
ſtate was Heathen; much more muſt
it needs be ſo, where the ſtate is
Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>I ſhall follow my <hi>Text</hi> therefore
both in it ſelfe, and in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
which followes upon it. In it
ſelfe; and ſo 'tis for the <hi>Vnity of the
Church. And a maine Text it is</hi>
(ſaith S. <hi>Jerome) againſt Hereſie and
Schiſme.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> In the Conſequence it
hath; And ſo 'tis for the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of
the State.</hi> And a full Conſequence it
is. For <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> not kept in the Church
is leſſe kept in the State. And the
<hi>Schiſmes and diviſions</hi> of the one,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115067:129"/>
are both Mothers and Nurſes of all
<hi>diſobedience and diſ-joynting</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
goes on directly to the Church,
by Conſequent to the State. And
it will behove both Bodies that all
the ſeverall members of each <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

the very worſt men pretend beſt
when they breake it. 'Tis ſo in the

            <p>Now to be one here, whether in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

Tis true, <hi>unity</hi> is very apt to hang
together. It proceeds from Charity,

            </p>
            <p>In the Common-wealth it needs

are <hi>Cuſtodes Civitatis,</hi> Keepers of

            <p>Now this noyſe at <hi>Epheſus</hi> doth
not onely tell us that unity needs
<hi>keeping,</hi> but it informes us farther of
the way to <hi>keep</hi> it. The way to <hi>keep
unity</hi> both in Church and State is for
the <hi>Governors</hi> to carry a watchfull
eye over all ſuch as are <hi>diſcoverd,</hi> or

The reaſon is, becauſe in this Unity
many are brought together; And
many will not be held together
without a bond. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
diſcovered this.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. De Doct. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiana, p<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

which hath no knot, is eaſily diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This Unity is ſo comfortable,
ſo beneficiall both to Church and
State, that it cannot bee too faſt
bound. But if it be not faſt bound,
both it and the benefit will ſoone be
loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now <hi>in vinculo,</hi> in that which
bindes this, is to be obſerved: It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
about all which it containes,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115067:143"/>
and then where it meets there's the
<hi>knot;</hi> So that which is bound is held
cloſe within the Imbracings of the
bond; And the <hi>bond</hi> is not of one
ſubſtance, and the <hi>knot</hi> of another,
but both of one and the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
So tis here. For the <hi>unity of
the Spirit</hi> is contained and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed,
as it were <hi>by peace: Peace
goes before it,</hi> to bring it in; And
<hi>Peace goes with it,</hi> when tis in; And
<hi>Peace goes round about it,</hi> to keepe it
in. And where the two ends of
<hi>Peace</hi> meete, there Unity is faſt
and <hi>knit up.</hi> And the <hi>knot</hi> is of the
ſame ſubſtance with the bond, <hi>Peace
too.</hi> And therefore where the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
reading of the <hi>Text</hi> is, To keepe
Unity in the bond of peace, there
ſome will have it,<note place="margin">Lapide. Ib.</note> to keepe <hi>Vnity in
vinculo quod eſt pax;</hi> In that band
which is peace.</p>
            <p>This <hi>bond</hi> as 'tis the <hi>bond of unity;</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
ſo 'tis well fitted to the <hi>unity it
bindes.</hi> For if you marke it, it bindes
<hi>unity;</hi> and the bond is but <hi>One; In
vinculo pacis,</hi> in the bond of
peace; <hi>One band.</hi> And yet that
which is <hi>unum,</hi> is not <hi>unius,</hi> that
which is but <hi>One,</hi> is not onely of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115067:144"/>
               <hi>One,</hi> For it bindes many, whole
Churches, whole Kingdomes. And
both bodies are ever ſafeſt, when
the bond is <hi>One;</hi> and that <hi>One</hi> able
to hold them. For when this <hi>One
bond of peace</hi> cannot bind cloſe, 'tis a
ſhrewd argument, either that ſome
<hi>ill humor ſwells,</hi> and will not endure
the bond; or that the <hi>bond</hi> it ſelfe is
<hi>ſtrained</hi> and <hi>made weake.</hi> And in
both theſe caſes, timely helpe muſt
be applied, or the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Body</hi>
is in Danger.</p>
            <p>You may ſee this plaine in the
<hi>Naturall body.</hi> The <hi>out-bond</hi> of the
body is the <hi>skinne.</hi> If the body be
too full of <hi>humors,</hi> and they foule
and in Motion, the body ſwells till
the skinne breakes. So tis in the
Church, and ſo tis in the State, when
the body is too full of humours.</p>
            <p>The <hi>inner-bond</hi> of the body is the
<hi>Sinew.</hi> 'Tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the very word
which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> uſes, The <hi>bond</hi> or
the <hi>ſinew of peace.</hi> If the <hi>ſinew</hi> be
broken or over-ſtrained, there's
much paine and weakeneſſe in the
body, and the members hang as
looſe, as if they were falling one
from another. And ſo tis in the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115067:144"/>
               <hi>Eccleſiaſticall;</hi> And no other than
ſo, in the <hi>Civill Body.</hi> If there be but
a <hi>ſtraining in the bond,</hi> though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the <hi>ſinew</hi> be not yet <hi>broken,</hi> tis
high time to looke to the Unity of
the Body. Well, What Remedy
then? What? Why, ſure there's
none but <hi>Vinculum Vinculi;</hi> The
<hi>ſinew</hi> muſt have a <hi>ſwathe:</hi> And that
which was wont to bind the Body,
muſt be bound up it ſelfe. And if the
Cure light not into honeſt and good
<hi>Chirurgions</hi> hands, it may prove a
<hi>lame Church,</hi> and a <hi>weake State</hi> ever
after. God bleſſe the Body therefore,
and direct the Chirurgions.</p>
            <p>Now as the <hi>bond</hi> of theſe great
bodies, the Church, and the State,
may be <hi>broken;</hi> ſo the <hi>knot,</hi> which
hath ever beene hard to <hi>unty,</hi> may
be <hi>cutte.</hi> And both Church and
State have ever had Cauſe to feare
both, both <hi>breaking</hi> and <hi>cutting.</hi>
Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> was afraid of this
in the Church, by and by after
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
He writes to the Church
of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Philadelph.</note> In any caſe to
<hi>to flie and ſhunne</hi>

               </gap>,
the partition or cutting off
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115067:145"/>
this knot. And indeed tis not fit for
any man imployed about this <hi>bond
of peace,</hi> to have his <hi>Raſor</hi> about
him. And <hi>David</hi> was afraid of this
in the State; and he had cauſe, great
cauſe: For ſome wilde unruly men
cryed out then, <hi>Let's break their
bonds in ſunder, and caſt their cords
from us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. What bonds? Why,
All the bonds of peace, and all the
bonds of allegiance too. <hi>For the
Conſultation then was</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin)
to depoſe David.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Pſal. 2.</note>

               <hi>And then brake them in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

               <note place="margin">Verſe 9.</note> 
               <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Now
the Breakers of the bond of peace
both in Church and Common-wealth
are <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>diſobedience:</hi>
For theſe two cry one to another,
That is, <hi>Pride to diſobedience,</hi> Come
let's breake the bond.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And this is very obſervable, and
with reference to this bond of peace
too; You ſhall never ſee a <hi>diſobedient</hi>
man, but he is <hi>proud:</hi> For he would
Obey, if he did not thinke himſelfe
fitter to govern. Nor ſhall you ever
ſee a <hi>proud man</hi> ſtoope to <hi>binde</hi> up
any thing: But if you ſee him
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115067:145"/>
ſtoope, take heede of him, 'tis,
doubtleſſe, to <hi>breake the bond of
peace.</hi> The Reaſon's plaine; if hee
ſtoope to binde up, He knowes he
ſhall be but <hi>one of the bundle;</hi> which
his pride cannot endure. But if he
ſtoope to looſe the bond, then he
may be <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>ſhew his vertue</hi> (as
he calls it) that is, hope To runne
formoſt in the head of a <hi>Faction.</hi>
Fond men, that can be thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
with pride againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
For when they are <hi>bound up,</hi>
though but as one of the Bundle,
yet therein, under God, they are
ſtrong and ſafe: But when the
<hi>Bond is broken,</hi> and they perhaps,
as they wiſh, in the <hi>Head,</hi> headlong
they runne upon their owne Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</p>
            <p>Thus you have ſeene the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
care for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity:</hi> For Unity, but faine
would he have it <hi>of the Spirit.</hi> This
Unity he deſires you ſhould <hi>keep;</hi>
yea <hi>ſtuddy</hi> and <hi>endeavour</hi> to keepe,
as the <hi>Spirit</hi> is ready to prevent and
aſſiſt, that you may be able to keepe
it. This Unity muſt be kept <hi>in peace:</hi>
And if you will have it ſure, in the
<hi>bond of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:115067:146"/>
That which remaines is, that you
obey and follow the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
That all of you in your
ſelves, and with others, <hi>endeavour to
keepe the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the

Common-wealth. For <hi>good Counſell,</hi>
ſuch as here our <hi>Apoſtles</hi> is, doth not
make Church or State happy, when
'tis given, but when 'tis followed.
And to the danger that may come,
it addes <hi>guilt,</hi> to all ſuch as will not

the <hi>danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let me ſay thus much for the
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit;</hi> 'Tis that which
ties us one to another, and all to
God, and God to all. <hi>Without God</hi>
we cannot be ſafe, either in this

this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> no man is ſure of his

He deſerves not to live, that would
diſſolve that <hi>bond,</hi> by which God hath
bound himſelfe to aſſiſt the Church,
and the Common-wealth. Our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
make <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity a Note of the
Church,</hi> and they perſwade ſuch as
will beleeve them, that we have no

have Occaſion given them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
their doctrine; leſt in the

them to prove, that we have <hi>no
Common-wealth</hi> neither, for want
of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to <hi>keepe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> I have
made bold to direct you <hi>one way
already;</hi> and here's an other. 'Tis
neceſſary that the <hi>Governours</hi> have
a good and a quick eye to diſcover
the cunning of them that would
breake the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> firſt, and the <hi>whole
Body</hi> after. You ſhall give a gueſſe at
them by this; They'll ſpeake as much
for Unity as any men; but yet, if you
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115067:147"/>
marke them, you ſhall ſtill finde
them <hi>buſie about the knot, that bindes
up <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in peace:</hi> ſomewhat there
is that <hi>wrings</hi> them there. They will
pretend perhaps, tis very good there
ſhould be <hi>Vinculum,</hi> A Bond to
binde men to Obedience, O, God
forbid elſe: but they would not
have the <hi>knot</hi> too hard. Take heed.
Their aime is, They would have a
little more liberty, that have too
much already. Or perhaps they'll
pretend, they would not <hi>untie the
knit,</hi> no, there may be danger in
that, but they would onely <hi>turne</hi> it
to the other ſide, becauſe this way it
lyes uneaſily. But this is but a ſhift
neither. For <hi>turne the knot</hi> which
way you will, all <hi>binding to Obedience</hi>
will be grievous to ſome. It may be
they'll proteſt, that though they
ſhould untie it, yet they would not
leave it <hi>looſe.</hi> They would perhaps
tie it otherwiſe, but they would be
ſure to knot it as faſt. Truſt not this
pretext neither. Out of Queſtion,
their meaning is <hi>to tie up Vnity in a
Bow-knot,</hi> which they might ſlip at
One End when they liſt. Indeed,
whatſoever they pretend, if they
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115067:147"/>
be <hi>curious about the knot,</hi> I pray
looke to their <hi>fingers,</hi> and to the
<hi>Bond of peace</hi> too. For whatſoever
the pretences be, they would be at
the diſſolving of <hi>Vnity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, Provide for the keeping of
Vnity; And what then? Why, then,
God bleſſe you with the <hi>Succeſſe of
this Day.</hi> For this <hi>Day,</hi> the <hi>ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth

<hi>Sex. Pompeius.</hi> And that Victory
was in <hi>Spaine;</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> which

But I muſt tell you, Theſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours

Church and State, if S. <hi>Paul</hi> may be

            </p>
            <p>And now, to conclude; I beſeech
you Remember, That all this <hi>Vnity</hi>
and <hi>Peace,</hi> what ere it be, and when
tis at the beſt, is but <hi>Veſtigium,</hi> a
track, and a footing of that everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
peace which is to come. And I
would not have you ſo love this
<hi>peace of Grace,</hi> that you ſhould at
any time forget the infinite <hi>peace of
Glory:</hi> The <hi>bond</hi> whereof nor
<hi>Earth,</hi> nor <hi>Hell</hi> can breake. For

But I cannot but hope <hi>better things

<hi>you have not ſo learned Chriſt,</hi> as that
you can preferre any Vnity before

that which is <hi>his foot-ſtep</hi> in this

            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore all pray unto

            </p>
            <p>Theſe words that begin the
Pſalme, I ſhall take in that ſenſe as
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115067:150"/>
applyed to the Type, to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and
in him to all religious Kings. Which
ſo to <hi>Solomon,</hi> that I am heartily glad
to find Chriſt, ſo full in the Pſalme,
ſo near the King.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I am glad to find him ſo
full in the Pſalme, becauſe that is a
confutation of all Judaiſme: for they
received the Pſalmes as well as we; &amp;
here in this Pſalme, there are many
things that they cannot faſten upon
<hi>Solomon,</hi> or any other but Chriſt.
So cleare is that, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath
obſerved long ſince againſt them:
The Iewes (ſaith he) ſcorne us for
receiving Chriſt as a Saviour, <hi>Praeſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus
tamen, &amp;c.</hi> yet we prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them out of the Scriptures,
that they receive, that Chriſt is come
the promiſed, propheſied <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I am glad to find Chriſt
ſo neare the King: becauſe nothing
can be more honourable, and ſafe,
for <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Father,
and the Sonne that is to ſucceed
the King, than to have God the
Father, and Chriſt his Son ſo neare
to them. So neare and cloſe, not
onely as they ſtand mixed in the
Pſalme, but farre more cloſe by the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115067:151"/>
Prayer of <hi>David,</hi> and by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
that follow in the Pſalme upon
the Prayer, Bleſſings, not upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and <hi>Solomon</hi> onely, but upon the
Father and the Sonne in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
where the Father with a true
religious heart imbraceth Chriſt,
and will teach his Sonne to follow
his ſteps: for then, and there, God
will give plenty of judgement to
the King, and a full meaſure of
Righteouſneſſe to the Kings Son.</p>
            <p>My Text then, as it is applyable
to <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> (for ſo I
ſhall follow it, here) is the Prayer
of <hi>David</hi> to God for himſelfe firſt,
and then for his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> after;
for both have reference.</p>
            <p>And the Bleſſings which follow
upon this Prayer made by <hi>David,</hi>
and granted by God, are very many,
and great, and follow in the Pſalme;
namely,</p>
            <p>Here is judgement for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and that according to right, at
<hi>ver.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Then here is defence for the
poore, I and for their very children
too, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Then after this here is peace,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115067:151"/>
peace upon all, abundance of peace,
at <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Then there is the puniſhment, and
that as rightly ſettled as may be, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the wrong doer, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>And all theſe come together, that
righteous men may flouriſh, at
<hi>ver.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>So it is a neceſſary Prayer to be
made, a very neceſſary Prayer: for
all theſe, and many more bleſſings
follow, and come upon any nation,
and any people, when God comes
to <hi>Give his Judgements to the King,
and his Righteouſneſſe to the Kings
Sonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My text is a Prayer; and there
are two Petitions, and theſe two
Petitions divide my text into two
parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The one is, that</hi> God would give
his judgements unto the King.</p>
            <p>The other is, that he would <hi>Give
his Righteouſneſſe unto the Kings ſon;</hi>
for all other inferiour circumſtances
fall into one of theſe. I will begin
at the firſt. <hi>Give the King thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
O God.</hi> My text I told you
is a Prayer; and I have made choice
of a praying text. The Age is ſo
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115067:152"/>
bad, thy will not endure a good
King to be commended for danger
of flattery, I hope I ſhall offend
none by praying for the King.</p>
            <p>The text is a Prayer, and <hi>quis orat,</hi>
who it is that prayes, is the firſt
circumſtance that appeares in the
text; it is <hi>David,</hi> it is the <hi>King,</hi> and
he beares a prime, and a great part
whereſoever he is. And it was <hi>Davids</hi>
honour: for there was never any
<hi>King</hi> ſo often found at his prayers
as <hi>David</hi> was; <hi>ſeven times a day
will I praiſe thee, Pſal.</hi> 119. This
was <hi>Davids</hi> promiſe, and for ought
we know it was <hi>Davids</hi> performance
too. And thorow all the booke
of his Pſalmes (that devout part of
Scripture) all his praiſes goe mixed
with prayer: ſo he prayed very oft.
And certainly, there is nothing
more neceſſary for any <hi>King,</hi> than
Prayer. And therefore S. <hi>Auſtine</hi>
accounts it one of the greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſes
of a <hi>King,</hi> not to neglect to
offer to God <hi>ſacrificium orationis,</hi>
the ſacrifice of prayer.</p>
            <p>1. And there is great need it
ſhould be ſo: for of all men (Prieſts
onely excepted) <hi>Kings</hi> have the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:115067:152"/>
greateſt account to make God:
therefore prayer is very neceſſary
for them; that ſince no man is able
to keepe his accounts even, God
would be pleaſed to be mercifull,
and take Chriſt into the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>2. Of all men (could greatneſſe
let them feele their wants) none
have ſuch burthens on their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as <hi>Kings</hi> have; therefore prayer
is neceſſary for them, that they may
call as often upon God, as he calls
oft upon them that <hi>are weary and
heavy laden to refreſh them, Mat.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>3. Of all men, none have ſo great
troubles as <hi>Kings</hi> have. Indeed
troubles muſt needs be great, or elſe
they dare not ſieze on <hi>Kings:</hi>
therefore prayer is neceſſary then
eſpecially when the trouble is ſuch,
as no wit of man can worke off,
and repell; and ſuch troubles there
are, when there is no ſhelter, or
helpe left in the world, but this,
<hi>Lord remember David,</hi> and all his
troubles. But be the troubles never
ſo great, if <hi>David</hi> pray, and God
remember, the <hi>King</hi> cannot be loſt
in any ſorrow. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> found it ſo
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115067:153"/>
when he faſted and prayed, and
turned to the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.
for then the Hoſt of <hi>Zenacharib</hi>
was preſently broken, and himſelfe
ſaved. So then <hi>David</hi> is at this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
worke, he is at prayer.</p>
            <p>I, but for whom is it that <hi>David</hi>
prayes?</p>
            <p>Surely, divers ancient, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
Divines, thinke that in this
place the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Kings</hi> ſonne
ſtand but for one perſon, the perſon
of <hi>Solomon</hi> under two different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Kings</hi> ſon;
and that there is an Emphaſis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Repetition. And they
thinke too that <hi>David</hi> penned this
Pſalme when he was dying, when he
reſigned his Crowne to <hi>Solomon,</hi>
and delivered the Scepter into his
hand; which the Jeſuit <hi>Lorinus</hi> tels
us (and he is very exact) that it was
juſt foure yeeres, (ſurely I thinke he
failes of his reckoning) before <hi>Davids</hi>
death, when he made his prayer for
<hi>Solomon.</hi> And hee avoucheth <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
to be his Author: but it is not
ſo, the Jeſuit in this, as in divers
greater buſineſſes is too bold: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith that <hi>David</hi> lived
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115067:153"/>
after <hi>Solomon</hi> was crowned <hi>aliquot
annos,</hi> ſome yeers; but he ſaith not
juſt four, it may be more, or fewer:
I will not enter upon the queſtion
<hi>quando,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> made this
Prayer, and penned this Pſalme.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the <hi>quando,</hi> the time
here is not in the Text, nor in any
part elſe in Scripture: therefore I
may ſafely be ignorant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe, ſuppoſe this
were the laſt Pſalme that ever <hi>David</hi>
made, as ſome collect out of the laſt
<hi>verſe,</hi> yet that ſuppoſed will not
prove that he made this Pſalme after
he had crowned <hi>Solomon</hi> King: for
before <hi>Solomon</hi> was crowed <hi>David</hi>
was little leſſe then bedrid, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.
at which time it is out of queſtion
that <hi>David</hi> prayed, therefore he did
not then compoſe this Pſalme.
Therefore I ſhall take liberty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from this opinion, with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to better judgements; but
eſpecially to the Church.</p>
            <p>Me thinks it was not ſo near night
with the Prophet when he penned
this Pſalme. I rather think that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
made it when himſelfe was
King, and his purpoſe was firmely
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115067:154"/>
ſet that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhould ſucceed him,
for ſo he had ſworne, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.
And I think this prayer here in
the beginning of the Pſalm was
made firſt by <hi>David</hi> for himſelfe,
and then for <hi>Solomon</hi> after. And ſince
this opinion maintaines nothing
contrary to the Analogie of faith,
nothing that hinders the context,
nothing that croſſes any determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church; nay ſince there
is in it more piety to God, more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to himſelfe, more inſtruction to
his Sonne, and more good example
to other Kings, that the prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
at himſelfe, I will take the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as I find it in the very words of
the Pſalme, to be a prayer, firſt for
<hi>David,</hi> and then for his Sonne, and
ſo proceed.</p>
            <p>Well then, <hi>Davids</hi> prayer here, is
firſt for himſelfe, (we ſhall come to
his Sonne after;) And he is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
example to Kings in this: for
the firſt thing that makes prayer
neceſſary, abſolutely neceſſary for
a King, is himſelfe: that a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
hand, even Gods hand would
ſet, and keepe him right, whom ſo
many inferiour hands labour to ſet
awry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:115067:154"/>
I, but what need the King to pray
for himſelfe? he wants no prayers
whom all the people pray for.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is true, the people are
bound to pray for their King
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. and I make no doubt, but
that the people performe this duty
as they are bound, ſince it is a tribute
which by the Law of God they ought
to pay; and <hi>David</hi> ſo great and ſo
good a King, had out of queſtion the
prayers of all his people, both for
himſelfe, and his ſonne; yet for all
that you ſhall find <hi>David</hi> at his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for himſelfe too.</p>
            <p>And certainly there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for it; for of all acts of Charity,
this of Prayer is apteſt to begin at
home.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, the King ought
to have the prayers of his people,
and that man cannot deſerve ſo
much as the name of a Chriſtian, that
prayes not heartily for the King;
becauſe that is not the Kings good
onely, but the peoples way to lead
a life in godlineſſe and honeſty,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. Therefore, that man
that makes no conſcience of praying
for the King, let him pretend
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115067:155"/>
what he can, he muſt be preſumed
to have as little care of all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and honeſty.</p>
            <p>I, but though the King ought to
have the prayers of his people; yet in
the performance of their duty, I
read not of any diſpenſation the
King hath to neglect his owne, not
to pray for himſelfe. If he be a King
like <hi>David,</hi> he muſt be a King at his
prayers too, eſpecially in thoſe great
things that concerne the King, that
concerne the Kingdome, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
his Son, and his ſucceſſion to
his kingdome; there he of neceſſity
muſt pray for himſelfe.</p>
            <p>He may joy in his peoples prayers
there, but he muſt pray for himſelfe
too.</p>
            <p>And God be ever bleſſed for it,
you have a King that is daily at his
prayers, both for himſelfe, and for
you: yet here, I pray take this along
with you; that as it is the peoples
duty to pray for the King, and that
takes not off their King to pray for
himſelfe: So on the contrary ſide,
the Kings religious care in praying
for himſelfe is ſo far from leſſening,
that it augments the obligation of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115067:155"/>
the people to pray for the King. And
when both pray, the King for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and the people for the King,
God will not refuſe their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>And the prayer granted, though
it fall firſt upon the head of
the King (as good reaſon it
ſhould) yet it becomes as <hi>Aarons</hi>
oyle, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. for it runs to the
skirts of all his people; ſo that they
have the benefit, both of their own,
and of his prayer.</p>
            <p>I will never miſdoubt the piety
of this nation in the performing this
duty, of which both here, and in all
places they are met this day to
make publick proofe. For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that keeps cloſe to this duty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many others, he ſhall be ſure
of this one great bleſſing, he cannot
fall into the oppoſite ſinne of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
againſt the King. <hi>David</hi>
the King in the text, he had faithfull
and religious people; yet there was
a <hi>Shimei</hi> among them, that in ſtead
of praying for the King, curſed and
reviled him, 2 <hi>Sam. 16. David</hi> was
very patient; but I pray remember
what <hi>Solomon</hi> the Kings Sonne did
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115067:156"/>
to <hi>Shimei, 2 King.</hi> 2. remember that,
and if the memory of his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would affright other men
from running into this blaſphemous
iniquity, all would ſoon be well.</p>
            <p>We are to conſider in the next
place to whom it is here that the
Prophet prayes, and that is expreſt,
<hi>A deo. Give the King thy judgements
O God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doe thou give. And as this is all
mens duty; ſo it it is the duty of
the King too among the reſt to goe
in prayer to God, and to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
Therefore <hi>Damaſcene</hi> puts
God into the very difinition of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Prayer ſaith that Father is <hi>petitio
decentium à deo,</hi> the asking of thoſe
things that are fit to be asked of
God. For prayer is one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
pats of divine worſhip: ſo great
that <hi>Parmatius</hi> diſputing againſt <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian,</hi>
takes prayer for the whole
entire worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>No Pope can diſpenſe with King,
or people, either not to pray, or
not to pray to God, but Saints, or
Angels. As for their diſtinctions,
they are all new; the antient Church
knew them not; though theſe
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115067:156"/>
have their uſe ſometimes, yet they
are a great deale too nice to be uſed
in prayer, that is ſo eſſentiall a part
of divine worſhip.</p>
            <p>And you have great cauſe againe
to bleſſe and magnifie God, for a
King, ſo conſtant in religion, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
in prayer, ſo direct in his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God alone, as he hath ever
ſhewed himſelfe to be; and <hi>God
for his mercy ſake ever hold him there,</hi>
And indeed to whom ſhould he, or
any of you goe in prayer, but to
God? for none can give but he;
nor none can bleſſe, or preſerve that
that is given, but he. If the King look
to have his Throne eſtabliſhed to
himſelfe, or his Son after him, he
muſt go to God for the ſetling of it,
or elſe it will ſhake then when he
thinkes it ſureſt. And ſince God
hath proclaimed it himſelfe, <hi>By me
Kings reigne, Prov.</hi> 8. Princes have
reaſon to looke up to him, that they
may reign by him, ſince againſt him,
nay without him, they cannot reigne.
To God then the King goes by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
But al this is loſt except we know
for what? And that followes next
in the text. It is for <hi>Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:115067:157"/>
It is indeed for all that a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is, but principally for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe under God, that is
the eſtabliſhing of the Kings
Throne, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe that is one of
the Kings maine vertues, for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of his people: for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have their well-being but by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and judgement. Therefore in
the Common Law of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
juſtice is rightly ſtyled. The
ſupporter of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>I will not fill your ears with curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities,
nor trouble you with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes,
wherein this judgement deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the King, and this juſtice and
righteouſneſſe for the Kings Sonne
differ one from another. I know
they differ in Schoole learning,
Judgement ſtanding uſually for the
habite; &amp; Juſtice for the ſentence, or
execution accordingly. But here <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus,</hi>
and <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and other Divines
tell me that judgement and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
in this place ſtand for that
juſtice, and judgement, that the King
is indifferently, &amp; equally to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
to his people, and ſo for one
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115067:157"/>
vertue. Here is the vertue and the
power, both from the King, and
both from God. The benefit of
both are the peoples; but from God
by the King. Therefore <hi>David</hi>
prayes here not for one vertue for
himſelfe, and another for his ſon;
but for one, and the ſame vertue for
both. For the Sonne had as much
need for this vertue as the Father,
the one being a King, and the other
to be one; they both needed this
great compriſing Kingly vertue,
without which there can be no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
peaceable government over a
people. So juſtice and judgement in
this place (as uſually when they
attend the King) containe the vertue
it ſelfe; and the power that brings
this vertue to act. The execution is
as juſtice, and the power to give
ſentence, moderation and equity to
ſmooth over the rigour of juſtice;
and all other vertues, as far as they
ſerve to ſtrengthen, or direct and
keepe even the hands of juſtice,
prudence eſpecially.</p>
            <p>Then it is a wondrous neceſſary
prayer here: for if juſtice ſhould
not be in the Kings will (which
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115067:158"/>
God forbid) it muſt needs grow apt
to turne to ſoureneſſe. And if judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and execution follow not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſentence of juſtice, the Kings
hand muſt needs ſhake into remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
And one of theſe, ſoure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
will make judgement it ſelfe,
or the pretext of it a ſcourage for the
people. And the other, remiſneſs, will
make the people a worſe ſcourge
to themſelves, for want of diſcipline
to keep them in order: For of all
ſcourges, there is none anſwerable to
the unrulineſſe of the people.</p>
            <p>Now this vertue as large as it is,
when it fills the heart of the King,
it is called <hi>another heart;</hi> it puts on
other diſmenſions; for it furniſheth
the Kings breſt with all rectitude,
and prudence; and rectitude is the
being, and prudence, the moderation,
and guide of all juſtice: for ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpect of perſons it belongs to
the wiſe, and prudent, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>Nay further, though this vertne
be ſo large, yet the heart of the King
is ſo capacious, that juſtice and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot fill it, if it ſtand ſingle:
therefore <hi>David:</hi> prayeth not for
judgement ſingle, but in the plurall
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115067:158"/>
number, <hi>Give thy judgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is great reaſon, that he
ſhould pray ſo: for juſtice continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
one and the ſame vertue, gives
many times different judgements;
and it muſt needs be ſo, and the King
muſt needs be an inſtrument in them
all; And in the various occaſions that
himſelfe and his people have uſe of.
This <hi>David</hi> found in his owne heart;
therefore he prayes for all.</p>
            <p>And this pray we alway for the
King, for all judgement for the King.
So give Lord.</p>
            <p>And here it is fit for you a little
to take a view of your owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and to bleſſe God for it: for
you live under a King that keeps his
Laws in his life; A King that lives ſo,
as if he were a Law himſelfe, and ſo
needed none. A King that plants his
Judges ſo, as they may equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute
his judgement, and juſtice to
his people; A King ſo bleſſed by God
for your good, that whether it be
for his owne prayers, or yours, or
both, or neither, but that God is
pleaſed to ſhew his mercy, and glory
upon him to you, certaine it is, that
God hath given him a very large
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115067:159"/>
heart, and filled it to the brim with
juſtice and judgement.</p>
            <p>Take heed, I heartily beg it of you.
I ſay it againe, take heed I heartily
beg it of you, that no ſinne of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe,
no baſe detracting
murmuring ſin, poſſeſſe your ſoules,
or whet your tongues, or ſowre
your breſts againſt the Lord, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Anoynted: but remember
in that theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, remember, that it is as eaſie
for God to take away any bleſſing
(even the great bleſſing of a good
King) as to give it, remember that.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, remember, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe
to God for ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a King, is the very ready way to
doe it, remember that too: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
looke to theſe things in time.</p>
            <p>I, but what then, hath a King e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
when God hath given him
juſtice, and judgement? May his
prayers then ceaſe for himſelfe, as
your prayers for him? hath he no
more need of God, when God hath
once given him judgement?</p>
            <p>O God forbid; ſurely he hath, and
it is to be preſumed, that the King
daily prayeth; I am ſure his duty
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115067:159"/>
it is, to pray that God would ever
pleaſe to continue, and increaſe the
righteouſneſſe, and judgement he
hath given to him. Nor can I think,
but that <hi>David</hi> was very oft at this
prayer too: for he ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 99.
The Kings power loveth judgement.</hi>
And it is more then probable, that
that he loved, he would pray for; he
prayed to have it, and to increaſe it.
And he that prayes ſo oft, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.
I ſay ſo oft that God would keepe
him <hi>in the way of his commandements,
and cauſe him to make much of
his Law;</hi> he muſt of neceſſity be
preſumed to pray for juſtice, and
judgement, which is the vigour of all
Lawes, divine, and humane.</p>
            <p>And Kings have great need oft to
pray for this grace, and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
and increaſe of it too.</p>
            <p>For Kings ſtand high, that is true;
but the higher they ſtand, the more
they are expoſed to tempeſts, &amp; wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhakings,
that paſſe lover the lower
vallies with the leſſe noyſe, &amp; danger.</p>
            <p>And Kings are great. That is true
too: but the greater they are, the
ſtiffer are the blaſts of all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on them to batter, at leaſt to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:115067:160"/>
would be wiſe: For certainly, there
can be no kingdome rightly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
further than God himſelfe
comes in, in laying the foundation
of it in true, impartiall judgement.
When the foundation of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is perfectly laid (which is a
bleſſing ſeldome perfect in al things
in any kingdome whatſoever, yet)
no kingdom can continue upon ſuch
a foundation, longer than it ſtands
upright upon it. If it ſway on
either ſide; if it fall not preſently,
it growes weaker ſtill, the more it
leanes away from juſtice and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is Gods.</p>
            <p>And as it is with kingdomes in
their foundation, and ſuperſtructure,
ſo it is with Kings too, that are to
manage, and diſpoſe them: for if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
King thinke himſelfe ſufficient
by his owne vertue againſt the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
of a kingdome, by his owne
juſtice, and wiſedome, and integrity,
he will find by his loſſe, a <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi>
in his greateſt greatneſſe, <hi>Dan.
4.</hi> that he &amp; all his vertue cannot long
keep up, no not a ſetled King. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>David</hi> was wiſe, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
that he went to <hi>God for his
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115067:160"/>
judgements,</hi> without which he nor his
Son after him, he knew was able to
hold up the kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Give the King thy judgements O God.</hi>
And what did <hi>David</hi> with them,
when he had them?</p>
            <p>What, he reſolved to make them
the very rule of his government, and
he did ſo: for</p>
            <p>Firſt for himſelfe, he tels us in
<hi>Pſal. 119, Thy judgements have I
laid before me.</hi> There he makes them
his owne rule. Then he prayes over
his Son <hi>Solomon. O Lord give here to</hi>
Solomon <hi>my ſon a perfect heart, that
he may keep thy commandements,</hi> that
they might rule his Son. Well then
<hi>Thy judgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is not all juſtice, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Gods? Yes, out of doubt; In
generall juſtice and judgement are
from him. Therefore it is a great
advantage to people in any king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
even among Infidels, to have
the kingdom adminiſtred by juſtice,
and judgement. But yet to make a
kingdom perfect, and entire, to have
the judgement Gods, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
firme; then there muſt theſe
graines be put into the ballance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:115067:161"/>
Firſt, it muſt be juſtice, not onely
given, but guided all along by God,
and Grace. If this be not, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot remaine firme in any
man, or any King. Now as it holds
it workes, for worke it cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the ſtrength it hath: therefore
if Gods ſpirit aſſiſt it not, it may
faint, and faile juſt there, and then
when on the ſudden it may ſhake a
kingdome.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it muſt be judgement
that is alway Gods; and it muſt
diſtribute rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as God commands. If ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and judgement role this eye
aſide, though it may continue for
ought may appeare to others, and
themſelves, yet they begin to looke
ſquint, and in part leave God.
Therefore if any pretended cunning
way of juſtice and judgement ſo
called, ſhall debaſe, and ſinke the
honour of God, and the ſincerity of
Religion: If any Municipall Law
be made in any kingdome to
ſtrengthen ſuch deſignes, as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to God, and his worſhip;
there muſt, there will come a failing
upon all ſuch kingdomes, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115067:161"/>
they are; and then it will appear,
(though perhaps too late) that the
judgements of their King were not
Gods judgements.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it muſt be judgement,
that (as much as humane infirmity
can beare) muſt be free from taint,
both within, and without; within
at the heart of the King, and his
Judges under him; and without,
from all poſſeſſion in the ear, and
from all corruption in the hand. If
this be not, Juſtice which ſhould
onely be blind to ſee no perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
ſo blind, that it can ſee no
truth; and juſtice that is ſo blind
cannot be Gods. Therefore if the
juſtice and judgement of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
cut up its owne foundation,
can any man thinke it can build
ſafely and wiſely upon it for the
State? it cannot be.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Thine</hi> in the text (for
I muſt haſten) <hi>Thy judgements,</hi>
It is ſo full a circumſtance, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
leave it yet. For by it you may
ſee how neceſſary it was then for
<hi>David,</hi> and how requiſite it is now
for all Kings to pray to God; and
to him alone for judgement: For
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115067:162"/>
no King can maſter the Scepter
well, but by juſtice and judgement.
And you ſee it cannot be done by
any kind of judgement neither; but
that that is Gods judgement in the
upright integrity of it: And then who
can give Gods judgements but God
himſelfe? who is as he is called
<hi>Iſay. 30. The God, and the God of
judgement:</hi> ſurely none can have it
but he in perfection, nor none can
give it to others, to make them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
but he.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Auſtine</hi> askes the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
but meerely in ſcorne. What!
is it come to that? doſt thou thinke
that thou canſt give juſtice &amp; judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto thy ſelfe? No, thou canſt
not; for no man can give himſelfe
that that he hath not; &amp; that that he
hath already, he needs not. This our
Prophet tels us plainly: for tho the
<hi>King love judgement,</hi> yet it is <hi>God that
prepares Equity, and Righteouſneſſe
in</hi> Jacob: <hi>O bleſſed are all they that
waite for him.</hi> For if they waite,
he will give, and that no leſſe than
<hi>Judgement, his judgements to the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One circumſtance behind yet is,
that the words are properly a prayer
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115067:162"/>
in the moſt native ſenſe of prayer.
Not a thanksgiving onely, that God
had given him his judgements. For
though God had given <hi>David</hi> his
judgements; and he was thankfull
for ſuch a gift as this: yet thinks
here is not his proper worke, but
humiliation, and ſupplication.</p>
            <p>And it is an excellent thing to ſee
a King at his prayers: for then you
ſee two things at once; a greater,
and a leſſer King, <hi>God and the King.</hi>
And though wee cannot ſee God,
as we ſee the King; yet when we
ſee Majeſty humbled, and in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of a Supplicant, we cannot in
a ſort but ſee that infinite, unſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Majeſty of that God, whom
even Kings adore, and are made far
greater by their humbleſt adoration.
For when I pray you was <hi>Solomon</hi>
the Sonne of this King at his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
glory? Surely, you ſhall finde
him at his greateſt, then immediatly
upon the finiſhing of the Temple.
And how doe you find <hi>Solomon</hi>
there? juſt at his Fathers worke;
he was there at his prayers upon
his knees, ſaith the text, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8.
upon his knees; whereas now many
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:115067:163"/>
meane, unworthy men, are loath to
bow their knees, or ſtoope in prayer
to God.</p>
            <p>Now this prayer was a prayer
indeed: for prayer is apt to beg, not
to buy. He that pleads deſert, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
reward of duty: but he that
prayeth relies upon the mercy, and
goodneſſe of the Giver. And this
is the way that <hi>David</hi> comes to
God, both for himſelfe and for his
Son.</p>
            <p>And I pray marke it, <hi>David</hi> here,
the great example of a praying
King, he ſaith not <hi>retribue domine,</hi>
Lord repay me for the paines of my
government; for my ſervice of the
people, or for my worſhip to thy
ſelfe; there is none of this; but <hi>da
domine, Give Lord,</hi> that thou art
able to doe by thy power, that thou
art ready to do by thy goodneſſe. O
Lord let not mine, or my peoples
unworthineſſe hinder that; Let not
their murmuring, &amp; diſobedience be
heard ſo farre as to thee; but Lord
give the King <hi>thy judgements,</hi> and
then I will execute them to thine
honour, and their good. This was
<hi>Davids</hi> way, and it was prevalent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:115067:163"/>
And out of queſtion be he King,
or Subject, he that askes no more
at Gods hands, than either of both,
askes and ſhall have too little. But
God gives much to humble Sutors,
Iudgements, and his judgements.
And neither the Prophet did ask,
nor God did give the earneſt and
pledge of this judgement onely, but
judgement it ſelfe to the King. And
certajnly the King had need to pray
thus; And ſo had the people as
great need as the King: for if this
prayer be not made, what aſſurance
have you that God will give? and
if God will not give, the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have; and if the King cannot
receive juſtice and judgement, hee
cannot diſtribute it to the people,
<hi>ver.</hi> 2. And if judgement be not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
to the people, there will
be no peace, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. And where the
people doe not receive judgement
from the King, and peace from
themſelves, what are they? Nothing
but a heape of moſt infirme, and
miſerable creatures: which you can
never be as long as God gives his
<hi>Judgements to the King, and his
Righteouſneſſe to the King ſonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:115067:164"/>
I have now done with the firſt
generall part of the text: and it is
time to deſcend from the King to
his Son, the ſecond part of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Prayer.</p>
            <p>And thy Righteouſneſſe to the Kings
ſonne, give Lord.</p>
            <p>Where firſt, though it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
in the text, it may eaſily bee
conceived, that ſuch a King as <hi>Dauid</hi>
prayed for a Son, before he prayed
for Righteouſneſſe to be given him:
and though <hi>David</hi> had divers ſonnes
before, yet in ſome reſpect or other,
they were all to <hi>David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as no ſons:
therefore there is no queſtion to be
made, but he prayed for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I and
therefore too, when God had given
him <hi>Solomon,</hi> he calls him not
bare his ſonne, but his onely ſonne,
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. And no marvell, ſince he
was that ſon, that God himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to ſucceed in the kingdome
for <hi>David, 1 Chron.</hi> 28. and ſuch a
ſon is alway worth the praying for.</p>
            <p>Well, but what then? when God
had given <hi>David Solomon:</hi> when
God hath given any other King a
ſon, as he hath given our gracious
King (Gods name be ever bleſſed)
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115067:164"/>
what then, is the Kings prayers then,
or the peoples at an end?</p>
            <p>No, nothing leſſe; nay, there is
more need a great deale, both for
the King, &amp; for the people to go on
in their prayers, as <hi>David</hi> did; that
the ſame God that hath given his
judgements to the King, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and <hi>Give his Righteouſneſſe to
the Kings ſonne.</hi> For it is a greater
bleſſing to the King, when God
gives his Righteouſneſſe to his ſon,
than when he gives him a ſon. For
if <hi>Solomon</hi> ſucceed not <hi>David</hi> in his
love to the Temple, as well as the
Throne; if he inherit not the truth
of his fathers Religion, as well as
the right of his Crown; if he follow
not his Fathers devotion, and pray
for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Judgement</hi> to be
given him, as well as other tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
bleſſings: the very bleſſings
of the Son would end in bitterneſſe,
and be the diſcomfort, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Father.</p>
            <p>But it is the wiſe, and prudent
Sonne <hi>that is the Fathers Crown,
and the Mothers joy, Prov.</hi> 10.
And then the bleſſing of Sonne is a
bleſſing indeed. <hi>David</hi> ſaw this
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115067:165"/>
therefore he continued his prayers.
And it is more than fit for other
Kings to doe ſo too. <hi>Thy Judgements
Lord give the King, and thy Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
to the Kings ſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the people, they have
great need, not onely to ſay <hi>Amen</hi>
to the prayers of the King; but to
repeate the prayer, and with ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to drive it in at the ears of God,
that ſo their children after them
may be as happy under the Sonne, as
they themſelves were under the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
while God gives both the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Son zeale to his truth,
and judgement over his people.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhould take occaſion
to tell you of the care, and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our <hi>David</hi> in his dayes, and of
his prayers, both for himſelfe, and
his Sonne; but that the age is ſo bad,
that they will not beleeve that he is
ſo good beyond them. And ſome
(for they are but ſome) are ſo waſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly
ſet to ſting, that nothing can
pleaſe their eares, unleſſe it ſharpen
their edge againſt authority.</p>
            <p>But take heed: for if this fault be
not amended, Juſtice may ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them that are guilty God knows
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115067:165"/>
how ſoone: And the Kings Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that God hath given him, may
pull out their ſtings, that can imploy
their tongues in nothing but to
wound him, and his government.</p>
            <p>Well, theſe muſt not divert me,
or any good ſubject from praying
for the King, and the Kings Sonne.
The Kings Sonne! bleſſed name,
what imports then to a King? ſurely
<hi>David</hi> knew well: therefore you
ſee he leaps for joy, into this prayer
in the firſt words of the Pſalme.
Some tell me this name imports at
large, the King, and his poſterity,
Sonnes or Daughters, not diſtinct.
And I confeſſe the leaſt is Gods
great bleſſing upon a people. For
the wiſe Hiſtorian tells us, that
<hi>Plena, &amp;c.</hi> The Kings houſe full of
them, is the Kings ſecurity; and the
kingdomes too: and our Prophet
proclames as much, for he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clames
him <hi>bleſſed that hath his qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
full of them, he ſhall not be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when he meets his enemy in the
gate, Pſal.</hi> 112. But when I find it
<hi>Filio Regis,</hi> the Kings Sonne, I think
<hi>David</hi> made a difference, and had a
ſpeciall eye upon <hi>Solomon,</hi> that God
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115067:166"/>
had given him to ſucceed after him,
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. Well then, be it to the
Kings Sonne.</p>
            <p>Why! but then is it but to one?
out of doubt where there is but one,
there can be no queſtion: but when
there are more Sons than one, as
<hi>David</hi> had (and other Kings may
have) there the Kings Sonne in the
text, ſtands for that Sonne, that in
the courſe of the kingdome, is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit,
and to be King after him.</p>
            <p>Not that prayer is not neeeſſary,
or not to be made for Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
upon them all: But becauſe in
the courſe of time the ſterne is to be
held by that hand, therefore the
prayer is moſt neceſſary to fill that
hand, with juſtice, and judgement, of
the Kings Sonne, and to ſeaſon the
Kings Sonne with juſtice and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>So then, the Son in the text was
<hi>Solomon,</hi> not borne firſt, for he had
other brethren living; but deſigned
by God, and by <hi>David</hi> himſelfe to
be King after him: deſigned by
<hi>David,</hi> therefore he had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to pray; deſigned by God,
therefore <hi>David</hi> had reaſon to hope,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115067:166"/>
that God would give him a ſpirit of
government. And it was ſo; for
God gave him plenty of wiſdome,
and ſtore of juſtice, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>The Sonne with which God hath
bleſſed onr King, and us, as <hi>natus
haeres,</hi> borne heire; and I hope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
and marked out by God for
long life, and happineſſe: In all things
like <hi>Solomon,</hi> God make him, ſaving
in thoſe things in which <hi>Solomon</hi>
fell from theſe prayers of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Now as it was to <hi>David,</hi> ſo it is
to any King, a great happineſſe to
have a Son to pray for.</p>
            <p>For firſt, there is ſcarce ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exerciſe of a Kings piety, as to
pray for his Sonne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is ſcarcely ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
motive to make the King
carefull of his Sonnes education, as
this prayer is. For the more <hi>David</hi>
prayed to God, for Gods juſtice and
judgement, to deſcend upon his Son,
the more he ſeemed to ſee what a
want it was for the Sonne of a King
to want juſtice and judgement, and
the more he ſees what this want is,
the more undoubtedly muſt he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:115067:167"/>
by prayer to God, and his
owne indeavour to looke to it, for
the vertuous education of his Sonne.
For it is impoſſible almoſt, that he
that prayes to God to give; ſhould
not alſo indeavour that it may be
given. For when we our ſelves pray
for any thing, that prayer if it be
ſuch as it ought, ſets an edge on our
indeavours: becauſe in a manner it
aſſures us, that God will give what
we aske, if we indeavour by Gods
grace, as we aske.</p>
            <p>And for our owne particular, I
doubt not but we ſhall ſee Gods
grace plentifully given to the Kings
Sonne, after his pious Fathers care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſucceſſefull indeavour in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.
That his heart may be full
of juſtice, and his hand of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
againſt the time come, that
the judiciary power muſt deſcend
upon him.</p>
            <p>And if you marke it here, the
bleſſing that <hi>David</hi> deſires for the
Kings Sonne, is the very ſelfe-ſame
that he askes for himſelfe, <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
that is, Juſtice, and Judgement.
And there is great reaſon for it: for
this vertue is as neceſſary for the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115067:167"/>
Sonne, as for the Father. The ſame
Crown being to be worne by both.
The ſame Scepter to be welded by
both. The ſame people to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by both. The ſame Lawes to be
maintained by both. Therefore the
ſame vertue is neceſſary for both.</p>
            <p>And the copulative in the text,
<hi>And thy righteouſneſſe for the Kings
Sonne,</hi> joynes <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi>
the Father and the Sonne in one
prayer for one bleſſing.</p>
            <p>And this example of <hi>Davids</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is a great leading caſe for Kings;
for this holy and pious King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
this King full of experience what
the greateſt want of a King might
be; he doth not aske at Gods hand,
for his Son long life, an inlarged
kingdome, heaps of wealth, (though
that be very neceſſary) but the grace
of judgement, and righteouſnes, that
ſo he may be able to goe through
with the office of a King, that is
<hi>Davids</hi> prayer. And other bleſſings
come within the <hi>adjicientur, Mat. 6.
they ſhall be caſt into the lap of the
King, if he firſt ſeeke the Kingdome
of God,</hi> in the adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and Judgement to the people.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:115067:168"/>
For Kings are ordained of God for
the good of the people. And this
<hi>David</hi> underſtood well: for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
acknowledgeth it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. that
God therefore made him King, that
he might feed <hi>Jacob his people, and
Iſrael his Inheritance;</hi> that he might
feed them: and as <hi>David</hi> knew this,
ſo he practiſed it too; <hi>for he fed
them with a faithfull and prudent
heart, and governed them wiſely with
all his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And even with this goes along
the prayer of the Church for the
King, that he may ever, and firſt
ſeeke Gods honour, and glory; and
then ſtudy to preſerve the people
committed to his charge, <hi>to preſerve
them,</hi> which cannot poſſible be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Juſtice, and Judgement. For
as <hi>Auſtine</hi> proves at large, there is
no bond of unity or concord that
can be firme without it.</p>
            <p>And I will not tell you, but <hi>Solomon</hi>
may, what a King is, that hath not
the grace of Juſtice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. But
however, the more are you bound to
God Almighty, that hath given you
a King ſo full of Juſtice, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as you have found him to
be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:115067:168"/>
And it is worthy our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
too, how <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>
agree in their prayers; and what
a Kings Son may learne, when he is
exampled by ſuch a Father. For we
find when <hi>Solomon</hi> came to yeeres,
and wore the Crowne, he fell to
prayer too: and his prayer was
built upon the ſame foundation. The
prayer of <hi>David,</hi> &amp; <hi>Solomon</hi> the ſon
meet at once. For <hi>David</hi> did not
ſimply pray for wiſedome; but for
that wiſdome that might enable
him to governe the people. And
indeed all the wiſdome of a King,
eſpecially to direct Juſtice, and
Judgement, is the very ready way to
all Kingly wiſdome. Therefore
<hi>Davids</hi> prayer went up firſt for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
becauſe without that there is
no wiſdome.</p>
            <p>There may be wilineſſe if you
will to reſemble wiſdome: but
there was never any wiſe King that
was not juſt. And that policy will
be fouud weake in the end, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
any King againſt Iuſtice and
Judgement.</p>
            <p>And as before, it was not Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alone, that <hi>David</hi> deſired for
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115067:169"/>
himſelfe, but it muſt be <hi>Tuam,</hi> thy
Iudgement. So <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> alone
doth not content him for his Sonne,
but it muſt be <hi>Tuam</hi> too, <hi>Thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed morall Iuſtice alone
cannot poſſibly be enough for a
Chriſtian King. Religious and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Iuſtice muſt come in too. He
muſt take care for the ſoules, as well
as for the bodies and goods of his
people. Therefore one of the
Churches prayers is, that the King
may ſtudy to preſerve the people,
not in wealth onely, and in peace,
but in <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> too. He muſt ſo
give the people their owne, that is
Iuſtice; as that he command the
people to give God his owne; that
is, Juſtice with Religion. And there
is no King, nor no Kings Sonne can
poſſibly doe this, unleſſe God give
them the ſpirit of Judgement, and
Juſtice. God muſt firſt give it the
King, before the King give it the
people.</p>
            <p>And it is, <hi>Give Lord:</hi> For as
Morall Juſtice onely will not ſerve,
ſo neither will Theological, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>qua datur,</hi> as it is given. For as
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:115067:169"/>
it is <hi>acquiſita,</hi> as it is learned by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
be it by ſtudy or practiſe, ſo it
is ſpeculative, or operative by
rule (that is the moſt) but as it is
given, ſo it is at the heart, and ſo
the King is not onely active by rule;
but it makes the King, and the Kings
Son to be in love, and to joy in the
judgment that they are to put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
Then the King is fitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
for government, when there is
the love of Juſtice, <hi>and truth in the
inward parts, Pſal.</hi> 51. For then they
cannot but practice what they love,
I, and then that Juſtice which is
within at the heart, is <hi>vera tua,</hi> truly
Gods Righteouſneſſe: and for this
Juſtice, and Judgement, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
continue <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, and go
on, <hi>Give Lord thy judgement to the
King, and thy righteouſneſſe to the
Kings ſon.</hi> For if God doe not give,
it is not poſſible for Juſtice, and
Judgement, any other way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
into the heart of the King, and
the Kings Son.</p>
            <p>None but God can ſee to drop
Juſtice and Iudgement into the deep
heart of the King; none but onely
<hi>Pater luminum,</hi> the Father of Lights,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115067:170"/>
that ſtand over, and ſees how to
doe it.</p>
            <p>And yet I muſt tell you here,
that while he prayes for Gods
Iuſtice, and Iudgement for himſelfe,
and his Son, it muſt be underſtood
with a great deale of difference, and
and that in two respects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe Gods Iudgement as
it is in God, is ſubſtantiall. It is ſo in
God, as it is his eſſence himſelfe.
This way no King is capable of
Gods Juſtice, becauſe it is his eſſence.
But Iuſtice as it is given to the King,
is a quality, an accident, and that is
ſeparable, if God either leave to
give, or deſiſt from preſerving that
that he hath given; therefore Kings
have great need to pray for this
Iuſtice, becauſe they can neither have
it, nor keepe it without him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe Iuſtice as it is in
God, is <hi>Lumen,</hi> all light, ſo bright,
that even impious men themſelves
cannot but accknowledge it, even
when they are condemned by it. So
cleare that no intangled cauſe can
cloud it; no corner ſinne can avoid
it. And this way againe no King is
capable of Gods Light, becauſe that
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:115067:170"/>
is a thing in communicable, as his
ſubſtance, as eſſentiall as he. But
Iuſtice as it is given to a King, is but
<hi>Lucerna,</hi> but a Candle-Light, an
imparted Light; a Light that is
kindled, and ſet up in a materiall
ſubſtance, &amp; ſo darkned with dregs:
yet even this Light Kings muſt pray
for: and it is but need they ſhould:
for if God give not even this Light,
it is impoſſible the King ſhould ſee
how to doe Iuſtice; or that he ſhould
diſcerne how to execute thoſe
judgements that God hath given
him.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Lighting up of this
Candle in the heart of the King, the
Light of Iuſtice and Iudgement, is a
marvellous bleſſing, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
accounts it ſo; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe among the many
threatnings, that he thunders out
againſt rebellions people, this is one,
that he will take from them the
Light of a Candle, <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. he wil not
leave them ſo much light: and it
was ſo; for Gods Iudgement
departed away from the King, the
King loſt the Kingdome, and the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115067:171"/>
people were lead away in darkneſſe
to captivity. So you may ſee what it
is to want this light of judgement in
a King,</p>
            <p>Secondly, it appeares to be great
by the promiſes of God: for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the many profeſſions, that
he makes to this glorious King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
this was one, that he had <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
a light for him, Pſal.</hi> 132.
So then you ſee by the preſence of
this light, what the benefit is to have
it. But then ſtill Kings themſelves, and
the people muſt remember, it is but
<hi>Lucerna,</hi> but a Candle lighted at
that great light, the Lampe of God;
And being but a Candle light, it is
eaſily blowne out, if God keepe not
his light about the King to renew it;
and if God provide not a fence for
this Light of Iuſtice againſt the
winds of temptation that bluſter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it. Therefore our old Engliſh
Tranſlation reads that place in the
<hi>Pſalme</hi> happily, <hi>I have provided</hi>
(ſaith that Tranſlation) <hi>not onely a
light, but a Lanthorn for mine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
to carry this Light.</hi> And this
improves the bleſſing a great deale
further: For there is no carrying
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115067:171"/>
of this Light without the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne
of Gods owne ordaining:
the temptations that beſet the King
are ſo many, and ſo ſtrong, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
this Lanthorn defend the light,
all the light of Iuſtice and judgment
will out. And this Lanthorn is ſo hard
to make, that God himſelfe muſt
ordaine it, or elſe the King cannot
have it: for who can fence, and
keepe in Gods bleſſings, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?
Therefore <hi>David</hi> here went
very right in his prayer, marvellous
right, both for himſelfe, and for his
Son, <hi>da Domine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Give Lord, not the
light of thy judgement, and juſtice
onely; but give the Lanthorne too
for thine Anointed, that he may be
able with honour to carry thorow
this Light of Iuſtice, and Iudgement,
before his people.</p>
            <p>And let me me tell you one thing
more, that <hi>filius regis</hi> the Kings Son
here, is not onely a fit object of his
Fathers prayers, but of yours too,
for the peoples prayers, as well as
the Kings: for <hi>filius regis,</hi> is <hi>filius
regni</hi> too, the Son of the King, is the
Son of the Kingdome; his Fathers
Son by nature, but the Kingdomes
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:115067:172"/>
Son by right; all the ſubjects having
equall intereſt in the Iuſtice and
Iudgement of the Kings Son. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
while <hi>David</hi> prayes, pray you
alſo, that God would give his <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the King, and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to the Kings Sonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I and where ever there is want
for a Kings Son to ſucceed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
his Father, ſurely it is a marke,
that God is ſomewhat angry with a
people: For if God doe not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
divert the judgements, and
ſometime leſſen them, when there is
not a Son to ſucceed, that judgment
nſually is a fore-runner of ſorrows:
of ſorrowes ſometimes that men
can neither ſee, nor prevent. I know
they may eaſily foreſee that troubles
may follow us, but of what kinde
they ſhall be, to what greatneſſe
they ſhall increaſe, how long they
ſhall continue, what trembling they
may make at the very foundation of
a State, whether it will pleaſe
God to give them an iſſue, or not
an iſſue, I ſuppoſe none can tell but
God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſtill let the prayer be
expreſt in what perſon it will, let
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115067:172"/>
it be made by the King, or by the
people, or by both; all ſhall goe
well, ſo wee pray, and give
thanks heartily for the King, and
the Kings Sonne. I muſt break off
the reſt.</p>
            <p>Thus you have ſeene <hi>David</hi>
praying for himſelfe and his Sonne.
That it is an excellent thing to find
a King at his prayers: that his
prayers cannot better begin, than
for himſelfe, nor better proceed
than for his Sonne; nor be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
made to any but God; nor
for a more neceſſary kingly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
than juſtice, and judgement;
nor with more wiſdome, than for
the joyning of Gods judgement
to morall juſtice: for that will
ever be the ſetling of the Kings
throne, and the honour and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the King himſelfe.</p>
            <p>This day, is the day of the Kings
crowning; many yeares may it ſit
on his head, and crown all his dayes
thorow with juſtice, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and this ſolemnity in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
with prayer and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God, the initiall dayes of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115067:173"/>
the Crownes of Kings, is old, as well
as any other; For <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells
us that it was a practice long before
his time. I, and even they which
ſerve no true God, Infidels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
were upon ſuch dayes as this
at their vows; and prayers to ſuch
Gods as they had, for the happineſſe,
and ſafety of their Princes; and I
hope we ſhall never fall ſhort of
Infidels in our prayers to God, for
the ſecurity and happineſſe of the
King: but we ſhall take up the
prayer here, as <hi>David</hi> begins it;
<hi>Give thy judgements to the King O
God, and thy righteouſneſſe to the
Kings Sonne.</hi> And it is the beſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of this day to pray for the
King.</p>
            <p>This is the day of the Kings crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and yet as I have not already,
ſo neither ſhall I now break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any large panegyricks, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
no not of a gracious King. But I
come hither to preach a kinde of
Goſpel to you, even glad tydings,
that God in the mercies of Chriſt
(whoſe the Goſpell is) hath given
you a wiſe, and juſt, and religious
King; a King whom God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115067:173"/>
to wind up all his other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
in patience within himſelfe, and
clemency towards his people. A
King made by God (for ſo I hope)
not onely to beare (for that he hath
done enough already) but to maſter
the great difficulties of his time at
home, and abroad; that ſo his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may not onely be, but may live,
and flouriſh in peace and plenty.</p>
            <p>This is the day of the Kings crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and though not juſt upon this
day, yet within the compaſſe of this
year God hath crowned him againe
with a Son, a Crown far more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
than the Gold of Ophir. For
ſince Children are in nature the
Crowne of their parents rejoycing,
what joy muſt this needs be, both to
the King, and to the people, who
have an intereſt, though not alike in
the Kings Sonne? In the Kings Son;
and he a Sonne given by God after
ſome yeares expectation: and he a
Son given after ſo great a loſſe of a
Son in the former yeare; and he a
Son after ſo many feares that this
bleſſing could not, or not ſo ſoone
come upon us? So here are two
great bleſſings that God hath given
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115067:174"/>
you at once, the King and the
Kings Sonne; the tree, and the
fruit; the King to be a bleſſing
to you, and the Kings Sonne to
be a bleſſing for your children after
you.</p>
            <p>And beſides, all other bleſſings
that are to come; here is a double
bleſſing riſing with this Sonne: for
it diſpells the miſts of your feares,
and promiſeth an influence to them
that ſhall come after. And let me
put you in minde of it; for it is moſt
true, whether you will beleeve it or
no; There are no ſubjects in any
State (I ſpeake what I know) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
Chriſtian, or other, that live
in that plenty, at that eaſe, with thoſe
liberties, and immunities that you
doe. There is no nation under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſo happy, if it did but know, and
underſtand its owne happineſſe. To
theſe, nay farre above all theſe, you
have Religion as free as may be.
And all this you have maintained to
you by the juſtice and judgement
that God hath given the King for
your good.</p>
            <p>Take heed, I beſeech you, take
heed, what returne you make to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115067:174"/>
God and the King, for theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.
Let not the ſins of the time,
murmuring, and diſobedience, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
any. They are great ſins when
they are at the leaſt; but they are
crying ſins, when they fly out againſt
ſuch a King, as God hath filled with
Iuſtice, and Iudgement.</p>
            <p>Rather ſet your ſelves to prayſe
God, and to bleſſe his name, and to
give him thanks for his goodneſſe.
And pray to him that he would ſtill
preſerve the King, and that his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kindneſſe may imbrace the
Kings Son. That ſo no cloud no
confuſed darkneſſe may be ſpread
over this kingdom; that no cloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
from your ingratitude to God
may obſcure the King; nor no eclipſe
cauſed by popular Lunacy may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
the Kings Son. For in this the
King, and the Kings Sonne are like
the Sun in the firmament, ſeldome or
never eclipſed, but by that Moon
that receives all her Light from
them, nor by that, but when it is in
the head, or poiſoned taile of the
great Dragon, the Devill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the multitude of people is the
Kings honour, Prov.</hi> 14. But in the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:115067:175"/>
loyalty and love of the people, is
the Kings ſafety; and in the Kings
juſtice, and judgement, is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his people; &amp; the ready way
to make a King joy in juſtice, and
judgement over his people, is for
people to ſhew their loving obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the King. And ſince none
of us can tell how, or what to doe
better, let us take up the pr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yer
here, where <hi>David</hi> leaves it, and
proceed to pray as he did, That as
God hath given us a King, and to
that King juſtice and judgement;
ſo he will moſt graciouſly be pleaſed
to continue theſe great bleſſings to
him for us; that the King may ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
comfort, and the people from
the King juſtice, and judgement.
That theſe judgements may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
may be all, which may any way
fit the King, or fill the people. That
theſe judgements may be Gods
judgements; that is, as neare the
uprightneſſe of Gods judgements
as may be, even ſuch as may preſerve
Religion intire, as well as Equity.
And that God would graciouſly
pleaſe, not to looke for pay from
us, but to give where we cannot
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:115067:175"/>
merit. That ſince he hath not onely
given us the King, but the Kings Son,
he will at laſt double this bleſſing
upon us, and make the Queen a
fruitfull Mother of more happy
Children. That to this Royall
Prince, he would give many happy
dayes, and a large portion of his
mercy, that the King, and his Son,
and the joyfull Mother that bare
him, may reſt in the middeſt of
Gods bleſſings, both ſpirituall, and
temporall; that we may be in the
middeſt of Gods bleſſings, and the
Kings, till the Kings Son be grown
up to continue theſe bleſſings to our
Generations, and tranſmit them to
them. And ſo O Lord, give and
continue, and ſtrengthen, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
and multiply thy <hi>judgements
to the King, and thy righteouſneſſe to
the Kings Son;</hi> even ſo Amen Lord
Ieſus, and doe it. To whom with
the Father, and the Holy Spirit,
three Perſons, but one everliving
God, be aſcribed all Might, Majeſty,
and Dominion, this day, and for
ever, Amen.</p>
