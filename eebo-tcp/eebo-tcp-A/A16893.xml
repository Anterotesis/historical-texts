            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What plottings? what combinations? What secret underminings vnder colour of furtherance? What writing and posting of letters, euen to the <hi>King</hi> himselfe? What retaining of Counsellours? What forging? what minting and coining of slanderous reports for the time past? What <hi>Panick</hi> feares pretended for the time to come? A rebellious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that vpon record; a seditious worke, fit to be stifled in the birth, or smothered in the cradle, for feare of further inconuenience likely to ensue. Such opposition they met with abroad. They wanted no <hi>discouragements</hi> at home. Amongst others, the <hi>Temple</hi> they were about to build was meane and despicable, a meane foundation, a homely building, in comparison of the former but as a Starre to the Sun, comming far short of it in magnitude, in glory. The <hi>Glory</hi> of the former Temple had so dazled the eyes of the ancient men who had before beheld it in the beauty of it, that they could not now looke vpon this without watering eyes, <hi>They wept when they saw it,</hi> saith<note place="margin">Ezra. 3. 12.</note> the Text. Against this discouragement it is, that the Lord goeth about by his Prophet to comfort the people in this Chapter, whereof the Text is a part. The Summe and quintessence of that consolation you haue it extracted in the words which I haue now read. That which disani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the people, was the meannesse of the house which they were about to build: <hi>A man child was borne; But</hi>

               <hi>she called his name Ichabod.</hi> The foundations of the worke were raised, the <hi>Temple</hi> was in some forwardnesse, but there was no beauty, no <hi>Glory</hi> in it; at least none in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of what once it was, and what God had promised, and they expected it should be. To animate them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this dis-heartning the Lord sends vnto them by the hands of this messenger this <hi>Propheticall Promise,</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19936:4"/>
               <hi>Glory, surpassing Glory</hi> to that worke which now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med so despicable in their eyes: that it should not onely match and equalize, but surpasse and transcend the former: <hi>The Glory of the latter house shall be greater then of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the opening vnto you of this <hi>Prophecie,</hi> and that you may see how this promise was afterward accomplished, I shall present vnto you onely these two things. 1. The <hi>Glorie</hi> of the former house. 2. The <hi>Glorie</hi> of the latter house, wherein it so farre surpassed and outstript the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: The <hi>first</hi> was <hi>glorious,</hi> but the latter more <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with the first of these, the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the wonderment of the world whilest it stood. <hi>Glorious things are spoken of thee oh thou citie of God: Glorious things are written of thee oh thou Temple of God:</hi> Canaan the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the earth: Hierusalem the glorie of Canaan; this Temple <hi>the glorie</hi> of Hierusalem: Suppose the whole world a ring, this Temple might well haue beene the iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell in it. The <hi>Glory</hi> of this <hi>Temple</hi> consisted principally in three things: the <hi>building,</hi> the <hi>furniture,</hi> other <hi>appurtenances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. For the <hi>building,</hi> we shall find it stately and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent:<note place="margin">1.</note> What the glory of this building was, we may guesse at it by those infinite (had not the Spirit of truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded it) incredible masses of treasure exhausted in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of materials. That huge Army of <hi>Overseers, Workemen, Carpenters, Masons, Labourers,</hi> all imployed about the cutting and hewing of wood, digging, and squaring, and caruing of stones, amounting in all to the number of one hundred and eighty three thousand three hundred men, besides other curious Artizans for working<note place="margin">1 King. 5.</note> in gold, siluer, brasse, and the like, of all which we may read in that 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5. If euer <hi>Temple made with hands</hi> could haue been worthy to entertaine the God of heauen, it had beene this.</p>
            <p>2. As it was glorious in the <hi>structure,</hi> so no lesse glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious<note place="margin">2.</note>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:19936:5"/>
in the <hi>furniture:</hi> the <hi>inside</hi> answerable and sutable to the <hi>outside.</hi> I can but giue you a glimpse of things. Do but looke into the <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> of God, what euer you touch, what euer you see, is <hi>pure gold:</hi> looke vpon the <hi>vessels,</hi> the <hi>table,</hi> the <hi>Candlestick,</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> the <hi>bowles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 6.</note> 
               <hi>basins, spoones, ashpans, tongs, snuffers,</hi> all nothing but <hi>pure gold:</hi> Looke vpon the <hi>hangings, couerings, vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> all other <hi>vtensiles</hi> requisite for that ceremoniall seruice; behold them all as <hi>rich,</hi> as <hi>curious,</hi> as art and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could make them.</p>
            <p>3. Besides the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>structure,</hi> and the <hi>glory</hi> of<note place="margin">3.</note> the <hi>furniture,</hi> there was yet a greater <hi>glory</hi> in the <hi>Appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances,</hi> some excellent rarities belonging and appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to this temple: of these the Hebrewes reckon ten: I shall content my selfe with fiue, and that to name them.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Arke of the Couenant,</hi> wherein were the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>

            </p>

            <p>3. Here was the <hi>Glory of the Lord</hi> himselfe: the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious presence of God manifested in some cleare and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tokens; a <hi>Transient,</hi> a <hi>Permanent Glory:</hi> the former in the <hi>Cloud</hi> at the dedication of this <hi>Temple,</hi> which so soone as the Priests were come out of the Sanctuary, <hi>filled the house</hi> (as you heard euen now read in that chapter se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected vpon the present occasion, <hi>so that they could not</hi>

               </gap>d Temple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the former. The former temple (according to their computation) stood but foure hundred and ten yeares, the latter foure hundred and twenty. A small ground (if true) from so small a difference in time to raise so great a disparity of glory. Others amongst them, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which way to turne them, against the euidence both of Sacred and Ecclesiasticall Story, peremptorily affirme that this second temple built by <hi>Zerobabel</hi> and the rest of the children of the Captiuitie, was euery way more state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and magnificent then <hi>Salomons.</hi> But then, why should the ancient men weepe? To leaue them, and to plow with our owne heighfers, to consult with our owne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters. Amongst them, some, and those not a few, and those none of the meanest, vnderstand the place <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically</hi> concerning the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ vnder the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Thus <hi>Ambrose, Augustine, Cyrill,</hi> with others, whose names I honour; <hi>Maior erit Ecclesiae gloria quam Synagogae:</hi> Greater shall the glory of the Church of Christ vnder the Gospell be, then the glory of <hi>Salomons</hi> temple, or of the state of the Church vnder the Law was. A pious truth, and perhaps here intended. But for my part, I haue no great delight in hunting after myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, where a more literall sense is brought to hand. Not to hold you in suspense. For the true and full vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this place (as with submission to maturer iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I conceiue it) we must know that the Temple in Hierusalem was thrice built. First, by <hi>Salomon.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by <hi>Zerobabel.</hi> Thirdly, by <hi>Herod.</hi> In the third and last of these Temples was this promise fulfilled, this prophecie accomplished; in <hi>Herods</hi> time built by him in the place of the second temple, about seuenteene yeares before the birth of Christ.</p>

               </gap>y but (by the way) how can that temple be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>this latter house?</hi> The word seemeth to point precisely at that particular building whereof they had then laid the foundations.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:19936:8"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> For the resolution of this, one Expositor (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest) instead of vntying the knot, cuts it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily denying that euer there was such a Temple as this, which is supposed to haue beene built by <hi>Herod;</hi> confidently affirming (though against all euidence both of Scripture and History) that, that Temple which was standing in the time of our Sauiour was the same that <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robabel</hi> and the <hi>Iewes</hi> built after their returne from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:</hi> Thus <hi>Eckius,</hi> a bold, (to say no more) a confident <hi>Papist;</hi> for this very particular condemned by <hi>Ribera</hi> and others of his owne coat, vnder the modest terms of rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and singularity. Others to waue the scruple, they mince the matter; <hi>Herod</hi> (say they) did not erect a new Temple, build it from the ground, but onely repaired and beautified that which was built. But we shall not need to seeke a muse to creepe out at, the way is open. The phrase here vsed in the text, hath no such propriety in it, that it must necessarily be restrained to that particular building, the second Temple, built by <hi>Zerobabel. Salomons</hi> Temple was not the same with this second Temple, and yet we shal find it pointed out by this Prophet by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name <hi>of this house, Who is there left amongst you that saw (this house) in her first glory,</hi> saith he in the fourth verse of this<note place="margin">Hag. 2. 4.</note> Chapter: <hi>This house,</hi> that is, the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the place and stead whereof this second Temple was built. By the same reason this third Temple built by <hi>Herod</hi> in the place of this second Temple, may also be called <hi>This house, This latter house. Forty and six yeares was this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>

                  </gap>0.</note> 
               <hi>in building,</hi> say the Iewes to our Sauiour. <hi>(This Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.)</hi> Diuines are at odds about the interpretation, which Temple it was that is there spoken of. Some vnderstand it of <hi>Herods</hi> Temple, which though it were but eight yeares in building, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> testifieth, yet at this time, when this speech is supposed to haue beene vsed, <hi>viz.</hi> in the yeare of the <hi>Baptisme</hi> of Christ, it had stood precisely forty six yeares; all which time it was still more and more adorned, and beautified, and perfected, and so might
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19936:8"/>
be said to be so long in building. Others, and that the greater number, referre the speech to this second Temple built by <hi>Zerobabel,</hi> which as the computation ariseth, was iust 46 yeares in building. <hi>Herods</hi> Temple was built in the place, instead of this second Temple, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intermission of time, and therefore by the Iewes there, and the Prophet here in a vulgar speech, and that not improperly called <hi>This Temple, This latter house.</hi> Ey, but the question still runs on. How was this <hi>latter house more glorious then the former?</hi> How was <hi>Herods</hi> Temple more glorious then <hi>Salomons?</hi> Here Expositors run two wayes. Some tie themselues to the letter, to the history: interpreting the place of the structure, the building, the outward beauty and glory of this Temple: <hi>Herods</hi> temple (say they) was of statelier building then <hi>Salomons,</hi> higher, larger, fairer, richer; <hi>Ribera</hi> sperds a great deale of time in euincing and clearing of all these particulars. For my part, I am not altogether incredulous but that it might be so. To grant it (as if histories may be credited we must not deny it) yet where was the glory of the <hi>furniture?</hi> There too, (saith <hi>Ribera</hi>) most of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of <hi>Salomons</hi> temple were restored by King <hi>Cyrus</hi> at their returne from <hi>Babylon;</hi> and how euer many of them were afterwards taken away by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Mach 1. 23. 1 Mach. 4. 49.</note> yet they were renewed againe by the <hi>Machabees,</hi> and that as rich, as costly as euer, all of pure <hi>gold.</hi> Suppose this too; yet where were the <hi>apurtenances</hi> that belonged to <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Temple?</hi> Where was the <hi>Arke of the Couenant?</hi> Where was the <hi>heauenly fire?</hi> Where was the <hi>Glory of the Lord?</hi> Where was the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim?</hi> And where was the <hi>succession of Prophets?</hi> All these (by the Hebrewes owne confession) were wanting in this third Temple, as well as in the second. What shall we then thinke, that the life of this promise lieth in the glory of the <hi>structure,</hi> and of the <hi>furniture?</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Caluin,</hi> for his part, is loath in this particular to go along <hi>cum crassis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretibus,</hi> with blunt interpreters, as he there calleth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19936:9"/>
them. I shall spare both the persons and opinion; yet the argument which he there vseth, seemeth to me more then probable. One maine reason why God would not haue the second Temple built in the like pompe and state with the former, was, that he might thereby take off the eyes of his people, and by little and little weane them from that Mosaicall pedagogie; that they might not wholly rest in those externall shadowes of types, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but that they might fix their thoughts rather vpon the <hi>Messias</hi> and the spirituall glory of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. If so; what then shall we iudge of that pompe and cost which was bestowed vpon this third temple by <hi>Herod?</hi> Surely as a subtilty of Sathan (and perhaps of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> himselfe, who was but a halfe-Iew, a Iew for his owne aduantage) that the eyes of the Iewes being dazled with this outward pompe and glory they might looke no further, but that their thoughts might hereby be wholly taken off from looking for, or longing after the promised <hi>Messias.</hi> And if so, then was this cost bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon this last Temple, rather a <hi>profanation</hi> then an <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning</hi> of it: and to the Iewes rather a token of the <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> of God vpon them for their ingratitude, then a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of his grace and fauour. Surely there was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else which made this Temple more glorious, then either the <hi>building</hi> or the <hi>furniture</hi> could make it: Why what was that? To hold you no longer in suspense, briefly, it was <hi>Christ</hi> himself: the <hi>Presence of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Preaching of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Reuelation of Christ,</hi> his manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station in the flesh, the publishing of the glad tidings of saluation, in, by, and through him. Here was the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent glory of this latter Temple. When <hi>Christ the desire of all nations</hi> (as the Prophet stileth him in the seuenth verse of this Chapter) was come, come in the flesh, then was <hi>this house filled with glory.</hi> So it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and so it was accomplished. Then was this house truly glorious, when it intertained him who was the <hi>truth</hi> of all those <hi>types,</hi> the <hi>substance</hi> of all those ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19936:9"/>
               <hi>shadowes</hi> which had made the former house (the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Salomon</hi>) so exceedingly glorious: The time will not giue me that liberty to vnueile <hi>Moses</hi> his face before your eyes. That <hi>Temple</hi> was but a type of his body. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy</hi>

               <hi>this temple,</hi> saith our Sauiour to the Iewes, <hi>He spake of the temple of his body,</hi> saith the Text; of which that temple was a type. What euer there was in that first Temple that made it so glorious, you shall find it all in this latter house, all epitomized in Christ. Here was the <hi>Arke of the Couenant,</hi> the Arke, wood within, ouerlayed within and without with pure gold.

Now that I haue it, I would be loth through straits of time to cast it away without some small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement. I shall be briefe, and onely propound what my purpose was to prosecute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The glory of our Temples is the presence and reuelation</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
               <hi>of Christ. How dreadfull, how fearefull is this place,</hi> (saith the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi>) <hi>surely it is no other but the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 17.</note> 
               <hi>house of God, the gate of heauen.</hi> What was it that struck the holy Patriarch with such an awfull dread and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the place where he was, being but in the wide open field? Why, it was the presence and manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him whom that <hi>ladder</hi> signified; the eternall Sonne of God the Mediatour of the Couenant, whose office it is to <hi>reconcile things in heauen, and things vpon earth,</hi> God

and man, as that ladder vnited heauen and earth: He it was who was pleased at that time and in that place to manifest his presence by some visible tokens, and that manifestation it was which made that place (though in the open field) dreadfull, fearefull, glorious: It is this presence of Christ that maketh a place first to be the house of God, and then that house <hi>glorious.</hi> Ey but how<note place="margin">

Why he is present after a spirituall manner, in the midst of his publique ordinances; in the <hi>Word,</hi> in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Where Christ is truly <hi>preached,</hi> there is he truly <hi>present:</hi> present with the Ministers, present with the people.

               <hi>end of the world,</hi> they are the last words of our Sauiour to his Apostles and their successours. With the people: <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name,</hi> &amp;c. Christ is truly present in all places, but in the <hi>midst of the seuen golden candlestickes he walkes,</hi> he is present after a speciall manner, with speciall assistance, with a speciall euidence of his Spirit, a speciall declaration of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, there is <hi>his arme reuealed.</hi> As in the Word, so in the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> there is he present, though not locally, yet truly, yet spiritually, (pardon the word) really present to the faith of the receiuer: And this is the glory of our Temples, a spirituall glory, consisting in the spirituall presence of Christ in the midst of his publique ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
            <p>It must needs be so. Glory (to speake properly) it is<note place="margin">R.</note> nothing else but an opinion of some excellency or worth, conceiued by others to be in such, or such a thing: Now if glory be measured by opinion, then is this spirituall glory (<hi>The Glory.</hi>) It is so in the estimation both of God and his Saints.</p>
            <p>First, For God himselfe, there is no Temple glorious in his eye where this Spirituall glory is wanting. Be the

building, the outside, the inside what it will, he regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it not, he dwels not in it. So much in expresse words Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth those superstitious Athenians;<note place="margin">Act. 17. 24.</note> where beholding their blind deuotion in erecting of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and such other ceremoniall externall obseruances; he tels them plainely, that <hi>God who made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heauen and earth, he dwelleth not in temples made with hands:</hi> Be the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple what it will, if there be no more in it but the worke of mens hands, God dwels not there, he delighteth not in it. True indeed, God did once dwell in a materiall temple betwixt the Cherubins, but wherfore was it? the Ark was there. God doth at this day dwel in the places of his publike worship and seruice, but wherfore is it? Why, the Assemblies of his Saints, his publique ordinances are there. It is this spirituall worship and seruice which God delighteth to be entertained w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Time was indeed when externall rites, and ceremoniall obseruances seemed to be in great request with God. They were not onely a means,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 23.</note> but a part of his worship; vnder the Gospell it is not so. <hi>The time commeth, and now is</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>when the true worshippers shal worship the Father in spirit &amp; in truth; for the father requireth euen such to worship him.</hi> It is this Spirit &amp; Truth in holy performances, the spirituall maner of worshipping God, that maketh seruices, persons, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be accepted of him: And this it is that made not onely this Temple, but euery Synagogue in Hierusalem, nay that maketh euery Temple vnder the Gospell more glorious in the eyes of God, then the Temple of <hi>Salomon</hi> was; <hi>Salomon in all his royalty is not as one of these</hi> (saith our Sauiour concerning the Lillies) his beauty was artificiall, theirs was natural. <hi>Salomon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Temple in al the royalty of it was not as one of <hi>these,</hi> these <hi>Temples,</hi> these <hi>Synagogues,</hi> these <hi>Churches,</hi> where Christ is plainely and powerfully preached, published, offred, applied in the word &amp; Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There was a Ceremoniall, here is a spiritual glory.</p>
            <p>And secondly, As in the eyes of God, so in the eyes of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19936:11"/>
his Saints, this spirituall glory is (<hi>The Glory</hi>) what so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an obiect in the eyes of a Christian as Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, especially when he is reuealed? <hi>A light to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 32.</note> 
               <hi>to the Gentiles, and (the glory) of his people Israel;</hi> so old <hi>Simeon</hi> stileth him. This is (<hi>the glory</hi>) in the eyes of a Christian, when Christ is reuealed to his soule pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, effectually in the publique ministery of the word. So great is the glory of Christ crucified in the preaching of the word, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cannot but wonder, that his <hi>Galathians</hi> before whose eyes Christ had beene thus <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified</hi> in his <hi>Preaching</hi> of him, should be so farre bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to looke off from it, as to looke after any thing els,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 1.</note> but Christ and the doctrine of Christ. <hi>O foolish Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who hath bewitched you? Gal.</hi> 3. 1. No glory like vnto this, when the veile is taken off, not from <hi>Moses</hi> his face, but from the face of Iesus Christ himselfe in the publique Ministry of the word: This (blessed be God that we may speake it without either feare or flattery) is the glory of our Temples. Children it may be are in loue with their bookes for the guilded couers, for the babies and pictures sake; it is the matter that men of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing looke at. Poore, blind, ignorant soules, whose deuotion is nothing but superstition, may be in loue with the Temple for the painting, caruing, guilding, dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but that which maketh it truly glorious in the eyes of God, and his Saints, is the glory of the latter Temple, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> spirituall worship of God, the presence and reuelation of Christ in his publike ordinances. The time concludes me, I must obey. That w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> remains is a word of application.</p>
            <p>I might in the first place from this ground take a iust<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> occasion to discouer and taxe that childish superstition of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in their preposterous adornati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Temples. Let none anticipate my intentions, or through preiudice either mistake my words, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construe my meaning) I haue nothing to say against the decent beautifying of the places of Gods publique wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. In this case I should rather make vse of a spurre
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19936:12"/>
then a bridle, if the time would permit; It is the shame of our nation in many parts of it (if I could hide it, I would not discouer it) the houses of God seeme to lie neglected, waste, ruinous, as if neither God nor man dwelt in them, or had any reference to them; we may without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie write vpon the doores of them (<hi>Ichabod</hi>) there is no glory, no beauty, no decency, neither in the outside, nor yet in the inside. I would to God the foule mouthes of the <hi>Romanists</hi> were not too iustly opened against vs in this quarrell; but yet our negligence is no plea for their preposterousnesse. What is it that they account the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test glory of their Temples? Stately and goodly edifices, vast and magnificent buildings, built rather for the eye, then the eare; state then vse; Rich and costly furniture, Curious pictures, Images, Crucifixes, Altars, Chalices, Vestments; rare apurtenances, shrines, monuments, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. This is the glory which the eyes of the greatest part amongst them are dazled with: Little account in the meane time do they make of this glory of the latter Temple, the <hi>Preaching of Christ.</hi> Perhaps a little in this <note n="*" place="margin">Lent.</note> season of the yeare, to which all their holinesse is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: The <hi>Passion</hi> of Christ shall be acted now and then in a pulpit, rather then preached. All the yeare after their Churches may preach to the eye (as indeed all their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is but <hi>eye-seruice</hi>) but little to the eare, lesse to the heart. For our parts, far be it from vs to enuy them this their glory. If it must needs be so that the golden Chalices and the golden Priests must be diuided, that they cannot go together, let them take the Chalices so we may haue the Priests. They were Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> three wishes to see <hi>Rome in her pride, Christ in the flesh,</hi> and <hi>Saint Paul in a pulpit;</hi> giue vs the two latter of these in a good sense in our Temples, let Rome still keepe her pride to her selfe. <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple I am sure might compare with the best of theirs in their owne kind, and yet <hi>the glory of the latter house was greater, then of the former.</hi>

Outward, externall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the house of God, so they be decent, comely, not subiect to occasion superstition in the beholder, or distraction in the hearers, they are not onely lawfull, but laudable. But the chiefe ornaments in which the glory of our Temples lies, are the speciall ornaments. Will you know what they are in particular, go along with me a

little into the Sanctuary of God. There we shall find three principall peeces of furniture; A <hi>Table,</hi> an <hi>Altar,</hi> a <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticke:</hi> A <hi>table</hi> for the <hi>shew-bread,</hi> with twelue loaues vpon it, signifying the twelue tribes of Israel presenting themselues before the Lord. An <hi>altar</hi> for the incense signifying the prayers of the Saints, which being offered vp vnto God in and through the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ, ascend vp as the incense, euen a <hi>sweet smelling sauour vnto God.</hi> The <hi>Candlesticke,</hi> signifying the <hi>Word,</hi> which is a <hi>lampe,</hi> a <hi>light</hi> for the guidance and direction of the people of God. Behold here the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ornaments wherewith the Sanctuary, the house of God should be furnished, when the Tribes come vp and present themselues before the Lord, when the people of God assemble together in a solemne manner: An <hi>Altar,</hi> a <hi>Candlesticke: Prayer,</hi> The <hi>word:</hi> the word <hi>Read, Preached.</hi> For my part, I dare not take away the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> from the <hi>Candlesticke.</hi> Let none dare to go about to take away the <hi>Candlesticke</hi> from the <hi>Altar. Prayer</hi> and the <hi>Word,</hi> God hath ioyned them together, let no man diuorce or put them asunder. Other apurtenances there were; amongst the rest, the <hi>Pincers,</hi> the <hi>Snuffers.</hi> The one to pinch of the mould from the loaues; the other to snuffe the lights. The Censures of the Church are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sometimes vsefull, needfull, and that to be applied to the Ministers as well as to the people, as the loaues haue need of the <hi>pincers,</hi> so the light of the <hi>snuffers,</hi> to make them burn the clearer. But the chief and the principal pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of furniture in the house of God which are of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall vse when the tribes meet together, are the <hi>Altar</hi> and the <hi>Candlesticke; Prayer</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> read, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: To these two adde but a third: <hi>viz. the seales of the Couenant, the Sacraments of the New Testament,</hi> the one of <hi>Initiation,</hi> the other of <hi>Confirmation; Baptisme,</hi> the <hi>Supper of the Lord,</hi> rightly and duly administred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christs owne institution, then haue we the house of God in respect of the spirituall ornaments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleately
