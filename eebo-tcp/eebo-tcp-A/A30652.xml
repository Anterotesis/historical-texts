            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ALbeit the unbounded liberty of the preſs, may ſufficiently war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant my neceſſary undertaking; and that a modeſt, and needful Apologie, free from all paſſion, or unlawful Aymes, may hee, by an ordinary charity excuſed; if not fully juſtifyed; yet I had not run the hazard of the publique ſenſure being conſcious of my owne incapacity, had I not been in need thereunto by ſome reaſonable preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that the end of my misfortunes (which can finde no other period) and that of my life, neerly approches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Neither had this alone prevailed with mee; unleſs conſtrain'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the injuſt and (to any ingenious nature) moſt inſupportable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and Calomnies, of ſome, who are totally ignorant of the truth of my affaires; nor have ever had the leaſt provocation, on my part, to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the cruelty of their ſecret practiſes, and obſcure proceedings againſt mee, to the endangering of my life, even ſince I came in this Province of Freesland; which (next the protection of God) I, thinke has been chiefly preſerved by my neglecting it: I not being ignorant of my danger, nor of the cauſes thereof, which I ſaw no certaine meanes of preventing, but by flight, disguiſe, and concealment; which I have ever through the whole cours of my great troubles, been reſolved againſt; chuſing rather to dye once, if I could not fairly defend my ſelfe; then live in fear of dying always: Eſpecially having a long time, conſidered death (if not in a dishonourable way) as the only end of my calamities, which I could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably hope for, and my moſt ſure azile.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No leſs have their ſiniſter and malitious practices, contributed to the traverſing of my fortune, which (I am perſuaded) had not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, been thus long deſolate and obſcure: by encreaſing the jalouſies, and indignation of ſome; who I have never willingly offended; nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then through the inſupportable neceſſity of my affaires heeretofore; and the indiſpenſable compulſions of honour; which would not permit me to doe what I might) and moſt others would) have done: nor to have left undone, what in policy, and the general practice of mankind, I ought to have avoided, as eſſentially needful to my intereſts, and to the raiſing me, out of this ſepulcher, wherein I have for ſome years lain buried alive;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48408:3"/>
which peradventure I ſhould not have come ſhort of, had I not been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly calomniated, and circumvented, by underground, darck, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow'd (or rather never to bee avowed) mines, and traines, which in ſome kind, have not a little contributed, to the rendring my wounds incurea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as well in England as elswhere.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This being really my caſe, is alſo the ſole cauſe, why I am enforced to expoſe my diſcreation to the capritious ſenſure of critiques, rather then to abandone my honour, by a womaniſh modeſty, timiditie and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: leaving theſe perſons triumphant in their victorie, which they have atchived by indirect, and moſt unjuſt means, I am not ignorant, what wrongs have been done mee, by whom, and how; but know I ſhall never be openly accuſed, and by conſequence, not have any occaſion of vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating my ſelfe, but by this means, to which onely I can have recourſe, and although, I am far from all hope of recovering what I have loſt; yet I ſhall endeavour to let ſome ſee demonſtratively, how far their credulity has been abuſed, and my innocency wrong'd; which I can no otherwiſe performe, then by declaring truly, and ſincerely, what I have done, or not done; leaving it to the judgment, and ſentence, of all unprejudiced, and unpaſſionate perſons, to what degree I have been either unfortunate, or criminel.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What my transactions have been in ſome great conjonctures, I ſhall be as ſincere and candid in; as if my eternal happineſs, or miſery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the truth, or falſehood, of what I here expoſe, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon view: which I onely make publique for the vindication of my honour, though I clearly foreſee, my intereſt may ſuffer by it; which weighs ſoe little with mee, that if this adventure meets but with a charitable reception from good men, and unpreoccupied; I beleeve (as far as I know my ſelf) I ſhall not be much troubled, if my death ſhould prove immediately after the Epilogue, to this tragedy.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T 17. years of age, I began to ſerve the late King of happy memory, Charles the-Firſt, being ancient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Lord Aſhley, General Major of the Army, in the firſt expedition againſt the Scots; an Accord was made as other agreements in thoſe times, of very ſhort continuance; for the ſpring following, the war was the ſecond time declared in that expedition, I was firſt Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in the Regiment of Colonel Henry Wentworth, brother to the Earl of Cleveland; ſhortly after, a Compagnie falling vacant in the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, by the favour of the King I obtain'd it. In the ſpace of a year the peace was again made, and the Armies disbanded. The war betwixt the King and the Parliament followed ſhortly after; I continued in his Majeſties intereſt and ſervice; I commanded the Regiment of the late Duke of Somerſent, at that time Marqueſs of Hartford. Generall for the King in the Weſterne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the firſt incounter, which Arrived betwixt his Majeſties and the Parlaments forces; I was hurt and taken Priſoner; brought ſo to London, by the late Lord Hollis, at that tyme Colonel under the Parlament. Not long after, being at liberty; the King honnoured mee with a Commiſſion, for a Regiment; not being at that tyme, full twenty years old: having levied it, I returned to Oxford, where his Majeſty held his court. Few days after, his Hyghneſs Prince Robbert, gave me a Commiſſion, which he had procured of the King; to be Governour of Malmesbury; whereof I knew not any thing, before he was pleaſed to deliver it mee. About the month of April following; his Majeſty ſent mee order (being preſſed for troupes) to march with three Regiments of foote, and as many Compag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of horſe, to Joyne his Army; for the relief of Reading; beſieged by the Earle of Eſſex; and was rendered by Colonel Fielding, at the ſame tyme the King arrived there; which might greatly have endangered his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; had the Enemy ſeen, and made uſe of their advantage.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the month of June following, his Majeſtie ſent Prince Maurits, and the Duke of Somerſet with an Army into the weſt, whereof my Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was part; to Joyne with My Lord Hopton, and Lord Berkeley; who had beaten the Parlements forces, Commanded by the Earle of Stamford, not long before, in the Province of Cornwell, the Conjunction was made; the towns of Weymouth (whereof the late Earl of Shaffsbury was left
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48408:4"/>
Gouvernour) Taunton, and Bridwater being taken, and garriſons placed in them; the body of the Army Marched, towards Generall Waller, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing firſt deſpatched my Lord Berkelay, with four Regiments of foote, and ſome few troupes of horſe, to blocque up Exeter, to prevent the Earl of Stamfords raiſing of forces in Devonshire. Who was Generall in the Weſt for the Parlament; but after the Battaile of Stratton reduced to the Gouvernment of that Citty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The firſt day, wee came before it; the Enemy deſpiſing our ſmall Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; ſillied out, with a very conſiderable party; but was vigorously repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, beaten, and ſome of their out worcks, and the ſouth ſubburbs poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed; which by reaſon of our want of Amunition; and our few forces wee quitted of our own accord, very many of their men where killed, and taken priſoners. The ſiege continued about twoe months: the Parlement endeavoured twice to ſuccour it, once by land, from plimouth, and Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth; which where ſurpriſed in their march, beaten and totally Diſſipated.</p>
            <p>Secondly by ſea, with the Parlaments fleet, commanded by the Earl of Warwich, having two thowſand ſouldiers aboarde, which he deſigned to land at Apſom, under the favour of his Cannon; but was prevented by our ſinking (the night before) divers veſſels with ſtones in the Channel. He endeavoured to land at other places on the ſtrand, in his long Botes; but was always repulſed with loſs, one of his ſhips was fired by us; another ſo raked through, by our Cannon; that they were Conſtrayned to fire it themſelves, not able to bring it of.</p>
            <p n="5">5. About this time Briſtol was taken by the Kings forces. Prince Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits arrived before Exeter, with about 3000 Cornish foote, and ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe; having viewed all the quarters, and Approches; reſolved on an Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que; by the ſouth gate; which was Committed to Colonel Chudly, and mee; with 2000 men, the manner left to our ſelves, at the place where wee intended to fall on; the enemy had twoe out guards, advanced from the ſouthgate, the diſtance of muſquet ſhot, of about 3 or 400 men; with a line of communication from the port, to the out works, which, wee could perceive was but ſlightly mand; wee reſolved with fire locks, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kemen, with piſtols by their ſydes; that light matches ſhould not diſcover our deſigne; to march ſilently an hower before break of day, to aſſault the line jointly, by way of ſurpriſe: he on the left hand neat the outguarde, I on the right, neer the port; hopeing thereby (if ſucceſs full) to cut of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48408:4"/>
the retreat of the Enemy, which wee did; by this meanes all in the out work, were either killed, or taken. Whereupon wee Lodged our ſelves under the wall, reaſnably wel couvered; ſoe neer the port that they durſt not attempt à ſally: in this condition and conſternation; they beat a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, deſired a treaty, ſent out hoſtages; Sir Richard Cave and I, were employed to treat, and had the place rendered even on our owne tearmes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Having refreſhed the Army, twelve or fourteen days, the Prince marched to Dartmouth, though late in the year, to begin a ſiege; before the ſeveral Quarters were fully fixed, his Highneſs; the Earl of Marborow, General of the Artillery, &amp;c. and Major General Baſſet, fell all three at one ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me dangerouſly ſick, which cauſed diſorder and delay; the greateſt part of the Officers were inclined to raiſe the ſiege, and retire the Army into Winter-quarters: Sir Richard Cave, Colonel Chudley, and my ſelfe oppoſed it, and wrote to My Lord Berkeley, (who was Gouvernour as well or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, as of Exeter) to come to the Army; at whoſe arrival reſolution was taken to attacque the Town in two places: Colonel Chudley, and my ſelfe were ordered (as at exeter) to aſſault one poſt, in divers places, he entered the firſt, beat the Enemy out of ſome Workes, but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately killed, his Troupes were repulſed; thoſe I commanded en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered likewiſe, drove them from all their outworks, which was their chief ſtrenght in that quarter; and commanded the Towne, which immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely treated, and rendered: whereof Colonel Seymour was made Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Towards the end of October, the King ſent order to my Lord Berckely, to diſpatch mee with my own Regiment, and what other trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes he could ſpare, with all expedition, to joyne with my Lord Hoptons Army, for the relief of Baſing, then beſieged by Sir William Waller. I was immediately ſent away with a Brigade of Foot, conſiſting of his Lordſhips Sir William Courtenays (not he of Devonſhire, but another of the ſame name) Sir John Acklands, Colonel Strangeways, and my own Regiment: with three troupes of Horſe: I joyned my Lord Hoptons Army; Baſing was relieved, Waller retired, incamped advantagiouſly under <hi>Farnham</hi> Caſtel; General Hopton followed him; preſented him Battaile; the one would not diſlodge, nor the other attacque him as he lay; the day following, a Councel of war was held, about the beginning of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, where it was reſolved, that the Amy ſhould ſeparate into four Brigades, and retire to Winter-quarters, one with my Lord Hopten to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48408:5"/>
Wincheſter, another under Sir Charles <hi>Vavaſour</hi> to Alsford, a third commanded by Colonel Boles to Alton, the fourth with mee to Peters<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, the Horſe were divided accordingly, a party with every Brigade of Foote, whereof I had with mee Sir Edward Stowels Regiment of Cavalle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Sir Edward Fords, Sir Edward Biſhops, four Troupes of my Lord Bellaſis his Regiment, commanded by his Major Bovel, with the three Troupes which came with mee out of Devonſhire. One preſent at the Councel, declared his opinion, that it was dangerous to divide the Army into ſo many open quarters, whileſt Sir William Wallers remained in one entire Bodie, ſince he could in one night (as his cuſtome was to march) force any of the neereſt to him, before the others could be advertiſed, joine, and ſuccour the quarter aetacqued; this comming from a verry youngman was neglected as of no moment, though the conſequence, ten days after, made it appeare, as one of Caſſandra's predictions, which though always true, were never believed, till accompliſhed, or paſtremedy.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Four of five days after, my Lord Berkeley arrived at my quarter, from Oxford, bringing with him Sir William Butler his Regiment of Horſe, with the Kings commands, to march incontinently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Arundel, to take it if poſſible. I marched all tueſday with the Horſe, and as many Muſquetiers as I could mount, being favoured by a great miſt, without any diſcovery, about four of the clock, wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning, wee ſurpriſed, and forced the Towne; the greateſt part of the Enemie retired into the Caſtel, which was rendered the Saturday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (when my foote came up) that the Souldiers ſhould goe whither they would, leaving all Armes, and Amunition, both of war, and mouth hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in three or four days, given the neceſſary orders, touching the defence of the Town and Caſtel; I left Sir Edward Ford there, with 400.

Men, out of Kent, whileſt I was ſeeking another forde, where I might paſs the River with more conveniencie then in the face of the Enemy; my Lord Hopton by an Expreſs, ſent mee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, that the General Waller (as was foreſeen, and foretold) marching all the night from Farnham, to Alton, had forced that quarter, about breake of day, killed Colonel Boles who commanded the Brigade, and all the ſoldjers either out of, or taken priſonners, and totaly diſſipated
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48408:5"/>
the Earl of Crawfords Brigade of horſe, which misfortune had ſoe weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Army, that he could not hinder the enemies progreſs, which he was perſuaded would be for the recovery of Arundel, before it could be provided of all things, neceſſary for its defence; which he recommended to mee with great earneſtneſs, deſiring mee to keep what forces I thought needful for the place, and to ſend back Sir William Butler, with the reſt, to join his Army; aſſuring mee, that if I were beſieged, he would relieve mee in eight days; exſpecting ſuddainely forces from Oxford.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I retain'd neer 800 Foote, with the four Companies of my Lord Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſis Regiment of Horſe, and my own Troupe; ſending back all I could, under the Command of Sir William Butler; in leſs then four and twenty howers after, General Wallers Army appeared before the Town, which I reſolved to defend, as long as I could; and in caſe of neceſſitie to retire to the Caſtel, it was aſſaulted in three places, and no fortifications, but the ruines of an old wal, and without it (at ſome diſtance) a more ancient Line, and Ditch; but without Flanque; where I judged they might be moſt uſeful, I placed Major Bovel with his horſe; and perceiving not far from mee, that a conſiderable bodie of the enemies Foot had paſſed the Line, with eight or ten blew Collours, which were of Sir Arthur Haſelrigs Regiment, commanded by Colonel Birch (who I think ſtill lives) and began to range themſelves in order; I deſired Major Bovel to charge them with me, for if we brake them not, the Caſtle might be loſt as well as the town; we charg'd, routed, and drove them back over the Line: Colonel Birch was (as I remember) wounded in the bellie, and one Captaine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del caſting himſelf amongſt the dead bodies (as if kill'd) was diſcover'd, and taken priſoner: my horſe was ſhot with a musket-bullet in the hip, and fell with mee; I had (aparently) been killed, unleſs reſcued by ſome Officers of my Lord Bellaſis Regiment. Another poſt where Major Flet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher commanded, was forced; he dangerouſly wounded, and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; with great difficulty wee retired into the Caſtel, where the Enemie thought to have entered with us, but was repulſed.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In theiſe conflicts many were kill'd on both ſides. I found means to advertiſe the King of the ſtate of the place, both as to its ſtrenght Amunition, and Victual; of the twoe laſt wee were very ill provided, by reaſon of the ſuddaineſs of the ſiege, as ſoon it was taken. I receiv'd aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from his Majeſtie, that within ten, or twelve days, I ſhould be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48408:6"/>
if I could defend it ſo longe, which was (in ſome manner) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, but ſucceeded not. I held it out five and twenty days, to great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, it was rendered by the Councel of War, upon quarter for life: I never ſigned the Capitulation, and might have been deny'd the benefit of the Articles, and quarter, had General Waller been cruel. Of above 900 Officers, and Souldiers, Horſe and Foote, which I retain'd before the ſiege; few more then 200 marehed out, the reſt either killed, or dead of the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy flux, and ſpotted feavour; with the firſt whereof I was my ſelfe attac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued, as ſoon as recovered; I was ſent priſoner upon my parolle to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, without guards, were rendering my ſelfe; I was committed to the Tower; remaining there about ſix months, until I had libertie from the Earl of Eſſex, to procure the freedom of Sir Ellis Layton (at that time Colonel of horſe under the Parliament) and of one Whyte, Capitain in the ſame Regiment, in Exchange, or to return again to the Tower within eight and twenty days.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The King granted their libertie, as ſoon as I arrived at Oxford, where I ſtayd but two days, and went poſt to Exeter by his Majeſties commands, having diſpatcht my affaires, for which I was ſent, I returned towards Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; on the way I underſtood, that the Earl of Eſſex, and General Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, were before it, the King brake through them, with what forces he had and retired to Worcheſter; Waller followed him: Eſſex halted ſome time at Burford, neer which, in my way; I fell into a ſmall party of ſtragling Souldjers, without any Officer; I told them I had the Earl of Eſſex his paſs for 28. days; that not more then halfe the time was expired, and was therefore free; that ſatisfyed them not; I was unwilling to be taken ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving papers of importance, and cyfers in my cloths, and ſadle; I was wounded in my left eye, and in danger to have loſt it by the blowe of a piſtol, which had been fyred in vaine; I was made priſonner, brought to Eſſex, who cauſed me to be dreſſed by his Chirurgeon for 2 or 3 days, and ſet me at libertie, according to my paſs: I went to Oxford, where I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till cured, and then returned to Exeter.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Prince Maurits, who had allways honoured mee with his favour, in whoſe ſervice I had not been unlucky, employed mee in his Army; the Earl of Eſſex marched Weſtward, whereof his Highneſs being advertiſed, roſe from before Plymouth, and ſtrengthned with 2000 Cornish men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to march to Exeſter, and there encampe, under the ſhelter of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48408:6"/>
Town, and River, to keep himſelf from the neceſſitie of a Battaile, being very inferior in number to the Enemy; the ſame day the Prince marched from Okhampton, the Earl in the evening arrived at Tiverton, we at Kirton; ſome Quarter-maſters of both Armies encountered, to make quarters in the ſame places; which was the firſt advertiſſement wee had, where he was; and I believe he knew as little of us: upon the allarme the Prince diſpatched mee with a thouſand Foote, and ſome Horſe, in the night to poſſeſs Exbridg, leaſt the enemie ſhould have been before hand; I did it, and caſt up a breſt worke. His Highneſs followed with the Armie; the Earl perſued his march to Pliemouth, and thence into Cornwel; leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prince, which ſeem'd ſtrange to moſt. I conjectured at his reaſon, and found ſhortly after, that I had not divined amiſs, but the recite is long, and here needleſs.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The very ſame day, his Highneſs received an Expreſs from the King in Cypher, whereby he was advertiſed, that his Majeſty had beaten Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Armie, at Croplie Bridg, and was on his march to joyne both Armies in the Weſt, if poſſible: His Majeſtie not knowing certainly, whither our Armie was come Eaſtward of Eſſex or not, thus unknown to either, things where in as good a poſture, as if concerted; the Prince ſent mee immediately to the King, with an account of all.</p>
            <p n="14">14. I met his Majeſtie in march towards chard, being joined, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie followed Eſſex; wee would have come to a bataille, he not; wee encamped neer together; wee had dayly ſcermiſhes; our deſigne was to ſtreigthen them for victuals; at the end of about 14. days, his horſe broke through Eaſtward, under Lieutenant General Balfourd, the Foote diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted their poſt a while, and then capitulated, to leave their Arms, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, Artillerie, Ammunition, and Bagage, and to march away with cudgels onely. Eſſex embarqued himſelf at Foy, this blemiſhed his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and ſhortly after loſt him the Generalat.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The King marched towards Oxford, in his way thither was forced to the ſecond battaile of Newbury, were his Armie was ſomething unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and had been more ſoe, if the jealouſies (or rather the Diametrally oppoſite principles, and aimes) of the Chiefs of the Enemie, had not at that time (in ſome kinde) favoured his Majeſtie.</p>
            <p n="16">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48408:7"/>16. The Winter following, the whole model of the Parliaments Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was changed, the Earles of Mancheſter, Eſſex, and General Waller put out: Fairfax made General, Cromwel Leutenant General, and the officers and ſouldiers compoſing the Niew Armie; for the moſt part (if not all) at Cromwels devotion, almoſt all confiderable perſons of the Preſbiterean partie put out. The King had for the following ſomer aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, rather a good then a great Armie, betwixt which (deſpiſing the new model) and that of the Parliament, was fought that fatal battaile of Naesby, where his Majeſtie loſt his Armie, and as the unfortunate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence thereof, not long after, his Crown and Life.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The King being returned to Oxford the Winter following, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd me to London (Sir John Bamfield haveing procured me a paſs to returne thither) to penetrate as far as was poſſible, into the deſignes of the two parties in the Parliament, in relation to his Majeſties Perſon and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. I wanted neither means, nor aſſiduitie, to performe what I was commanded. I found the one very ſevere in their principles, as wel to the Civile, as Eccleſiaſtical Gouvernment: the other which was influenced entirely by Cromwel, reſolved (and labouring) to change and deſtroye both; I clearly ſawe, by Joyning, with the firſt, the roote of monarchy, was to be preſerved, and did believe, the branches would againe growe out: to truſt the latter, I ſaw no reaſnable ground; what ever the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of ſome amongſt them were; in their ſecret Correſpondency with perſons, of great quality, and no leſs credit about the King.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The Bulke of the party, and the leading men (as I knew, always ſayd; and writ both to the King himſelfe, and divers others of the greateſt quality; ſome whereof yet live) were reſolved upon an entire ſubverſion of monarchie, and the Eſtabliſhment of a new Gouernment.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Having (as I thought) light ſufficient, to make theſe twoe points, as Clear, as by a Mathematical demonſtration; I deſguiſed my ſelfe, in my Groomes Clothes; and went with the Tame Carrier to that Towne; and thence on foote to Oxford; where I Entered in the Evening, without being knowne to any; onely the Captaine of the guard cauſed me to be brought to Sir Thomas Glemham, who was then Gouvernour; but I was ſo diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he knew me not; I tould him in private that I came from London about ſome affayres which Concerned his Majeſtie; deſiring him to appoint
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48408:7"/>
me to ſome convenient place; where I might be private; and that he would ſend one of his ſervants to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Oudart (who at that tyme was Under-Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to Sir Edward Nicolas principale Secretary of State) to come to me; which he Immediately did, and returned forthwith, to acquaint the King with my arival, who ſent him back, with his commands to put the heads of what I had to ſay to him in wryting, that he might have time to conſider of it, and would ſpeak with me (at large) the night following; in the day, it being almoſt impoſſible, without diſcovery.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Accordingly, about eight of the clock, the next evening, I was brought where his Majeſty was; none being preſent but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Secretary Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas; the Duke of York; came in for a moment to receive his fathers Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, before his going to his reſt. The King debated at large Every point, and circumſtance, contained in my memorial; being at that tyme fully convinced that he could not exſpect any thing, but ruine from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and there adherents in the Parlament; giving me newe inſtructions, concerning divers eminent perſons, of the Presbiterean party, with letters to two of the Chief; and to a great and a wiſe Lady, who was in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary credit, and had much influence upon the transactions of thoſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. His Majeſtie commanded me to acquaint the Queen, from tyme to tyme, with all that paſſed betwixt him, and me, and of all my transactions concerning his ſervice; which I could better doe from London, then he from Oxford, which I did performe, by a conſtant Correſpondence, with the Earle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Albans, during the ſpace of about three Years, untill I was commanded out of England for other ſervices.</p>
            <p n="21">21. The King having charged me, with new Inſtructions, letters, and all things expedient for his ſervice, diſpatched me againe to London: when Imediately upon my arrivall I ſpake with thoſe, to whom his Majeſtie had written; two whereof where unwilling to receive their letters; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to hear them read; and after to ſee the hand, and ſignature; which they knew to have been all his owne.</p>
            <p n="22">22. By theſe means, ſome where gained by publique, others by their owne particular Intereſts: a few, who had been his Majeſties menial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and in his favour; I thinke repented really what they had done; and reſolved to efface. What had paſſed, by their future fidelity</p>
            <p n="23">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48408:8"/>23. But much the greateſt part where brought about, through the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, that the power of the Army, which dayly encreaſed, would overgrow the authorithy of Parliament; treading under foote all lawes, and conſtitutions changing the Gouverment, and Gouvernours; as frequently as the Pretorian Chohorts, did that of Rome, whereby the publique miſeries, of the preceding civile war, might prove but the prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue to the following tragedy; Anarchy, uſurpation, and tyranny; which begun, was nouriſhed, and ended in blood: as the whole world, has been witneſs of.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Not long after, I had left the King at Oxford; the Army having reduced, all the reſt of the Nation (ſome few places excepted) marched towards that Citty, to beſiege both his Majeſtie and it; who being reſolved not to fall into their hands, as long as he could avoyde it, was conſtrained to ſave himſelf diſguiſed in an Eccleſiaſticall habit: which was the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he could aſſume who not long after, ſacrificed his life, for the maintaining of that profeſſion; which he was fully convinced, was of Apoſtolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and had ſworne at his Coronation to upholde; as it had been eſtablished by law, at the firſt ſolid reformation under the Reigne of Queen Eliſabeth, who though a moſt Zealous Proteſtant; and the greateſt pillar of the reformed Religion, throuwghout all Chriſtendome; could never be induced upon any conſideration, to the taking away of the Epiſcopal fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="25">25. The King haveing for that tyme, thus Eſcaped; threw himſelf upon the Scotish Army, which then beſieged Newarke; and upon the rendering of the Place, was conducted to New Caſtle: Whither (Imediately at his arrivall) he ſent me his commands to Come with all diligence: haveing obeyed, his Majeſtie was Pleaſed to Acquaint me, with the State of his affaires, with the Scots; Whoſe conduct towards him, had not Given him the Satiſfaction, which he reaſnably hoped for when he had volonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, betaken him ſelfe to them, for Refuge in his diſtreſs: haveing heard all I had to repreſent, concerning the affaires at London, wich could any ways relate to his perſon, or Intreſt; ſince his Eſcape from Oxford: he commanded me, to make a ſhort deduction of all, in writing to leave with him, for the refreshment of his Memory.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Haveing remained there a few days: his Majeſtye was pleaſed to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48408:8"/>
truſt me with new Inſtructions, according to the change, and Exigence of his affaires; and to diſpatch me back to London.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Not long after I receaved a Letter from him by an expreſs whome he eminently truſted, to whoſe Information, he referd me chiefly in the following termes.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

            <p n="28">28. Part of this Buſineſs needs not to bee mentioned Heere, being in ſome Kinde particular; relating to what degree two or three perſons, might, or might not be truſted, and in what Maters: but the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall thereof was, to Engage the Earl of Eſſex, the Earl of Holland, My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord Willoby of Parham, with ſeverall others of both houſes; ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the Buſineſs; by their owne, and frends credit: that the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Parliament, which were reſolved, ſhould be drawne up (upon his Maj. meſſage a litle before, preſſing earneſtly a treaty) migt be as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, as poſſible Could be Procured; and that ſuch commiſſioners (by the influence of theiſe perſons, might be choſen to compile them, as neer the model, which his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. had given in writing, to the perſon all ready mentioned, as Could be effected.</p>
            <p n="29">29. The buſineſs was communicared, where it was moſt convenient: but the ſudaine death of the Earle of Eſſex, throwgh an appoplexy, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the propoſitions more harsh, and difficult; then peradventure they would have been, had he lived; whoe was animated; reſolute; would hazard more then all the others; had credit; and was every moment inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48408:9"/>
by the influence, and perſuations of his ſiſter, the late Dutcheſs of Somerſet.</p>
            <p n="30">30. However, Cromwell, the army, and their adherents in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fearing the very poſſibility of the Kings aſſent; in that extremity of his affaires: and by conſequence, the fruſtration of their deſigns, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ading to the deſtruction of his perſon, and the ſubverſion of Monarchy; Employd all the artifices Imaginable, to have the King deſpoſed to reject entirely, the propoſitions, Without ſoe much as demanding any treaty, or Explication: which they concluded, would diſguſt (to that height) both the Scotch, and ſeverer of the Engliſh Preſbitereans (as indeed it did) that they ſhould the eaſilier arrive at their great deſigne, in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of all; as it after fell out, and chiefly throwgh that maxime, which he all a long perſued, of keeping the King, and Preſbiterans from agreeing; whereof the ſucceſs, was even at that tyme clearly probable.</p>
            <p n="31">31. To this end, they connived at the eſcape of a perſon out of the tower, there Priſoner; and in reaſnable credit, with the King: being moreover, a clergy Man; animated in the higheſt degree, againſt the Scotch, and Preſbitereans; was a very proper inſtrument for their deſigne; thowgh I ſhall doe him that right, as to declaer my perſuation; that he ſuſpected not the deceit wherein he was flattered, employed, and decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; as many others were, unblemiſhedly faithfull to the King, but to credulous. This man (as I have ſayd) eſcaped; made his ſpeedy repaire to Niew Caſtel; being fortified with powerfull recommendations, from twoe, or three, great, and worthy perſons.</p>
            <p n="32">32. The ſame day that he parted from London, one whoe was at that tyme, very intimately my frend, and in the ſecret; gave me a viſit; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mee, (with joye even in his eyes) that he came to tell me the beſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, that ever I had heard; being a particular recite, of the Eſcape of the fore Mentioned perſon; with his Meſſage, inſtructions; and the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteurs he was charged with, to his Maj. from ſome of the army; and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal perſons, of their adherents; whoe as he ſayd were abſolutely reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to reſtore the King; upon his utterly rejecting the Parliaments Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; and graunting them a full liberty of conſcience; and ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the Militia, as might ſecure all to them, which his Maj.

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48408:9"/>Sect. 33. He added (as allready in tryumph) that the buſineſs was as good as done; and that in leſs then three months, we ſhould ſee the King on his throne; and in the full Execution of his Regal authority haveing heard him, with great attention (for his diſcource was weighty, thowgh his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deluded) without one word of interuption; I anſwered him at lenght, that I was ſorry, I could not rejoice with him, at his triumphant niewes; which I ſhould undoubtedly doe, as much as any Man alive; if I believed the ſucceſs would prove, what he and thoſe engaged in that deſigne, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured to them ſelves; for he had told me whoe they were; three or four of the greateſt, and one of the wiſeſt men that ſerved the King, on whoſe prudence, and integrite his Maj. relyed, as much as any mans. I added, I believe (or rather I knowe) this to be a manifeſt cheat; concerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Cromwell, Ireton, and ſome cheif perſons of their adherents in the twoe houſes; whoſe reall, and hidden end is (what ſpecious pretences ſoever they make to abuſe the credulity of you, and others) to render this treaty ineffectuall, which has been browght about, with great difficulty and, againſt ſtronge oppoſition, even of thoſe perſons, whoe make thei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ouvertures now; hoping hereby to fruſtrate by adreſs, what they Could not hynder, by their debates; in the twoe houſes and by Makeing it bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ak of abruptly; by his Maj. Rejecting all the propoſitions in Generall; caſt the odium upon him; and render the breach irreconcilable betwixt him, and the Preſbitereans; whereby (as I had much reaſon to fear) the moſte zealous, the moſt violent, and the leaſt reaſnable (which are all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the greateſt nomber) would entirely abandon the wiſeſt, and moſt moderate; uniting them ſelves to the armies party in both houſes; whereby, the authority of Parliament, being joyned to the power of the army; both the Kings perſon, and Monarchie would be deſperately expoſed.</p>
            <p>Sect. 34. I aleaged further, that I knew his Maj. would never conſent to the propoſitions as they lay; nor was it councellable he Should: only that he would demande a treaty, and debate, by a power given to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to explaine and diſcuſs, Every artickle apart, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; which was the likelieſt means to produce a good Effect: and that by ſuch an anſwer, and demande, thoſe perſons whoe had (as then) the moſt credit, and cheif direction, would endeavour to deſpoſe the Parliament to conſent by which means, and throwgh reaſnable expedients, which might be fownd out; the ſevereſt things might have been moderated; and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48408:10"/>
great difficulties remouved. To which end I told him, I had already writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the King; whoe ſeemed to be very well ſatiſfied therewith; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to give ſuch an anſwer.</p>
            <p n="35">35. He replyed, that he was (upon good grounds) aſſured, when his Maj. had hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, what this meſſenger forementioned, had to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pownd; be would not demande any treaty; and that the army would ſet him on his throne and make him a great King: I beſowght Allmighty God, that it might prove ſoe; but that I feared, thy would at laſt take away his life, and crowne together, puting him in a capacity of poſſeſſing another in Heaven, more durable.</p>
            <p>Sect. 36. The next day, I went to waite on the Marquis of Hartford, ſince Duke of Somerſet; whoe the forenamed Gentilman had told me, was acquainted with all this tranſaction; and concurred in it: which I fownd true; and that he was perſuaded the army would reſtore his Maj. ſudainly: perceaving me obſtinate, in the contrary opinion; he ſayd theiſe words to me: Colonel Bamfield, I have allways wiſhed you well, and doe ſoe Still; and therefor would adviſe you, not to oppoſe your ſelfe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to obſtruct this cource towards the Kings recouvery; for ſome of the clergy begin to ſuſpect, that you have particular intereſts, in your trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions with the Preſbitereans; which weigh more then that of his Maj. I made anſwer, that I had no other worldly intereſt, but what was invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in, and ſubordinate to, the Kings: that I never expected any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage neither from the one, or from the other partie; but that I was ſoe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced, of the deſperate deſigns, ſecret practices; and principles of the army, and their adherents (where of I did not want light) that the groundleſs jalouſie, of ſome men, nor their deluding hopes, ſhould never make me proſtitute my reaſon, nor act againſt it; or have any thing to doe with thoſe, whoſe end, and underground workings were for the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kings perſon, and Monarchie.</p>
            <p>Sect. 37. A few days after this his Maj. anſwer came, but not alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch, as theiſe his freinds, whoe, I have mentioned, deſired; but unhappy enough for him, to doe the armies buſineſs at that tyme, for the moſt Zealous part of the Preſbitereans left, the wiſeſt; and moſt modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te (whoe endeavoured to have made the Kings anſwer the fowndation of a treaty) and being likewiſe irritated, by the Schotiſh Miniſters, Gyllaſpy,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48408:10"/>
and others; joined with the armies adherents in Parliament; to demande of the Scots, the delivery of his Maj. perſon, to commiſſioners, whoe were ſent to receive him; and guardes commanded by Collonel Graves. This was clearly foreſeen, by the late Duke of Lauderdalle (then one of the Commiſſioners for Scotland) the Earle of Holland, my Lord Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowby of Parham; my Lord Hollis, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Phillip Stapleton, and very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others in both houſes; whoe were ar that tyme entirely for the Kings reſtauration, upon as moderate termes, as their conduct, and credit in Parliament, Could poſſibly worke out: and as the only expedient, to remoue difficulties, wiſhed, and endeavoured to bring the buſineſs to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall treaty: by which means, they hoped to abate the ſeverity of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which all reaſnable, and truly conſcientions men amongſt them, knew his Maj. Could not graunt, without violence to his conſcience, in the breach of his othe; and diveſting himſelfe of all power, to maintaine ye lawes, protect his ſubjects; or to preſerve himſelfe; and his poſterity, from being deprived, of that leſs then halfe his regall, and juſt authority; which his aſſenting to thoſe propoſitions (in the termes they were drawne up) would have left him: the remaining part of his power being but precario; and at the arbitrement of every ſucceeding Parliament.</p>
            <p>Sect. 38. The wiſeſt amongeſt them, Conſidered, and acknowldged theiſe truths; and ſeeing a part of the Nation deſpoſed with the army, and their adherents, towards a popular Gouverment; would willingly have had more power in the King; then when they began the war, they deſired, or deſigned.</p>
            <p>Sect. 39. On the contrary; the adverſe partie, was abſolutely againſt a treaty, which they feard might lead to moderation on both ſides; and produce an accord; deſtructive to thoſe great projects, the cheifs of them, had figured to themſelves, for a long tyme; and reſolved upon, after the niew modeling of the army: to prevent an agreement; they muſt hinder a treaty; to which end, that party, in both houſes haveing at firſt, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly oppoſed, ſending of any propoſitions to the King; but that being carried againſt them, in the affirmative: by great adreſs, and infuſing ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies concerning Religeon, into the greateſt nomber of the Preſbitere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; (few of them being States men, by experience, and peradventure, not all by reaſon) they eaſily drew them to a vote, that his Maj. Should be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſigne the propoſitions in the termes, as they were ſent him by both
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48408:11"/>
houſes, alowing no latitude, to the Commiſſioners by whome they were ſent; to treat or debate one ſyllable: knowing very well, that the King; neither would; nor indeed Could; conſent to them as they were; neither with Conſcience, honour, or ſafety: however, leaſt the extreme danger whereunto he lay expoſed; might have prevayled with him to conſent; they made uſe of the ſtratagem, I have allready mentioned, of infuſing into the belief of many of the moſt conſiderable of the Kings freinds, that the army would reſtore him, upon certaine conditions ſpecified; whoe led his Maj. himſelfe to ſome hopes of it.</p>
            <p>Sect. 40. By theiſe means the King was by the Scots delivered to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, ſent by the Parliament to receive him; by them browght to Holmby, one of his owne houſes: where he was rigorouſly guarded, and very hardly uſed, in all conſiderations; not permitted to Speak with any man, but in preſence of ſome of the Commiſſioners; not one of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtique ſervants ſuffered about him, nor the liberty to write, or receive a lettre, from the Queen, any of his Childeren, or freinds: knowing nothing what his enemies did; or what he was to doe himſelfe. In this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition, one nepar (whome the Parliament had placed about him, as his barber) being gained; whoſe employment every morning, and evening neer his perſon, gave him the oportunity of conveying letters, unpercevably into his hands; how ſtrictly ſoever he was watched: by this conveniency, haveing written to him at large, concerning many things; and eſpecialy, of the deſorders, begun betwixt the Parliament, and the army; and of all els which I judged neceſſary for his Knowledg, in that eſtat he was; he did me the honour, to write to me an anſwer, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing termes.</p>

what ever I can now offer, or conſent to; will rather be interpreted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from fear, or at beſt, to mend my condition, then from any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif of publique good: for I am as a blinded man; without the leaſt light, of what I am to expect, from my enemies; or hope for from my frends: ſaveing what Gods Providence affords me; by the induſtry, and hazard of thoſe, whoe are moſt faithfull to me: inſo much, that I cannot change my reſolution; unleſs upon the certainty of gaining ſome advantage for the publique, which may counterballance, the paſſing by this reall point of honour: for I cannot admit of your diſtinction; of promiſing things now, to be ratified when I am at liberty.

I have many other letters, from his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. touching theiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, at that tyme, not neceſſary here to be inſerted, for the end I propoſe to my ſelfe. The Parliament had paſt an ordinance, in both hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48408:13"/>
for the diſbanding of the army; which would not obey: their refuſall, and proceedings there upon, were very high, and factions; and out of the power of the houſes to reſtraine; their only force, lying in their votes, and orders; which the other laughed at, and diſpiſed; whoe haveing thus begun, fownd themſelves obliged to goe on; or periſh. The Parliament, was here at much alarmed; and the wiſeſt amongeſt them began to repent, their haveing rejected a propoſition, which was ſecretly made to them, and often urged, with weighty reaſons: not to ſend the Scotch army out of England entirely, and at once; but at the ſame tyme to diſband part of their owne; and ſend away a like proportion of the Scots; and ſoe by degrees make them ſelves quit of both. But this was refuſed, without aleaging any ſolid reaſon againſt it; but only depending on Parlementary authority, which they ſayd, the army would never dare to diſobey: they were likewiſe ſorry, they had ſoe long, and ſoe much neglected, the great advances which the King had made; and told me plainly; they would endeavour the paſſing of a vote, in both houſes, for the Kings coming to London; but that they apprehended, the army, there upon, would ſeize upon his perſon, before he could come thither.</p>
            <p>Sect. 49. They deſired me to write to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. to know his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I told them I would goe my ſelfe; to a frends houſe, within leſs then an hower from Holmby, and would write from thence, which I did all the ſame night poſt.

            <p>Sect. 51. My anſwer to this letter was very ſhort, haveing acquainted my Lord Dumfermlin fully with all things; whoe had likewiſe himſelfe, received letters from ſome of the Scotch Commiſſioners at London, which confirmed all I had written, and ſavd; and therefor concluded ſome thing was to be done out of hand, for the Kings eſcape. He named the twoe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to me whoe oppoſed it; one where of commanding the troupes which garded his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>., without him it was not poſſible to have been done. The next morning, in ſtead of receiving any advice from the King, how I might ſerve him in his eſcape; the newes came, of his being ſecured by a party of the army, commanded by a cornet named Joyce, by his trade a taylour. His, Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. demanded of him; what commiſſion, or autorite he had, to offer him the violence he did: without ſoe much as mouving his hat, or ſhewing the King the leaſt reſpect; he ſhewed him with his hand, the five or 600 ſoldiers which he commanded; ſaying there is my commiſſion; his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. without any (the leaſt) emotion ſmilingly replyed, t'was written in avery faire hand. In ſhort; he was carried away to the army: ſome furious ſpirits amongeſt them, as Major General Harriſon, and others, were for the putting of him to death, by an unammous ſentence of the army: but Cromwell, Ireton, and the moſt politique heads, were for delay, and temporiſing, ſoe long, by amuſing the King with hopes that they would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48408:14"/>
reſtore him; till they had entirely broken the Preſbiterean party, and rendered them powerleſs; and themſelves more abſolute. Upon this fown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, Cromwell, Ireton; and other principal perſons of the army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very Civile, and ſome thing reſpectfull to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. makeing great proteſtations of haveing no other deſigne but the ſetting him, with honour, upon his throne; on his graunting them a free liberty of Conſcience; with ſuch a power in the Militia; as they judged convenient for their aſſurance; that they might not be deprived thereof at pleaſure: but that tyme was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to prepare the way; and to diſpoſe the minds of the army, to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion thereunto.</p>
            <p>Sect. 52. Theſe promiſes, and deep Proteſtations, ſeconded by a free permiſſion of his frends to wait on him: of ſome of his domſtiques to ſerve him; and of his chapelens to performe their functions, in his devotions; according to the Conſtitutions, and Cuſtomes of the Church of England; wrought very much upon the King; eſpecially from the hopes he had; of not being conſtrained in his Conſcience, in Matter of Divine worſhip, and church Gouverment wherein he was much more ſencible; then in what concerned his prerogative, or the rights of the crowne.</p>

The chiefs of the army (eſpecially Cromwell, and Ierton, whoe were great maſters in that art) made large promiſes, and ſpecious apparencies, without effecting of any thing; or makeing any demandes tending to a poſitive concluſion, of what would ſatiſfy them, or of what they would doe for his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>.: and which was then to me remarquable, and worthy at all tymes of obſervation; that amideſt all theiſe faire pretences, the armies adherents, in both houſes, whoe did not any thing, but by ſecret concert with Cromwell, continually clamoured in Parliament, at the ſeeming liberty which the King had; often aleadging that he ſhould be more reſtrayned, and that the chief delinquents (which was the Phraiſe in thoſe tymes) owght to be brouwght to condigne puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Sect. 54. Twoe or three of the leading men, whoe thirſted for his blood, ſeverall tymes let fly expreſſions of that kinde, directly againſt his perſon; and others a little cautious; more obliquely: but ſoe, that both the end, and the way to it, which theiſe men had long projected, by mutuall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was in my opinion ſufficiently viſible; where of I advertiſed the King conſtantly; and frequently, the Queen; by my conſtant adreſſes to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48408:15"/>
Earle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Albanes, whoe lived when I wrote, and intended to Print this relation. As I mentioned all particulars of that nature, ſpoken in both, or either houſe, ſoe I named the authours; haveing had ordnarily once in four and twenty howers, knowledge of all that paſſed, which concerned the King, whoe was trained from place, to place according to their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and deſignes, during the ſpace of divers months; till Colonel Hamond was made Gouvernour of the iſte of wight, and Kaireſbrooke Caſtel more magnificently furniſhed, out of the publique warderobe; then was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him, or ſutable to his condition; which by ſome others was taken notice of; and by me eſpecially, throwgh an unexpected accident, to long to be here inſerted; which gave me cauſe to ſuſpect, and fear what ſhortly after unhappely arrived; which important circomſtance, joined to divers others, not of much leſs weight, put reſtleſs thowghts into my head, till ſuch tyme as I could obtaine a particular audience from the King; to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me I gave an exact account of my apprehenſions, with the grownds of them.</p>
            <p>Sect. 55. His Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. anſwered; theiſe reaſons have weight, one may fear as well to little, as to much, eſpecially as my condition is, yet if there be any faith in them, they will never come to ſuch extremities; however their feeding me hitherto, with good words, and deep proteſtations, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout reall effects; or coming in all this tyme, to any particular, or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive concluſion; makes me ſome tymes doubt the event; but on the other ſide, I cannot fall into all your apprehentions, which ſeem, now and then, to hyppocondriacal.</p>
            <p>Sect. 56. I replyed, I beſeech God thy may all prove ſoe; where unto I added, that I hoped there was yet an expedient, either to conſtraine them to doe his buſineſs, or to have it done without them. He ſmiled, and told me ſuch a propoſition was well worth the hearing, aſking mee what it was.</p>
            <p>Sect. 57. I anſwered, ſome of the moſt conſiderable perſons of both houſes (whoe I named) were unchangeabley convinced, that the army jugled with him, whoe were reſolved upon a totalle change of the Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment; which deſigne (they whoe had ſate during the ſpace of five, or ſix years, in the ſame aſſembly, with them; and had been privy, to their principles, and debates; and (without doubt) to many of their moſt ſecret contrivements) could ſee further into them then any els; and wiſhed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48408:15"/>
his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. would bring them to a ſhort, and peremtory reſolution, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching what would content them; as likewiſe what they would doe for him: becauſe that every day, they gained power; and others whoe really deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. Conſervation, and reeſtabliſhment loſt it.</p>
            <p>Sect. 58. If they meant ſyncerely, as they pretended; Cromwell, and Ireton, Could abſolutely, engage, that party in both houſes, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currance with them; whoe were inſeperably linked to his intereſts: and that the Preſbitereans, would not hinder, but further it; to prevent what they reaſnably, and exceedingly feared; to late finding that they had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a ſpirit, which they could not eaſily lay againe. And that the event was very uncertayne, in their oppoſing of that power, which inſencibly they had let glide out of their owne hands, and nouriſht againſt themſelves, to long, to be able to give limits to it.</p>
            <p>Sect. 59. They conſidered that if the liberty of Conſcience, which the army ſeemed to inſiſt upon, were conſented to, and the penal ſtatutes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, the Preſbitereans would have been included, as well as others; and for the power of the Militia, which was demanded for ſecurity, it muſt have reſided in King, Parliament, or both: for in the Officers of the army, it could not be, without keeping up a continued ſtanding Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, which the nation Could not bear, as unſafe, both for King, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and people.</p>
            <p>Sect. 60. They were therefor of opinion, that his Matie without further delay, ſhould have pleaſed to preſs them to a particular, and Catigoricall explanation of their full demands; which if he fownd ſuch, as he could agree to; and that the armies partie in both houſes, would ſyncerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur; there Could be no inſuperable difficulty in the buſineſs; nor any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſaveing what the Scotch Miniſters, could have ſtirred up, whoe would never have approuved of a liberty of Conſcience, nor of any thing leſs then a Preſbiterean Gouverment jurê Divinô; which the armies adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in both houſes, were declaredly againſt; and I dare boldly ſay (for I underſtood at that tyme, the temper, and coſtitution, of that Parliament, as it really was) ten of thoſe, whoe went by the name of Preſbitereans, were not of the Schots opinion; but either for a moderate epiſcopacy, as the King had volontarily offered it, at the treaty at uxbridge, when he was under no force, as the wiſeſt expedient, to have remouved all jalouſies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48408:16"/>
about Religeon; or els were eraſtians; and for haveing the politique Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of the church dependant, on the civile, as it had been from the midle of Henry the eights raigne, to that very tyme, (the ſix years of Queen Mary, only excepted.) And undoubtedly there was great, and clear reaſon; foreſeeing, that where the Eccleſiaſticale policy of the church, in the one, or the other extreme, is received (or ſhall be) as Jurê Divinô, the Hyrar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, has, and will gouverne more abſolutely, then the civile, and ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Magiſtrate; which has been manifeſt, for many ages, and is as demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable for the future, as any probleme of euclide; from which clear, and experienced ground, it may be thowght, that no wiſe ſouveraigne Autority, will volontarily part with the beſt halfe, and ſureſt fowndati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its power.</p>
            <p>Sect. 61. But inſencibly, I forget my ſelfe; this not being my buſineſs; nor was then, any part of my humble repreſentation to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. thowgh above a year before, he had <hi>towght</hi> me that leſſon, when he was at new-caſtle; in ſoe much, that by what I have here ſayd upon this ſubject, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come but his echoe.</p>
            <p>Sect. 62. Wherefor I ſhall returne, without goeing further aſtraye, to the matter, which led me to this ſhort digreſſion; to conclude, as I did then, to the King; that the oppoſition of the Scotch Miniſters (thowgh it might have made a little noiſe, could not have occaſioned any interupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the ſucceſs of what has been ſayd.</p>
            <p>Sect. 63. But in caſe, his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. Could not bring the army to ſuch a concluſion, as this councel imported; and that he fownd himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; that their promiſes, and proteſtations, were but deluſory; they whoe gave this advice, promiſed to endeavour, the paſſing of an order in both houſes, to command the army to retire further from London; and to permit the King to come to ſome of his houſes neer the citty, to treat perſonally, for a well Grownded peace.</p>
            <p>Sect. 64. His Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. replied, this has ſome weight, being what I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deſire; but I much doubt, the armies obedience; either to leave me at ſoe much liberty; or to retire to ſuch a diſtance. However, I will preſs them as far as is poſſible, and prudent for me in the condition, I am; to a fixed, and poſitive Concluſion with me; and by you, ſhall acquaint them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48408:16"/>
with the ſucceſs, if I finde it uſefull to me. Theiſe men whoe propownd this to you, ſee to late, that they have improvidently cut out more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, then they can make up without my help; but I cannot reſolve to doe it all, at my owne expence.</p>
            <p>Sect. 65. His Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. (however) put this in practice with all the erneſtneſs he Could; but met with continual demurs, and delays: that things were not yet ſufficiently ripe: that the army was not ſoe unanimous as was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it would become: that there were deſordres in it (which Cromwell underhand raiſed, to have a colour for protarction, and for other greater ends which appeared on the the theatre ſhortly after) that their frends in the Parliament, Could not be wrowght to a full concurrence with them.</p>
            <p>Sect. 66. Theiſe pretexts, were ſoe groſſe, and obvious, that the Kings hopes deminiſhed dayly. Where upon, thoſe perſons allready mentioned, procured an order in the twoe houſes, that his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. ſhould reſide at Richmond houſe; that he ſhould be attended by the ſame perſons, whoe were about him at Holmby; thirdly that Colonel Roſſiters regiment ſhould guarde him. All which Cromwell refuſed, and laughed at; decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the King ſhould come no neerer to London, then the Parliament permitted the armies quarter to be. Where upon I al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aged, to thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that all their votes would ſignify nothing, unleſs means could be fownd out, where by their orders, might be ſeconded, by ſuch force, as in ſome degree was able, to counterballance that of the army. To which end none Could be thowght on, ſaveing the Militia of London: which at that tyme, of trayned bands, and auxillianes amounted to at leaſt fiveteen, or ſixteen thowſand foote, and to have been browght together in ſix howers tyme; they were for much the greateſt part Commanded by Preſbiterean officers; which in divers battayles had done as good ſervice, and fowght as well as thoſe of the army.</p>
            <p>Sect. 67. Whereupon the Earles of Mancheſter, Holland, Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalle (whoe thowgh not of the Parliament, but one of the Scots Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, had great credit in the city) my Lord willowghby of Parham, my Lord Hollis, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Phillip Stapleton, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. William Waller, Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Maſtey, Major General Browne, all which and divers more, whoe had great influence on the citty, judged it now the crittical ſeaſon, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage it, to petition the Parliament, for the continuance of their Militia,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48408:17"/>
under the eſtabliſhment it was; which Cromwell, and his adherents la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to have changed; but ſecondly to order that the King, ſhould be left at his Houſe at Richmond, in order to a perſonall treaty; thirdly that the citty ſhould be autoriſed to rayſe forces, for the Parliaments, and its owne defence, and have power to chuſe their General Officers. Fourthly that aleaven members of the Parliament whoe had been (a little before) throwgh an impeachement of the army, ſequeſtred from their ceſſion, with their owne conſent, ſhould returne to their places in Parliament; this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne was Caried on (in the beginning) with as great ſecrecy, as ſuch a tranſaction Could be, by the perſons above mentioned, where in I ſlept not.</p>
            <p>Sect. 68. I acquainted the King with it, whoe approuved the whole conduct: withall commanding me, ſoe to Gouverne my ſelfe, in my part there of; that he might not be neceſſitated to appear there in; firſt for his perſonall ſafety, as being in the power of the army: ſecondly that he might have been free, in Conſcience, and honour, to agree with the army, in caſe that this deſigne ſhould drive them to the neceſſity, of makeing good their ſeverall proteſtations to him, which without being forced to it, he perceaved they would never doe.</p>
            <p>Sect. 69. Beſides he told me, moſt of thoſe with whome you treat, play now their owne after game; they began theiſe trowbles, which have browght me to this eſtate, and haveing by their owne Improvidence, throwgh their rigid dealing, when they had the power to have agreed with me, loſt the dignity, and authority of Parliament; would now recouver themſelves by my hazard; wherefor, I ſhall goe as far along with them, as I finde conſiſtent, with the publique; and my owne intereſt; chargeing you, not to engage my name further.</p>
            <p>Sect. 70. I replyed, that to communicate what meaſures his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take, would never be approuved by thoſe leading men; and might break of, and Fruſtrate the whole deſſein, upon which (one way or other) his <hi>perſonelle</hi> ſafety, and reſtauration entirely depended: therefor the beſt courſe, I coud ſteer, was not to let them know, that I had lately ſpoken to him about it; and that in caſe, they ſhould preſs me to it, that they might have his engagement, to adhere to them, in their proceedings; I would employ all the adreſſe I could, to divert them from urging his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48408:17"/>
to any promeſſe againſt them, in whoſe hands, and power he was, and many of them (if not all) deſperately diſpoſed to his deſtruction, which would undoubtedly produce violent, and precipitate practiſes againſt him, if they came to the leaſt knowledg, or even jalouſie, that his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. was in any kinde of coluſion againſt them. He approuved of this expedient; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that it was neither more, nor leſs then truth.</p>
            <p>Sect. 71. Shortly after I was deſired to mouve the King herein; where upon, I aleaged the above mentioned reaſons againſt it, with ſuch enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements, as they were ſatiſfied. In fin, the trayne tooke; the citty put in excecution all that had been ſecretly contrived: petitioning the Parliament, for the confirmation of their Militia, according to the Eſtabliſhment where in it was.</p>
            <p>Secondly that they might have power to rayſe new forces, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Parliament, and themſelves.</p>
            <p>Thirdly that they might be empowered to chuſe their owne General offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Fourthly, that the King ſhould come to London, in order to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall treaty; and that the aleaven ſecluded members, ſhould returne to their ceſſion in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Sect. 72. Here upon all Cromwels party, in both houſes reſorted to the army. The reſt which conſtituted more then the nomber requiſite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned aſſembled, voting all the citties demands. Whoe began to ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe forces: choſe theyr General officers, which were S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. William Waller, Major General Maſſy, and others. Theiſe enrolled, both horſe, and foote, which came howerly in to them.</p>
            <p>Many officers, and ſoldiers; whoe had been reformed, at the inſtances of the army, as being of different principles from them, were againe employd. A propoſition was made of ſeazing all the horſes, within the lines of Communication, where withall, they Could have mounted 4 or 5000 troupers, which joyned to the citty Militia, with the new leavied foote; would have made a more conſiderable force, then that of the army; which they knew, and apprehended. Where upon, Cromwell conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the fox might on that occaſion, doe more good, then the lion; employed all his artifices, even totum vliſſem, to hinder all accord betwixt his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. the Parliament, and citty; and the Kings party from joyning: prognoſticating the entire ruine of all his vaſt deſigns, with the inevitable deſtruction of his perſon, and complices, from ſoe fatal, and ominous a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48408:18"/>
conjoncture: which to prevent, he preſented aleaven propoſals to the King.</p>
            <p>Sect. 73. Firſt for the repealing of all the penal Statuts againſt recuſants; with the takeing away of all coercive authority from the Biſhops.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the repealing of all acts, conſtrayning the uſe of the common prayer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly againſt the enforcing of the Covenant. The next propoſal, was compiled, in moſt ambiguous, and conditional termes; whereby (as I conceaved) the very quinteſſence of this cheat was manifeſt, as followes here.</p>
            <p>Fourthly the things before mentioned being ſufficiently aſſured; and proviſion made, for ſetling, and ſecuring, the rights, liberties, ſafety, and peace of the nation: his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. perſon, and Royal iſſue, may be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In this propoſall, all man kinde may ſee, that there was nothing poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, nor to have been certaynly depended on, for the Kings perſon, or poſterity: the means, for ſatiſfaction in theſe great matters, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the body of the propoſal, being left indeffinite; muſt have been the ſubſequent, reſult, of a newe treaty, whereby a port remained open, to render the later clauſe of no manner of Effect; ſeeing they might continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have declared, that no conceſſions which the King Could conſent to, with the preſervation of Monarchy, were judged by them ſufficient, to have ſecured (in their ſence) the rights, liberties, ſafety, and peace of the Nation.</p>
            <p>The ſeaven following propoſals, concerned entirely, the moderating of divers ſeverities towards the Kings partie; which were wiſe and juſt in themſelves; but moſt Achittophally politique, as to his end, which was only to bynde up the hands of the Royal party, at that conjoncture, and to hinder a coalition.</p>
            <p>Sect. 74. To render all his offers to the King fruitleſs; he had this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, which he had formerly made uſe of, on the like occaſion; before his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. eſcaped from Oxford: that thowgh he, and moſt of his officers, had thowght thoſe propoſals, a good fowndation for the Kings reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and for the nations ſafety; yet if the Parliament would not be led to the ſame opinion, he could not conſtraine them. That he, the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and army, were but the nations, and Parliaments ſervants, not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48408:18"/>
their maſters. That they could only recommend their propoſals, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force their acceptation.</p>
            <p>Sect. 75. However, his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. haveing peruſed theiſe propoſals, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated them, and lent to favourable an ear, to his, and his ſon inlawes explanations, and deep proteſtations; did conceave very ſtrong hopes, that they were in erneſt, and really intended his reſtauration, upon which grounds (whereunto was joyned the councels, and preſſing perſuations, of three perſons, permitted by the army at that tyme about him, and in great credit with him) as likewiſe, being in their hands, and power, might apprehend, that his ſafety required his compliance. At their deſire, he ſigned a paper, utterly deſavowing, and diſapprouving, the proceedings of the Parliament, and citty; embracing the armies propoſals, as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt fowndation for a well grounded, and durable peace.</p>
            <p>Cromwell haveing obtayned this, cauſed ſome thowſands of copies, to be imediately printed, and diſperſed throwgh the cittie, and nation; which gave ſoe full a ſatiſfaction, to allmoſt all the Kings frends; that they diſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aded what cittizens, they could have influence upon, not to oppoſe the army.</p>
            <p>Sect. 76. Haveing gained this great point, he marched furiouſly towards London, where the deſordre, and conſternation was ſoe great; by the paper his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. had ſigned; by the endeavours of the Royal party; and of Cromwells owne, which were conſiderable in that place; as at his arrival, he fownd no oppoſition. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. William Waller fled into Hollande, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Phillip Stapleton to calais, where he died in eight or ten days after; and many others retired to ſeveral other places: divers of both houſes, as well as of the citty, were impriſoned. A great part of his army marched throwgh London, in triumph, he made one of his owne partie Leutenant of the Tower, modelled the Militia to his owne pleaſure, and intereſt; left ſome Regiments about the Mewes, and Whitehall, to encourage his frends, and terrifye his enemies in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Sect. 77. This thowgh (at that tyme) a bloodleſs victory, was in effect, one of the greateſt, that ever he gained; makeing way to that unbownded power, which he after atchieved, and waded to, throwgh a ſea of blood, in all the three nations; and which was moſt extraordinary, died in peace, and declared his ſucceſſour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:48408:19"/>Sect. 78. This haveing ſucceeded, according to what he had long deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet hardly hoped for, but was reſolved to hazard; he began to put of the maſque, where withall he had hithirto deſguiſed himſelfe, as to what concerned the King; thowgh not as to other ſubſequent, and great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
            <p>Sect. 79. He quartered part of his army, in the adjacent places neer London: Conveyed the King further from it; the councels of the officers, and agitators, were aſſembled at putney: t'was now thowght high tyme to breake with his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. and for him, with his Mirmidons, to appear in their pure naturals.</p>
            <p>Sect. 80. Subjects for deſperate, and bloody debates, touching the King, were propownded in their meetings, by his, and his ſon in lawes inſtruments and ſecret inſtigations: thowgh it was yet unſeaſnable, that the ſcean of execution ſhowld be expoſed.</p>
            <p>Sect. 81. He ſeemed much concerned for the danger he had plunged the King into, and would appear willing to quench a reall fyre, (which he had kindled, nouriſhed, and now cheefly, adminiſtred fuel to) with an imaginary water.</p>
            <p>Sect. 82. This danger of his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. was communicated to him, both by his frends, and enemies; but with very different intentions. Cromwell would not appear the laſt, nor the leaſt concerned for his ſecurity; which undoubtedly, and viſibly was, to have it provided for, in the Iſle of wight. To which end he wrote a letter to his Couzin, Commiſſary General Whaly; whoe had the guarde of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. perſon; ſignifying the deſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the army, with the Kings danger; which being communicated to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. he recalled his word, which had been given, that he would not endeavour to eſcape: notwithſtanding, whaly tooke not the leaſt care to prevent it, which he undoubtedly would have done, had he not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, what arrived very ſhortly after.</p>
            <p>Peradventure being at that tyme a preacher, (as moſt of the officers then were) he was likewiſe a prophet; and Could divine, that his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, would prove but a tranſlation, from an ill impriſonment, to a worſe. In ſhort he left Hamton Court (I will not ſay ſaved himſelfe from it)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48408:19"/>
few knew what path he had taken (thowgh ſome I am confident did, beſides thoſe with him) till the newes came to the Parliament, of his being in the hands of Colonel Hamond in the Iſle of wight.</p>
            <p>It not being my buſineſs here, to enlarge to much, or to diſcant upon other mens alegations, for the excuſe of Cromwells, and Iretons after proceedings, as extorted from them, throwgh danger, and neceſſity, for their owne preſervation; ſome whereof being falce; others frivolous, and childiſh; I ſhall leave them as they are, without further reflexions; paſſing on curſorily, to ſome few matters of weight, leading to the fatall event of this moſt unhappy buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The King being in the Iſle of wight, and not finding his entertainment, anſwerable to his hopes; and that the perſonall ſecurity, oraculouſly promiſed him, was to be interpreted, in the ſence of his enemies, tending directly, to his ſtricter, and ſurer confinement; and in the extremeſt danger which could threaten him; his eſcape was become much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, if not impoſſible; and being advertiſed from London (means ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing been ſudainly fownd out for correſpondence with him) of thoſe things which moſt neerly concerned him: and particularly, that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions were preparing to be ſent him. to obviate which, that he foreſaw would be to his prejudice. He wrote a letter to the Parliament; confirning what he had offered them, in his Meſſage from Holmby, ſome months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with other very conſiderable additions; of the Militias being in their hands during his life; together, with the chuſing the councel, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State; as likewiſe the payment of the arrears of the army; and concerning other things; he erneſtly preſſed, that he might with honour, and ſafety, have come to a perſonall treaty at Londen.</p>
            <p>Sect. 83. In anſwer where unto; the Parliament paſſed four bills to be ſent to the King, proviſionally, for his ratification; which being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as acts, his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. ſhould be admitted to a perſonall treaty. Theiſe bills were large; and needleſs to be recited here verbatim; the firſt regarded the Melitia, both by ſea and land, to be entirely in their hands; and for the raiſing mony, for the maintainance there of, the laſt by inevitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, muſt have contiued that Parliament to all perpetuity, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting them with full power, to prorogue, and meet againe at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. By twoe of theſe acts, the King muſt have deveſted himſelfe, and his poſterity of the ſword, and treaſury, and eſtabliſhed them in it. And by the laſt; given them ſuch a power, as was little leſs then the legiſlative; which in a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48408:20"/>
ſhort tyme, they would undoubtedly have drawne to themſelves. It is here, remarquable, that Cromwell, and ireton, whoe ſix or ſeaven months before, by an adreſſe from the army, had in a mennacing manner, demanded of the Parliament, to reſolve upon, and declare a fixed period, to their ceſſion; thereby to make roome for a trienniall to be aſſembled; in this occaſion were the moſt violent in preſſing theiſe four acts; before his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. were admitted to any perſonall treaty. And when the King had paſſed all, at this tyme demanded; and came to a treaty, it was in their power, whither they would have agreed with him or not; from all which conſiderations, and divers others, which undoubtedly he had; he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ratifying of any acts, untill all were agreed.</p>
            <p>Sect. 84. Upon this refuſall (which he foreſaw from the very nature of the demands muſt enſue) Ireton after an invective ſpeech, tending to the Kings rejection, and to the ſetling the Gouverment without him, moved, that it might be reſolved to make no more adreſſes to him; the debate laſted long, and as Ireton began, Cromwell ended, with bitter reproches againſt his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. and threatings of the Parliament, if they paſſed it not: at length, this reſolution, was forced out, not without vigorous oppoſition, of neer the halfe in both houſes.</p>
            <p>Sect. 85. Firſt, that no further adreſſes be made to the King.</p>
            <p>Secondly that no application be made to the King, by any of his ſubjects, without permiſtion of Parliament, under the penalty of high treaſon.</p>
            <p>The laſt vote, was relative to the firſt as before theiſe votes (all moſt as ſoone as he was in the Iſle of wight) I had fownd out means of correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with him, and of giving his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. conſtant advertiſements, of all occurrencies, which concerned him, ſoe notwithſtanding this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, of being puniſhed as a traitour; I continued it even to the laſt: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to write to him, and to receive letters from him, both for my ſelfe, and others; the greateſt part, of his intelligence, both with engliſh, and Scotch paſſing throwgh my hands, whileſt I remayned in England, not without great hazard, (as may eaſily be conceaved,) which had it ever been diſcouvered, no humane means that I ſawe, could have ſecured my head.</p>
            <p>Sect. 86. Cromwell haveing (as I have already ſayd, and demonſtrated) from tyme, to tyme, oppoſed, and by his ſeveral artifices; prevented all treaties (as much as he poſſibly could) and agreements betwixt the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48408:20"/>
King, and the Preſbitereans; by degrees, wrowght the Earle of Eſſex, Bedford, and Mancheſter; the Generall Waller, Major General Maſſy, Major General Browne, and all thoſe Military perſons, out of all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, whome he judged capable, to bring any opſtacle to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; in ſome Kinde reduced the citty of London: and jugled the King priſoner into the Iſle of wight, in the cuſtody of Colonel Hammon, one of his creatures, he belived his game ſure; which was the ſole reaſon, why I ever declined, all treaty, or coluſion, with thoſe people, foreſeeing clearly their ends, and as viſibly their ways to them; even when the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallity of the Kings party, aſſured themſelves, that they would infallibly reſtore, both him, and them.</p>
            <p>Sect. 87. My ſtedfaſtneſs, in the contrary opinion, and my endeavours, againſt that groſs deluſion; not proſtituting my reaſon, to other mens phantaſies, procured me many enemies, with very ſevere ſenſures; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding divers to a jalouſie, that I had rivited my ſelfe into that intereſt, rather for my owne private ends; then for his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. ſervice, or for the publique behoofe of the Nation; which moſt groundleſs, and unreaſnable cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, together, with the animoſities, and calomnies which aroſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refrom, had prepared the way, and facilitated my after mine, all thowgh I ſolemnly, and ſyncerely proteſt; that I alone declined the one party, as being unchangeably convinced, that they deſigned his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. deſtruction; nor applyed my ſelfe to the other, then by his commands, and (as things were in thoſe tymes) that I Could perceave no other means for his preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Sect. 88. Upon advertiſements, I gave the King (which I know he had from other hands (of the foregoeing votes, as likewiſe of what Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and Ierton, had ſayd againſt him, he ſawe to late, howe perfidiouſly they had jugled with him, which firſt diſpoſed him to treat with the Scotch, and with as many of the Preſbitereans in England, as ſafely Could, and would be treated with: which evidently refutes that rediculous aſſertion of ſome, whoe pretend to be the Kings frends; that Cromwell, and Ireton, broke with his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. becauſe he treated with the Scots; makeing the effect, the cauſe; it being notorious to all, whoe had any tranſactions in (and knowledg of) the affaires at thoſe ſeperate tymes; that the King (after the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies propoſalls) had no treaty with the Scots, or any els, till the votes of non adreſſes; and unanimous proteſtation of the army, to live and dye
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48408:21"/>
with the Parliament, in the perſuance of thoſe votes; and for the ſetle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Gouverment, without his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. and a little after; the like was done, by the Parliament, to live and dye with the army, for the ſame ends: and which was the wonder, of wonders; the houſe of Lords Paſſed this reſolution firſt; with great zeal; and ſent it downe to the Commons for their concurrence; whoe for ſome tyme oppoſed it vigorouſly; till threatnings and fear, cauſed many members to abſent themſelves; ſoe that it was carryed in the affirmative, by five or ſix vooices. Thus the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons contended to preſerve the Peerage; for the aboliſhing of which, the Peers themſelves layd this fowndation; which enſued in about a year after.</p>
            <p>Sect. 89. Theiſe proceedings haveing been viſible; and, his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. no other recource for the gaining of his liberty, with the preſervation of his crowne, and life; came to a concluſion with the Scotch Commiſſioners, whoe were permitted by the Parliament to, repaire to the King, about the Gouverment of their owne nation.</p>
            <p>Sect. 90. The agreement with them, gave ſuch ſatiſfaction; that they engaged themſelves to enter into England with an army, as ſpeedily, as well could be; and in order to conjonction with them, ſeverall treaties were ſecretly mannaged, with the principall perſons of the Preſbiterean party. In a Parliamentary way; nothing Could be done with them, nor by them; becauſe of the awe of the army; and the incertainty of many amongſt themſelves; whoe in divers debates, voted with the contrary party. Beſides, that the very late reſolutions, and proteſtations of both houſes; rendred all propoſitions of that Kinde, vaine, and exceeding dangerous: in ſoe much, that there remained no other way, but to treat with them a part, and with the greateſt Privacy. The reſult was; that they ſhould declare at the ſame tyme with the Scotch, the Kings party being to joine with them. Upon the Scotch commiſſioners leaving the Iſle of wight; his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. was more ſeverely guarded then ever. Not with ſtanding, I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant correſpondence with him: all (or much the greateſt part of) his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencies, either with the Kingdome of Scotland, or England, paſſed my hands; not without great difficulty, danger, and expence. When all theſe tranſactions were concluded; the King ſent me the following letter of credit, to be communicated, to as many of the Gentilemen of the Eaſterne aſſotiation, as I ſhould thinke fit; with the advice of thoſe, with whome I had before treated. The Duke of Lauderdalle did me the honour
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48408:21"/>
to deliver it me, at his returne from Cairſbrook Caſtel; and to let me know what was concluded, betwixt his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. and the ſotch Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners.</p>

            <p>Sect. 95. For ſome Important reaſons, which I acquainted his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. with, I delayed this buſineſs untill the end of Aprill following; at which tyme, it ſucceeded happily; to the great contentment of the King, and of the Royalle famely: his Highneſs arrived firſt in Zealand; and the next day in Holland.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:48408:22"/>Sect. 96. About ſix weekes after, the Parliaments whole fleet, quitted their unlawfull maſters, came to anker in Gorée Rode; delivering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to the Duke of York as their Admirall; which they knew he was by the King his fathers patent; and was really the occaſion of their coming thither; and ſubmitting to him.</p>
            <p>Sect. 97. The winde which was favourable to bring them into Holland; prouved a ſtorme to me, which occaſioned my wrack ever ſince; haveing unhappily given ſome councell concerning that fleet (it ſeemes) with to much precipitation; which was well meant; very ill taken, becauſe moſt bitterly repreſented, by a perſon of quality, and (to doe him but Juſtice) of merit; betwixt whome, and me, there was at that time ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, about particular matters; who according to the ordinary practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in ſuch caſes; to ruine my credit, and increaſe his owne; held it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, to couver his private animoſity, under the ſpecious vaile of Zeal to a more publique intereſt. I ſhall againe declare, what I have ever proteſted; that I had no other end, or deſigne; then either freeing the King out of his Impriſonment in the Iſle of wight; or (if it were fownd Impoſſible, which I did not then belive (nor doe now) that is was) to have landed 1500. or 2000. men at yarmouth, to have countenanced a riſing in northfolke, ſuffolke, and the other adjacent Provinces of the eaſterne aſſotiation: the probabillity of the one, or of the other, I ſhall here expoſe to any reaſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſideration.</p>
            <p>Sect. 98. Firſt touching the Kings freedome; I had been aſſured out of England, of a landing place in the Iſland; which I looked upon, as the greateſt difficulty.</p>
            <p>Sect. 99. Secondly, that we Could have landed with 2000 Men; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing raiſed at that very tyme in Holland about 1200 Engliſh Soldiers, of the reduction, which the States had then made of the troupes of our nation, and might well have added to them upon ſuch an occaſion; 1000 ſea men choſen out of the Fleet; beſides that great aſſurances were given, that the inhabitants, would have riſen, with us, if we could have furniſhed them with armes, which was to have been done.</p>
            <p>Sect. 100. Thirdly, I could never conceave (in caſe of a free deſcent
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48408:23"/>
on land) any great, or long oppoſition wee Could have met with by ſea, not the leaſt; the Parliament, not haveing had one ſhip of war fitted out, in ten weekes, or three months after. By land, as little; except what Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Hamond Could have made, with not above 5 or 600 foote, which was all he had; nor Could have hoped for more. Cromwell with the greater part of the army was marched againſt the Scots; Fairefax engaged before Colcheſter; and ſome conſiderable parties, of the army, diverted into walles, by riſings there for the King at the ſame tyme. Moreover, if they Could have ſent an army entire to portſmouth; or any other part upon that coaſt; to have been tranſported into the Iſland; not a barque, or bote Could have paſſed, without either being ſunke, or taken. Beſides there were many of the braveſt, and beſt officers, whoe had ſerved his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. whoe were Embarqued in the fleet: as Prince Mauris, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. John Boyce, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Waſhington, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Francis Mackworth, and very Many more; whoe wee fownd retired into Holland at our arivall, and ſome followd; nor is it to be Imagined, that in ſoe glorious an enterpriſe; but that the greateſt conteſtation would have been, whoe ſhould have been readieſt to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifiſed themſelves. For my part I never could apprehend any other diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in this attempt, then to have landed; which we had great, and likely aſſurances of; and in all events, our retreat was ſure, and the fleet at liberty for any other deſigne, in caſe that could not have been effected.</p>
            <p>Sect. 101. Which was, to have landed at yarmouth; where we were ſure of a free reception: and did perſuade my ſelfe, that a body of 2000 Soldiers would have had the reputation of double the nomber; and have encouraged the whole county of northfolke to have riſen: which had been very well prepared by my tranſactions before my leaving of England; with S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. John Hobart, and divers more of the Gentry of that ſhire, by the Kings commands and credentials.</p>
            <p>Sect. 102. Theiſe were ye only ends I had in that tranſaction, which was then ye firſt ſtep to my utter ruine: if there were any little irregularity as to ſome formalities, in the way leading there unto; the moſt it Could have amounted to, was an errour committed throwgh to much precipitation, &amp; erneſtneſs, which (I hoped) could not have been conſidered as a crime.</p>
            <p>To have given advertiſement to the Queen, and Prince; fourteen days tyme (at leaſt) muſt have been loſt; which might have rendered the whole deſſein, either Impoſſible, or much more difficult, and hazardous. More
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48408:23"/>
over, if it ſhould have been refuſed (as peradventure it might) to have gone forewarde with any enterpriſe, howe neceſſary, how profitable, or how glorious ſoever, would have been conſidered as deſobedience, and have fallen under the interpretation of contempt.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I conſidered, that the firſt, and chiefe duty which then lay upon me, was to contribute all I could towards the conſervation; and liberty of the King; being likewiſe preſſed by a ſecond, which I concluded, weighed not much leſs, both of dependence, and obligation; from all which reaſons joyned to the Importance of the deſigne, which Could not admit delay, I thowght the wiſeſt courſe was to put it Imediately in practiſe, and after, to have excuſed the omiſſion of ſome circomſtances, by the weight and preſſure of the affaire. Beſides, I conſidered, that if the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs followed, which was reaſnable to hope for; a ſmall errour would have needed no great appologie: and if it did not; I was reſolved to bear the blame; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. I have abondantly done, thowgh I did not foreſee, it would have fallen ſoe heavy on me, nor have dured to perpetuity.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theiſe tranſactions, his late Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. arrived at Helvot ſluce; to whome a very bitter repreſentation was made, of my proceedings; notwithſtanding, twoe days after, his Majeſty was gratiouſly pleaſed, to vouchafe mee a free, and particular audience, to hear indifferently what I could ſay; either for my Juſtification, or excuſe, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. was much to the purpoſe, I have here aleaged. Haveing patiently heard me; his anſwer was, very neer in the following words, or at leaſt, exactly to the ſame ſence. Colonel Bamfield, I am unwilling to belive all I have been infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, concerning your late proceedings, about this fleet; for if I did, I ſhould truſt you no longer; wherefor I am willing to credit what you ſay, as to the ends you had; but even according to your owne acknowledgment, you cannot deny, but that you have (in the way to them) very much fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in your duty, and reſpect to me; but being contented to hope, that it has been throwgh haſte, and inconſideration, without malice; I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done this fault freely, and charge you not to be diſcontented; for if I ſhall ever perceave that you are, I ſhall be more diſpleaſed with you, then I am, for what you have now done.</p>
            <p>I confeſs nothing could have been, more generous, nor more gratious; and I reſented it accordingly; with that humility, and thanckfullneſs, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. I was obliged to doe.</p>
            <p>About the ſame tyme, the Scots with an army, of 20000. Men, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into England, anſwerable to the accord, that their commiſſioners,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48408:24"/>
not long before, had made with the late King, of ever happy Memory: his faithfull ſubjects in England, began to riſe in ſeverall parts of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as had before been agreed upon; it began in Kent, ſome thing unſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſnably, and throwgh ye little (or rather no) experience of thoſe whoe commanded, was more eaſily, and more ſpeedyly diſſipated, then was expected; had they underſtoode theyr undertaking; to have left their owne province, and marched to Arundel, in ſuſſex; ye neer adjoyning coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. was prepared to have riſen with them, before I left England: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing poſſeſſed themſelves of that faſt place, defended on the one ſyde by a navigable niver; on another, by a ſtrong caſtle, ſituated on all moſt an in acceſſible elevation; on a third by a deep lake; neer muſquet Shot over; and by cutting a narrow dam betwixt it, and the river; the water Could have fallen into it if needfull; on ye fourth, by a wall, and ditch, thowgh without flanque, which in twenty four howers Could have been caſt up, after the manner of a good intrenchment: about 200 paces further advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; was an old rampart of Earth, ſufficiently high, which reached from the elivation of grownd, where on ye Caſtel ſtands, to the ſide of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, which was a ſingular help, to a moſt advantagious retrenchment; which in eight and forty howers, by many hands, Could have been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of Admirable defence; by the direction of any, whoe underſtood the advantages of ground, for an encampment; and that had any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, generall knowledg of fortification; which moſt officers, of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, either underſtand reaſnably, or owght to doe: beſides, if it came to be forced; all the ground within it, was commanded, both by the Caſtel, and towne; and this part was the weakeſt of the foure; I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this only, as one of the ſtrongeſt, and moſt Important poſts in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or any where els that I have ſeen, for the defenſible encampment of any reaſnable body of an army; which that riſing in Kent, then amounted to; and would have been double the nomber had they marched to Arrundel, by the addition of force, they would have had, out of ſuſſex, and Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire; both which Provinces, were for divers months before prepared to riſe, with the firſt reaſnable occaſion; and poſting themſelves faſtly for defence, I much queſtion whither the army of Fairfax (which conſiſted nor at that tyme of 7000 foote) would have attempted them as they might have <hi>layne</hi>: at leaſt, would have fownd a long worke to have reduced them; and given tyme, and aportunity to the reſt of the nation to have riſen; and formed themſelves, into ſome conſiderable, and ſolid bodies. And as this had been, the moſt councellable, and alltogether Practicable, in that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48408:24"/>
part, and occaſion; ſoe had it been much more needfull, and profitable to the whole undertakeing, and common intereſt of the King, and his faithfull prople; had the Scots army taken the ſame meaſures, when they were advertiſed that Cromwell advanced towards them; and haveing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped themſelves advantagiouſly, with a ſufficient intrenchment, as they had places in abondance, where they marched to have done, allmoſt Impregnably; and by that means have kept themſelves from the neceſſity of fighting, unleſs upon ſuch certayne advantages, as muſt probably have produced the ruine of their enemy.</p>
            <p>As it was Cromwells intereſt, and reſolution, to fight them as ſoone as poſſibly he Could; ſoe was it no leſs theirs to temporiſe, by a defenſive war. After them; divers of ye nobility, and cheif Gentry, in Northumberland, Cumberland, Weſtmerland, and Yorkſhire, were in a combination together; and rayſing of forces with all diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; in ſoe much, that had the Scots but avoyded fighting, for the ſpace of one month; which with great eaſe they might have done, by the advantagious poſts, whereof in divers places throwgh which they had marched, they Could have had their choiſe: by a good entrenchment (which at other tymes, was obſerved, they ſufficiently underſtoode) the forces of the four Provinces I have named, would have in that tyme, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a ſolid body of an army, more conſiderable for Nomber, and in all other regards, then that of the Scots amounted to. Beſides thoſe of the eaſterne aſſotiation, were fully, and unanimouſly reſolved to rife: Cornwell; Devon, Somerſet, and Dorſet, the like; and wanted only a month or ſix weeks tyme: in ſine, the whole nation was prepared as to the ſame end; and were in the way towards it; when the ſtrange, and allmoſt wonderfull defeat of the Scots army; by Cromwells, not conſiſting of halfe their nomber; broake all other meaſures, which had been taken upon that fowndation, by concert ſome months before.</p>
            <p>As they had neglected what I have allready mentioned, touching en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment; ſoe when they came to fight (as if there had been a fatallity, both in the conduct; and ſucceſs, they neither made uſe of the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of their nomber, their army haveing been ſoe ranged, that the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateſt halfe of their troupes never came to fight; nor profited themſelves, of that benefit of the choyſe of grownd, and other commodities, which a defenſive army may have, againſt an enemy whoe attacques it; which owght allways to be held in cheife conſideration, by all experienced; and Provident ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48408:25"/>But to ceaſe from all further reflexions; that army was unfortunately bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and ſoe totally diſſipated, that it was not believed that 5000. of them, ever returned to Scotland: this miſcarriage and miſforture, ſtifled divers great deſignes abortively, upon the point of their production; and cut of others, which were begun, before they Could come to any maturity.</p>
            <p>Haveing been at that tyme, privy to all the deſignes, and meaſures, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and taken, in that conjoncture, and in thoſe tranſactions; as likewi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe actively induſtrious, in the contriving, and advancing of moſte of them; which (according to humane Judgment) I was fully perſuaded, could not have fayld of the end, where unto they were directed; of the Kings liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and happy reſtauration, both for himſelfe, his porſterity, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>His late Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. was out of the hands of his enemies; the King now raigning eſcaped out of England; the Parliaments whole fleet leaving them, returned to their obedience to their Souveraigne; the Scots entered into ye heart of England, with the formed body of an army of twenty thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men; riſings in ſeverall places; an univerſall, and well formed reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, throwgh the whole nation, to doe the ſame; and upon the very point of being put in execution; one great (and indeed unreaſnable) er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and twoe, or three others, not much leſs (which to avoyd tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as well as for other reaſons I mention not) ruined all; and ſhortly after, the whole fabrique of Gouverment; cauſing ſuch a violent, and Generall Conflagration, as I fear even to this day, has never been totally extinguiſhed; but as fyer hid in the cavernes of the earth, is often ſubject to make very dangerous irruptions.</p>
            <p>The Scotch army totally defeated; Cromwell Marched towards Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; all other parties in England, which had declared for his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. were eaſily diſſipated, and all places ſudainly reduced; the humane cauſe, of this extraordnary, and moſt un apprehended ruine of the Scots forces, was attributed, to the ſecret correſpondence, which was more then belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to have been, betwixt ſome of the diſſenting clergy (which were much the greateſt nomber) with other of the nobillity, whoe had oppoſed moſt violently, that expedition into England; and Cromwell. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the great influence they had upon a conſiderable part of that army; which was knowne to ſome; and had very convincing appearences to all: both from their extraordinary conduct, in ſuffering themſelves to be conſtrained to fight againſt their wills, and contrary to the common intereſt, of the Cauſe they had in hand; and when they engaged; ſoe Improvidently to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48408:25"/>
have ordered the buſineſs; as not to have browght halfe their army to fight: as likewiſe from the tranſactions, and accord, betwixt Cromwell, and that partie of the Scotch, when he came upon their borders.</p>
            <p>The whole face of things, being thus unexpectedly changed, the more ſevere part of the Preſbitereans, whoe had not long before concurred, with the armies partie in both houſes, to the vote, of non adreſſes to the King, apprehending (when it was to late) the danger of the totall ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of the antient Gouverment, of the three Nations; by theiſe allmoſt prodigeous ſucceſſes of the army, changed their mindes; forſooke the army party; and joyning themſelves, to the moderate Preſbitereans (whoe in truth, and reallity, were ſtrong Proteſtants, but no Preſbitereans) were by much; the more numerous in both houſes; nullified the former reſolution of non adreſſes to the King; and agreed to a ſpeedy treaty with him; hopeing to have concluded it before Cromwells army, Could March ſouthward, and joyne with Fairefax; ſoe to have browght his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. with freedome, Honour, and ſafety to London: to have voted all the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall officers commiſſions voyde; to have employd others in their charges; and at the ſame tyme, to have rayſed a niew army in, and about London: by which means, it was hoped, all parties would have agreed together, whoe were frends to the antient Gouverment; and to the lawes of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which were undoubtedly, nine parts of ten, in all three Kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</p>
            <p>A day was prefixed, for the beginning of the treaty, forty days limited for its continuation; thowgh that it was belived, it would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, in ten; throwgh the neceſſity of the intereſts on both ſides. Which had it been, I am confident the King had been happily reſtored, and a multitude of Calamities prevented; which enſued at (and ſince) his death; and (as may be feared) are not yet ſoe entirely ended, as wiſe, and honeſt men may wiſh. Artickles were drawne up, and Commiſſioners ſent away with them to the Iſle of wight. About which tyme, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. William Moray then of the bedchambre to his Royale Highneſs, whoe was permitted to be about the King, during the treaty; wrote me word, that his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. had commanded him, to let me know, that if I Could come into England, either by permiſſion of the Parliament (where the Preſbitereans had at that tyme the power) or ſecretly; my negotiations, at that conjoncture with thoſe whoe had formerly had communication with me, about his affaires; and my advertiſements to him, might be of great uſe.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as I had received the letter, without much ballancing, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48408:26"/>
the danger which I expoſed my ſelfe to; I repayred to fluſhing, hired a fiſher boate of expreſſly, haveing deſguiſed my ſelfe, as much as I could, arriving in twoe days at London, where I remayned ſecretly during the treaty. Very ſhortly after, haveing ſpoaken with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Moray, whoe the King ſent expreſſly to me, with a letter, and with his Commands; I fownd means to ſpeak with Generall Waller (whoe was returned from the Hague, whither he was conſtrained to fly, ſome months before, and ſate now againe in Parliament) and by his means, and ordnarily at his houſe, with divers others of both houſes. The great, and ſevere demands about church Gouverment, which really, and ſencibly, touched his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. conſcience, in regard of his othe, and of other conſiderations, the firſt forty days to which the treaty was limited were expired, without coming to a concluſion; in which tyme I had written very often to the King, and received letters from him; in all I writ, I humbly, and yet freely (as the matter required) repreſented to him, the dangerous, and allmoſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition of his affaires, by the protraction of tyme; and dit not faile on the other ſide; to lay before thoſe perſons, of both houſes, with who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me I had dayly Communication; as demonſtrably, and as forcibly, as my reaſon Could reach to; the horrible confuſion, which would inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly arrive, both in religion; and the Politique Gouverment, to the utter ruine of the nation; the conſequencies where of, their poſterity might feel, and bewaille, in caſe the accord were not concluded tyme enough, to make ſome reaſnable, and ſolid Proviſion; againſt the deſperate deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Cromwell, and his army (which was on its march furiouſly towards London) before it Could arrive there; deſiring them to conſider; that they would finde empty Imaginations, ſupported only by the votes of both houſes; to weak to encounter the reall dangers, which threatned them, and the Nation; by the audatious violence of thoſe, whoe had allready gone ſoe far towards their pernitious projects, that they Could never thinke themſelves ſecure, but by goeing boldly on to ye bloody accompliſhment of it: which was clearly, and dayly perceaved, by the comportment of Cromwells party in both houſes.</p>
            <p>I wrote an ample letter, as ſencibly, and convincingly as I could to the ſame effect, to the late Lord Hollis, which to my knowledg, haveing effaced my name (whither for his owne, or my conſideration I know not) he read to others of the commiſſioners; and fownd means to let the King ſee it: thowgh at the ſame tyme, I wrote fully to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. particularly, and plainly: it being then no ſeaſon to leſſen, or render objects more agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48408:26"/>
then they were in themſelves. I repreſented, that Cromwells army advanced with all poſſible diligence, I acquainted him with the practices of his party, both in the Parliament, the citty of London, and in ſeverall other parts of the Nation where they had influence: humbly beſeeching him to conclude the treaty, before the army Could approache, to hinder the effects of it: that the Parliament might have had tyme, to have declared all the Generall officers commiſſions voyde; and ſome others, whoe were moſt deſperately active: to make niew Generalls, and to raiſe an army in the citty of London, and in the neereſt adjacent Provinces: and to bring his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. with honour, and freedome to London: and ſince it was feared; that he whoe commanded the Guards about the King, would not have obeyd; as to what concerned his perſon; in ſuch an unhappy event, I added ſome particulars; which I thowght moſte conducible, not only to the prevention of the greateſt, and neereſt danger to which his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lay expoſed; but in the worſt which could fall out, to the preſervation of Monarchy, in the perſons of his poſterity, in their juſt degrees, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the due courſe of law, in that caſe provided, and not otherwiſe: it is moſt true, that upon a weighty matter, I had a moſt juſt, and neceſſary occaſion, to mention nominally twoe of his children to him (as I had done when I judged it requiſite very often before) adding for the concluſion of that paragraffe, which contained my humble opinion (for it was no more) theiſe following words: that it would undoubtedly be a great ſecurity to his affaires, and of no leſs encouragement to his frends; when his children were at the head of thoſe whoe ſhould appear for him; where withall I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my letter, which was the laſt that ever I had the honour to write to him. Had it been then printed, would have fully convinced all men whoe might have read it, of my Loyallty, and Zeal, to the King; and for the preſervation of his perſon; and no leſs of my fidelity, and affection to the ſervice of his lawfull ſucceſſours in theire juſt degrees; as God, Nature, and the lawes of the Land had ordayned; without ever mentioning, or ſoe much as thinking upon, that villainous, and moſt fooliſh hyſteron, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teron which I was ſecretly accuſed of (not long after the Kings death) by one ſingle perſon alone, to have inſerted in that letter. Had it been ſoe; it neither was, nor is comprehenſible, howe he Could have knowne it; I never truſted him enough; to let him have ſeen any letter I either wrote, or received: nordid I ever know, any perſon of what quality ſoever, more exactly circomſpect, in Keeping of his correſpondencies ſecret; and the letters of thoſe whoe wrote to him, then his late Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. was: nor Could he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48408:27"/>
have had any end, which might have counterballanced, the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that were reaſnable to apprehend for his ſervice; by communicating that letter to him; or indeed to any els; unleſs it had been for their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel (which this perſon in the judgment of all whoe knew him, was no ways capable of, nor proper for) in which regard his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. would rather have communicated it to ſome other perſons, of the greateſt capacity in the nation; and of the greateſt credit with him; and were at that tyme permitted about him; then to a yongue Man, of no Importance; and whoe had never ſerved him: the truth is; had I wrote, what I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to have done; it had been in the higheſt degree, factious, and ſeditious; as well, as the moſt fooliſh project, and propoſition, which Could have entered into the thowghts of any man, not actually in a frenzy; and fitter for bedlam, then for any reaſnable ſociety: nor Could I ever obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, that my greateſt enemies; were at any tyme inclined to place me in that cattegory. In fin my letter was never produced; nor ſeen by any man, that I Could hear of; but by my accuſer; nor by him neither, in that ſence he reported it. I well know to what an extent words written, as well as ſpoken, may be wreſted; if there can in them, be any poſſibility of a double ſence, the change of a point, of a comma, or of the leaſt accent, may vary a whole ſentence, or periode; as may be confirmed by a multitude of examples, both in hiſtory, and frequent moderne practice: but in what I wrote, there was nothing but ſimple and categorique naratives, of matters of fact; pregnant, and viſible dangers; and humble repreſentations, touching the beſt, and likelieſt means, to obviate, and prevent them: where of his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. himſelfe, was the moſt competent judge, whither they were reaſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, honeſt, and appliquable to the condition he then was; to have been made uſe of, or rejected; according to his owne prudence, and pleaſure. I ſhall here conclude this; where upon I have the longer inſiſted, as being the fowndation of my utter ruine: the ſource, of my great ſufferings, during ſix, or ſeaven years; and thoſe calamities, and neceſſities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into I was plonged, at that tyme, the cauſes of my offending his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. to that degree he ever remained.</p>
            <p>It is beyond the limits I propownd to my ſelfe, to enlarge to a particular relation, of the artickles preſented to the King, of the debates, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes there upon, during the treaty, which has been allready the worke of other pens more proper for it then mine, I ſhall only ſay, that had his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. and the Parliaments Commiſſioners, come to the ſame concluſion,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48408:27"/>
they at laſt did, fut twenty days ſooner (which they might have done, for to the beſt of my remembrance, there were twice fourteen dayes added to the firſt forty, which was ſpun out to the laſt three or four) the King in my opinion, had not come to a violent death; the Nation, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtante Religeon, had been free from the infamy there of; and ſecured, againſt the cruel confuſions, which Imediately followed the effuſion of that blood; all thowgh his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. and the Parliament were fully agreed; and his conceſſions voted entirely ſatiſfactory; and a ſufficient fowndati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for a happy peace, and firme eſtabliſhment in all his Dominions; yet by the violence of the army, which over whelmed all; very much the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateſt part of the Parliament were ſecluded; and allways kept out; till Ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the Preſent Kings reſtauration; divers of the members em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and others conſtrayned to ſave themſelves beyond ſea.</p>
            <p>In this deplorable condition of things, his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. a little before he was remouved from Niewport by the army to Hurſt Caſtel, apparently calling to minde what I had ſeverall tymes repreſented to him, was gratiouſly pleaſed to ſend me by Mr. William Moray, the enſuing letter.</p>

            <p>Imediately after his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> death; I was ſuſpended from the Honour of wayting where I had done; and my coming to the court prohibited; which cauſed me to continue ſecretly, and deſguiſed in England, in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not knowing well (in the diſgrace I then was plonged) how to ſubſiſt els where; beſides that I hoped there, to finde ſome favourable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, of ſerving the King; where by to remouve his diſpleaſure, thowgh it prouved not ſoe eaſy a matter, as ſome to Conſolate me, flattered me with the beliefe of.</p>

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:48408:28"/>I remayned in that condition about a year, ſome tymes in one place, and ſome tymes in another; till at length, I was betrayd by one whoe had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me long, whome I had bred up from a boy, and much obliged. I was taken, and Impriſoned, and had certainly loſt my head; unleſs by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordnary Providence of God, I had fownd the means of ſaveing my ſelfe throwgh a window of the Priſon; which (all circonſtances conſidered) was little leſs then Miraculous: the ſea ports were ſoe layd for me, that I was conſtrained to remaine ſecretly in the citty of London, in faithfull frends houſes during the ſpace of three weeks, when at laſt, I was convey'd over into Holland, by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Roger de Lyvedy Capitaine of a Man of war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Rotterdam, whoſe brother was ſince vice Admirall of the Meu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe; twoe or three years after, his ſhip was ſeized upon at Hull, he put in Priſon, where I have heard he dyed.</p>
            <p>I had no ſooner ſet foote on land, but I was forced into another miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which was unavoydable, that conſtrained me for ſome tyme, to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke my refuge at vienna neer utrect; which added to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. indignation; but it pleaſed God, that the occaſion in few weekes was taken away; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re upon I repayred to Breda, where the King was in treaty with the Scots Commiſſioners; his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. would not permit me to appear in his Preſence, nor at his court; he agreed with them, went into Scotland; it was not alowed me to wayte on him thither, thowgh I made uſe of the interceſſion of ſome great perſons, in no leſs credit with him, to obtayne that Grace.</p>
            <p>Shortly after I followed, in company with the with the Earle of Diſert, where being arrived Duke William Hamilton, whoe was killed at woſter, the late Duke of Lauderdalle, with moſt of the Nobility of Scotland, whoe were then about his perſon, employ'd theire mediation, as erneſtly, as duty, and deſcretion would admit, to bring me into grace, but Could not obtayne any thing; which conſtrained me to returne againe into Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>In this State I continued about five years, endeavouring to doe all the ſervices I Could: frequently, agitated, betwixt hope, and deſpaire; till at length I had the happineſs to performe ſuch a ſervice as that ſome very great perſons, both in quality, and credit, Improuved it all they Could, to reſtore me to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. favour; whoe prevayled ſoe far, as that he was pleaſed, to admit me into his Preſence, and to kiſs his hand; as allſoe to receive the account I had to give him, of ſome matters which regarded his ſervice; and to deliver his opinion freely enough, concerning perſons, and things, relative there unto.</p>

The reading ended, I was aſked whoe I meant, by the perſon not named, on whome I had made divers reflexions; I waved the declaring thereof, by all the evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that my invention Could furniſh me with; foreſeeing into what a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berinthe of <hi>niewe</hi> trowbles I ſhould winde my ſelfe; if I entered into the liſt with him: I knew it would be in all kindes, impar congreſſus A chilli: at length, the King himſelfe commanded me to declare whoe I meant: which without the higheſt contumacy, I was obliged to doe: thus finding my ſelfe in volontarily engaged; I undertooke the Juſtifying of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of my letter; which I endeavoured with much more ardor, then was ſutable to the condition where in I at that tyme was; whereby I offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. in the higheſt degree; and was blamed even by thoſe preſent, whoe wiſhed me well.</p>
            <p>This niew wound prouved incurable; leading the King to a reſolution of remouving me entirely out of his ſervice, whereof, I wanted not infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: which made me ſeek an oportunity to have audience by him: which at length I obtayned.</p>
            <p>I began to ſpeak about things, which concerned his ſervice in Scotland; haveing heard me; and demanded ſome queſtions, which naturally aroſe from what I had repreſented; I Could perceave by his anſwer in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48408:29"/>
that he had no minde to have that ſtring further touched upon: in ſoe much that I paſſed from it; to my owne particular concernments: after haveing layd before him, the unhappineſs of my condition, throwgh the long continuance of his diſpleaſure; I humbly beſowght him to graunt me any one of three things; he was pleaſed to reject all; thowgh they were eaſy; of ſmall Importance, and without the poſſibility (as I conceaved) of any harmfull conſequence: where upon, I threw my ſelfe on my knie, humbly beſeeching him not to caſt me entirely of; that I had ſerved his Royall father; his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. himſelfe, and the Crowne; faithfully from my youth: that I had the ſame affection to his Perſon, and fidelity to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which I had ever profeſſed; and in many occaſions, ſignally demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated: that nothing Could deminiſh my Zeal, but unreſiſtable neceſſity.</p>
            <p>His Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. anſwered, he Could not belive, that thoſe would ſerve him faithfully, whoe he did not thinke well affected to him: that I had ways of my owne, and followed my owne councells in his buſineſs, which he would not ſuffer; I replyed, that if I had done ſoe; it had been when I was at ſuch a diſtance from him, that I Could not receive his orders, and that what I did, I thowght beſt for his ſervice; but that in the future, I would never doe any thing relating to publique affaires, without his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties poſitive commands: he replyed, I cannot graunt any of the things you deſire; one of them at this tyme, is not in my power; not being in a condition to helpe thoſe I would: the other twoe, I doe not thinke for my ſervice; nor have I any further employment for you. The to ſencible anxiety, wherein I was; finding my ſelfe irreparably ruined; utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all means to ſubſiſt, and hopeleſs for the future: ſoe trowbled my reaſon, that I broke out of thoſe bowndes of duty, and profownd reſpect; which in all conditions, I owght as a ſubject; much more as a meniall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to have confined my ſelfe to; and ſayd, it is Impoſſible for me to live thus any longer; if your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. will abſolutely abandon me, I can have no other refuge, then to endeavour to returne into England; and ſeek my bread amongſt your enemies, whoe I have hitherto oppoſed, with all the vigour, and induſtry, I Could: where upon he roſe from the chear where he gave me audience, and told me; I have no more to ſay to you, nor will ever have more to doe with you; and ſoe retired out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>Some perſons of the greateſt Calibre, by whoſe means I had obtayned that audience, whoe were preſent at a little diſtance, and had heard all that was ſayd, reproched me with indignation, for my laſt words; calling them
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48408:29"/>
raſh, undutifull, and inſolent; and that none of my frends (afterwards) Could ſpeak more in my favour; with many other ſuch like expreſſions; and indeed, I fownd them ever after much more Cold then formerly: I procured an audience againe from one of them; not without ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which was likewiſe, the laſt, I ever had; where repreſenting the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my condition, and mentioning (as modeſtly as I Could dreſs my complaints up) my paſt ſervices for divers years, which were very well knowne to the perſon to whome I ſpake; one whoe was by, made anſwer in ſome kinde of heat; all your paſt ſervices, are loſt in the ill ſucceſs of the Kings buſineſs: Other expreſſions, as ſharpe as that, were added; which I then thowght (as I now doe) were ſpoken, to drive mee off from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of ſubſiſtance, from thoſe to whome I had adreſſed my ſelfe; fearing (peradventure) that my ayme was to pin my ſelfe on them, whoe at that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joncture, were in no very oppulent condition. I ſowght, and (in private for all were cautious of me, ſeeing the Kings great, and declared diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) obtained an audience, from another, where I had placed my laſt hope, and refuge: he heard me attentively, but ſayd little: only in the concluſion, he told me he was very ſorry for me, but ſaw not how he Could help me: to appear in my behalfe would make my condition rather worſe, then better; as he ſayd I might my ſelfe eaſily conceave; and Could in ſome kinde prove diſadvantagious to himſelfe; upon which termes I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, never haveing ſpoken to him ſince; nor is it likely, that I ever ſhall.</p>
            <p>Thus finding my diſeaſe (under which I had long languiſhed) become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable; and that all thoſe, whoe had either kindeneſs, or compaſſion for me; began to apprehend my ſickneſs as contagious: as is done in the peſt (<hi>with a Lord have mercy upon me</hi>) had abandonned me: as periſhing men in a ſhipwrack, ſave themſelves as they can; ſoe I returned into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, haveing no other refuge in nature: which I did openly, and avowed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I had before declared I ſhould be conſtrained to doe.</p>
            <p>During the intervall betwixt that tyme, and his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. reſtauration, I did many things, which gave him Juſt reaſon to continue, and to augment his indignation, if that were poſſible.</p>
            <p>The King was out of his dominions, another authority eſtabliſhed; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re unto the three nations either volontarily, or by conſtrainte had ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Being thus Throwne out of his ſervice, and out of all truſt, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; I abandonned my ſelfe to thoſe councels, which an inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table neceſſity ſugeſted to me, that according to the Judgment of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme legiſlator, renders divers other lawes diſpenſable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48408:30"/>I ſtayd not long in England; had no converſation with any of the Kings frends; which I avoyded more then many of them did me. I was ſeldome there; but haveing concluded a very advantagious capitulation, with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Tillier, at preſent Chancellour of France; for the rayſing of a Regiment of 2500 Engliſh, and Scots, and had obtayned liberty to doe it; I returned to London, to procure Marchands ſecurity, for my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the conditions, on my part agreed upon, before the mony I was to receive, Could be payd me. Haveing accompliſhed, what was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to the contentment of thoſe concerned; a man of war was offered me, for my retranſport to Deep, without my demanding it: I wondered a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, at the great civility; conſidering it, as a good preſage, that I ſhould meet with no niew interuption, in the progreſs of my buſineſs: I went the next day poſte to Dover; ſending thence to the Downes, the order I had for a frigat to come thither, where I thowght to have embarqued my ſelfe: whileſt I wayted for it, dreaming of nothing leſs then Impriſonment; the Gouvernour of the Caſtel, with the Major of the Towne, together with ſome Soldiers came into my chamber, ſhewing me an order from Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, to ſeize all my papers, and to bring me, and my ſervants, priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners into the caſtle; not one of them, haveing been permitted about me; nor to ſpeak together, before they were examined; which the next day was performed: but my turne came not untill three or four days after; which was executed with great formality, and no leſs ſeverity, upon ſeaven Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickles: which I looked upon, as very ſtrange, and without any the leaſt poſſibility of fowndation; in ſoe much, that my anſwers, were poſitive, and ſome thing negligent; ſufficiently knowing, that according to their owne conſtitution, in thoſe tymes; they Could doe no more to me, then to revoke what had been graunted, concerning my leavies, and to keep me in reſtraint for ſome tyme. In a few days, I was again examined for the ſecond tyme; not in the order I had been at firſt, but very confuſedly, hopeing to have intrapped me in ſome contradiction; but my anſwers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing been in ſubſtance the ſame, as at firſt, no advantage Could be fownd againſt me, by that courſe; and to have prouved any materiall point, I knew was Impoſſible: which made me appear very indifferent, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the uncivile, and rude threatnings, of one of my Commiſſaryes.</p>
            <p>The only thing, which had any ſhadow of truth, or reaſon, was; that a few days before my parting from London, a Gentileman with whome; I was very intimate, being at that tyme Gouvernour of a conſiderable place whoe in his heart, I knew was not paſſionately in love with the cauſe he was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48408:30"/>
engaged in; haveing told me in confidence, that another, underhand ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited his charge, and he feared might deprive him of it. I was very free, and open, in my Councells to him, touching the beſt means to conſerve it; adding in the concluſion, that as long as he held that poſt, in all events which Could happen, he might keep himſelfe conſiderable: he anſwered me not a word touching that point: but after a ſhort, and deep Meditation; diverted his diſcource, to another ſubject: the next day he acquainted Cromwell with the Councel, I had given him; not without, both chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and addition: whither this had been concerted before, and that he was employ'd to counterfeit, jalouſy, and diſcontent to in ſnare me; or that he thowght to profit himſelfe in that occaſion, by manifeſting his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grety throwgh his diſcouvery, to preſerve his charge I Could wever know, nor with my ſelfe determine; this information, gave more credit to other Articles, then otherwiſe, they would have met with; which Cromwell himſelve, as lenght reflected on, as artificial contrivements, of ſome whoe he knew (by many intercepted letters) were not my frends, to obſtruct my levies; and to ruine my credit in England, at that tyme; to prevent my doeing the harme, they apprehended, which I never meant: at this very conjoncture, there hapned a miſunderſtanding at the Kings Court (then) at Bridges in Flanders; ſome perſons haveing retyred thence to the Hage; where upon purpoſely to ruine me, advertiſement was given to Cromwell; that all beit, I was very deep in his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. diſpleaſure (which he knew as well as they) yet I was well with others, whoe were no leſs his enimies; and that my pretext for liberty, to make levyes for France, was but to couver the deſigne I had, to begin a fowndation, for the advancement of another intereſt; ſome circomſtances, relating to my affaires (where of he was not ignorant) afforded no ſmall probability to this information, where in he was the more confirmed, by the Gouvernours advertiſement, whoe I have mentioned, being likewiſe ſtrengthned, by another, of little leſs Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: which was, that Imediately, before my parting from paris, I had ſayd ſomething occaſionally, to a perſon of quality of my owne nation, in confidence; that concerned England, and Spayne; he contrary to his promiſe, acquainted one of the French Miniſters with it, whoe wrote it to Monſieur Bourdaux then Ambaſſadour in England, and by him was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Cromwell; theſe twoe circomſtances gave much credit to the chiefe information.</p>
            <p>Haveing layne under this reſtraint, three weekes, and nothing to have been prouved, but the Gouvernours advertiſement, the buſineſs of Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48408:31"/>
being accommodated; the grownds whereof he at laſt knew; and was fully convinced that I was not faulty in the great deſigne. Which being urged by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. John Renolds, with ſome others, throwgh their frequent ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations for my liberty; and for my permiſſion to proceed in my levies; he acknowledged that nothing ſtuck with him, ſaveing the councell I had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Gouvernour I have allready mentioned: they aleaged, that all humane affaires were ſubject to mutation; and that if any change ſhould happen, my words Implied no more then a bare poſſibility thereof; but not that I knew of any; or that I did wiſh, or would further it. That the Councel I gave, was to a frend, whoe demanded it; whoe then was, and whoe allways had been in his intereſts; and that any man, upon the like occaſion, might have given the ſame Councel.</p>
            <p>His final anſwer was; that after haveing Impriſoned Colonel Bamfield, we can neither truſt him, nor he us: wherefor I cannot now conſent to his levies, nor to his continuance in any of the dominions of this common wealth: his liberty he ſhall have, upon his engagement, to retire abrode within four days; and not to returne into any of the three Nations, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout leave of the Gouverment: which I did, was ſet at liberty; and to keep my word more exactly then I was conſtrained to; haveing ſtayd one day at Dover; the next, I hyred off an open ſhaloup to calais; where I fell ſick of a violent feaver; which confined me for ſome tyme to that place. Thus I fownd my ſelfe utterly ruined in his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. favour, caſt out of his ſervice for ever: and by this contrivement, and accident (for both were in the buſineſs) to gayne my liberty, was conſtrained to enter into a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lontary exile: loſt with the Gouverment which then was; totally fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the chiefe end (for which I had broken with all my former frends; by procuring leave, (contrary to their Councels;) for my returne into England) which was to have gotten my ſelfe to the head of a Regiment of 2500. Men of my owne Nation, in the King of Frances ſervice; whereby I Could have ſubſiſted with honour; and Gouverned my ſelfe in other things, according to events.</p>
            <p>During my ſickneſs, which was violent, I fownd my ſelfe ſuffiently contented to dye; for being ruined with all the world, ſmall hopes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning to recouver my ſelf; I Could better have ſubmitted to a quiet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath, then to have ſuffered thoſe bitter anxieties of a turbulent, and afflicted life; which I fore ſaw I was likely to undergoe, as hath befallen me, from that very tyme, to this day; but the periode, either of our lives, or trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles comes not, as we often deſire: Haveing recouvered my health; I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48408:31"/>
endeavoured to calme my minde; which was not without diſordre; and to bear patiently thoſe calamities, which I then felt: and to fortify my ſelfe to ſuffer thoſe, which I foreſawe, I was likely to undergoe; by a decree greater, and more ſouveraigne then ſolomans; which would require a ſupport, ſublimer, then what reaſon, or Philoſophy, Could afford; feeling in my ſelfe, Juſt cauſe for what I apprehended; when I deeply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, on the violent paſſions, inordinate affections, and to great infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my life paſt. I knew, plethorique bodies, repleat with vitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours (if there were any hope of cure) had need of ſtrong, and ſearching phiſick. Which preparitories, have kept me from being entirely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, with what I have ſince undergone.</p>
            <p>I returned no more into England, till the death of Cromwell; which came to paſs, neer twoe years after: S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. William Lockart, whoe was then Cromwels Ambaſſadour in France, and Gouvernour of Dunkirck, to whome I had been knowne, before he fell into that intereſt; gave me a paſs; with a letter of recommandation to one of his frends, whoe was at that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in great credit.</p>
            <p>The factions, and diviſions, in the army: the vinverſall diſcontents, in all the three-Nations; which Could not longer bear, the confuſions; of thoſe tymes; being deſtitute of all Principles of Gouverment; either in church or ſtate: the weakneſs of him whoe ſucceeded; and of thoſe whoe followed him; that amidſt the greateſt Anarchy in the world, figured to themſelves, a chimerical Democratie; which one of them Called a republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, as durable as the ſun, and moone; wherein he vanted himſelfe to have more greatneſs, then he wiſhed for; which in eight months tyme afterwards, terminated in a ſtrict Impriſonment in the Tower of London where he dyed; and his republique (as uſually Anarchies doe) ended in Monarchy, many of the greateſt, and wiſeſt men of the three Nations ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion of thoſe deſorders, which underhand ſome of them increaſed, all they Could; opened the way to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. re-eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>The next day after his arivall at whitehall, I was comitted cloſe Priſonner to the Tour of London, into the cuſtody of a perſon, whoe had been one of the late Kings Judges, whoe was not only pardoned, but continued for ſome tyme, as Lieutenant of that place this may deſervedly be conſidered as a wonderfull diſpenſation, to ſee me (whoe had very often hazarded my life, for the ſervice of the crowne, and eſpecially for the preſervation of that King) become a priſoner under the care of one whoe had a principal hand in his death; becauſe he was cunning enowgh, to help to deſtroy his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48408:32"/>
fellowes, but a few days before the late Kings reſtauration, and when he plainly perceaved, there was no humane poſſibility to hinder it. I remained under a ſevere reſtraint about aleaven months; when by order, I was browght by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. John Robinſon (then Commanding the Tower, the former haveing been remouved) to whitehall to be examined; which I was upon divers Artic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles; by the Earle of Clarendon, at that tyme Lord Chancellour, and by the twoe Secretaries of State, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Edward Nicolas, and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. William Maurits. What was true, I acknowledged; pleading an inevitable neceſſity for what I had done; aleadging that thoſe things, Could not amount to the crime, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the warrant for my committment; which was upon ſuſpition of miſpriſion of treaſon; my Lord Chancellour told me I was browght thither, only to anſwer cattegorically, to what was demanded of me. That pleading of my cauſe, was for another place, if it ſhould be thowght fit to bring me thither: notwithſtanding that rebuke, upon my further examination; as the matter required, and Could permit, I defended my ſelfe, as reaſnably as I Could; in ſoe much, that his Lordſhip told me, Colonel Bamfield, I can perceave, that you have not been alltogether Idle in the Tower; ſeeing you are arrived at ſoe much knowledg in the law, at leaſt as you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; but I muſt tell you, that your wiſeſt, and ſureſt refuge will be, to have your recourſe to the Kings clemency, and not to your Juſtification. I anſwered him, I had great need of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. Grace; that I threw my ſelfe at his feet, and Implored it with all humility; but was fully perſuaded that his LoPP. deſired not, that I ſhould acknowledge my ſelfe, more guilty then I was: he replyed no God forbid; but it behouves you to be very Carefull, that ſome things you deny, come not to be prouved, which the King has been informed of, and belives: I added no more, but if they Could be prouved, I deſired no Grace.</p>
            <p>This examination laſted longer there; then is neceſſary, it ſhould doe here. In the concluſion, I was commanded to withdrawe into an ante chamber, where ſome of the nobility, and divers Gentilemen were, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by the fier; and I went alone to a window over againſt them; about halfe an hower after; my Lord chancellour, and the Secretaries Came out; and being ready to paſs by me; his LoPP. drew a little towards me, and I with a profownde reverence, neerer to him: he ſayd aloude in the hearing of all preſent: Colonel Bamfield, I am your freind: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Secretaries, and I, are ſencible of your ſufferings, and will doe all we can to obtayne you the Kings Grace, and to procure your liberty. And turning to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. John Robinſon, ſayd, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Lieutenant you may let him have the full liberty of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48408:32"/>
the Tower; and all his frends whoe deſire it, the freedome to viſit him as we returned back in the barge, to the tower; amongeſt other diſcource (for then he was become very civile, whoe before had treated me excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rudely) S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. John Robinſon told me, that he had conceaved my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have been much otherwiſe then he fownd it: that my Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, had been as moderate in his reflexions on my anſwers, after I was gone out, as he had been in the examination; and at the end of the debate, ſpake theiſe following words. The ſomme of all is, that Colonel Bamfield has ſerved the Crowne from his youth; and when we left him, he left us.</p>
            <p>About three months after; his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. ſent an order for my liberty. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſome tyme in London, where I lived with the greateſt circomſpection Imaginable, not to give cauſe of jalouſy, or offence to any. Till at length S<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Allen Apſly (treaſurer to his Royale Highneſs) whoe did me the honour ſome tymes to ſee me, with a civile and frendly introduction, to very ill niews; told me in plain termes, that the court was againe abondantly unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed with me; and that Particularly, his Royale Highneſs, the Duke of Yorke, had commanded him to tell me, that I owght to be carefull of my comportment, that if I fell into any trowble, he would have nothing to doe with me; adding theiſe words, the Duke is ſoe diſpleaſed with you; that I belive it eaſier for you to recouver the Kings favour then his.</p>
            <p>I with ſome Importunity urged him to tell me, if he knew any thing of the cauſe; to which he gave no other anſwer, then that the beſt cource he Could adviſe me to, was, for ſome tyme to retire my ſelfe out of England; till the publique affaires were ſoe re-ſettled, that there might remaine no grounds of jalouſy concerning me. I replyed, I ſhall take this night to thinke of it, and would the next day give him an account of my reſolution; which I did the morning following before he was out of his bed.</p>
            <p>I told him, that I had duly weighed his councel, and was determined to follow it; that thowgh the ſtorme I had ſtoode out, ſeemed to have been abated, yet I Could perceave the ſea was ſtil unquiet, the winde contrary, and my ankers not the ſureſt; in ſoe much that I ſhould ſeek another port; his anſwer was, you doe very wiſely; for in caſe the leaſt newe diſorder ſhould ariſe; I am ſoe much your frend, as to tell you freely, that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade my ſelfe, you would be confined to a perpetuaile Impriſonment. I replied I had rather dye; he told me bruſquly, that; you may eaſily doe, if you have a minde to it.</p>
            <p>I beſowght him to acquaint his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. that if he pleaſed to give me leave;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48408:33"/>
I would for ſome tyme retire out of his Dominions, till the affaires of ſtate were ſoe ſettled to his contentment, that my returne might give no ombrage.</p>
            <p>The apprehenſion of a continuel Impriſonment, had ſoe alarmed me; that I was willing to be gone as ſoone as I could; which made me haſten to him agayne, twoe days after: he told me he had fownd occaſion to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the King my humble reſolution of retirement; which his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouved.</p>
            <p>He added likewiſe, that he had acquainted my Lord Chancellour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; whoe he ſayd commended my diſcretion; councelled me to carry my ſelfe abrode, circomſpectly, and Dutifully, not haveing to doe with factious, or ſciſmaticall people; by which means he hoped to ſee me (in ſome tyme) recalled from my volontary baniſhment. Theiſe diſcources of his, together with ſome advertiſements I had, from a perſon of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, at that tyme of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. councel, whoe either out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, or frendſhip; by one of his neer relations, had deſired to meet me in a third place; cauſed me to haſten my departure with ſoe much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, as to leave my torne affaires, in a very deſorderly condition: for he gave me ſome light, into the reaſons of my niew deſgrace; as my often frequenting of ſome places, thowgh moſt publiquely; which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to my diſadvantage, as all things in nature, at that tyme, by ſome would have been: ſecondly that I had ſpoken words, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſon, with greater confidence, then diſcretion; which were loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon, as marques of remaining diſcontent, and of factious inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he told me the expreſſions, but aſſured me, that he knew not whoe the reporter was: where upon I named the perſon; avowing that I had ſayd thoſe words, or to the ſame effect. Acquainting him with the occaſion; which was that this Gentileman, was not at that tyme in very much greater grace, in the court, then I; with whome ſome tymes I met occaſionally; and at other oportunities he did me the honour to viſit me; one day I retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with me at dinner; at the table, we diſcourced of many indifferent things, as I tooke them to be; for as long as he was there, one of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants was preſent, and (till neer the end of dinner) his footeman; whoe being gone out of the chamber, he ſayd ſome words to me abſolutely in ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, which was cuſtumary amongeſt the great wits, of which nomber, he really was, both by nature, and acquiſition, as any I knew of the Nation; the ſubſtance was, a paralelle he made, betwixt me, and one dead ſome tyme before, whoe had not been of the Kings moſt dutyfull ſubjects; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the future courſe of things, as he ſayd they might fall out: I
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48408:33"/>
(I ſuſpecting nothing, for we had lived during the ſpace of twelve, or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien years, with great kindeneſs and familiarity) anſwered him, in the ſame dialect in pure, and manifeſt rallerie; nor could the thing it ſelf, about which he had ſpoken, bear any other ſence, if weighed without paſſion; and my anſwer, much leſs: if the antecedent, as well as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent had been reported; but he in another place, and to other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, repeated only (and that grammatically) my words, as ſeperate from his owne, which he never mentioned; in ſoe much that where twoe ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are relatives, if the later be reported, without the former, to which it related; the ſence may be wreſted oftentimes, to what one will. Haveing recited exactly the whole Matter, with all the circomſtances, to this noble perſon; he ſhooke his head, and ſayd, theiſe are dangerous tymes, and ſuch are moſt dangerous men; I beſowght him that he would acquaint my Lord Chancellour with this buſineſs, and all its circomſtances. He replied his Lordſhip knowes nothing of my ſpeaking with you, much leſs of what I ſay to you; and I deſire he never may, nor any els. I have wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed you well, as long as I have knowne you; and have been very ſorry, for your miſfortunes; and out of pure pitty, have adventured to ſpeak with you; to hynder your falling into greater; which may prove as laſting as your life; and therefor I hope you will keep this meeting, and what I have ſayd to you ſecret; otherwiſe, you will deal unwiſely as to you ſelfe, and unthanckfully as to me. Some perſons of the greateſt Calibre, are ſoe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſted againſt you; that your clearing your ſelfe in this point, will in no kinde help you; for the words themſelves, can bear no action in law, nor be of any other conſequence, then to confirme ſome in the belief long rooted in them; that you are diſcontented, and that your heart ſwells with mutinous, and revengfull thowghts; which is ſoe ingrafted, that if an Angel ſhould deſcend from Heaven to declare the contrary, I may queſtion, whither it would avayle you. Retire your ſelfe as ſoone as you can, be very circomſpect in your whole comportment, and eſpecially in your diſcources; wherein your beſt frends, condemne you, as often to free:</p>
            <p>Speaking to him about his Royale Highneſs the Duke of Yorke, and my Lord Chancellour; he told me, the Duke is not (as I hear) inclined to you as he has been; and I eaſily belive, that S<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Allen Apſley ſayd the truth to you (for I had told him what it was) that his Maſter will not medle in your concernments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:48408:34"/>My Lord Chancellour had kindeneſs for you; wrowght out your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; was opinion when you firſt came out of the Tower, that you might have been employed at ſea; for the King would not endure to hear of your coming to Court; but now thoſe thowghts of his Lordſhip are off; and thowgh I can perceave, that he wiſhes not your utter ruine; yet if you ſhould fall into any new trowble; you will finde no favour from him.</p>
            <p>I have here inſerted the ſubſtance of this noble perſons diſcource, and (as far as I can poſſibly recollect) his words. Upon theſe advices, twoe, or three days after, I embarqued my ſelfe in a ſhip of Zealand, and landed at Midelburgh, where (meeting with very great civility, and kindeneſs, from all perſons in generall) I remayned neer four years; when by the councels, and very effectual recommendations of ſome of my frends I went to the Hague, where by their credit, and by the <hi>power</hi> of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Holland, whome they had engaged to favour me; I had the honour to be received into the ſervice of the State. Shortly after, Colonel Dolman and I were ſummoned by proclamation (without the ſpecification of any crime, as the cauſe) to render our ſelves in England by a day, which neither of us doeing, we were both proſcribed; and which (I belive) was never done before, by act of Parliament, without any Criminal charge aleadged againſt either; I ſhall not wear out tyme, with fruitleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, nor with any other kinde of reflexions, which can ſignify nothing. I only ſolemnly proteſt, that after my proſcription, which was (I thinke) in the very beginning of the year 1666, till the month of April in the year 1674, I never wrote letter, nor ſent meſſage to any creature, in any of his Majeſties Dominions; nor did receive any. Haveing not had in all that tyme (being about eight years) the leaſt correſpondence directly, or indirectly, either to good, or bad ends.</p>
            <p>In the month of April 1674, when the peace was concluded, by the laſt treaty of Breda; I wrote three, or four letters, to twoe perſons of great quality, in the moſt eminent employments about his Majeſtie, and in no leſs credit. Whoe had been bred up from their youth in the ſervice of the crowne; one (with whome I had formerly long and great correſpondence) returned me no other anſwer, then verbally, to him whoe delivered him my letter; that he was very ſorry for the unhappineſs of my condition, but that the conjoncture Could not permit any man, to ſpeak in favour of that unfortunate Gentileman. The other (I know) did move his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. in my behalfe for my returne into England ſeverall tymes; but Could obtayne no Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48408:34"/>Thus finding my ſelfe, moſt entirely ruined, and hopeleſs of ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couvering, either in England, or els where; I betooke my ſelfe to a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, as contrary to my temper, humour, and cuſtome, as one oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, can well be to another; where unto I could never conſtraine my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, throwgh the whole courſe of my life, untill that tyme: which was to retire my ſelfe not only from all kinde of affaires, of what nature ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; but even from the uſual contentment, of humane converſation; as far forth as the poſſibility of ſubſiſting Could admit; and to lead an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitical kinde of life; to which end, haveing throwgh the frendſhip of a worthy perſon, to whome I was knowne; procured in the country, a little houſe in a garden; (but as great as my deſigne.) Thither I retired my ſelfe; and ſoe continued during the ſpace of five years; haveing had in all that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, very little other ſociety, then my bookes, and meditations. not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this great circomſpection; and harmleſs way of living; I Could not be entirely free from ſome practiſes, which had been (for a long tyme) one of the chiefe cauſes, of my great calamitie; in ſoe much that I then did (and doe now) thinke; that if the very trees Could have had the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive faculty; they would have been employ'd to my diſadvantage; which made me as much as was decently poſſible, to avoyd the ſpeaking with all man kinde: but in this egiptiene darkneſs (by intervalls) God extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naryly afforded me ſuch glimerings of light, that I Could diſcouver, the firſt mouvers, reaſons, ends, and inſtruments, of all theiſe practiſes; as likewiſe that paſſion in the firſt; and intereſt in the laſt, produced theiſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; from which (I playnly ſaw) no manner of life, that I Could conſine my ſelfe unto, was of ſufficient force to free me.</p>
            <p>Theiſe conſiderations which were ſolid, and reall; exempt from all Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriacall vapours, or chimeraes; together with the very ſencible decay of my health, throwgh this way of living; as likewiſe, that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſencibility of my to heavy diſtreſſe, not haveing been Stoicien enough, to have loſt my feeling; together with other reaſons that I ſhall not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I concluded my return to Leuwarden (at leaſt for the winter) more conducible to my health, to my ſecurity, and more convenient in other conſiderations then the country, about the end of September 1679, I poſted my ſelfe there; where I lived as free, from all converſation, as I had done at Bergum. In the year 1680, coming to the knowledg of ſome things which concerned me in the higheſt degree; that I Could be touched with; and perceaving by the prints (which were frequent, and filled therewith)
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48408:35"/>
that the deſordres in England, were riſen to that Height; that the ſtorme ſeemed to blow, from all points of the compaſs; and not only conjecturing that I ſhould be ſuſpected, but knowing that I was ſoe (thowgh innocent, as to all thoſe tranſactions, as the childe whoe had never ſeen the light) I begun to thinke with my ſelfe, what courſe was fitteſt for me to ſteer; and after much deliberation, I concluded it abſolutely beſt, to write into England; which accordingly I did, to a perſon whoe I thowght Could not be expoſed to any ſuſpition; and by their means, (if they would have adventured it) to have letters delivered to ſome of the Court, whoe had formerly been my frends; this perſon anſwered my letter, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke what I deſired. Where upon calling the ſaying to minde, that he that wallkes circomſpectly, walkes ſurely (allbeit I ſaw no neceſſity to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve done it, as things were betwixt England and this State) I demanded leave, from thoſe, whoe had the power to accord it me; for my writing to ſuch of my frends, as would have endeavourd to get my proſcription taken off, free and entire liberty, was graunted me, very Generouſly; without thoſe limitations, which I offered to Impoſe upon my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>I wrote three letters, to perſons of Importance at the court; one tooke tyme to reſolve whither he would receive his, or not; but after three or four days conſideration excuſed it: the other twoe received my letters, promiſed anſwers; but as I have ſince knowne, not finding means to obtaine any thing in my favour, wrote not to me. However, at length, one whoe had credit, was Induced to receive letters from me, and to write to me;</p>
            <p>My end, and endeavour was; firſt to make my innocency appear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrably, touching all correſpondence, or coluſion with any of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. ſubjects; either in, or out of his Dominions; nor to have had ſoe much as knowledg, of any contrivements or deſignes, tending in any kinde, or degree, to the prejudice of his perſon, or diſturbance of his Gouverment. And nevertheleſs, that I knew, negatives were moſt difficult to be prouved; yet by inductions, and neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencies, much may be clearly demonſtrated. Beſides, I was certayne, that it Could not be in the power of mankinde, to prouve any ſuch matter againſt me; haveing ever ſince my reſiding in Freezland, been ſoe exactly circumſpect, not to give any juſt occaſion of jalouſie; that I have entirely avoided the ſpeaking with any, whoe I knew, or did but Imagine, to have been ſuſpected, by his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. as diſaffected to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48408:35"/>
or Gouverment: and if any ſuch, have deſired any communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with me, I have civily excuſed it; as that which Could not have been benificiall to them, and might have proved domageable to my ſelfe. Nor have I ever done it, to this moment; either by interview, ſpeech, writing, or Meſſage; ſent, or received.</p>
            <p>Nor have I had any other knowledge, of thoſe plots, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, during theiſe laſt ten years (which have filled all Chriſtendome with noiſe) ſaveing what I have ſeen in print; and not before it was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique.</p>
            <p>Theiſe truths haveing been ſoe made appear, as that they neither had been, nor Could be contradicted, by any lawfull evidence, or reaſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance, I flattered my ſelfe (as indeed I have done) into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of getting my proſcription taken off; and might have met with no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from England (which has allways befallen me) to my obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning employment abroad, in caſe of a foraigne war, which till about eigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>een months ſince, I concluded unavoydable; haveing been poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely reſolved, to throwe my ſelfe, into the firſt engagement, where I beſt Could, with the ſatiſfaction of my Conſcience, thereby to have honourably ended (if God had thowght it fit) an unhappy, and a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome life, more to my contentment; then the continuation thereof for many years has been.</p>
            <p>Perceaving now no means remayning, in this dead calme, which is Joyfully believed of 20 years continuance, for the lawfull perſuance of my deſigne; being likewiſe deprived of all hopes in England; I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, during the ſhort reſte of my life with as much tranquility, as God ſhall pleaſe to voutſafe me, to ſubmit to his holy will, in whoſe booke, the nombers of our dayes are regiſtred, wayting on him till my change comes, whoe ſways all men, and actions, to thoſe ends for which he has ordayned them: in this courſe, to meet with the leſs interuption; I yet determine neither to diſcompoſe my ſelfe, nor give any ombrage to others, by medling with wordly affaires, further then the neceſſity of my ſubſiſtance may conſtraine me to it: which I conceave cannot hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, if I am dealt juſtly with, by thoſe for whome I have viſibly ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to great extremities, for Divers years.</p>
            <p>This being my ſyncere intention; I ſhall ſumm up the principal points, which have (in ſome kinde) conſtrained me to become publique, to the following heads, and ſoe conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:48408:36"/>Firſt I here declare, and proteſt, (which I doe with a clear, and ſafe conſcience) that ſince my leaving of England, with his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. permiſſion; I have had no correſpondence, by writing, receaving of letters, or Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, into, or out of England, or of any other part of his Dominions, nor have had any conſultations, or contrivements with any of his ſubjects abroad, tending to the rayſing, or fomenting any diſcontents, uproors, ſeditions, or treaſons, againſt his perſon, or Gouverment.</p>
            <p>Secondly that from the year 1665, after the firſt war was declared by England againſt this State; I neither wrote, nor received any letter or Meſſage, into, or out of England, or any other of the Kings Dominions, untill the year 1674. after the laſt peace concluded at Breda, and then only (as I have allready ſayd) unto twoe perſons of as great honour, and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the King, as I have ever knowne, and of the neereſt places, and truſt about him: at which tyme, I wrote but twoe, or three letters, with Communication of ſome perſons, in the greateſt conſideration in the Gouverment of this ſtate. Nothing at that tyme, haveing been obtayned<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned for me: I wrote not more, till the end of 1679, or the beginning of 1680; and then writh free leave of thoſe in cheif authority where I was; and only for the ends, I have allready mentioned.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, knowing poſitively, and particularly, that by ſome very ill perſons, I have been accuſed, to have ſpoken, undecently, and undutifully, concerning the late King, of happy Memory, as likewiſe of ſome other Princes abroad of the Royale blood; which has been belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and contributed as much to my late Calamities, as thoſe other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a higher nature, and may yet reduce me to greater extremities, then I thinke decent for me to mention. Wherefor I doe declare, that I have never at any tyme, nor on any occaſion, mentioned his late Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. neither any other Prince of the blood, capable of a legall ſucceſſion (at any tyme, or event which can happen) to the crowne, but with that due reſpect and modeſty, which became a ſubject to ſpeak of his Souveraigne; or a ſober man, of ſuch whoe are in a legal poſſibility to become ſoe.</p>
            <p>Few men can be ignorant (and to many not inſencible) of the prodigious liberty, which has of late years been taken, of falſe informations in ſecret, (which being belived, without due examination; no man can be ſafe) as likewiſe, of Improbable, untrue, and contradictory evidences in publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, and of moſt Impudent perjury, which renders it a bold hazard, for any man to lay himſelfe open to, yet ſuch is my innocency (as to all theiſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48408:36"/>
matters) and ſoe great, and full the ſatiſfaction of my conſcience, that I ſhall venture to declare; that if any man upon the earth; either of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. ſubjects, or ſtrangers, will ſay, and can ſuffiently, and authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally prove, the contrary to any one of theiſe aſſertions; I ſhall freely with my ſoul forgive him, if he does it, and be contented to ſuffer death.</p>
            <p>As I began, ſoe I ſhall end: that falſe accuſations, with ſecret and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable practiſes, to deſtroye me, or at leaſt, to continue me under the Calamity which has long layne heavy upon me (much worſe to me, then death) have conſtrayned me to this courſe, as unfit for me, as I am for it; referring my ſelfe to the equitable ſenſure of unpreoccupied perſons; the judgment of my cauſe to God, and my ſoul in all events, to his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible mercy.</p>
