            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Fuller ANSVVER TO ELIMAS the Sorcerer, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the last Letter I had from you, (and the last may it be for ever) of <hi>Iuly</hi> 7. 1682. You first acquainted me with Mounsieur <hi>Maimburgs</hi> History of <hi>Calvinisme;</hi> published in several E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, not long before: I made speedy enquiry after it, the rather, because you told me the Nation and you (two Aequipollents, doubtless) had been more beholding, under God, to that <hi>Ex-Iesuit</hi> (so you term him) than to me and my Partners: What Partners you mean, I know not, nor what share I am to have among them, nor of what; untill you make more plain and publick, what you so kindly have assigned me, <hi>Ecce hic sto, vindicandus mea sorti,</hi> in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Phrase.</p>
            <p>The Book I have obtain'd from <hi>London,</hi> and found annexed to it, what you pointed at; <hi>Declaration de Madame la Princesse D'Iork;</hi> by the publication whereof (for all the other History I am sure you thank him not) how much you, and your Party, are beholding to that <hi>French</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, will very manifestly be made appear, if but in the Second and Third Paragraphs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ie proteste en la presence de Dieutout puissant, &amp;c.</hi> Where her Royal Highness makes most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn protestation, in the presence of Almighty God, That, since her return into <hi>England,</hi> not any person in the world, either directly, or indirectly, carried her from our Church, to imbrace the <hi>Catholick Religion;</hi> that the grace of her reconcilement (as they use to call it) she owed solely to God's mercy; that she her self durst not believe it any Sequell of her daily Prayers (in the course of her Devotion) ever since she had been in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> adding.</p>
            <p>It is very true, That having view'd the Fervour and Devotion among the <hi>Catholicks</hi> of those Countries, and being sensible of none at all, or very little in her self, from that time, she never ceased to ask of God the grace, that if she were not in the true Religion, she might be before she died.</p>
            <p>Give me leave, Sir, to be of opinion, till you make it otherwise appear, That this Pious and Prudent Lady, after her own conviction, and choice made, (if chuse she did) had so much Charity for her Directors, (who e're they were) yea, and for her Chaplaines too, as, when ready to turn her back upon them and their Offices, she would not spit in their faces, as in defiance, with whom and by whom, so many hundred times she had pay'd her Orisons, and made addresses to the Throne of Grace, (with as much well-tempered Zeal, we thought, though not alike cloud of Incense, and other pompous Ceremonies, as I had observed any where, either in <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Flanders,</hi>) but rather intercept, as she hoped, with the extended Palmes of both her hands, all false aspersions, and calumnies, that might for her sake be cast upon us, by such opprobrious persons as your self, (if your very self were not the He, she meant to anticipate) whose measures are wholly broken, and whose maine design is utterly disappointed, by taking upon her self, what with the danger threatned, you would fain have imputed to us; but this Passage, Sir, you had no mind to regard, and I cannot blame you for it, being so directly cross to your purpose.</p>
            <p>The two concealed Bishops, we may be sure, shall not escape the fiercest effects of your rage,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101706:3"/>
if you and your Blood-hounds can trace them out, whom you precondemn unheard, and deftine as the worst of Criminals, to a most severe, a fatal Execution, though, for kind <hi>Mounsieur Maimburg's</hi> sake, the very <hi>Iesuites</hi> that lately suffer'd, should conditionally be recall'd to life.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, to leave them (the Bishops I mean) behind, to answer for themselves, when you can bring 'em to your High Court of Justice, who, you say, <hi>Pag.</hi> 4, are condemned persons in Law, though what Law you name not, nor does any of ours, I presume, so deeply Sentence the most Bigot-Papist for his Religion, (as I think was declared from the Bench, more then once, in the late Tryals) much less any in our Communion, for private Sentiments, before publick scandal given, and a fair Conviction.</p>
            <p>I must peremptorily demand of you, (and I can do no less) having been so publickly traduced by you, and thereby exposed to the obloquie (if no worse) of all true and false Protestants in the three Kingdomes, as publick a retractation of, and plenary satisfaction for the foul injury you have done me; else, although I may not deny you the indeleble Character of a Priest, I shall impress upon your Name another, of a like aviternall durance, of a Profligate Person, and a most malicious Calumniator.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, what more yet will be laid to your charge, if that Noble Lady her self be more grosly and impudently defamed then her Chaplaines? if, notwithstanding those uncertain fluctuations of opinion, agitations of Spirit, cross collision of thoughts, and perhaps, alternate in consistent resolutions, she departed either indeterminate in her Religion, or not altogether so adverse from that her Highness had before Professed, from the first Maturity of her reason and fit capacity to make her choice? That you may know me to be in earnest, (with a civil respect praemised to <hi>Mounsieur Maimburg's</hi> Historicall Narration, and a little suspense made of that credulity you would have us yield to your Prophetick Inspiration, who pretend a foresight of her change, so many years antecedent to it) I offer two particulars to the serious consideration of the present Age, the feares and jealousies of which flie, too often, swifter then Fame it self with such stories; and to the judgment of Posterity, that may be diversly mis-informed by the praejudice, or in observance of many that transmit their reports to 'em, which can meet with little opposition, or good Evidence against them, at that distance.</p>
            <p>The first tender I make, is this, which you will, I hope, allow me to adventure upon my own Reputation, if I add, <hi>in verbo Sacerdotis,</hi> which I safely can; That toward the end of my last Quarters waiting in course at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> her R. H. having been long decumbent in her sickness, and many times in great extremity of torture, (perhaps, as much of mind, in that distraction, or convulsion of thoughts, as of body) from the violent assaults and paroxysmes of her Fever, both yielding alike sad accents, if not articulate complaints, and much astonishing us, whose atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in our stations drew us within notice of it, there being, as it were, an absolute desertion of her little Oratory; which before, whether her H. were there, or not, us'd to be well frequented by a comfortable Audience, that assisted at our Mattins and Even-Song, which, beside that it pleased God, gave countenance to the Chaplain, in the performance of his Offices, at the houres appointed, I calling to mind the strictness of her Commands formerly, and the steadiness of her personall example, in time of Health, found it necessary for her R. H. to have knowledge of it, in some seasonable intervall of her griefs, assuring my self her Goodness would not take amiss such a dutifull and devout expression of a religious desire she should be daily prayed for by us, when, in that weak condition, she could not present her self before the little Altar she had erected to pray there with us. This I did with that caution as became me in the present circumstances, and committed the care of it to a discreet Lady of her Chamber, who was seldome absent from her Bed-side, desiring her, in the summe of all, to say plainly, That the Chaplain was in this streight, without her H. suddenly found some expedient, either <hi>to set open the doores of her Oratory, and read Common-prayer to the painted Wain-Scot; or keep 'em shut, and read none at all,</hi> whereof what sence the Court and City would have, must be left at adventure; The very next day, when I went into the Privy-Chamber, at the wonted hour, I saw no cause at all either of complaint, or enquiry after her H. pleasure, and new Order, it being appointed before my coming, that the Reading-Desk and Books should be made ready, and when the Bed-Chamber door should be opened, our Common-Prayer should be read at the very entrance thereinto, whither assembled not only a considerable number without the door, and within, such Ladies as were either in immediate attendance, or others priviledged to be there, but her H. personally, as she lay in bed, found, I hope, some comfort and benefit by our Prayers, read in her hearing, wherein, I doubt not but at that time, she joyned in Communion with us, or else would have ordered it otherwise, This course, for ought I remember, continued while her infirme condition could comply with it, throughout my time; After my dismission, what Method therein was observed, my Reverend Successor in that employment can best report; But this, on all hands, I believe will easily be yielded; That her Highnesses Sickness more and more every day prevailing,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101706:3"/>
and consequently the strength of Nature as much decaying, little abatement, in that anxiety, she had, of mind, and little better satisfaction of doubts and scruples, or settlement in Religion, considering her sad condition, can reasonably be supposed; Whether, in this deplorable state, she might send for her Spirituall Physician, the Ecclesiastick Person mentioned by her, or some other, I can, with assurance, neither affirm, nor deny; nor will I doubt more, if he came, of her Highnesses patient attention, and submission, to all he said, (at a time when she wanted somewhat to allay or charm the tumult of her Spirits) then I do of what a Learned, and well Practised Civilian has sometime told me, That many Testaments are brought in Court, truly Signed by the Testators, in a dying condition, but upon no other account of will, or consent, then to be rid of their importunate Kindred, Allies, or Friends, that they may be free to dispose their Soules to a calm and serene departure out of this unquiet World; And whether the good Father were sent for or no, very well known it is, how the Ecclesiastikes of that Communion use not to be over-modest, as opportunity may serve, in offering their Assistance to exspiring persons, of what Church, or of what Quality soever, where they may have admission.</p>
            <p>Which puts me in mind of what happened many years since, at <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> about the Decease of my Noble Patron, the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> who, on his last fatal day, being taken speechless somewhat early in the morning, and so continuing, to the great grief, and disappointment, of his few Domestiques then about him; In the afternoon the Reverend Mother, or Lady Prioress, of the <hi>English</hi> Nunnery, sent a Message, in great haste, to me, that I must needs attend her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, at the Grate, as if she had praepared some speciall Cordiall for our good Lord, (whom she and all her Votaries respected highly) that would not only recover his Lordships Speech, but renew his Age, or protract his life some years longer; when I went to know her pleasure, the good Lady told me somewhat to this purpose. That, understanding my Lords condition, she could not be at rest, untill she had finished the great Devotion her whole Monastery had for his Lordship, by recommending two grave <hi>Franciscan</hi> Fryars to do their last religious Office for him in their way, [<hi>i. e.</hi> according to the Rituall of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church]; Whereat I was so much surprized, that I had almost forgot the sedate temper I came to her in, being more prone, upon that her motion, either to smile, or be angry, then to lament the loss, I every hour appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, might befall me and my fellow-servants in a Forreign Countrey, by our Lord's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease; At length, being somewhat recomposed, I minded her Reverence of what she knew very well, the free converse my Lord had often, in time of Health, with their Fathers and Fryars of any Order, declining no discourse on any points in controversy they could mention to him, in a <hi>Calm</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> way; how acceptable it had been, on both sides, though neither Party could convince the other; and how incongruous it would be, after all the aforesaid frankness and plain-dealing, now to give his Lordship the trouble of a faint dispute, if he could have us'd his Tongue, but now he could not, how false I must needs prove to him and to my trust, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting such religious Offices to be practised upon him at the point of Death, which he approved not of toward any other person, when in perfect health, and vigour of understanding; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the over-courteous Lady, whether satisfied, or no, acquiesced, and retired, as I returned to my languishing good Lord, to perform my last duty at his Bed-side, as his Chaplain, according to the Form or Permission of our <hi>Britannike</hi> Church. Whereas, had I taken other measures, it, most certainly, would have been reported, That the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> if but by reason of that very ancient Ceremony, their extream Unction, without a word spoken, had died so good a <hi>Roman Catholique</hi> as the best; and his surviving Chaplain, (or Director in Mr. <hi>Iones</hi>'s sense) had been no other than a Papist in Masquerade, and for his treachery to so noble and so good a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, had deserved no less then present death by his Martial Sentence. But I proceed,</p>
            <p>To make good my word, and produce my second particular, upon better credit then my own, (as having it from a person twenty times more interessed in the Court then my self, and far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with private passages of moment there;) When, not only the reports were warm of her R. Highnesses defection from the Religion professed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but that her Father, the Earle of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> had taken notice of it by Letter, (the written Copy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of passed from hand to hand) in discharge of his paternal duty, I being not over-credulous of such a suddain change, upon popular Rumour, in a Personage so judicious, and deliberate in all her actions, to obtain a certainty of the Truth, for my private satisfaction, (if no more) writ a Letter upon that Subject, to a very sage and grave Person, my most worthy friend at Court, from whom I receiv'd this in Answer, or to this effect.</p>
            <p>That her R. H. (when this fierce conflict of Soul and Body was almost finished) when she must needs be sensible of the few houres or minutes she had to live, and fewer hopes, but by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary divine assistance, to hold the encounter unto the end, like a good <hi>Christian</hi> Lady, desired to have her last <hi>viaticum</hi> praepared for her, and like a persevering Member of our Church, appointed it to be administred, expresly by the hand of the Bishop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> that then was,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101706:4"/>
who, by what impediment, or unhappy accident, was not expresly writ me, came too late, when, if the doors were not shut, the Keepers of the house were trembling, the Grinders ceasing, and those that had been looking out of the windows were darkened; And this Daughter of Musick being brought low, her desire failed, because she was going to her long home, where I hope her divine Manna hath never failed, and her coelestiall, instead of her sacramentall, Cup hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed, beyond the satisfaction of her thirsty Soul, to her eternal joy and ineffable delight in the God of her Salvation.</p>
            <p>The Testimony of my courteous Correspondent would be unquaestionable, were his Name known, which I will not publish, having not askt his leave, but take any censure, to be made of what he writes, upon my self. The truth of all, or high probability (without the credit and veracity of which witness) will, I doubt not, be rationally argued from what here I mean shall follow.</p>
            <p>Now, Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> after two such unexceptionable Evidences, in your own expression, let you and I consider, laying aside all praejudice against Directors, or Confessors, what is reasonable for us to believe of our Deceased Dutchess; Was all this, think you, a piece of Pageantry her R. H. acted, or exposed to the view of the world, in the very last Scene of her life? But <hi>Mounsieur Maimburg</hi> Prints it, as is supposed, from her own hand; I will believe it so far, when I see, and know the Originall; but I will not then believe her R. H. persisted in the sense of it to her last hour, inferring rather from what I have here related, That she retracted the said writing in fact, which perhaps, f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r reasons best known to her self, if not because of her infirmity, her H. neither declared it by word of mouth, nor signed any such Retractation with her hand; So that <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Maimburg</hi> may boast, as you say, of a Proselyte in guilded Paper, and you charge me, with the Party you mean, to little purpose, if no such finall change were resolv'd on, as you surmise; Toward the discovery of which Truth, if what I have already writ, be not enough demonstrative, let us, with all due regard to the Pious memory of that excellent Princess, take a summary review of the Declaration it self, and see what we can make probable of its tendency to either term.</p>
            <p>Her protestation is plain and positive, as before I minded you, That neither Papist, nor Protestant, in Masquerade as you suspect, had suggested any thing to withdraw her from that Religion, wherein by Birth, and so many years education, observation, converse, hearing, and reading, what Doctrine was soundly Preached, and learnedly written, she had been well-grounded and settled to her hearts content, as was evident by many instances to all in attendance on her, especially the Chaplaines, who best know, by the strict duty they were kept to, how sollicitous her H. was, upon all incident occasions that detained, or diverted her from the ordinary hour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween three and four in the Afternoon, to have another order'd, though at seven or eight of Clock in the Evening, as she could Personally be present in her Oratory at our Prayers. Which exemplary Devotion for the service of our Church had such an influence, likewise, upon all, or most of her young Ladies, that, when they had obtained leave to make a visit, or otherwise to employ the hour, they would frequently get a little Congregation assembled in their Mothers Chamber, and have the benefit of our Evening Prayer before they would take Coach.</p>
            <p>As for the more publike Offices in the Chappell, how praecise her H. was in her Orders, and how advertent to see them executed, you best know, Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> whose charge it was on the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, and we all can testifie for the Sundays in our courses, which if we supplied not our selves, were obliged to be accountable, unto whom we resign'd the Pulpit for the day, a considerable time before, which yet sometimes, you know, would not serve our turn; for so select were the persons, of whom her R. H. would approve, to Preach before her, that our opinion, or character, of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>em would not pass currant, if not conform with that she had made of e'm to her self; insomuch as, among others, this singular instance, I very well remember; That a Learned Person, in great eminency of place, and of no less popular, yea, Courtly reputation for the elegancy of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, having with intendment to pay respect unto, and please her H. taken that dayes duty of mine upon himself, when notice thereof was sent into her, a convenient time before, her answer was a plain Refusall, and a command given, that I should perform my Course my self, (as I did) or see it otherwise supplied to her Highnesses better satisfaction; which unexpected disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it gave me an uneasy task, to revoke my grant in as smooth and gentle language as, with necessary caution, I could Penn; so it coloured my modesty with such a blush, as I never had the confidence to visit that Reverend Person afterward.</p>
            <p>Her Highnesses particular care of the Family, with its dependants, at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, to keep them steady in our Religion, you have Published in her Orders, delivered to you by the Reverend Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> but with no order, Sir, I presume, to make such unhandsome and uncharitable observations on them, as</p>
            <p>That the first tended to bring you and the Liturgy into contempt; as if the Dutchess and his Lordship had conspired in that scandalous design; whereas the true intendment seemes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101706:4"/>
for the honour, and preference of the Morning Liturgy to a Morning Sermon, if you mean it separate from the Service; and denotes the errour in their choice, who went to it at <hi>Whitchall,</hi> where their presence was not required, nor assistance wanted, when their duty was, to repair unto the Chappell at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, their oeconomicall, though not parochiall place of publick worship; whose forenoon defect of a Sermon was supplied, you know, in the afternoon, by us the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines in our courses, not to mention St. <hi>Peters Westminster,</hi> St. <hi>Margarets,</hi> St. <hi>Martins,</hi> all in our vicinage, where they could not miss, nor you, in likelihood, of a Congregation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the diversion of many to <hi>Whitchall;</hi> or, if you had been thereby absolutely deserted, the like remedy might have been found, as I told you before, I succeeded in upon like occasion, and the deviating, or ambulatory, part of their H. Highnesses Family thereby reclaimed to their duty, without all jealousie of the Dutchess, or contempt drawn upon you by his Lordship.</p>
            <p>The fourth Order, you say, tended to enrage several of the Family against you. I answer, That they might be more, or less, enraged, according to the method you took for discovery, which was not directed by urgent interrogatives. <hi>Are you Protestant, or Papist?</hi> so as they might be under constraint to tell an untruth, or betray themselves; but rather by enquiry of others, Whether they made profession of any distinct Religion? what? and where they frequented any assembly in the practice of it? This and other such gentle, or concealed, methods used; what apprehensions could you, Sir, have had from their rage in the Court, and under the protection of both their H. Highnesses?</p>
            <p>Lastly, You say, you did begin to Catechise, but was discouraged by the Arts of the said Bishop.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> Do not deceive your self by a prejudice against my Lord; for you did not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but went on confidently several dayes, I may say weeks, without that discouragement, untill you became so ridiculous to the very Gentlemen you would pretend to instruct, and so much the discourse of others, to my knowledge, about the Court, who in some concealed place were your Auditours, though unseen; who reported afterwards what they heard, but could by no means understand (of which curiosity I was not guilty) that I am of opinion, my Lord of <hi>W.</hi> could not but be informed of it, and might silence you by his power, if you suppressed not your self by your after-prudence, when some good friend had dealt freely and plainly with you in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. So that certainly you forgot your Order, which was, <hi>To Catechise and Instruct the Pages and others who want instruction, very constantly, according to the Orders of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>N.</hi> 9. Whereas, I fear in your Zeal for their speedy and over-full instruction, you ran out to such an excessive length, and so dilated in a confused Paraphrase, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> has neither ordered, nor will allow.</p>
            <p>Somewhat like to this Order, not of Catechise, but enquiry, I had received from her H. long before this of yours, upon notice whereof given, all those young Gentlemen, that were then Pages, met me at Major <hi>Eyres</hi>'s house, to sustain the Scrutinie, which, with all alacrity, they did singly, every one in turn, out of the others hearing; My business was, 1. To sound their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or praepossessions, in matters of Religion, as to what was practised in either Chappell at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s. 2. To search, whether their Tutour or under-Governour, Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> a discreet and sober person, had not been tampering with them, at any time, and endeavouring to seduce them toward the other Chappell, as you oddly call it, (according to the style, meseemeth of <hi>the other House,</hi> you, formerly, may have been accustom'd to) some suggestion, of like sort with that you now own, having been made, (by whom I know not) to her R. H. and Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> render'd a dangerous person to have the guidance of those young Gentlemen. The account hereof I gave her H. did so well satisfie her, as the said Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> was better confirmed in his place, and her Highnesses good opinion, then before, who had been otherwise supplanted, and certainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. This passage I recollect, and here recite (still more in conjunction with you) to strengthen the argument I am about, That her H. from time to time, was very firm in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of our Reformed Church. I return now to Mounsieur <hi>Maimburg's</hi> Printed Declaration.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Il est bien vray qu' ayant veu la ferveur et la devotion des Catholiques de ces Pais la,</hi> &amp;c.] Whereas her H. so much magnifies the fervour, and devotion, she had beheld in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> in comparison with which her own was nothing, or very little, as she judg'd; that modest opinion justifies more the method of her humility, then <hi>Christian</hi> charity, which in this case, if in any, ought surely to have begun at home; I mean not with a better opinion of her own person, which yet from others might have deserved it; for that Soul, though of the greatest Princess, cannot be layed too low, which the more it is by its self depressed, the higher will it be by God exalted, but of others in the same <hi>Communion,</hi> especially being, as we account, reformed, and well refined from many errours, our Divines discover, so well in their Breviary, as Missal; And if the eye, or ear, may carry it, I wish the <hi>tunsio pectoris,</hi> and other ceremonies retain'd, I hope, with very warm devotion, by your pious <hi>Britaines,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> had occur'd to her memory,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101706:5"/>
when she beheld the dropping Beads, and turning leaves of divers Offices, by the nimblest fingers of either of the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Flemish Ladies;</hi> yet far be it from you, or me, Sir, to derogate from the zeal intended by those good women, (with or without comparison) whom I have many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, with a very sensible reflexion, in whole and full Congregations, on their bended knees at their Vespers, I am sorry to say, and our own, many more, in very undue postures, and gestures, unbecoming our common, or publick Prayer, which her R. H. knew very well to be the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of our incurious people, not the Prophaness of our Church, which prescribed much better, and more beseeming, demeanour in her Canon. The more retired fervour, and Devotion, of those Foreign Females may be such as among other Writers, Dr. <hi>Vane,</hi> our relapsed Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, so highly commends them for, after he had done the like courtesie for their Clergy, in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious harangue, <hi>Pag.</hi> 266. Thus</p>
            <p>And even the weak Sex of woman, whose natural delicacy, tenderness, and infirmities, may seem to carry with them a Patent of exemption from extraordinary severities and mortifications of themselves, yet such is the <hi>omnipotency</hi> (a bold word) of Catholique Religion, that even these do equal, if not excel the men, in the tough exercise of denying themselves, of taking up their Cross, and imitating of Christ; invited hereunto, more by pure love of God, and gratitude for his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and suffering for them, than for the expectation of reward.</p>
            <p>But little of this came, I presume, within the verge of her R. Highnessesview, or observation beyond what she had seen at some solemn Anniversary, <hi>Omgang</hi> or <hi>Procession,</hi> if their Canvas Frock or Covering had a woman under it, wherein the fervour, or excessive Calenture, of their devotion, has now and then, cost a life, until restrained, or absolutely inhibited by the Bishop of the place.</p>
            <p>Their Morning Devotions were more moderate, their early Masses, indeed, well frequented, though the Host, to few, or none, of them delivered, some private Office, perhaps that of the H. Virgin, or other Saint seperately acted, or passed over with a silent motion of the lip; their habit loose, and not over decent, I will not say over - modest for a Church-Assembly; some slight Veil, or <hi>Huyck<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> as they call it, rendred <hi>Calyptra,</hi> or <hi>Palla,</hi> as <hi>toga a tegendo,</hi> soon put on, and as soon off, much after the rate of our morning Lecturers by Candel-light heretofore; At their solemn <hi>Vespers,</hi> on great Festivals, I have known their Churches well warmed by the zeal of that sex alone, or in the company of few men, beside their Priests; And a person of Honour once told me, after he came home soundly crowded, for his curiosity to see their Ceremonies, at such a time, that having darted himself sodainly behind some Pillar of a Church for concealment, when he more deliberately looked about him, and discovered none but women in full Congregation from the Altar to the very door, apprehending he might be known or suspected to be upon espial, as indeed h was, he soon Retreated, with some difficulty, being well pleased he had so made a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable escape.</p>
            <p>But for all this her Highnesses credulity of their fervour, and devotion, in one sex, or other, or in both,</p>
            <p>[<hi>Ie n' avois pas neantmoin le moindre doute que la creance d' Eglise Anglicane ne fust la veritable;</hi> &amp;c.] she had not the least doubt, as yet of the Faith, and truth, professed by the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> nor any scruple, or trouble of conscience, upon that subject, until the <hi>November</hi> before she declared, when she began to read the History of our Reformation, composed by Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> so much esteemed by persons the best able to judge of it in the whole Realm, who praepossessed Her with good assurance that the said book would clear all doubt, and scruple of conscience, that could be made concerning the said Reformation.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed further in my Reflexions upon this Paragraph, I wish, I could be well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in somewhat I understand not, which seemeth little to authentize the <hi>Declaration</hi> of a so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and wary, Princess as you and I, Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> had known her H. to be in all that passed from her, within our notice; was it not just before, that she declared her self free from all doubt and scruple? &amp;c. What Reason then had those able &amp; judicious persons to put her H. upon the task of reading Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s History, as the only book stored with sufficiency, to deliver Consciences out of all such perplexities, when she had acquainted them, that none she had? was it ever her custome, think we, in her garden pleasures, to quit a smooth or Carpet - walk, on set purpose to entangle, and embroyl, her self in a thicket of Thorns and Bryars, to sting her thoughts with the sense of an overgrown Prince's lewdnes in another Century, which if it were so ominous, as to dash a blot, at so great a distance upon our Escuchion, or Entail a curse on Posterity to or beyond the third and fourth Generation, her Highnesses personal share could be apprehended but as of one among the many, having no lineal descent from his Loines, nor collateral Relation to him.</p>
            <p>But let the air of this madvertance, or what else it is, expire and vanish; And take we into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration the unexpected disappointment her H. met with, in reading the Doctor's Book, so highly commended to her, so great as great could be, clear contrary to what was promised [<hi>I' ay trouve au contraire,</hi> &amp;c.] so much it seems, in the generall, as, besides her own dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101706:5"/>
she thinkes it of no force, or efficacy, to becalme any troubled Spirit among the mean and ordinary sort of people; and I think so too, it being writ in another style then what is levell'd to such low capacities, and in the matter having a mixture of such variety, as at every turne all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the thread is broken, and they lose their way. But you, and I, Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> can very well remember, that our eminent Princess was none of the <hi>les esprits mediocres,</hi> being more mercuriall then most of the first, or second rank in her Sex; and I believe, it may be our joint - opinion, that her R. H. was not, at that time of day, to seek satisfaction about the principles of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, nor a stranger to other faithfull Writers upon that Subject; who speak no less truth, and as plain <hi>English</hi> alltogether, in the case, as the worthy, and never enough magnified, Dr. <hi>Heylyn;</hi> beside, that, on this occasion, comes into my mind an expression to our purpose, utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, many years since, by a learned and judicious person, who was far better acquainted with her R. H. religious searches in that kind, then you and I can pretend to be, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was enough assured, she understood the state of the question, better then her noble Father, who at the same time was the great Minister of State, and, however otherwise unfortunate, the most memorable Restorer, and establisher of our ruin'd Church.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the three particulars that entangled this pious Lady, I can not but take notice of two other, wherewith she antecedently chargeth our Reformation; 1. Changing the face of the ancient Church; and, 2. Renouncing the Catholique Religion; both which are most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly disclaimed by our most learned and most impartiall Controvertists; and the former of the two disowned by that brisk <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, <hi>Mounsieur de la Militiere,</hi> in his address to our King, which, very probably, her R. H. had read, long before her return into <hi>England,</hi> being Printed with the Lord Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi>'s Answer, at the <hi>Hague,</hi> 1654. where the French Counsellor condescends to say, That the Protestants of this Kingdome, by Episcopacy, Liturgy, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, [which were retained] had preserved the face, or image, of the Catholique Church; And I remember, when I was in <hi>Flanders,</hi> an old <hi>Benedictine</hi> of our nation asking me, how I liked the decency of their Churches, and solemnity of their Service, or publique Worship, I answered, to this purpose, That I observed little more in substance, then what he might have formerly seen, if he had pleased, in our King's Chappell, St. <hi>Pauls London,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter's Westminster,</hi> with the other Cathedrals we had in <hi>England;</hi> whereto he somewhat sarcastically replied, That in Archbishop <hi>Laud's</hi> time, indeed (which he needed not to have specified in absolute derogation to all the former from the first Reformation) your Church washed, and beautified her face a little, but, for all that, more intrinsecally she was a very slut; Let them look to that, if cause be still, who, after some intimations given by Bishop <hi>Andrewes, Mountague,</hi> and others, should see supplied what may be found wanting, and applied by practice, to render her through-reformed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve her from all such reproach. As for the good old <hi>Monke,</hi> if I had been in another Countrey, I should have wiped his mouth with my Handkercheif, and opened the eyes of his understanding for a better prospect of truth among us.</p>
            <p>As to the second, I know none but our rigid <hi>Calvinists,</hi> that became absolute Renegadoes, and desertors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, much less of the Catholique, though taken in their own sense, which all good men and moderate among them will allow us to call what they would have it to be <hi>Roman Catholique Reformed;</hi> Reforme we did, when they would not, by degrees, what was first found to be amiss by themselves, before, and at, their little Synod of <hi>Trent,</hi> (for no other then so was it, compared to a truly Generall, or universall Councill, <hi>Italy</hi> alone being but a spot, or parsell of the Universe;) And retain we did so much as the circumstances of those times would permit, of the Doctrine and Discipline transmitted to us from the more ancient, because being, as called, the Primitive Church, as it extendeth to the first five Centuries at least, if no more; which her H. might have found averred by all the Orthodox Fathers, and other Learned Writers, then, and since then, of our <hi>English</hi> Nation; whose works, if they had not come to her sight before, all Libraries, at her desire, would have been searched for her satisfaction, and why some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to that purpose was not seasonably order'd, I am not to be accountable; And if Mr. <hi>Iones</hi> had said no more but that either her R. H. departed from us, or her Directors, who e're they were, left her solitary in her choice, upon too easie termes, I could have little contradicted.</p>
            <p>That somewhat more of what they opin'd, and practis'd, might have been taken in by our first Reformers, or may be yet by a Nationall Synod, or Convocation, if commissioned to consider of it, I freely grant, and suppose it to be the sense of our best Divines; for King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegm takes not with all, nor may be taken in a strict restraint to what is already done, <hi>I like not riding so near;</hi> For better Authority then my own, I will cite no other, (and am sure I can cite no better) then Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> nor any more authentick part of his workes, then his private Prayers; who, in his Manuall of Meditations, and private Devotions, for <hi>Monday</hi> every week, beggs of the Lord, for the Church Catholic Confirmation, and Enlargement; Eastern delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and unity; Western (wherein ours is included) perfection and peace; but more expresly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101706:6"/>
for the <hi>British</hi> (which is our own) supply of what is wanting, establishment of what remaines; (may the good Prelate's Prayer be answered to perpetuity in the last, whatsoever becomes of the first) For why we should quit what we have, because we have not all we would, and go over we well know not, why, or whither, is a Riddle I yet understand not; nor, if I may enjoy my share in what we have, though I never have it of what we want, (it being no part of my province to gain enlargement,) I hope my conscience will never be much perplexed about our present, wherein soever defective, State.</p>
            <p>But the three remarkes her R. H. made in reading Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>'s History seemed so hainous, or odious, as ought not, she thought, to be digested toward a Reformation.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Henry the eight's Luxery,</hi> the Popes restraint of which made him struggle, and at last get loose.</item>
               <item>2. The covetousness and sacriledge of the Lord Protector to <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth; And</item>
               <item>3. The nullity of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Title to the Crown.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The last of which I do not find asserted, but rather the contrary, by <hi>Dr. Heylyn,</hi> who makes the Estate of Sir <hi>Thomas Bollen</hi>'s Family to have become fortunate by the production of that Princess, to the Realm of <hi>England, Pag.</hi> 86. Who reports the illegitimation of the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and entailing of the Crown, for the default of issue male, upon the Princess <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> somewhat he has of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight's apprehension, when he became as much offended at his second Marriage, as he had been at the first, That the legitimation of his Daughter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> might be as likely to be called in question, in the time succeeding, as that of <hi>Mary</hi> in the former, <hi>Pag.</hi> 91. yet afterward, That if her Mother had only lost her head, though with the loss of her honour, it would have been no bar to her Daughter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from succeeding her Father in the Throne, <hi>pag.</hi> 93. And what ground was found out, on which to dissolve the Marriage, he cannot tell, it not appearing upon record; but that it was dissolved, does, by a solemn instrument under the Seale of Archbishop <hi>Cranmer &amp;c. pag.</hi> 94. And if it were done <hi>errante clave,</hi> (as, for ought we know, it might) our doubting Dutchess was not obliged to demurr upon that, unless with intent to suspend her censure, and her change too, (upon that account) untill better assurance, which neither the Doctor's History, nor any other, I have heard of, could give her. Finally, whatsoever difficulties might be made, That the Crown did of right belong to her, when the point was brought to issue, both the Doctor ownes, upon the death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Parliament then sitting could not deny it her. <hi>Pag.</hi> 101.</p>
            <p>Her Highnesses scruple rested then, it seemes, upon K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s Lust after change of Wives, and her abomination of Sacriledge lay'd to the charge of him and others, which I know none of our faithfull Historians have much endeavoured to excuse, or palliate; It being the sense of them all, which my Lord Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> thus declared in his <hi>Schisme garded, pag.</hi> 58. Posterity is not guilty of their Ancestours transgression further then they do imitate them, or maintain them. And as for acts of Sacriledge and the like impieties (as certainly <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and some others cannot be freed from such) they are by us as freely charged upon the actors, as by any <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manist</hi> they can be, sayeth the sound and learned Dr. <hi>Hammond, ch.</hi> 7. of Schisme, adding, But yet Sacriledge is no more Schisme then Adultery, and the Church, on which one sin hath been committed, cannot be from thence proved to be guilty of every other. These, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more authorities to intercept such objections, if the Dutchess knew not, her H. cannot be well excused; and if she did, which may more reasonably be supposed, how can you and I Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> afford credit to Mounsieur <hi>Maimburg,</hi> that she would use so weak an argument, to justifie her Secess. So that her Highnesses imagination, was unnecessarily troubled about the concurrence of God's Spirit with such hainous acts, and manifest impieties, as the libertinage of K. <hi>H.</hi> 8. The Lord Protectour <hi>Seymour</hi>'s Sacriledge, and Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Usurpation, (if it may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.) But the H. Spirit might go along with a finall renunciation of the Pope's usurpt Supremacy, and tyranny over our King and Nation, after 400 years dispute about the point, with intervalls, and variety of success on either side; And an Oath may be tender'd to maintain the Kings In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Praerogative in Church affairs, <hi>quoad extra,</hi> without any offence, or resistance of the said H. Spirit; Of which Praerogative yet if a King (which I put at large, because all <hi>Christian</hi> Kings are alike concern'd in the case) will at any time remit, and deliver freely, or with some reserve, his Ecclesiastike Power into the hands of the Church, or into his whom he will constitute, for the time, <hi>Caput unitatis,</hi> the Head of unity in his Realm (as many have done, and do at this present) I know no reason, why the Subject should not submit to that derivative power, which being held of the King, is ordained of God; For to say, That, before the Reformation made, any Subject might have withdrawn his obedience to the King, because the King had vested that part of his power in the Pope, I fear had been little less than resisting, or at least declining the ordinance of God; to go on no further in that Text.</p>
            <p>But I return to our most unhappily perplexed Princess, who takes offence at the Bishops, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101706:6"/>
were of the first Reformers, for pretending their sole design to have been re-establishing the Doctrine and Discipline of the Primitive Church, after <hi>Henry</hi> 8. had enterpriz'd a separation from <hi>Rome</hi> upon no other account but his own satisfaction in criminall pleasures: What K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8's principall, or less principall intents were, I know none but the ghost of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour, if raised again, could assure her; The most Reverend Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> no doubt, knew most of his mind, from beginning to end, in the matter of divorce, and what annexes it had of his criminall pleasures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but, in what I have seen of his Grace's writing, I met with nothing at all which in that particular could have gratified her Highness: yet be K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s meaning alltogether so bad as suspected, I understand not why the Reverend Bishops, who were better inclined, should be involved with him in the sin, being instruments, under God, of bringing good out of evil, and who, by such degrees as K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s other policies would permit, made good that pretence, both the rest of his, and in the few years of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. his Reign, howsoever managed by that covetous Lord Protectour in his minority, as in a great part, beside other instances, our Historians have mentioned, does undeniably appear in that little Code of Reformation, as I may call it, entituled, <hi>The institution of a Christian Man,</hi> composed and published by, and with the consent of many pious and prudent persons, <hi>Anno</hi> 1537. <hi>viz,</hi> the two Archbishops at that time, nineteen of the Bishops, eight Archdeacons, and seventeen Professours of Divinity, Ecclesiasticall and Civill Lawes; which book and some other like, beside many Dedicatory and Praefatory Epistles praefixed to them, if her H. had neither in possession, nor seen, she was strangely destitute of due assistance, and not well praepared for so severe a censure in a praecipitate Declaration.</p>
            <p>Nor yet much better, I fear, for the application, she next made, to instruct her self in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversiall points between us and the <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholiques, having not read, as may be presumed, the Primitive Fathers, and Councels, but relying upon sole Scripture, without the Conciliators of Texts, (if not opposite, inconsistent in shew) nor other authentike Interpreters, but her own private spirit, perhaps forearmed with prayers and teares, but not praeassured by promise of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine assistance, and all desired success in the revelation of truth, (the solemn objection thrust upon us, successively by the Papists) and a too forward adventure, which most commonly imports more haste then good speed, as is here manifested by the sequel, in her own Confession, That the Scripture she believed not her self, by her self, capable to understand; Yet on her H. went, and, notwithstanding the distrust she had of self and solitary abilities, to her astonishment, in the most difficult points of all, drew with her own Bucket more truth, as she was mis-perswaded, from the bottom of the Well, then the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> could do with hers, who went her way, and left her water-pot behind her, having her thirst quencht indeed, yet not with the water she her self had drawn, but with that of the Spirit, infused from the mouth of the <hi>Messias,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Prophet, the <hi>Christ,</hi> as the <hi>Samaritan</hi> so good as confessed to the Citizens she earnestly called upon to come and see, not to suddainly believe, until better attested to 'em; <hi>Venite &amp; videte,</hi> not <hi>venite &amp; credite,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas</hi> has it from St. <hi>Chrysostom;</hi> And <hi>proijciat hydriam qui vult Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelizare.</hi> He, or she, that will evangelize, or interpret the Gospell rightly, must leave his Bucket behind him, or break his Water-pot in pieces.</p>
            <p>[<hi>I' ay tronve neantmoins, &amp;c.</hi>] Yet notwithstanding her distrust, her H. found what she could not promise her self so soon to discover, severall things, which now appeared so plain, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her judgment, so easie to comprehend, that she wondred a thousand times, how so long time had passed without reflecting on 'em;</p>
            <p>The particulars, whereof she now was strongly convinced, [<hi>fortement convaincue</hi>] were, 1. The reall presence of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in the Sacrament of the Altar; 2. The infallibility of the Church. 3. Confession, Auricular she meanes; And 4. Prayers for the Dead; Of all which could I be convinced by the strongest argument I have heard, or read, in their Controversiall Writers, I would soon be so far converted too.</p>
            <p>Of the first so many volumes have been written on both sides, that I am perswaded, there can be little argument invented new on either, to avoid transcript, or the Author's disrepute of being plagiary, but what is futile in so serious a quaestion, or what makes the Schisme and Distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us unnecessarily, if not affectedly, greater; for, setting aside the History of opinions in the severall ages of the Church, the quotations of Fathers, and other modern Authors, the variety of expressions, every man desiring to utter his own mind in his own words, I really believe, the substance of what we mean, as relating to the whole controversie, might be as well, and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly, contracted into one single sheet, as spread upon so many thousand quires of Paper which fly about the world. But to the point.</p>
            <p>The reall presence [<hi>la presence reelle</hi>] in the Sacrament of the Altar was the first thing her R. H. missed in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> I hope the Reverend D. <hi>Sutclive</hi> did not, whose book she ever had in her hand, when we approached to administer the body and blood of our Saviour to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101706:7"/>
her, upon her knees; If he did, I am sure his equalls, and his superiours, our Church Dignitaries and others, have not declined the term <hi>Real,</hi> from the beginning of our Reformation to this day, nor to declare what is meant by the same, according to the sense and acception of the Primitive Fathers, whom they cite in multitudes to authorize the Doctrine of our Church therein; Of some the most eminent I shall render their own words, and afterward apply my self to what follows.</p>
            <p>Let the most Reverend Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> be the first, who in the Preface of his Answer unto D. <hi>Stephen Gardiner p.</hi> 1. sayeth</p>
            <p>Where I use to speak sometimes (as the old Authors do) that Christ is in the Sacraments, I mean the same as they did understand the matter, that is to say, not of <hi>Christ</hi>'s carnall presence in the outward Sacrament, but sometimes of his Sacramentall presence———</p>
            <p>That <hi>Christ</hi> and his holy Spirit be <hi>truely,</hi> and <hi>indeed,</hi> present by their mighty and sanctifying power, vertue, and grace, in all them that worthily receive the same.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. of his first Book of the Sacrament. As he giveth the Bread, so giveth he his very body to be eaten with our <hi>Faith.</hi> And therefore I say, that <hi>Christ</hi> giveth himself <hi>truely</hi> to be eaten, chawed, and digested, but all is <hi>Spiritually</hi> with <hi>Faith,</hi> not with mouth.</p>
            <p>The Reader is to take notice, That when his Grace useth the termes <hi>verily</hi> and <hi>indeed,</hi> which are the same in our Church-Catechisme, I understand his sense aequivalent to theirs after him, who say, <hi>really,</hi> upon the like occasion, neither he nor they meaning more, or less, then our Church does, nor all otherwise then did the Primitive Fathers; for when <hi>really</hi> is extended to denote <hi>transubstantially,</hi> his Grace afterward utterly disclaimes it.</p>
            <p>As does likewise the Right Reverend Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> of <hi>Sarum,</hi> our Church Apologist against the Papists. <hi>pag.</hi> 319. of his Reply to Mr. <hi>Harding</hi>'s Answer; We teach the people, not that a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Sign, or Token, but that <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body, and Blood, <hi>indeed</hi> and <hi>verily</hi> is given unto us; that we <hi>verily</hi> eat it: that we <hi>verily</hi> drink it; that we <hi>verily</hi> be relieved, and live by it.—Yet we say not, either that the substance of the Bread or Wine is done away: or that <hi>Christ's</hi> Body is let down from Heaven, or made <hi>Really,</hi> or <hi>Fleashly</hi> Present in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The most Reverend Archbishop <hi>Laud</hi> declines not at all the word, but commends it for the best that can be used in the matter of the H. Sacrament, <hi>pag.</hi> 188. of the Relat. of his Conf. speaking of <hi>C. Bellarmine,</hi> thus; Now if he had left out Conversion, and affirmed only <hi>Christ's reall presence</hi> there, after a mysterious; and indeed an ineffable manner, no man could have spoke better.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>pag.</hi> 192. And for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nothing is more plain, than that it believes and teaches the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Reall</hi> presence of <hi>Christ</hi> in the Eucharist. And this his Grace declares; not only for himself, but urgeth, that Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> comes more plainly, and more home to it than <hi>Frith,</hi> [a Martyr for it that had said enough before] For if you understand (saith he) by this word <hi>really, Reipsa,</hi> that is in very deed and effectually; so <hi>Christ</hi> by the grace and efficacy of his Passion, is <hi>indeed</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> present, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if by this word <hi>Really,</hi> you understand <hi>Corporaliter Corporally,</hi> in his natural and Organical Body, under the Forms of Bread and Wine, 'tis contrary to the Holy Word of God.</p>
            <p>And so likewise Bishop <hi>Ridley.</hi> Nay, Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> addes yet farther, and speaks so fully to this Point, as I think no man can add to his Expression. Both you and I (saith he) agree in this: That in the Sacrament is the very <hi>true</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> Body and Blood of Christ, even that which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> which ascended into Heaven, which sits on the right hand of God the Father; which shall come thence to judge the quick and the dead. Only we differ in <hi>modo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the aforesaid Prelates the learned Bishop <hi>Mountagu</hi> thus accords <hi>pag.</hi> 250. of his Answer to the Gagger, He gave substance, and <hi>really</hi> subsisting essence, who said, This is my body: this is my Blood: It. <hi>pag.</hi> 251. Poor Woodcock or Catholique Cockscomb, that sendest a Protestant to seek a figure, who is as <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>substantiall</hi> as any Papist.</p>
            <p>Id. afterward in his Appeale <hi>pag.</hi> 289. speaking to the Informers. Which <hi>Reall</hi> presence, in your Divinity, is flat Popery; but not in the Divinity of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for this he cites Bishop <hi>Bilson, Andrews, Morton;</hi> and for the easie accommoding the difference between them and us, were it not for the Jesuites faction on their side, and the Puritans on ours, the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Hooker,</hi> that Puritanomastix, as he calls him.</p>
            <p>To this effect is the late Bishop of <hi>Durham's</hi> first Chapter in his accurate History of <hi>Papal Transubstantiation,</hi> where the <hi>Reall,</hi> that is, the <hi>true,</hi> and not imaginary Presence of Christ in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, is asserted out of the Sacred Scriptures, according to the very words praefixed in the Title of it.</p>
            <p>And the most acute, no less solid, Bishop <hi>Ier. Taylor</hi> in his larger Tractate, entituled, <hi>The Reall presence and Spirituall of Christ in the blessed Sacrament,</hi> Proved against the Doctrine of Transubstantiation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101706:7"/>Which Doctrine is, that no question her H. meanes, though couched in the word <hi>Reall,</hi> not considering, perhapps, that <hi>Real-Spiritual</hi> may alltogether as well be in conjunction as <hi>Real-Carnal,</hi> or <hi>Corporeal;</hi> otherwise her complaisance in the discovery had not been such as to deserve her astonishment, or wonder, when of so many learned Writers we have upon that Subject, she could scarce have taken a book in hand which would not have set the terme, or true sense and meaning of it in her view, with the concession of our Church, if she had read, or heard other of it, the Authours were not well studyed in the point, but took on trust the expressions of our early Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters after the Reformation, whereas the true state of the Controversy was not so clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood at first on either side as it is now. Sayed the Bishop of <hi>Derry, Sch. Gard. p.</hi> 378. And being so, in the opinion of those I mention'd, and many more may the difference, so formidable as it looks, be much more easily reconciled then heretofore, both sides contributing their symbol to a happy peace, and not struggling for that which never will be made good and evident on either; For had her H. known or consided, what the Authour of <hi>Fiat lux</hi> saies, there have been fifty, or threescore several interpretations of these few words, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> This is my body, which, it may be, upon further search he might have multiplied to a hundred by variety of paraphrase in every man's peculiar distinct way of expression, and did all those vanish, or return to their first origen, the literal sense at last, by fixing a more steady eye, or serious thought then formerly upon the Text? Bishop <hi>Mountagu</hi> who had many Bibles, and Interpreters of all sorts about him, after a thorough search, could not so determine it, but much otherwise, <hi>viz.</hi> Transubstantiation, or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writt: but it is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion unto many superstitions. Appeal <hi>pag.</hi> 297. Yet allthough we deny the change so called to be reasonable, or intelligible; I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not that we deny it to be possible; by God's omnipotence, which is not limited by rules of reason, and naturall Philosophy, in extraordinary transmutations; But to say, God does it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he can do it, is no logicall argument; nor holds it any more in this, then in a thousand other things, within the infinitude of his power, which we be sure, are not, nor do we believe shall be ever actually accomplished.</p>
            <p>And why her H. should be troubled in conscience about that she knew, or might have known, many learned, honest, and industrious men on both sides (for that is truth, had her H. taken time to look about her) could never attain to, beyond the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>! or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>! I confess is my wonder; yea, and so much the more, because she had in her own power, which was enough to quiet her own Conscience, what she alledg'd she wanted; for I positively demand, who hindred her from believing Transubstantiation, if by Revelation or self-perswasion, or submission to the opinion of some admired, or endeared person, she was prevailed with to believe it true, or intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secally to adhaere to it, as if it were? Who from paying divine worship, after such mis-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion or submission, to the body and blood of our Saviour, when tender'd to her upon her knees? The Church directed her R. H. among others, what she would have her do, according to the Doctrine published in the Confession of it, but the Church enquired not after what she thought, or with what intention she acted her part in that holy duty, and, I hope her Conscience was not troubled, because others did not, upon like principles, or in kind compliance, what she would have them, and tell her H. so at their hazard. Our Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> quotes D. <hi>Tonstall,</hi> (and seemes not to dislike it) saying thus; Of the manner and meane how this might be (whether by Transubstantiation, or otherwise) perhaps it had been better to leave every man that would be Curious, to his own Conjecture: as before the Councel of <hi>Laterane,</hi> it was left at liberty, Pef. of Apol. <hi>pag.</hi> 237. And in generall upon like occasion (wherein this may be suppos'd included) sayes that H. Martyr Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi>—how far that Belief or any other, sinkes into a man's heart, is for none to judge but God. Conf. <hi>p.</hi> 213. Further yet, Her ghostly Father of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, if none of ours were to be trusted, might have instructed her, That <hi>Suarez,</hi> among divers other, a learned man of great note with them, made plain confession, That, to believe Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation is not necessary to be taken in to the Doctrine of Fayth; and why then should her H. be so much concerned for it? And D. <hi>Fisher</hi> sometime Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> That it cannot be proved by any Scripture. Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> Repl. And if not thence to be proved, her perswasion was groundess, and her labour in the search fruitless, if not fallicious as to her self; for most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, those deep-learned Doctours could dive further into the sense of H. Writ, then a Lady that meant well, but had little skill in Metaphysicks to assist her, which <hi>Suarez</hi> himself sayes this point requires; but against private illumination, or a self-conceit of it, whether so, or no, I can say nothing. In summe, the change that does so divide us, what e're it be, is a secret of God's own making, and a secret of God's own keeping, wherein her H. might have acquiesced, with the like moderation, as the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> shewed, before she came to be Queen, which she might have read with the other passages in Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi>'s History, very substantially, and significantly, allthough rhythmically thus expressed,</p>

            <p>I add but one word more; The mysteries being so great, and the difficulties being so many; I much doubt, whether the more intelligent sort of <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholiques do themselves believe Transubstantiation, though so earnest for it, to obtain the better Character among the more simple Devotes that do; which when I was in those countreys, I adventur'd to tell some of them, who had patience enough to hear it, without making a very earnest, much less a reproachfull, answer; and very glad I am, that, upon this occasion, I have met with countenance, and am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in my suspicion by a most reverend and able Authour, Archbishop <hi>Laud</hi> Conf. <hi>pag.</hi> 192. where his Grace declares opinion in these few lines.</p>
            <p>As for the Learned of those zealous-men, that died in this Cause in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, they denied not the <hi>Reall</hi> presence, simply taken, but as their Opposites forced Transubstantiation upon them, as if that and the <hi>Reall</hi> presence had been all one; Whereas all the Ancient <hi>Christians</hi> ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the one, and none but Modern and Superstitious <hi>Christians</hi> believe the other; <hi>if they do believe it: for I, for my part doubt they do not.</hi> And as for the Un-learned in those times, and all times, their zeal (they holding the Foundation) may eat out their Ignorances, and leave them safe.

               <p>Her Highnesses next discovery was an Infallibility of the Church, but points not to any one or more Texts of Scripture, by which she owned her self convinced; nor yet teils us, what she means by the Church, nor in what points, or cases, she would have it infallible, unless she intends all; And where is that, or those Texts of Scripture that did convince her? What concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility she might have learned from our most eminent Writers, I shall produce, for their sakes who may be under the same difficulty, and, perhaps, not so successfull, or sodain, in meeting with the like satisfaction as our Dutchess did.</p>
               <p>As for the most learned, and acute Dr. <hi>Ier. Taylour,</hi> I can not tell, whether I were best advise 'em to read, first, or last of all, his 1.

               <p>Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> in his Answer to <hi>Smith</hi>'s Preface, speakes not home enough to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, where he sayth; Truth it is, indeed, that the Church doth never wholly erre, for ever in most darkness God shineth unto his elect, and in the midst of all iniquity he governeth them so with his holy word and spirit, that the gates of Hell prevaile not against them————This Church is the piller of truth, because it resteth upon God's word, which is the true and sure foundation, and will not suffer it to erre and fall. <hi>Pag.</hi> 405. 406. It is the invisible Church his Grace meanes, for of the outward, and visible, he absolutely denies it; and this proves, I confess, rather the perpetuity, then infallibility, of the Church.</p>
               <p>Bishop <hi>Field</hi> recollects several acceptions of the Church, <hi>Book</hi> 4. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. First, as it comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the whole number of believers, that are, and have been, since Christ appeared in the flesh; which Church, he sayes, is absolutely free from all errour and ignorance of Divine things, that are to be known by revelation. The second acception is, as it comprehendeth only all those believers, that are, and have been, since the Apostles time; which, in things, that are, of necessity, to be expresly known by all that will be saved, that it should erre, is impossible; And, further, thinkes it as impossible, that any errour, whatsoever, should be found in all the Pastours and Guides of the Church, thus generally taken. Touching the Church, as it comprehendeth onely the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers that now are in the world, he sayes, In things necessary to be known, and believed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, and distinctly, it never is ignorant, much less doth it erre; yea, in things that are not absolutely necessary to be known and believed expresly, and distinctly, it never is ignorant, much

               <p>But, because I doubt, whether our Princess made reflexion upon the Church in such a diffusive sense, and supposing that she wanted such an Oracle of Infallibility, as to which there could be access for imediate resolve of scruples and doubts, upon all occasions, (which, I fear, had her H. lived longer to make triall, would have been as much missing in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as in ours,) I must lay aside many other excellent Writers upon this point, I have before me, or at hand, and take up one, so learned, and <hi>Orthodox</hi> as the best, and him the rather, because he useth not to be so nice in uttering his mind freely and learnedly, and yet making it consistent with the Article of our Church, though in appearance, point blanck contradictory to what he resolutely concludes, it is Bishop <hi>Mountagu</hi> I mean, who in his Appeal, where he justifies what he had said in his answer to the Gagger; his Position is this,</p>

               <p>Let any man living shew me, sayes he, any historicall mistakings, misreportings, where, when, in what any Generall Councell, according to true acception, or Church Representative, hath so erred in the resolution and decission of that Councell; for in the debating of doubts, questions, propositions, the case is otherwise, and not the same.</p>
               <p>I conceive and acknowledge but four Councells of this kind, that of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>

               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> may seem to have been of a contrary mind in her determinations; For <hi>Artic.</hi> 21. we read thus</p>
               <p>Generall Councels—————when they be gathered together (forasmuch as they be an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of men, whereof all be not governed with the spirit and word of God) they may erre, and sometime have erred, even in things pertaining unto God.</p>
               <p>Which decision of the Article is not home to this purpose, as he particularly proves, and hath the approbation of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Francis White,</hi> afterward Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> that he found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therein [in that and his whole Book] but what is agreeable to the Publick Faith, Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of whose Doctrine the said 21 <hi>Article</hi> is a noted part.</p>
               <p>But because the Bishop leaves this Infallibility at above a thousand yeares distance, <hi>viz:</hi> the last Generall Councel of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> attributing no such thing to any the pretended Generall Councels since; it is necessary I go seek a supplement somewhere else, for the guidance of doubting persons, who may be at loss, what to think the state of the Church hath been in so long an intervall; and, if they take Posterity into their care, what it may be in a much longer yet to come, before such another Generall Councel meet, now the Latine Church seemes to be finally settled upon the Lees of the Decisions in the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi> Among those many I have turned over, I find not where to furnish my self better then from the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Whether a Generall Councel may erre, or not, is a Question of great consequence in the Church of Christ, To say, It can not erre, leaves the Church not onely without remedy against an errour once determined; but also without sense that it may need a remedy, and so without care to seek it——To say, It can erre, seemes to expose the members of the Church to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and wavering in the Faith, to make unquiet spirits, not onely to disrespect former Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the Church, but also to slight and contemn whatsoever it may now determine.————I said, the Determination of a Generall Councel erring was to stand in force, and to have External Obedience at least yielded to it, till Evidence of Scripture, or a Demonstration to the Contrary, made the Errour appear; and until thereupon another Councel of equal Authority did reverse it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 146. 147.</p>
               <p>In the following Considerations is added, with submission to our Mother the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and to the Mother of us all, the Universall Catholick Church of <hi>Christ;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Assistance of the H. Ghost is without errour, that's no quaestion: and as little there is, That a Councel hath it.</p>
               <p>This, in the abstract, is as home as need to be in the point, but this, afterward, is somewhat moderated, by distinguishing the infallibility of the after-Councels from that of the Apostles themselves, <hi>Acts,</hi> 15. where they say of themselves, and the Councel held by them: <hi>It seemes</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:101706:9"/>
                  <hi>good to the Holy Ghost and to us,</hi> (who might indeed, well say it) but he does not find, that any General Councel since, though they did implore, as they ought, the assistance of that <hi>Blessed Spirit,</hi> did ever take upon them to say, <hi>in-terminis,</hi> in express terms of their Definitions, <hi>Visum est Spiritui Sancto, &amp; Nobis; It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us,</hi> Acknowledging thereby (as I conceive) a great deal of difference in the Certainty of those things which a Generall Councel had after determined in the Church, and those which were settled by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> when they sate in Councel; But then, again, though he did not find, That they used this speech punctually in terms, yet the Fathers, when they met in Councel, were Confident, and spake it out, That <hi>They had assistance from the Holy Ghost;</hi> yet so, as that <hi>They neither took Themselves, nor the Councels They sate in, as Infallibly Guided by the Holy Ghost, as the Apostles were;</hi> And he saies, <hi>Valentia</hi> is very right in concluding, That though the Councel say, they are gathered together in the Holy Ghost, yet the Fathers are neither arrogant, in using the speech, nor yet Infallible for all that. If other their Writers had used the like moderation, perhaps her R. H. had not been so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about it.</p>
               <p>I expect nothing more will be obtained from other our Controvertists towards the satisfaction of any in like condition; yet because Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> had a more peircing eye of reason then most of the rest, I will summe up his method so short as I can, and see what we can make good out of it.</p>
               <p>This he layes as the groundwork of his Discourse with <hi>F. Knott;</hi> That the distinction of Points Fundamental, and not Fundamental, is in this Controversie good and pertinent: And that the Catholique Church may erre in the latter kind of the said Points.</p>

I will fix upon one or two of them, in whose conversion they so good as tell us, they are most triumphant.</p>
               <p>Let the first be Dr. <hi>Vane,</hi> Chaplain to his late Majesty, who, in the very entrance to his sixth Chapter of <hi>The Infallibility of the Church,</hi> begins thus;</p>
               <p>Now that the Catholique Church, (which Society of <hi>Christians</hi> soever it be) is the onely, faithful, and true witness of the matter of God's word, to tell us what it is, and what is not it, the only true interpreter of the meaning of God's word, and the last and finall judge of all controversies, that may arise in matters of Religion, and that she is not onely true, but that she can not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, seeing she is infallible.</p>
               <p>Our Church, which is Catholique too, in concurrence with that he went to, is, he knew, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the first four Generall Councels to the Fathers of the first five or six hundred yeares, from whom we receive the Canon we have of the H. Bible, and to whose writings we go for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of any Texts that, any way, seem doubtfull, if necessary to be resolved; In others not so considerable, for ought I know, we leave every man to his own diligence in comparing Text with Text, for mutuall illustration; and to his own reason for inference of the best truth from the premises he makes himself; or if so ignorant, he can make none, we send him to the lips of his Parochiall Priest, or some other, at his choyce, which certainly should preserve at least, so much knowledge, as to determine the little difficulties brought to him, according to the sense of our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101706:9"/>
Nationall Church, if such as whereof she hath taken any notice. For Catholique Tradition we go to the Catholique Writers, so truely called; For what is unwritten we have no infallible li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Oracle to consult, no more have they, for ought I see, whereof any use can be made to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent satisfaction; and therein we may cry quitts, as afterward I shall briefly shew.</p>
               <p>The Conclusion herein lay'd down by D. <hi>Cressy,</hi> is as followeth;</p>
               <p>That it belongs alone to the Catholique Church, which is the onely Depositary of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, authoritatively, and with obligation, to propose those Revelations to all Christians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to interpret the Holy Scriptures, and to determine all emergent Controversies; and this to the end of the world, in as much as the Church by vertue of <hi>Christ's</hi> promises, and assistance, is not onely indefectible, but continually preserved in all truth.</p>
               <p>Of what Divine Revelations the Catholique Church is Depositary, I have already owned, <hi>viz.</hi> of the H. Scriptures, and the Primitive Fathers, in their Writings, as being the best and surest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters; The difficulty yet sticks at the determining emergent Controversies, which may be multiplied in <hi>infinitum,</hi> by too dubious, and over-scrupulous persons, so well in smaller, as greater, matters, in whose behalf, for living Oracles or other certainty of infallible resolution, I am yet to seek I confess; And therefore setting aside all nice disputes about indefectibility of their Church, and generality of Truth preserved by her, I must, and may, I hope, freely demand of <hi>Mounsieur Maimburg</hi>'s Proxy if he have any in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether the Controversies, or doubts raised in our Princess's breast, were not emergent, whereof since her <hi>R. H.</hi> could not be resolved with us, I may, modestly, ask whither they sent her for satisfaction; or rather, what infallible Judge it was, whom they brought to her bedside in that infirm condition; I would use no railery in these solemn discourses, but their matter of stating the case in quaestion does, as it were, obliege me to do somewhat like it, after which short apologie, I hope I may be allowed to proceed; The Pope in person it could not be, who is resident at <hi>Rome,</hi> and has enough to do with the Controversies and emergences, that from all parts of Christendome are carryed to him; The Catholique Church it could be less, in what notion soever taken, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Collective, Diffusive, Representative, &amp;c. No Councel sitting, the dispersed Members of any impossibility not consulted; and from the Conclave, I hope, came not the infallible spirit, I say, not in a Carriers budget, as my Lord of <hi>Derry</hi> hath been pleased, in a little ironie, to word it, with reference to that at <hi>Trent;</hi> In fine, this infallible Judge might be <hi>Monsieur Maimburg</hi> himself, or some other Ghostly Father nearer hand, alwayes readily prepared, <hi>In nomine Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, sanctae<expan>

               <list>
                  <item>1. Whether an ignorant man (I insert, or a knowing, but doubting Lady) be bound to believe any point to be decreed by the Church, when his Priest or Ghostly Father assures him, it is so.</item>
                  <item>2. Whether his ghostly Father may not err in telling him so: and whether any man can be obliged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of damnation, to believe an errour.</item>
                  <item>3. Whether he be bound to believe such a thing defined, when a number of Priests, perhaps ten, or twenty, tell him, it is so; And what assurance he can have, that they neither err, nor deceive him in this matter.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p>4. I add another upon my own account, though others may have done it before me; whether it be not the same Church, which now averrs her self to be infallible, that made the first decision of it; and if so, how she can be sure, she erred not, in making the said decision; which may carry on the question <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum?</hi> where I leave it; concluding with my Lord Bishop of <hi>Derry's</hi> question in the case;</p>
                     <p>What availeth it to say, they have the Church for an infallible Iudge, whilst they are not certain, or do not know, what the Church is; or who this infallible Iudge is, <hi>Sch. Gard. Pag. 406.</hi> Or what sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction had her <hi>R. H.</hi> in deserting our Church, because she found no infallibility pretended by it; and going over to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which, though it pretends all that may be to it, yet in reality can have as little, as appears by what is said above.</p>

               <p>The said Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> indeed, is very strict in this Article, imposing upon her Penitents a particular enumeration of all mortall sinnes, with all their severall aggravating circumstances, which our <hi>Royall</hi> Martyr in his Confer. <hi>pag.</hi> 172. sayes, is either not possible, or, at least, not necessary; and hath a colourable argument for that his opinion; which alone, then applied to the Marquiss, if it fully answer not the summe of all the learned <hi>Portuguise</hi> Doctors, And radius, (of whom Bishop <hi>Mountagu,</hi> gives this singular Elogy above others, <hi>qui ad Concilium Tridentinum attulit &amp; profundissimi Theologimentem, &amp; linguam Oratoris discrtissimi,</hi> that he carried with him

I say, if it answer's not the summe of all that eminent person hath, of all our Opposites most pertinently, amassed for particular and perfect confession, I wish it were strengthened by our most famed Controvertists of this time, toward the true stating the difference between us, and then commending the practice of what they approve to the best advantage, and reforming the frequency, and audacity, of sinn in this licentious age; Which the <hi>Romanists</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> do not alltogether with that fervent zeale, and diligent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, as is pretended, at least on their most solemn Festivals, when, usually, the greatest number address themselves to their Confessors, publikely in their Churches, who make such a slight scrutinie, and so indulgently dismiss their penitents, to save time, and to give all that come the satisfaction to take their turn, that I have often censur'd the practice of it there as a meere formall business, without enquiry into many circumstances of aggravation; Nor do I remember that I ever saw one single person arise from the knee with a penitentiall tear of sorrow upon the cheek.</p>
               <p>Yet, that some of their Fathers do, with integrity and discretion, mesnage that great concern, I will conclude with a report of what an honest <hi>Franciscan</hi> Friar, at St. <hi>Malo,</hi> told me and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Nation; That his course was this; <hi>When any penitent came to him for absolution, he would, the first time, treat him gently, and impose no hard penance, in consideration of humane frailty; That the second time he confessed a relapse to the same sin; he would deale more severely with him; But if the third time he came to be eased of a like burthen, he would not trifle away his time, in discoursing with him, but bid him go seek another Confessour, for himself would have no more, at all, to do with him.</hi>

               <p>The Right Reverend Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> gives us in short, what some others more enlarge upon; <hi>Schism gard. pag.</hi> 231. <hi>We condemn not all praying for the dead; not for their Resurrection, and the consummation of their happiness; but their</hi> [the Papists] <hi>prayers for their deliverance out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; for it is a great mistake, to think Purgatory must needs be yeilded, when we make such prayers;</hi> For which errour, Bishop <hi>Mountagu</hi> sharply reproves the Gagger, thus; <hi>You are a poor</hi> Ignaro, <hi>that think, Soules must needs be in Purgatory, that receive assistance from the Church; It may be your poor understanding will wonder at it; but know, Sir, I can admit Prayer for the Dead, and deny your Purgatory.</hi> Pag. 292. Which, I think, he repeats again to the Informers somewhere in his <hi>Appeale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bishop <hi>Field, Book</hi> 3. <hi>Ch.</hi> 17. explaineth the manner of it among the Ancients, <hi>viz. The custome of remembring the departed, naming their names at the Holy Table, in the time of the holy mysteries, and offering the Eucharist, (that is the sacrifice of praise) for there was a most ancient and godly custome, neither is it any way disliked by us.</hi>——In this sort they did most religiously observe and keep, at the Lord's Table, the commemoration of all the Patriarches, Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, Martyrs, and Confessours———: but if they wished any thing, it was the deliverance from the power of death, which, as yet, tyranniseth over one part of them, the speedy destroying of the last enemy, which is Death; the hastning of their resurrection, and joyfull publique acquitall of them in that great day, wherein they shall stand to be judged before the Judge of the quick and the dead. This was the practise of the whole Church, and this the meaning of their commemorations and prayers, which was good, and no way to be disliked.———It was the opinion of many of the Fathers, that there is no judgment to pass upon men till the last day; that all men are holden either in some place under the earth, or else in some other place appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, so that they come not into Heaven, nor receive the reward of their labours, till the generall judgment.</p>
               <p>Seven <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers he nameth, whose opinion is such, and refers to more, in the forecited Chapter.</p>
               <p>But Bishop <hi>Taylor,</hi> (whose diligence in his researches was indefatigable, and his disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, commonly, more successfull then any others) hath, beyond the forementioned, some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar observations about this point, which afford great allowances of Prayer for the Dead, yet no nearer approaches to Purgatory, held by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> See, Part 2. of his Dissuasive from Popery, <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. where you will find what followes;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. All the Fathers did pray for the Dead, yet they never prayed for their deliverance out of Purgatory, nor ever meant it.</item>

                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:101706:11"/>2. Though the Fathers prayed for the Soules departed, that God would shew them mercy; yet it was, that God would show them mercy in the day of Iudgment; In that formidable and dreadfull day, then there is need of much mercy unto us, saith St. <hi>Chrysostom;</hi> so, generally, Interpreters, Ancient and Modern, do understand it of <hi>Onesiphorus.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The faithfull departed are in the hands of <hi>Christ</hi> as soon as they die, and they are very well; And the Soules of the wicked are where it pleases God to appoint them to be tormented by a fearfull expectation of the day of Iudgment; but Heaven and Hell are reserved till the day of Iudgment; and the Devils themselves are reserved in Chaines of darkness unto the judgment of the great day, <hi>saith St. Jude,</hi> and in that day they shall be sentenc'd, and so shall all the wicked, to everlasting fire, which, as yet, is but prepar'd for the Devil and his Angels for ever.</item>
                  <item>4. Some of the Ancients speak of visitation of Angels to be imparted to the Soules departed, which is a mercy; And the hastening of the day of Iudgment is a mercy; And the avenging of the Martyrs upon their Adversaries is a mercy; for which the soules under the Altar pray, <hi>saith St. John in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:</hi> And the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers speak of a fiery trial at the day of judgment, through which every one must pass; and there will be great need of mercy.</item>
                  <item>5. After all this; there is a <hi>remission</hi> of sinnes proper to this world, &amp;c. But at the day of judgment there shall be a <hi>pardon</hi> of sinnes, that will crown this pardon, when God shall pronounce us pardon'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world; and when <hi>Christ</hi> shall actually and presentially rescue us from all the paines which our sinnes have deserved; even from everlasting pain: And that's the finall pardon, for which, till it be accomplished, all the faithfull do, night and day, pray incessantly, allthough to many, for whom they do pray, they friendly believe, that it is now certain, that they shall then be glorified.</item>
                  <item>6. St. <hi>Austin</hi> though, he had reason to pray for <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>remission</hi> for his Mother, for the reason's allready expressed, though he never thought his mother was in Purgatory. It was upon consideration of the dangers of every Soul that dies in <hi>Adam;</hi> and yet he affirms, she was, even before his death, alive unto <hi>Christ.</hi>

In the next page he reproves that initial errour of them that affirm, <hi>Communicantes &amp; offerentes pro Sanctis,</hi> imports not a Prayer; And afterward makes it clear, <hi>That the</hi> Greek <hi>Fathers did really pray for mercy, for pardon, for a place of rest, for eternal glory, for them who never were in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory;</hi> for it is a great ignorance, he sayes, to suppose, that when it is said, the sacrifice or oblation is offered, it must mean only thanksgiving, being called in St. <hi>Dionys,</hi>

               <p>And what more then this, Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> did the two most able Bishops that we have in <hi>England</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, as touching Prayer for the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to her R. H. in the Conference she had with 'em? and less then this how could they own, without a fallacy put on her, and defrauding the Church of <hi>England</hi> of what she indulgeth to her Children, in all that Reason, and Primitive practice will justifie? And if, as to themselves, they made use thereof in private, without making publique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession thereof, what thence has such a puny <hi>Presbyter</hi> as Mr. <hi>Iones</hi> to charge them with, who lets his sling slip at randome, being not furnish'd with the least pebble that can strike either of them in the forehead? For what is pretended that one of them confessed more, or answered her H. freely, when she pressed him upon the other points of Controversy, and principally on the <hi>Reall</hi> presence of <hi>Iesus Chrst</hi> in the Holy Sacrament of the Altar.</p>
               <p>That were he a Catholick, he would not change Religion; but that having been educated in a Church, in which he believed there was all that was necessary to Salvation, and there having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Baptisme, he thought he could not quit it without great scandall; is no more then what I presume, a great number in the communion of either Church would say after him; and they that say it not, do ordinarily, we find, change sides, when they have once prevailed with themselves to step over that consideration; And what one Noble person, worth many hundreds of Mr. <hi>Iones</hi>'s inspired party, has seriously owned to me, in his exile, after much earnest discourse upon that and other points, then whom there was, while he lived, no more intelligent and impartiall, free and familiar, Antipapist in the Peerage of our Kings dominions, the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> my <hi>quondam</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, of pious memory, is the Peer I mean.</p>
               <p>And if her R. H. had been presented, seasonably, with such a choice Collection, as I have here made, from the highly learned, and very Orthodox Grandees of our Church, (which will be further authorized, as occasion may require, by thrice the number, alike qualified, yea, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified too,) I see no reason, but she might have understood her self Catholick enough where she was, as in these, so in all other points controverted between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us; and no such ardent desire of change, no such inward paines and horrible disquiets upon account of her discourse with the two most able Bishops, need have urged her to the least complaint.</p>
               <p>What other method her H. took in so important an affair, for her entire satisfaction, since she has not thought fit more particularly to declare, it will be no discretion, nor good manners, in me to make conjecture. Certain it is, she could not do better, then in praying to God from her
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101706:11"/>
whole heart, (as, she sayes, she did) to calme the inquietude, and agitation of her troubled spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and to give her knowledge of the truth; But did her H. expect the answer to her prayers should be by immediate divine Revelation? Those Reverend Bishops could, and would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with other precedents, beside that of prayer, from devout noble Ladies in St. <hi>Hierome</hi> and other Fathers; And had she but opened a little book of my Lady <hi>Faulklands</hi> Letters, she might have seen the remedy applied to a spirit no less disconsolate and diffident, upon one account, then her own upon another;</p>
               <p>But in this unsteady state of doubts and fears, and an unsettled faith, being <hi>Christmas</hi> day, her H. goes to the King's Chappell, to participate of the Holy Sacrament, which, contrary to her hopes, brought new troubles upon her soul, and I wonder not a whitt at it, want of the <hi>Reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> or <hi>Corporeall</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> sense, being that which did most afflict her, whereof she might be well assured, little supply, or comfort, was to be had from the King's Chappell, and so her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, she thought, was lost.</p>
               <p>Her next essay was by address to a Catholique, for counsell, and if possible, for cure, which now at last, was, as her H. fancied, in some sort, effected by a good Priest he sent for [<hi>me fit venir un bon Prestre,</hi>] with whom conferring about her interiour condition, and souls salvation, the more she parlied, the more she felt her self intrinsecally carried off, and fortified by grace of the holy Spirit toward the change of Religion;</p>
               <p>A Gentleman of quick dispatch was this good Priest; but I hear nothing yet of his infallibility her H. lately lookt for, unless the other Catholick, who e're he was, that call'd him to her, passed his word for it in private, which security taken, all could not but be oracular that came from his mouth.</p>

               <head>Of the H. EUCHARIST in one or both kindes.</head>
               <p>As I find in the very first place, was his decision of receiving the H. Sacrament in one kind, in which one element if were not administred both the flesh and bloud of our Saviour, <hi>Christ</hi> would never have suffered the other to be substracted, and his Church deprived of half himself, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to abide with her (whole and entire, no doubt) to the end of the world; Nor could her H. think her self free to believe otherwise, or that <hi>Christ</hi>'s own words could be frustrate.</p>
               <p>Before I can well apply my self to reflect on this Article of half-communion, (as our Writers often call it) I think it not alltogether impertinent, to declare my dissatisfaction at the sodain change I observe of a disconsolate dejected Spirit, to an argumentative and active Soul, in search so superficiall, and so definitive, before full discovery; as if intent upon contradiction of her own practice so many yeares, and not startled at so quick a transition, from the unquestionable security of both elements in the H. Eucharist to the hazard of enjoying the intire end and effect of neither, when reduced to one.</p>
               <p>I am very prone to suspect something like a <hi>chasme,</hi> or <hi>hiatus</hi> here, a defect in transcript of the Declaration published in her Highnesses name, which <hi>Mounsieur Maimburg</hi> best knowes wherewith it <hi>should</hi> be, and, in fidelity to the trust reposed in him, <hi>ought,</hi> if so, to be made compleat;</p>
               <p>Howsoever, to let it pass from hand to hand, as delivered to us, and to wait upon her R. H. so immediately as she leads the way from her Closet to the publike Schooles, I can not but much commend the early exercise of her skill and prudence, in selecting that part of the question which best will bear discussion, and arresting her upon assurance of his word, who never <hi>did,</hi> nor, being Truth it self, <hi>can</hi> ever break his promise;</p>
               <p>For no notice at all is taken, how many yeares the Church persisted in submission to the express words of our Saviours institution, without substracting or altering ought in the celebration of this H. Sacrament; Whence Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> sayes, the Question that standeth between us is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether the Holy Communion at any time, within the space of six hundred years after</hi> Christ, <hi>were ever Ministred openly in the Church unto the People under one kind.</hi> Repl. to Mr. <hi>Hard.</hi> Ans. <hi>pag.</hi> 96.</p>
               <p>Which extent of time he might have drawn out much further, by the concession (among others) of <hi>Cassander,</hi> a man professing himself a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique, though of wonderfull modesty, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and learning, sayes Bishop <hi>Mountagu,</hi> whose words are these, as by his Lordship cited; <hi>It is manifest, that, in administration of the sacred Sacrament of the Eucharist, the Universall Church of Christ untill this day, and the</hi> Western <hi>or</hi> Roman <hi>Church, for more then</hi> 1000 <hi>yeares after Christ, especially in their solemn and ordinary dispensation of this Sacrament, did exhibit and give unto all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> Christians <hi>not</hi> one <hi>only, but</hi> both <hi>the kinds of Bread and Wine, as it is most clear and evident out of innumerable testimonies of the old Writers, both</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Latine, <hi>which I can make good, &amp;c.</hi> This he did in part, and the rest we may safely take upon his honest word, and credit; and 300 yeares more then he voucheth upon Bishop <hi>Mountagu</hi>'s, who saith after him too, <hi>This is every where the custome in all the World unto this day, but in the</hi> Roman <hi>exhorbitant Church; and was not quite</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:101706:12"/>
                  <hi>abolished in that Church, till about</hi> 1300 <hi>yeares after</hi> Christ; <hi>and by much art, colluding, and fine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, was retained from being cast out of that Church, in the late Conventicle of</hi> Trent, <hi>onely kept in for a faction, but mightily oppos'd by learned, honest, and conscionable</hi> Catholiques; Whereupon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and worthy Prelate joynes issue with all Papists living, <hi>That it never was otherwise used in all the Church of God, for above</hi> 1000 <hi>yeares after</hi> Christ; And, that if all the Papists living prove the contrary, he will subscribe to all Popery, <hi>Ans. to the Gagger, ch.</hi> 36. which is fair enough.</p>
               <p>So that I shall need call in no more help upon this account, except I may that observation of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Taylor</hi> and others, <hi>That the Primitive Church did excommunicate them that did not receive the holy Sacrament in both kinds.</hi> Pref. to Diss. Pag. 5.</p>
               <p>I return, therefore to her Highnessess argument drawn from the promise, and veracity, or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of Christ to make it good; Which promise being not particular, not restrained to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental presence, upon which we differ; much less limitted to the Patriarchate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that under the name or notion of his Universal Church, exclusive of all other Christians not taken into her communion; he left her free, at her own hazard, to commit sacriledge in this kind as in divers other, and to withdraw her self from him before ever he withdrew from her; and to afford his fuller presence by both representatives elsewhere, among a greater number of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, by computation, then those within her pale or Communion, in both kinds of this H. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment united, altho' in some other doctrines, ceremonies, and customes, or national, or Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, civical, or rural, or in other dissonancy whatsoever, more, or less, divided; But her H. had already changed her measures with her Religion, and was already principled a new by her good Priest, and not permitted to look back upon us unto whom for ever she had bid adieu. By this time, no doubt, she was taught to say, <hi>That Christ assured us, The Holy Sacrament,</hi> (though but a Wafer) <hi>containeth his flesh and blood, because the Church hath at length declared,</hi> he, <hi>or</hi> it, <hi>shall be so understood;</hi> Else we know not where to find any words of Christ that import the real subsistence of both ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in one, wine in bread, or bread in wine; eating his blood, or drinking his flesh; His Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was otherwise, and so was, accordingly, the practice of the Church for 1300 years together; And Dr. <hi>Cressey</hi> confesseth <hi>Exom.</hi> Pag. 602. <hi>This is not a matter of Doctrine, but meer practise; The Church sayes not, it is unlawful to take it in both kindes; Nor do we know, where Christ ever sayd, It is lawful, or allowable, to take it but in one;</hi> Extraordinary Cases come not under consideration here, and therefore he might have refrained to mention either the sick, or antipathetick people. As the Councel of <hi>Basil</hi> ought to have granted the poor <hi>Bohemians</hi> their dispensation, without so <hi>hard</hi> I say not onely, but most <hi>impious</hi> condition, if in their Consciences they were otherwise perswaded, as is believed, they were; I shall transcribe it from Archbishop <hi>Laud, Conf. pag.</hi> 198.—<hi>That it may be lawfull for them to receive the Sacrament as</hi> Christ <hi>commanded them, but not unless they will acknowledge (most opposite to Truth) that they are not bound by Divine Law to receive it in both kindes.</hi> At this rate our departed Dutchess might very well undertake for Christ's both promising and performing, when her good Preist, (whom now she must say after) has the like effrontery as others to make him say what they will; Like the Heretick <hi>Severus</hi> in <hi>Anastasius Sinatia,</hi> who maintained it lawfull, and even necessary, according to occasions, and emergent heresies, to alter and change the Doctrines of Christ: and the Cardinal of <hi>Cusa</hi> affirmed it lawfull diversly to expound the Scriptures according to the times. See Bishop <hi>Taylor, Reall Pres. Sect.</hi> 3. Where his Lordship very pertinently observes, <hi>That in the sixth Chapter of St.</hi> John's <hi>Gospell is earnestly pretended, that our Saviour taught the mystery of Transubstantiation; but with some different opinions;</hi>——And yet very many of the <hi>Romanists</hi> affirm, <hi>That in this Chapter</hi> Christ <hi>does not speak of sacramental or oral manducation, or of the Sacrament at all;</hi> And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> going to excuse it, sayes in effect, <hi>That they did not do it very honestly,</hi> for he affirms, <hi>that they did it, that they might confute the</hi> Hussites, <hi>and the</hi> Lutherans, <hi>about the Communion under both kinds:</hi> And if it be so, and not be so, as it may serve a turn, <hi>It is so for Transubstantiation, and it is not so for half-Communion;</hi> we have but little reason to rely upon their Judgment, or Candor, in any exposition of Scripture.</p>
               <p>And here sayes Archbishop <hi>Laud, their building with untempered mortar appears most manifestly, For they have no shew to maintain this, but the fiction of</hi> Thomas <hi>of</hi> Aquin, <hi>That he which receives the Body of</hi> Christ, <hi>receives also his Blood</hi> per concomitantiam, <hi>by concomitancy; because the Blood goes alwaies with the Body;</hi> of which Term <hi>Thomas</hi> was the first Author I can find, Conf. p. 198. <hi>Who was born, says</hi> Bellarmine, Anno 1224. <hi>and died</hi> Anno 1274. <hi>And as he was the first that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, so the Councel of</hi> Constance <hi>was the first that decreed it, after the year</hi> 1400. sayes my Lord of <hi>Derry,</hi> in his Answer to <hi>Mounsieur de la Militiere.</hi>

And the Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> speakes slightly of it, and good reason why, because we need it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing secure without it. <hi>Let what will become of Concomitance,</hi> sayes he, <hi>whilest we keep our selves to the Institution of</hi> Christ, <hi>and the Universall practice of the Primitive Church.</hi> p. 92.

his Lordships Christian charity was ever such, as, not to condemn so many millions of devout Souls, as, after the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> if not after the more early invention of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> neither had, nor could have, participated the H.

               <p>I am well - assured, neither of their Lordships were unacquainted with that special Treatise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this subject written by the pious <hi>Cassander, Dignissimus lectu,</hi> A book most worthy the reading, sayes <hi>Grotious,</hi> to whose judgement our moderate Divines are prompt enough favourably to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; beside what <hi>Modrevius</hi> hath in his on the same Argument, <hi>Vid.

               <p>What may be replyed to this, sure enough, that great Doctor, and amphibious <hi>Calvinist, Andr.

Certainly, if he thought it Sacriledge in good earnest, and properly so called, he could not but know it, at first sight, to be a sin; and the good Doctors apology in his behalf is but weak, and accordingly the learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> in his turn, takes no notice of it.

Let us therefore see what more he can say for <hi>Melanchthon;</hi> To shew his better opinion in the Case, he remits us to some select particles of his Writings, where he expostulates about <hi>Christs</hi> Institution, which being in generall for the whole Church, he demands, why one of the species, or kindes, is taken from part of the Church, whereof the <hi>Romanists</hi> gave many reasons, such as they were, in likelihood the same then, as since, which how well they will hold, is still the question whereof anon, This he confesseth, <hi>Melanchthon</hi> added afterward, <hi>se Ecclesiam excusare, quae hanc injuriam pertulit; that he excus'd the Church which suffer'd the injurie;</hi> and that's well enough, for we are on the suffering side; <hi>Rivet</hi> brings up the reer, and passeth his word, <hi>That yet</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchthon <hi>did not excuse those, that forbad not onely, but excommunicated, such as us'd the Cup;</hi> who said he did? not <hi>Grotius</hi> any where; as I remember; Who liked well enough where it could be had, and no order of the Church wherein he was matriculated, interposed to the contrary that the H. Sacrament should be administred in both kindes, whereof as himself participated, when among them whose use it was; so, it may be supposed, he advised his Family to do the like by choice, in a Countrey, where both were practised, and a third profession preferr'd to both, as in <hi>France;</hi> For when at <hi>Paris,</hi> I officiated at the honorable Residents, Sir <hi>Richard Brownes,</hi> his widow, &amp; daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with a third Lady of quality, who understood little of our language, after admission asked, communicated in both with us, according to the forme, and ceremonie of the knee prescribed by our Church.</p>
               <p>Concerning M. <hi>Bucer, Rivet</hi> answers directly, nothing to what by <hi>Grotius</hi> was alledged, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts his Reader another way, to the 74<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapter of his Defense of the <hi>Colonian Reformation:</hi> which is a usuall shift of his, though imputed by him in this very question, to his more plain-dealing Antagonist; <hi>But what find we there, whither he sends us? why, much after the rate as in</hi> Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon; we find that <hi>Bucer</hi> sayes; <hi>Quod alteram speciem Sacramenti in genere auferre, grave Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legium est. That to take away from all</hi> Christians <hi>in generall, either species of the Sacrament, is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sacriledge;</hi> whereas <hi>Grotius</hi> denies frequently, that they do it, but in severall cases, both of persons, Nations, and Countries, grant it for the asking; and they that will not ask it, may go
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101706:13"/>
without it, whose fault is it if they do? And what have we to do with the conditions any foreign Church puts upon the Members of it? which I believe was my Lord of <hi>Derry</hi>'s meaning, who, perhapps, on very good reserved reason, had as little mind to answer positively, were the quaestion thus put, as Dr. <hi>Rivet.</hi> Do you beleive, or not, that whole Christ is present, where by order of any Church, which beleives not our Saviours Institution, or Precept, to be so peremptory as we do, either element or species, is separated from the other? My opinion is, Mr. <hi>Bucer</hi> so well as others would have been silent in the case, who, in all his Writings I have met with, that relate to the H. Eucharist, useth and adviseth speciall caution against humane thoughts, sensible imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, logicall or philosophicall arguments and deductions, flying up above all such on the wings of Fayth, after an humble resignation of his Reason, which he confesseth alltogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to comprehend in the least, this inscrutable, inaccessible mystery in the veil. To some part of this purpose, peradventure, may be reducible those two Axioms in his Exomolog. <hi>N.</hi> 10. and 14. which I shall transcribe for the consideration of the learned, without interpreting to the meer English Reader.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And now I have mentioned Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> (both <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Rivet</hi> being foreigners) I judge it very pertinent and seasonable here to transcribe what the said learned and Orthodox Bishop hath left us of his judgement impartial concerning those three great Patrons and Promoters of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in this point.</p>
               <p>It being alleged by Mr. <hi>Harding,</hi> That <hi>Luther</hi> writeth to them of <hi>Bohemia</hi> these very words <hi>Quoniam pulchrum quidem esset, utraque specie Eucharistiae uti, &amp; Christus hac in re nihil tanquam necessarium praecepit: praestaret pacem &amp; unitatem, quam Christi ubique praecepit, sectari, quam despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietus sacramenti contendere.</hi> Where as it were a fair thing to use both kinds of the Sacrament, yet for that Christ herein hath commanded nothing, as necessary, it were better to keep peace and unity, which Christ hath every where charged us withal, then to strive for the outward kindes of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>To this our Bishop maketh answer; The words that <hi>Luther</hi> wrote to them of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> were written by him before God had appointed him to publish the Gospel.</p>
               <p>And when Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> (according to the Bishops supposition) urgeth his saying opposite to the former, thus, <hi>Si quo casu Consilium statueret, &amp;c.</hi> If in any case the Councel would so ordain, we would in no wise have both the kinds, but even then, in despite of the Councel, we would have one kind, or neither of them, and in no wise both; and hold them for accursed, whosoever by authority of such a Councel would have both. The Bishop makes this fair apology for him.</p>
               <p>There was nothing further off from <hi>Luther</hi>'s mind then upon any determination of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, to minister the Sacrament under one kind, and so to break Christ's Institution into halfes. But he thought it not meet, that God's truth immortal should hang of th'autority of a mortal man, and stand for true no further, then it should please a man to allow of it. This was the thing that D. <hi>Luther</hi> misliked, and thought intollerable. And therefore he said, he would have God's word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, only because it is God's word, and spoken by him, not because it is authorized by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel: and if the Councel would allow the Ministration in one kind, then, he said, he would use Both, because Christ in his Institution appointed Both. But if the Bishops in the Councel would agree upon Both kinds, as a matter standing wholly in their pleasures, as though they had full power to controle, or to ratifie the will of God, then he said, he would have no regard unto the authority of such a Councel, that setteth it self above God, but rather would use one kind on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or none at all. This latter part I understand not how <hi>Luther</hi> could make good, nor how he could be free from arrogancy, wherewith Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> chargeth him, though for the credit of our first Reformer, the Bishop takes little notice of it; for I perfectly understand not, how the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels that follow, of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Esai</hi> run in an even line with <hi>Luthers</hi> Case.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:101706:13"/>Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> next would prove <hi>Luthers</hi> from that opinion of <hi>Melanchthon,</hi> who had been <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's</hi> Scholar, and his saying this; <hi>Sicut edere suillam, aut abstinere a suilla, sic alterutra signi parte uti, medium esse.</hi> That as it is a thing indifferent to eate swines flesh, or to forbear swines flesh, so it is also to use which part of the ligne a man listeth</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bucer</hi> also, saith he, is of the same opinion; <hi>Ad controversiam, quae est de una aut utraque specie, tollendam, &amp;c.</hi> That the controversie of for the <hi>one</hi> or <hi>both</hi> kindes, may be taken away, it shall be very well done; that holy Church made it free to receive the Sacrament in <hi>one</hi> or <hi>both</hi> kinds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet under such condition, as hereby no occasion be given to any body, rashly to condemn the use, which the Church hath so long time kept, nor to judge one another.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Melanchthon</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> he sayes accompted it as a thing indifferent. To which the Right worthy Bishop makes a more ingenuous answer then did D. <hi>Rivet</hi> to <hi>Grotious,</hi> about the same point and persons, which is this.</p>
               <p>Indeed these godly learned men, when they saw that through the malice of their adversaries, they could not obtain that Christ's Institution might universally be received, yet they desired at the least it might be left free without restraint, for every Church to do therein, as they should think good, and that without murmure, or offence of others. And thus far forth their desire was, it might be judged free: not that they thought, Christ had not ordeined the Sacrament to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred unto the people in both kinds, or that in it selfe it is indifferent: but that the faithful of God might indifferently, and freely use it without controlement, and that it should not be judged Heresie, to do as Christ had commanded.</p>
               <p>If I may after all, be allowed to utter freely a word or two of my own opinion, it shall be this in general, without restraint, or particular regard to this difference, or indifference, about <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> kinds in the administration of the B. Sacrament. If the Church of <hi>England</hi> had improved, as she might, her first <hi>Lutheran</hi> Reformation (so far as <hi>Lutheran</hi> it was, or justifiably might have been) without permitting <hi>Calvin,</hi> one of another spirit then the meeker and more wary <hi>Melachthon</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> to put in his foot, our controversies had been fewer, our people steadier, and our dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick peace, at least, by much more entire; It is that Presbyterian Colloquintida that hath spoiled all, the weed that <hi>Geneva</hi> sent us, and thither we must remit it, there to take what root it will, or we shall never be at quiet but in our graves, if there, which may well be doubted.</p>
               <p>I proceed somewhat further to such cases, as on all sides are acknowledged of necessity, <hi>in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemijs &amp; aegrotis,</hi> in abstemious and sick persons, the former of which are dispensed with for the wine, and the latter for either species, as they are affected; for some have such a drought in their jawes and pallate, as they can eat no Bread; others so much offended at the fumes of Wine, as they nauseate the very smell. Here <hi>Grotius</hi> puts the question home, being resolved to extort an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; <hi>Interim negare non audet,</hi> &amp;c. presuming, Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> dares not deny, but, in the foresaid cases, especially, that of the sick the Sacrament was received entirely, though administred but in one kind; which deny he does not; nor indeed well can he the argument drawn from thence, where any Church hath published a prohibition of the Cup; for without doubt it will be owned, that the words of consecration made it a Sacrament in the sick mans case; and why the same words alike pronounced by a Priest, in the other, should not have the same effect, will be hard for Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> to assign a satisfactory reason; The little evasions he seemes to make are not such as his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary will permit himquietly to go away with, as the rarity of one instance, or frequency of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but few are sick, to the many, the innumerable multitudes of them, that from age to age have been denied the Cup by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> But the sick have it, the other element, <hi>in voto &amp; desiderio,</hi> in votive wish, and desire why the healthy should not have the like fervency of devotion for what they want, who can tell the cause, or not condemn 'em for their luke-warm indifferency? or not pitty such of them, who, if not persuaded, they had the whole, would rest content with a half - communion; though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be so courteous as to afford 'em comfort, that its better for them to participate of an imperfect Sacrament then none at all. <hi>Esti enim Sacrificium sit imperfectum sine utraque specie, tamen praestat imperfectum habere, quam nullum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all this contest against Sacriledge, the violating Christs Institution and positive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the separation of his blood from his body, the riffling and robbing so many Christian soules of their hereditary right, when of age, or ju<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Rivet,</hi> of all men, should abate the value of that prize he had so much contended for, placing it in a lower rank of those motives, by which, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was made from <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Protestancy,</hi> atchieved with Fire and Sword? <hi>Neque tamen haec unquam fuit potissima ratio, cur ab Ecclesia Romana secessionem fecerint Ecclesiae Reformatae;</hi> one it was indeed of the number; but many more there were of greater moment, <hi>plures alias fuisse, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joris momenti;</hi> which he well knew, sayes the Doctor, that made the objection, <hi>Apologet. ss.</hi> 87. but he well knew withall, as we have likewise known, to our future terrour, that for none of those momentaneous motives, (nor, perhapps for alltogether of the rest) was more blood shed, more

               <p>Now, it would be worth enquiry, were it not a business of more length then what I am about will well permit; Why the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is so obstinate in the case, if so she be, which some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to qualifie, to the dissatisfaction of a greater number, in a greater part of <hi>Christendome,</hi> then are those in communion with her, and to the hazard among them of so many soules, who, meerly in compliance, or fear of censure, do they know not what, doubting, if not denying, within themselves, that to be a Sacrament which they receive, and consequently, if it be, or be not, going away, without the effect of it for want of fayth, or for having too much presumption upon a moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Divine Institution.</p>
               <p>Our great Apologist Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> tells us, their own Doctors <hi>Alphonsus de Castro,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Gerson,</hi> have laid them out in this wise particularly, and at large;</p>

               <p>Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> takes notice but of one, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> suggests about Lay-mens Beards, which he sayes, is as ridiculous, as the Doctrine it self is unreasonable; and if they would shave Lay-mens Beards, as they do the Clergy, it would be less inconvenience then what they now feel; and if there be no help for it, they had better lose their Beards, than lose their share of the Blood of Christ. <hi>Collect. p.</hi> 469. Alike answer, it is supposed, might be given to the rest, which having no more weight in them require no better. D. <hi>Rivet</hi> sayes, they are of no moment, futile all, <hi>quas Modrevius exacte refellit,</hi> and exactly refuted by <hi>Modrevius,</hi> whose word we will take for it, and trouble our selves no further. Only because Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> in his review of <hi>Gerson,</hi> adds one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in his <hi>Reply;</hi> before overseen, or omitted in his <hi>Defence, Viz.</hi> the incidence of the Palsie, which, if beyond what the Physicians call a tremour, may have somewhat of moment in it, and more or less weight with us, who have a due veneration for the Elements, after Sacramental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, We may so far consider it as to say, it endures not the test, because being incident so well to the Priest, as the people, an expedient should have been found that might equally have secured both, or no notice taken of either, but God's providence, for preventing, or mercy for pardoning be relyed on, who foresaw in every particular inconvenience what hath been found, or can possibly be apprehended, and yet Christ himself instituted the administration in both kinds.</p>
               <p>But to return once again to her R. H. by whom this difficulty was more easily digested, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined according to the decree and practice of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> she is pleased, it seems, to declare, that she would not permit her self, were she able, (as she will not pretend to be) to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the verities of more grandeur, nor ingage in any other point, beyond some few words for entertainment of discourse, and that without any contestation at all, but simply to express the motives and reasons of her conversion; Which temper of moderation had she been pleas'd to use and observe when with us, toward which the upright open dealing of the two Bishops seemed to induce her, (whose unbiassed judgement I am sorry to see outdone, or undervalued, by the witty artifice, or bolder practice, of a single Priest) her H. might have lived longer, as the only one of her Mother (on whose two breasts, from infancy, she had depended for her spiritual alimony, and thriv'd well by it) the choice one of her that bare her; the daughters, whensoe'r they saw her, would have blessed her; As a wall might she have been, with a Palace of silver built upon her, as the wisest of Kings allegirizeth most elegantly in his <hi>Song of divine</hi> love.</p>
               <p>I draw now toward the Conclusion, the last Paragraph of her Declaration.</p>

H. too, in her present state, all the mercy, that may be, by permission, wished her, before, and at, the great Day, and above all, that crowning pardon (as Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> calls it) which surmounts so much the absolution of her good Priest, (so
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101706:14"/>
joyfully pronounced over her, when she first did throw her self into the armes of his all-compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive Church) as is the highest Arch of heaven from the very centre of the earth.</p>
               <p>What follows, at last, being left at her Highnesses judgement, will &amp; pleasure, ought to have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle contradiction from her <hi>quondam</hi> Chaplain, who, in good manners, will but lightly glance, or gloss upon it.</p>
               <p>1. That she beleeved it not necessary for her to declare in publick, That it was neither interest, nor prospect of honours, nor of the fading and perishable goods she might have by it; that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to their Church, since on the contrary, all the world, she sayes, needs must know, that, by the change of Religion, she exposed her self to the peril of losing both her friends and credit; I am none of the world that know it, nor do I believe them to have been her Highnesses friends, who would be lost upon account of her passing from a state of sad perplexity and disquiet to one of certain assurance, satisfaction, and peace within, if so she found it, Other friendship in, or with the world, is enmity with God; Religion is not to be chosen, or adhaer'd to, against perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Conscience, be it right or wrong, by the deceitful weights or measures of worldly friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; The standard of it is more sublime, and credit ought not to be so considerable, as a good conscience, in the case, which I have charity to hope she had, and exercised, without prejudice, or partiality in her new choice.</p>
               <p>2. [<hi>Pay balance et examine plusteurs fois &amp;c</hi>] that her R. H. had balanced and examined often, Whether it were not more expedient for her, to conserve her friends, her rank, and credit in the Court, by continuing in the exercise of the Religion profess'd and practised by the <hi>English</hi> Church, then to abandon all those things, upon a view and hope of happiness in a future life.</p>
               <p>I am sorry, I confess, for that <hi>plusicurs fois;</hi> that the ballance, if the beam were true, (which her self was concern'd to look to) should be taken in hand more then once, (if once had not been too much) and expedience put into the scale; for, alas! what are the light feathers of Fortune, and Fame, or Reputation, to the weight of Eternall Glory? what's a Pebble to the Pearle of price? what the whole world to the worst soul in it, when true merchandize is to be made, but a cruell purchase of false felicity? And therefore if, for the time, the eyes of her mind were darkened, her understanding clouded, great, indeed, was God's mercy, in that, so on a sodain, he became unto her as the light of the morning, when the Sun ariseth, a morning without clouds; <hi>as the tender Grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after Rain.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 4. after the many teares she had dropt, in the anxiety of her mind, and dejection of her spirit, so as she felt no pain, no difficulty to make that choice, that so decretory choice, and with what advantage, good Lady! before this time she knowes to the full.</p>
               <p>3. That the only trouble remaining upon her spirit was an apprehension she had of what dire influence her change might have upon the poor Catholiques of this Countrey; what they might suffer upon account of her conversion; praying that God would give her the grace to suffer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently with them the disgraces and afflictions of this life, for the meriting of life eternall.</p>
               <p>Indeed the malice, or zeale (if it be so) of the <hi>Mobile,</hi> or common people, is seldome mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by reason, or measured out by Conscience, how much soever pretended by them which might in this case, so well as others, have caused the floods to rise, and lift up their voyce, which, when they do so, by God's permission, we, who had made no such choice, or change, felt to our cost; But; God be praised, we since have found, and so might her R. H. too, if she had survived, that the Lord, who dwelleth in Heaven is mightier; and under the sacred roof of the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, in the midst of those feares she might have hoped for at least personall protection; And all her Catholiques, who had taken the oathes, might have been secure of theirs, keeping within the limits and boundaries of the Law, while His Majesty shall keep power enough in his hands to curb and subdue all riotous and rebellious people; which power may he never part with, nor want a greater at any time, for the safety and honour of his Royall Person, Crown, and Kingdome, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the necessity, or expediency, of all, or any, his State-affairs may require.</p>
               <p>Here my Reflexions end, upon her Royall Highnesses solemn Declaration, dated at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, the eighth of <hi>August,</hi> 1670.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mounsieur Maimburg</hi>'s fine Rhetoricall <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> or grand <hi>Acclamation,</hi> yet remaines, which in civil complement, must not pass away without my notice and fit respect.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Une declaration fi forte, si raisonnable, &amp; si sensee, &amp;c.</hi>] A Declaration, sayes he, so strong, so reasonable, and so full of sense, by this admirable Princess, who instructeth us with so much sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, which have been the true motives of her conversion; and who, in the sequel, is dead holily in the Catholique faith,</p>
               <p>The <hi>strength</hi> of it will best appear, when the arguments and stanch or stay'd opinions of those Worthies I have assembled in my Reflexions, the main pillars of the Church her Highnesses left are weakened, and laid in their ruines; The <hi>reasonableness,</hi> when the vizard, her good Priest put upon it, is taken off; And the <hi>sense,</hi> when the sandy supposition, upon which the pretence of all is ambiguously
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101706:15"/>
founded, shall be well-confirmed, and with full assurance settled.</p>
               <p>That she died holily, who lived religiously, I will not doubt; but that she died, after due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, in the precincts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I confess I do; In the fayth of it that she could not, I am pretty well assured, if but because her weakness would not allow her sufficient opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, in the time of decumbency, to consult her judgment, her disturbance being so great, with little, or no, intermission; less to hear, read, and discourse, with pauses requisite, what might be of strength sufficient (if ought could be) for an evincement, and prevaile for a free resignation of her soul to the sense, and conduct, of her good Priest;</p>
               <p>But, to render the Declaration, as taken with the best advantage, so usefull, so powerfull, as by its precedent and greatest efficacy, to convert all sorts, and degrees, of Protestants, whatsoever, more then all disputes by tongue, or penn, in which every Heretick, when pressed with argument, takes no care but to find evasion, and get away so clear, as he may perswade others he was not van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd, is, in my opinion, to magnifie it overmuch, and to undervalue many learned and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing Disputants, many judicious and impartiall Readers, whom he will needs have compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in that equivocall name of <hi>Protestant,</hi> as over-facilely to part with their Fayth, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son too, and pusillanimously to yeild their <hi>Christian</hi> liberty to his blind obedience; wherein yet I leave the Gentleman to enjoy his fancy, and others to like submission and imitation as in what they shall find themselves by just authority or argument fairly and clearly convinced, at their own hazard.</p>
               <p>That, in effect, he sayes, <hi>There is no Protestant, but who may find a like origine of his heresie, in some passion of despite, jealousie, ambition, or libertinage,</hi> (by which word, and somewhat more, I suspect <hi>Mounsieur Maimburg</hi> may have had a finger in forming this Declaration,) toucheth not us in <hi>England,</hi> who understand the motives and method of our Reformation betters, and our selves too, then to be concerned in any errour or heresie, (were it so) at this distance, we being no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, as the <hi>Mounsieur</hi> and his friends would have us, from <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius,</hi> or any other; but Reformed Realls, in the first notion, that is, according to the original Doctrine, and Discipline of the Ancient Church, the Records whereof were laid open before <hi>Christians</hi> of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter principles, by which to recover that purity, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had lost, and to get clear from those errours they had introduced, of later date.</p>
               <p>Therefore, although, in compliance with <hi>Mounsieur</hi>'s advice, such of our <hi>English</hi> as understand intirely the establishment of our Church, and true state of the controversy between them and us, should read this excellent Declaration in cold blood, <hi>et sans pre occupation,</hi> without any prejudice (as in earnest I have done severall times, since I took this task in hand) will not judge it a thing so monstrous, <hi>une chose monstrease,</hi> that what he calls the Catholique, but meanes the <hi>Roman</hi> fayth, which, in above 400 years before Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and but few less before that passive re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> had no such settlement as he pretends, by the generall consent of our Nation, but (what our Histories will make appear,) were offering many times, at a deliverance from Popish thraldome, besides, at an orderly Reformation of some doctrinall and practicall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the Religion of those times, should be abolished by that good Queen, upon better termes then her sole and single interest, (for the interest of some deproedatours about her I will not excuse); And that we take not her for the first foundress, but the Primitive Fathers and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctours in the five or six first Centuries, for the Confounders of the ancient, and, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, of our <hi>English</hi> Church, as it stands at distance from the <hi>Roman.</hi> And so I bid a Dieu to <hi>Mounsieur Maimburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must now turn about to Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> whom, if I should decline, and offer silently to slip away, or withdraw my hand from the table, I am sure, he would pull me by the sleeve, if not the tip of my ear, for not regarding his politicall, or morall, but most illogicall, inferences from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Declaration.</p>
               <p>There are but few, sayes he, to be found, so forsaken of God, and their own Reason, as are not able to discern and allow, that Secret Enemies are far more dangerous to all Men and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than open and professed: and that Men hate to be betrayed worse then to be destroyed</p>
               <p>If you intend, Sir this, or what may be the extract of it, as a Major proposition, you had done well in laying an Assumption to it, (since <hi>Dolus latet in generalibus</hi>) and not run away with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, one of the praemises to which is lost; When you put your argument in better form, and dare deal in explicite syllogismes, (for enthymems are little other then mental reservations, which you know in whom you hate) you shall be fairly answered by an express denial, or distinction from what you argue, which will put you to further proof. Declining therefore such scholastick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I must Socratically ask, according to the several hypotheses in this Paragraph, 1. What se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret enemies you suspect, and upon what ground, either as to seperate Individuals, or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities in their conjunction? unto whom? or what? If you cannot make out what you would, why leave you e'm not at their own hazard? knowing that</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:101706:15"/>
                  <l>Qui fraudem injustam machinatur alteri,</l>
                  <l>Suo ipse damno antecapit eventum mali.</l>
               </q>
               <p>2. What treachery, or destruction from her Hignesses conference or Declaration, we are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend? speak out, man, and by no means smother treason, in whom soever it lurkes; If a new Plot be, give us freely what you have discovered, which may serve as a train to the rest, that none may escape.</p>
               <p>But you proceed thus, They therefore that countenance, or cover, the Masquerade Enemies of the Church, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> prove themselves to be of the same pernicious conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; the greater they are in Place, and Power, the greater is the danger to the Publick from them, and their detection therefore the greater service and glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sententias loquitur</hi>——It is somewhat ominous to be too sententious: The worst of men can speak good Proverbs so well as the wise, until themselves become the subjects of such as they best deserve. <hi>Catiline</hi> himself, no quaestion, while he was instructing others in the wayes and methods of his close Conspiracy, until it was mature for action, issued out good counsels for the publique peace, and prosperity, being expedite at disguise, and ingenious for Masquerade, from his very youth, <hi>subdolus &amp; cujuslibet rei simulator ac dissimulator,</hi> the Historian tells us. Having no answer to my former quaestions, I must again to my interrogating, Who are they, Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> that do either countenance, or cover? Be you not brib'd with Sugar-plums to conceal their names, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy they are contriving; The Mobile will not be raised else, and so you will lose the benefit of a common cry; And tell, man, what, or of what, you would have detection made, for <hi>salus poulis</hi>'s sake at least, that you fall not into condemnation for breaking the highest Law. Tell me further yet, what glory they are like to gain, proportionate to the service they may do you in the discovery, whether a pension, or a place in the fift or false-hearted Monarchie, or by what other spurious title you mean to distinguish that you are erecting, with such applycation.</p>
               <p>But her late Highness, it seems, is gone off, I hope you will not say with concealing treason, though you say little less then with reserve of the names of those whom you point at as the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, having not expressed what Bishops those two were in Particular, whom all sober Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants must look on as the Betrayers of her soul, and this Church.</p>
               <p>Was not her <hi>Ex-Iesuite,</hi> think you in the Plot of this concealment, whose principle is for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve? for</p>
               <p>It seems duty, you say, and fidelity to our Church and Nation, to contribute Intelligence and Observations to detect them farther.</p>
               <p>I have heard, Sir, that some such Intelligences and Observations, of as high a nature, have been frequently bought and sold; And so may these too, for ought I know; but I never yet traffiqu'd in 'em; you may have 'em about you, but I know of none in this Countrey. Yet, to make amends for my ignorance, or negligence of this sort; I have more then compensated what her Highness failed in, having expressed, upon this occasion, more then twice two, which shall be twenty, when cause requires, that, by some parasangs, have out-gone those two mischievous Bishops, who e're they were; And who, I pray are those sober Protestants that dare look upon those I named, as Betrayers of their souls, who made address to 'em for ghostly counsel, and advice about Religion? much less were they treacherous to our Church, who were the principal supporters, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, of it; whose names are well worth your notice, and their books, such as deserve your reading over, more then once; which done, Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> tell me seriously, what false steps they have taken, and wherein it is they have betrayed either Church, or Nation; Till when lay your hand on your mouth, and speak not evil so unadvisedly, concerning the Ecclesiastical Rulers of the people.</p>
               <p>But you add, They are not in Reason Fathers who are condemned persons in Law</p>
               <p>To this calumny you have had my answer, from the very Sages of the Law, who pronounce no sentence of condemnation for speaking truth, and that according to the dictates of the ancient Church, which they appeal to, call you it Popery, or Treachery, or both, or what you will; it is your ignorance, not their errour, which puts a false gloss upon what they say; and your zeal for you know not what that inflames your passion and hurries you beyond the bounds of <hi>Christian</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and moderation; so that they have not forfeited their paternal right, or priveledge, by che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing their children and instructing them in the same paths they had trod themselves, the old paths, wherein is the good way, advising them to walk therein, that they might find rest for their souls P. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 16. As for those that are froward, who say, we will not walk therein, they leave them to their crooked wayes, the wayes of darkness, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. since they will not follow the light they have set before them.</p>
               <p>Yet, you say, the danger and scandal of their ill example is the less, because they never shewed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101706:16"/>
so much Learning and Integrity, as to justifie before the World, their new perswasions, by Pen, or open Practice, or Resignation. <hi>A</hi> Papist, <hi>or a</hi> Mahometan, <hi>that is sincere and Resolute</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Since you know not who they are, Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> methinks you might have forborne to judge of what they do, or do not, in publick; and what revenge you bear in mind, you may call in your Party, to exercise upon them whose names are known, and whose Writings many where to be had; whose opinions are published in Print, and their practises in our Cathedralls, and Royall Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells, to be well attested at this day; All which being not otherwise to be answered, nor their persons now to be punished, who lie silent in their Graves; all you can do, when the second time, by the prosperity of the wicked, power shall be in their hands (which God avert) will be, to burn their books, wheresoever you meet with them, and, if you have the like malice, the like princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of sacrilegious impiety, as, not many yeares ago some had, do as they did, who scattered the bones of the dead, and threw the Dust of Kings, (greater Potentates then Bishops) out of their marble chests, or leaden coffins. And if any thing more can be done to those Popish Prelates, that escapt your judgment, and slipt slyly into their beds of rest, such as <hi>Overall, Andrewes, White, Mountagu, Taylor, Bramhall,</hi> and the rest of that <hi>Babylonish</hi> rabble, you being set on hanging in this very Page. <hi>Hang them up in</hi> Effigie, <hi>on the post - fact, as having been false to your Fayth, while they lived, and multiplying still by their books dayly proselytes to</hi> Antichrist, <hi>perverting, if it were possible, the very Saints themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, in more good earnest, Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> you see, their perswasions were not new; They send you to such Antiquity, as, it seemes, you have not conversed with; and appeale to better authority then their own, to be justified in what they have written; which you ought to have enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, before you had so sharply censured the two Reverend Fathers of our Church, who were guided by the same rule, in what they said, and what they owned to be their private practice; hoping, perhapps, by that latitude, and ingenious communication, to have induced her R. H. before it might become too late, to a better opinion of our Church, from which they found her wavering, (if she disguis'd it not) And for that their plain and sincere dealing, which was as much as any Casuist, or Director, (even <hi>Campanella</hi>'s Confessour himself) could do, open the Closet of his breast, and expose the secrets of it to his, or her, best advantage, by whom he is consulted; for this faithfull discharge of their trust, you are pleas'd to gratifie them no otherwise, then with the most odious, most detested, title of <hi>Iudas</hi>'s amongst our Apostles (it is well you allow us any such as Apostles in that sacred Order) and put upon their account the scandal of our present misery, (wherein you have but a little portion, Sir, beside what you wilfully draw upon your self) the Redivision of these Kingdomes, the dissenting members of which, since the happy Restauration, never would be obliged by Acts of Oblivion, Pardon, and Indulgence; nor ever will be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any Conformity to the Government, Ecclesiasticall, or Temporall, the only bond of our peace, the submissive unity of an humble spirit; nay, your fears, and fewds, which are made, and multiplied, by the infernal Ghosts, the reascended boutefeaus of <hi>Forty - One,</hi> must be charged upon these Bishops, and, that I may retrive a line or two, which I let pass in the last Paragraph, <hi>These good Bishops, because they will not be perswaded, nor terrified, to give spirituall counsell, contrary to their own Conscience; because they will not practise openly what is inconsistent with the rule of common prudence, in our circumstances; nor spontaneously resign their demesnes, and dignities (for that's the true intendment of it) to a brood of insatiate Cormorants, and sacrilegious Seekers, to the still</hi> plus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultra - <hi>designing Impropriators, they must</hi> cedere de viâ, <hi>give place not onely to professed Papists, but to most arrogant, blasphemous,</hi> Mahomitans, <hi>be termed two - faced Renegadoes, false to their Fayth, and Trust, and Countrey too, because, in reallity, they are true to all.</hi> For thus you say, let the Reader have it in your own words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Papist, <hi>or a</hi> Mahometan, <hi>that is sincere and Resolute in the profession of his errour, shew's more Religion and vertue, than the most Reverend two - fac'd Renegado, that's false to his Fayth, and Trust, and Countrey, for worldly Interest. And indeed, he that is so false to himself, will hardly be true to any other.</hi> Therefore <hi>Campanella</hi> advises to chuse for Confessor, <hi>non qui te diligit, sed qui diligit animam Suam, such who loves his own Soul, not thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little releif, at last, you are pleased to afford 'em, by a <hi>lifting</hi> courtesie, (so I will call it) of the burthen, too heavy for them to bear, <hi>Multorum manibus</hi>—if it should not here be rather <hi>Magnatum manibus</hi>——laying part of the guilt upon the shoulders of the Great ones; whose frailties if they be of eternall permanence, their condition is desperate, never to be repair'd in this World, nor that to come; for so you write;</p>
               <p>To these <hi>Iudas</hi>'s amongst our Apostles is cheifly owing the present misery and Redivision of these flourishing Kingdomes, by new Fears, and Fewds: and not a little, perhapps, to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Frailties of great ones, that <hi>had rather be Pleas'd than Lov'd:</hi> How happy were it for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if such carnal Compliers for the sake of grandeur, were as hatefull to our Princes, as they are to God and the rest of Mankind? I have no better account to give to God and the World, of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101706:16"/>
latter part of my life, than some zeal and adventures against such Betrayers, which I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all worldly Offers and Peace.</p>
               <p>Their fault, you say, is, because they had rather be pleas'd then lov'd.</p>
               <p>The truest love, Subjects have for their Princes, is best attested by their obedience, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able disposition; by whom when so beloved, certainly, they are best pleased, there being no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistence at all, but if your meaning be, they had rather <hi>be flatter'd,</hi> you were as good say, they had rather be <hi>destroyed;</hi> which Princes affect so little as do their people, who pretend so much care of their Princes preservation, when, sometimes, they are underhand associating, and contriving their utter ruine. But these great ones, our Princes, you think have a destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive gift of clemency, the stream whereof runs in another chanel then you would have it, and, perhaps, of another colour; They are out of their Politicks, in making favourites of such, as are undoubtedly hateful to God and mankind, your intelligence is great, if you write what you know; and if what you do not, you do it like a man of no understanding, to pronounce you know not whom odious to God and mankind, because loved by their Princes, who themselves perhaps expect as little love from your party, as you profess you have from their favourites. So many years are not passed, but that many of us, still surviving, can very well remember, what printed professions of abundant Love and Honour, what <hi>Declarations</hi> of obedient and Loyal Subjects, with most humble and affectionate Addresses, were made to our late Soveraign, of blessed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; what specious promises of erecting his Royal Person, Crown and Dignity, to the very highest pinnacle of glory; but, withal, we forget not, what hard and immajestick conditions, these fair but fraudulent, tenders were clogg'd with, how they wrested from him not only his favourites but his forts, and deprived him in vote, before they could accomplish it in fact, both of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate solace, and publick strength; which, in effect, was, not only to unking, but unman, him, and so we all know, that in no better performance it ended, by these several steps of descent (which I shall not enlarge on) so incongruous prov'd their Acts to their words, (when they would not trust him, their liege Lord, and Soveraign, but an upstart Russian, with their Protection) by reviling, rifling, rebelling, chacing, devesting, restraining, dethroning, beheading, attempting to break the image of his soul, and posthume reputation, in peices, by a malicious, and yet a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Iconoclast, as a Peer of his Realm and a loyal Gentleman can attest from his own mouth, a fellow that ruffled his father out of his estate, while alive, and cheated his Prince of the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to his piety, and incomparable Vertue, when, otherwise at rest in his grave.</p>
               <p>You now plainly see, Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> what I reflect on, what a sad unprecedented instance we of these (then unfortunate) Islands have had in all the most impious particulars, and aggravations recited, with as much detestation as sorrow, to the perpetual infamy of that forty one, and forty eight, party, with whom I fear you are become over-and-above-familiar; and so ill as you treat me, somewhat afflicted I am in your own behalf, that you have no better account to give unto God, and the World, of the latter part of your life, then what you spontaneously mention, and little better then boast of, some zeal and adventures, against such Betrayers, (the character you injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously give them) your warm passion, and unnecessary hazard, had been, by much, more laudably exercis'd, and undertaken, against another party-rampant, who have better deserv'd the justice of your title; And your preference of such fanciful enterprises, to worldly offers and Peace, will bear the empress but of Knight errantry, when led into the Lists where any true valour is to be shewed. Nor (beleeve me) will posterity give it any preference to (if they afford it the like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment as our Predecessors have done of) the Spanish <hi>Don</hi> in his encounter with the Mill: but</p>
               <q>Hermes omnia solus, &amp; ter unus;</q>
               <p>You alone are all, as you take the conceit, and may you so triumph in your thoughts, as the World may hear no more of your too adventurous exploits, untill you have clear'd your account of the former, which I fear you will not be able to do with that success as you promise your self; And, if you will take my friendly advice, put your Candel under a Bushell, for alltogether here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and leave not the world with an ill scent whensoever your faint light shall exspire.</p>
               <p>What I leave in arrear of this Chapter being but a short forme of transition, or preface, to your following impeachment, I pass it over, untill I send you my Finall Answer to your devised Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies of Schismaticall Protestanism, <hi>De Macedos</hi> dis-ingenuous treatment, with other our brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, (so far as any such really were, not in Phantomes) at Sea and St. <hi>Iames,</hi> till when I rest</p>
