            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What then ought man to doe, vpon whom nature, beſides this inclination and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which dead things doe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with him, hath endued with ſence, and ouer and beſides ſence, which is common to him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, hath giuen the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of diſcourſe and reaſon, to be able to diſcerne and chuſe the beſt things of all thinges which preſent themſelues vnto his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and that which is moſt

Now the ende of man and of all his thoughts &amp; meditations is good. And truely, there is not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many, ſo diuers in nature and condition of life, which deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not that which is good, and eſchueth not that which is euill:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:88:14"/>
and being demanded wherefore hee doth this or that, anſwereth not, but that he doth it, or thinkes that he doth it for his good and welfare. And albeit in our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, a man may finde a great manie more bad then good; yet the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall intention, whereby wee are directed and guided, is to come vnto that which is good. But as it fareth manie times with him which aymeth at a marke, if his ſight be hindered, either by ſome diſeaſe of the eye, or fault in the ayre, or if hee take one thing for another, although he deſire to hit the marke, ſo that he couet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, yet it is impoſſible but he ſhould be wide from it: ſo likewiſe wee, becauſe we doe not knowe wherein conſiſteth our good, but oftentimes take that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:88:14"/>
which is about it, for it; do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in our particular actions take our ayme amiſſe, and ſhoot wide from our generall marke and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>Good, in good trueth, is not ſo placed that all the world may ſee and perceiue it; nature hath ſowed and ſcattered heere beneath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs certaine weake and feeble ſparklinges of that heate, which notwithſtanding beeing rightly applied vnto our mindes, are able to kindle a pure light in them, and cauſe vs to ſee good, as it is, and not as it ſeemeth. So then, wee muſt ſeeke it, and wee ſhall finde it; hauing found it, we muſt acknowledge it; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging it, wee cannot chooſe but loue it; and louing it, wee ſhall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten all our deſires thereunto, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:88:15"/>
enioy it with great happines. For euen as trueth preſenting it ſelfe vnto our vnderſtanding, is there entertained with great ioy and contentednes: euen ſo good offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it ſelfe vnto our will, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by her with great pleaſure, as being her naturall obiect. And therefore, I thinke, that if a man would properly define good, hee muſt affirme it to bee nothing els, but the eſſence &amp; vſage of a thing, according vnto his nature. For this ſame nature is ſo prudent and prouident a miſtreſſe, that ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies diſpoſeth all things vnto their greateſt good, and therefore hath giuen them a firſt motion vnto that which is good, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ende which they ſhould ſeeke and ſearch after: in ſuch ſort, that he that will followe after it,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:88:15"/>
cannot chooſe but compaſſe and obtaine it. Now by the rules of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, man ſhould be ſo compoſed and faſhioned, that that which is moſt excellent in him, ſhould beare rule and commaund, and that reaſon ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe all that which is preſented vnto her, as beſt beſeemeth her, and ſhal moſt ſerue for her purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Well then, the good &amp; happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of man, conſiſteth in the right vſe of reaſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and what is that but vertue, which is nothing els but a conſtant diſpoſition of will, to followe that which is honeſt and conuenient. There is no man, as I ſuppoſe, but wil auouch this to be good: but yet for all that, there wil bee a great many found out, which will affirme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> herein onely conſiſteth not mans good &amp; happines,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:88:16"/>
but that hee muſt haue a ſound and well diſpoſed bodie, and a hundred more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, without the which it is not poſſible for mans life to be, much leſſe to be happie and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ortunate. But if our poſition which we haue ſet downe vnto you at the firſt bee true, (as true it is) that the end of euery thing is his good, and his good is his end, and that theſe two are ſo reciprocable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertible the one with the other, that the one cannot bee without the other, then may we not iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that health, or riches, are mans good, ſeeing that they are not his end which he regardeth. For hee cannot poſſeſſe or vſe them, but to ſome other end. And ſo too, that the greateſt part of his time, whileſt hee enioyeth them,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:88:16"/>
he cannot ioy in them, but is with them vnfortunate and vnhappie: vnleſſe peraduenture ſome man will ſaye, that they are happie, which make their riches &amp; health ſerue them (as they doe full many in the world) to nouriſh their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and cheriſh them vp in their wicked paſſions and affections. But happily will ſome man ſay, they doe ſerue, as meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments diſpoſed vnto the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of this good, without the which it is not poſſible that a man ſhould get it, and therefore by a neceſſarie conſequent they are to be accounted neceſſarie, to the obtayning thereof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good. Truely it is a harſh and improper kinde of ſpeech, to call that good, which ſerues to the procurement and obtaining of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:88:17"/>
that which is good; or that which is the ſubiect and matter of good. For vertue, which we haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before to be the true good, is of ſuch a nature, that ſhe can make her benefit indifferently of things contrary in nature, ſhe profiteth and helpeth her ſelfe as wel by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as by riches, by ſicknes as by health. For wee doe as much commend him that can patiently endure his pouertie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly beare his griefes or diſeaſe, as we doe him that liberallie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth his goods, and being in health, honeſtly laboureth in his vocation. So that if you wil needs call riches good, becauſe they ſerue to the obtaining and getting of vertue, why may you not as well call pouertie by the ſame name, ſeeing that it ſerues to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:88:17"/>
ſelfe ſame vſe, and that more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitablie alſo? Now to call things ſo contrary and repugnant, as riches &amp; pouertie are, by the ſame name, hath not ſo much as any ſhew or apparance of any trueth. Wherefore, let all theſe things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine indifferent, as being made good or euil, by the mind of man which knoweth how to vſe them rightly, which if he want, yet will he not want the meanes of attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto his ende, which is to be faſhioned and framed rightly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto reaſon, and to make vſe and benefit of all things which ſhall happen whatſoeuer, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to purchaſe his chiefe good and felicitie.</p>
            <p>If wee will truly know wherein conſiſteth this good, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider within our ſelues what that is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:88:18"/>
which ſeekes it: for it muſt needs be the good of that part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Nothing ſeeks after that which is anothers, vnles it bee coupled and ioyned with his owne. Now then there is no doubt but that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and firſt motion of all our actions commeth from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the good which we ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, muſt needs be the perfection, reſt and contentment of the ſame. But if wee place riches and health in this account, and eſteeme them for things good, and by a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repute all things contrary vnto them euil; what doe we els, but teſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifie vnto all men, that there is no true felicitie in this world, and that our minds are here held in perpetuall torment? For a man muſt needes haue death and griefe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:88:18"/>
continuallie before his eyes, both which are eſteemed euils, and whereof one is oftentimes preſent with him, the other neuer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaſeth to threaten and menace him. If then they be things euill, the feare of them is iuſt, &amp; if he be alwaies in feare, how can hee bee at any time happie? Let vs therefore confeſſe, that either man hath no good ordained and prepared for him in this world, which he may compaſſe and attaine vnto, or els acknowledge, that this good doth wholly and entirely conſiſt in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For it muſt needs be that the end of euery thing ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable vnto the ſtrength and nature of the thing it ſelfe: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſe, if the end were vnpoſſible to be atchieued, in ſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mans good, it would turne to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:88:19"/>
be mans further torment. And ſo he ſhould nothing but labour and trauaile in vaine, as the daughters of <hi>Danaus</hi> are ſayd to doe in hell, ſtriuing to fill certaine bottomles veſſels with water, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hold no water at all. Againe, if there bee no Science nor Arte in the world, which hath not one end or other limited her, which they may come vnto by keeping of certaine precepts and rules; what ſhall we thinke that nature, the mother of Arts and Sciences, hath propoſed vnto man (which is her chiefe worke) an end, which it is vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to come vnto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is out of his power?</p>
            <p>Will (as we ſay) is that which ſeeketh after our good: now a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and well gouerned will neuer coueteth (as indeede it ought not

to doe) but that which ſhe may, and which it is in her power to procure, ſhe buſieth not her ſelfe about hauing of that which it is not in her power to haue when ſhe will; as health, riches, and honors. For if our good did conſiſt and depend of them, wee ſhould not neede to imploy reaſon or will to the procurement of them, but we might as well compaſſe them by prayers &amp; wiſhes: for it is a thing which is ſubiect vnto a thouſand caſualties, which cannot bee pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of this ſect, as to confeſſe that the bodie or goods, which are but inſtruments of mans life, were a part of mans ſubſtance, and might by their qualitie alter the qualitie of the ſoule; yet may wee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch this for good, that loſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hence is it that particular men doe euen glorie in their wounds, doe euen bragge and boaſt of them, if they haue receiued them in the defence of either Prince or countrie. Shall we than aſſigne vnto the bodie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other motion or deſire then that, by the which it referreth all things that come vnto him, vnto the ioy and happines of the mind? ſhall we, I ſay bee ſo fooliſh as to linke and knit the ſoule ſo faſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bodie, that the good thereof ſhould remaine as a ſlaue within his members, and ſo farre foorth depend on them, that accordingly as the bodie ſhould be well or ill
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:88:22"/>
diſpoſed, the mind ſhould be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and accounted either happie or vnhappie? Truly, if ſo bee that nature would haue had mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and perfection to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on his bodie, or conſiſted in his goods, ſhe would haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto all men like bodies, and like meaſure and quantitie of goods: for ſo ſhe ſhould not haue been partiall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that the action of the minde may bee as honorable and glorious in one ſort as in another: yea, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie thereof doth appeare &amp; ſhine foorth more gloriouſly, and merit more praiſe then, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, he commeth of himſelf vnto his wiſhed end.

            <p>Now there is nothing which can ſo ſoone ſet vs in this way, and learne vs how to obtaine the right courſe of ordering our affections, mindes and wils according vnto reaſon, as Wiſedome, which is (in my ſimple opinion) both the beginning

and end of all vertues. For cauſing vs to haue an exact and true knowledge of the condition and qualitie of things which come into our conſiderations &amp; viewes, ſhe teacheth and telleth vs what is according vnto nature, and what not, and like wiſe what is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and followed, or ſhunned and auoyded.

O how happie would mans life bee, if it were alwayes led and guided by her direction? But alas, as this vertue is moſt faire and excellent, ſo ſhe is moſt rare and hard to be found: for ſhe is ſo hidden in the bottome of our

mindes, as the veynes of gold lye ſecret in the bowels of the earth, and are found but in few places. This is (as I bele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the right vſe of wiſedoome. And if wee will hearken vnto her, ſhe will tell vs, that wiſedome hath two properties and vſes, the one to prick vs forward to that which is good, the other to pull vs backe from following that which is euil. Now becauſe when we come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Philoſophie, we doe not bring with vs a mind pure and neat, but alreadie diſtempered, euilly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and poſſeſſed with filthie humours, and ſuch as are incident vnto the common ſort of people; becauſe, I ſay, wee come vnto her as vnto a skilfull leach or cunning phiſition: therefore if we will bee cured, wee muſt doe as ſurgeons doe which haue to doe with ſores and wounds, who before they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any medicine or ſalue to cure them, doe firſt draw out all the

Now it hath pleaſed nature to grant vnto ſence this power and ſtrength which commeth from the ſoule, to applie it ſelfe vnto things, and extract their formes, and afterwards either to chooſe or refuſe them, as they ſhall beſt pleaſe or diſpleaſe him, and agree or diſagree with his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

But as ſhe hath alotted them this power and authoritie: ſo ſhe doth moſt ſtraitly will and command them to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with their office, which is to call to mind things paſt, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to aduiſe themſelues what is beſt to be done: not preſuming or daring to diſquiet the higher and ſtronger faculties, or breede any further vprore or confuſion. For ſo it falleth out many times in an armie, that the watch becauſe they know not the purpoſe of the Generall, whoſe direction they ſhould follow, may be deceiued, and take the enemie comming vnto them diſguiſed, for friends, and their friends which come in good will to ſuccour and relieue them for enemies: and euen ſo

the ſences, becauſe they cannot throughly conceiue and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend thinges appertaining vnto reaſon, as being aboue their reach, are beguiled with ſhew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of thinges, and doe oft times iudge that for a friend vnto vs, which is our greateſt aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And ſo whileſt they preſently ruſh forward without ſtaying, or looking for any commandement from reaſon, they prouoke and ſtir vp that part of the ſoule where concupiſcence and anger dooth lodge, whereby ſpringeth ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Heere beholde and marke the foure winds (as I verely ſuppoſe) from whence ſpring the cruell tempeſts of our ſoules. Their den
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:88:30"/>
from whence they come, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els (as hath been alreadie ſhewed you) but a falſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which wee haue, that thoſe things which are preſented vnto vs are either good or euill. For by this meanes attributing that qualitie vnto them, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is not in them, wee flye or follow after them with vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: and this is the very originall and ſpring of theſe paſſions. Well then to ſtoppe this den, aſſure the reſt of our ſoules, and prouide that they be not otherwiſe moued then it is meete for them to bee, let vs call to minde that which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto vs in the very beginning and entrance into this diſcourſe. To wit, that the good of a man, and the perfection of his nature, conſiſteth in the diſpoſing and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:88:30"/>
faſhioning of his will to the right vſe of things according vnto rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and contrariwiſe, that his euill commeth from a diſordered or vnskilfull vſing, or rather abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them. For by the firſt hee ſhall reape much profite, receiue much content and quietnes, and chance what chance, nay he may ſet vp his reſt, and remain as ſtable andimmoueable as a rocke in the middeſt of the ſea: by the ſecond, euery ſmall thing that chaunceth will trouble him and turne to his great griefe and diſaduantage. Now this diſpoſition of our will lieth whollie in our power, and conſequently our good and euill. Wherefore, if at anytime there be preſented vnto vs any obiect, to the endethat we may not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at all as with ſome good or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:88:31"/>
euill which doth follow vs, let vs conſider whether the thing which happeneth be in our power or no. If it bee in our power well and good, it may bee good or ill vnto vs. And yet in this caſe too, wee muſt not be too paſſionaetly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in any ſort: for if we can but moderate and guide our willes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, we ſhall make it good, and ſo continue it ſtill. If it be out of our power, then it is neither good nor euill, and conſequently wee ought not to ſeeke or prouide it.</p>
            <p>Now the things which are in our power are theſe; to approue, vndertake, deſire, and eſchue a matter, and in a word, all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For our will hath authoritie and power to rule and gouerne them according vnto reaſon, till they come vnto the place from
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:88:31"/>
whence our good and happineſſe muſt come. As for example ſake, ſhe is able to diſpoſe our opinion, ſo that it yeeld not conſent but to that which it is meete it ſhould, and which ſhall bee examined ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſence or reaſon, that ſhee ſhal cleaue faſt vnto things which are euidently true of themſelues, and keepe her ſelfe in ſuſpence in things doubtfull, and vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect thinges which are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues plainly vntrue and falſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſhee can ſo rule our deſire, that it ſhall follow after nothing but that which is agreeable with nature, and eſchue the contrarie. The things which are out of our power are theſe; our riches, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and briefly, that which doth no way depend of our willes: and here, if any thing doe happen, wee
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:88:32"/>
may not ſay that it is contrarie to our natures: becauſe it happeneth either by the vniuerſall and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall order of things, and ordinary co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

for that is a very fooliſh and vaine affection to will that which it is not in our power to haue, as alſo becauſe that howſoeuer it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, it may proue good vnto vs, and be the ſubiect of many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and laudable actions.

On the other ſide, if we deſire and labour to auoyde that which is out of our powers, wee ſhall oftentimes fall from our hopes and wiſhed ends, and miſſe of our purpoſes, and light vpon that which wee ſo much abhorre, wee ſhall trouble our ſelues, vexe and torment our ſelues, and all to no purpoſe or end in the world.</p>
            <p>There is no man ſo fooliſh or vnaduiſed, but that hee confeſſeth that he had rather haue his deſires then be depriued of them, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be free from paſſions, then to be troubled with them, if hee may doe otherwiſe.

            <p>Therefore as ſoone as any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of pleaſure for the bodie, as delicate and daintie meates doe come into our mind, and that we doe finde our ſelues mooued; let vs think thus, that this is one of the things which is not in our power, neither good nor euill: but an indifferent

For it is an eſpecial fauour of nature, for the which ſhe deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſingular great thankes at our hands, that ſhe hath made things
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:88:36"/>
neceſſarie for our life moſt eaſie to be found, &amp; that the things which are not found but with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, are nothing neceſſarie at all. And truly I cannot chuſe but admire the words of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> but I would they had proceeded out of another mans mouth, becauſe I would not haue ſo worthie a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence marred with the effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natenes of the reſt of his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: My bodie (quoth he) daunceth for ioy, and my heart within me is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed with pleaſure, to think that I being content with bread &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhould bee able to contemne all the delicate fare of the world. And now if <hi>Epicurus</hi> gloried ſo much in the contempt of all dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, what thinke you ſhould the Stoicks doe? ſhould not they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and honour ſobrietie as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:88:37"/>
the very foundation of all other vertues, and ſuch a one as ſtifles all other vices in the cradle, &amp; chokes them in the ſeede?</p>
            <p>We reade that the families of the <hi>Curij</hi> and <hi>Fabricij</hi> in Rome did get many ample victories o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their enemies, yet were they not renowmed for any thing but for their frugalitie. Their feates of armes did for a certaine time aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the ſtate of the Romanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their forraine enemies: but their ſobernes and frugalitie hath been a law to frame and faſhion the mindes and courages of them which did afterwards ouercome all the world: the figges and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots which they preferred before the riches of the Samnites, were more pleaſant in taſte to them which ſucceeded them, then were
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:88:37"/>
the delicate meates of <hi>Axicius</hi> in his time. Theſe reaſons may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſerue vs to moderate thoſe exceeding great pleaſures which wee take in wearing coſtly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and building ſtately houſes, &amp; ſuch other things which are to be referred vnto the vſe of the bodie: for otherwiſe, if we doe not mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and meaſure the pleaſures which wee conceiue in them by the neceſſitie of nature, the very opinion will draw vs into a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous downfall, where we ſhal nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finde ſhore nor bottome. For example, firſt our ſhewes muſt be made of veluet, then of cloath of gold, and laſtly they muſt be fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embroydered with pearles and diamonds: and ſo likewiſe our houſes muſt bee firſt built with Marble, then with Iaſper, and finally
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:88:38"/>
with Porphyre. It ſhall bee good therefore for vs to obſerue this courſe, that our apparell bee ſufficient to defend vs from the violence of heate and colde, and our houſes ſtrong enough to reſiſt winde and raine, and let vs not ſeeke any thing els: and if happily we finde any thing beſides, let vs not be moued therewith at all.</p>
            <p>But it ſeemeth that reaſon hath more adoe in reſiſting the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which come by ſight, and fruition of fayre and beautifull things, then it hath in conquering the pleaſures which wee haue but earſt entreated of. For wee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the perſon which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth on his face the fauours of nature printed in a rare and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull ſort, hath a lawfull power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs, and that drawing our eyes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:88:38"/>
vnto it, it draweth our affections likewiſe thither, and enthralles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto it euen againſt our willes. But what then? let vs remember that it is a thing meerely without vs, and that it is a grace and fauour which nature hath beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the perſon which enioyeth it, and not vpon vs: and that it is a thing, the vſe and poſſeſſion wherof may be as preiudiciall as profitable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: and laſt of all, let vs conſider that it is but a floure which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually fadeth, and nothing els but as it were the colour of a bodie. If you ſuffer your ſelfe to bee carried away with this mad and frantike paſſion, where ſhall a man finde you? you cannot bee your owne man any longer; your bodie muſt needes endure a thouſand paynes to ſeeke your pleaſure, and your
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:88:39"/>
mind a thouſand torments to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your deſire. When this deſire ſhall grow to his full height, it wil become low, &amp; loue neuer leaues encreaſing till in the end it proue ſtarke madnes.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore prouide our ſelues of ſtrong rampires and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes to warde vs againſt this paſſion, and let vs take heede that we bee not coſoned or deceiued with her entiſing baits. The more ſhe dallieth with vs, the more let vs defie her, and let vs take this warning in good time, that ſhe neuer comes to embrace vs, but ſhe meanes to ſtrangle vs: that ſhe neuer giues vs liberty and licenſe, but to bring vs into thraldome and ſlauerie: ſhe baites vs with honie, to glut vs with gall: ſhe ſetteth before our eyes a vaine
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:88:39"/>
ſhew of pleaſure, which paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in a moment, and leaues vs ſorrow and griefe which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for euer. Let vs therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our mindes in ſuch ſort, that in conſidering the excellencie of beautie, we doe acknowledge the cunning workmanſhip of nature, and let vs ſo eſteeme it as wee doe the Sunne and Moone, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency which is contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them. And if the law doe grant vs any more particular fruition of it, let it bee taken to that end that nature deſires, and ſo that we doe not loſe the vſe of reaſon which ought ſtill to beare rule in vs; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring alwaies how much harme commeth by the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vſe of this pleaſure; how it waſteth the bodie, weakeneth the ſoule, and duls the ſpirit. Let vs
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:88:40"/>
altogether abſtaine from it (if it be poſſible) before wee bee married: for beſides that, it wipes away all ſhame and modeſtie in youth, it makes them loſe the ſweetneſſe of marriage which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But aboue all things let vs take heede that wee doe not commit any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtie the ſooner to accompliſh our filthie pleaſures.

            <p>Laſt of all, this kind of pleaſure is accompanied with a kinde of delight which concernes the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and in this regarde it ſeemeth that it is ſomewhat naturall: but the deſire of goods and honours,

For what is there in the world ſo vncertaine and vnſure, as the poſſeſſion of ſuch goods as goe and come, ſlide and paſſe away as a torrent? And I may very well ſay as a torrent, for they make a noyſe at their comming vnto a man, are full of violence being poſſeſſed of him, and are indeede nothing els but troubles and griefes: it is long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come, and when they are

come they ſtay not long with vs, but vaniſh away ſuddenly and in a moment, &amp; when they are gone they leaue nothing behinde them in the bottome but dirt and filth.</p>
            <p>O riches, if men could bee ſo happie as to ſee the ruſt of cares and grie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And truly thoſe which do loue you, I can ſay no more of them but this, that they haue one vertue in them, and that is this, to be very conſtant in concealing their griefes, for feare of diſcouering their ſhames: and were it lawfull for ſorro we freely to vtter her complaints againſt Fortune, think you that ſhe could

not anſwere the accuſation of ſo many men, as ſhe hath couſoned by giuing of them euils, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and title of good things? Verely my opinion is, that ſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let vs then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge riches to be as they are, that is, preſents of Fortune, which ſhe doth but lend vnto vs for a while: for goods that ordinarily happen vnto bad men, for goods which are not goods, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue gotten them good maſters: for good which oftentimes corrupt goods manners, but neuer amend the bad: for goods without the which ſo many wiſe men haue made their liues moſt fortunate:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:88:42"/>
for goods which ſo many wicked men hauing had, haue ſuffered moſt pitifull deaths. Let vs know what this vnruly deſire of hauing them doth profit vs. It is a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene in our ſoules, which conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth our naturall affections with her venemous heate, to fill vs with certaine poyſoned and virulent humours. As ſoone as it is lodged within our hearts, all honeſtie and natural affection which is due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to parents, friends, &amp; to our ſelues, vaniſheth away: all the reſt being compared with our profits, ſeeme nothing: we, euen we for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ſake neglect our ſelues, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe our mindes and bodies, and as it is in the prouerbe, ſell the horſe to buy hay. It ſeemes that nature in the very growing of gold, hath in ſome ſort preſaged

Now if you cannot ſhew me this honeſt meanes, why are you ſo inſtant with me to ſeeke them by vnlawfull meanes? Let vs learne to ſeeke that without paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which nature deſires, and we ſhall finde that Fortune cannot hinder vs from atchieuing our purpoſes. But

indeed the ſpeedieſt &amp; trueſt way of attaining vnto riches, is by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing of riches. If we would faine be rich, we neede not encreaſe the meanes of getting them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diminiſh the deſires of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: hee that is a contented man, is a rich man, hee may haue riches when he will.

            <p>Indeede true honour is the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering &amp; beaming brightnes of a

good and vertuous action, which rebounds from our conſciences vnto the ſight of them with whom wee liue, and ſo by a reflexion in our ſelues, brings vs a teſtimonie from others of the good opinion which they haue of vs, which makes vs to enioy great comfort of minde. Now this good dooth wholly depend on vs. Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures vs this good, when, and as often as wee will haue it, wee may haue it.

ſo that our affections are hanged vpon the eyes of other men: and wee loue not vertue, but as the common people doe loue and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour it: if wee chance to attempt or doe any good thing, it is not done for the loue of good, but for deſire of honour. And ſo wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like pearced hogges-heads which ſuffer no licour to come foorth, till there bee a vent made.

Firſt of all let vs perſwade our ſelues that there is no true honor in the world but that which commeth from vertue. Secondly, that vertue ſeeks no greater or ampler theater to ſhew her ſelfe in, then her owne conſcience. The higher the Sunne is the leſſe ſhadow it makes, and the greater a mans vertue is the leſſe glorie it ſeekes. And indeed a man may very well liken glorie vnto a ſhadowe, for it followes them which flye from it, and flyes them that ſeek after it. Let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that we come into the world as to a comedie, where wee may

not chuſe what part we will play, but onely looke that we play that parte well which is giuen vs in charge. If the Poet bid vs play a kings part, we muſt take care that we doe it well, and ſo if he charge vs with the porter or clowns part, we muſt do it likewiſe: for a man may get as much credit by play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one wel, as by well acting the other: and like diſcredit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth vnto him if neither bee done well.</p>
            <p>As for diſhonours, we muſt vſe them as wee doe meates at a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, where wee taſte of them which are ſet before vs, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it an vnmannerly part to reach our hands after thoſe diſhes which are ſet at the further end of the table, or to take the platters out of the ſtewards hands. And ſo

we, if the teſtimonie of our vertue, profit of our countrie, and fauour of our friends commit any matter of weight and credit to vs for to be done, which we know wee are well able to bring to paſſe, let vs accept it modeſtly, and diſcharge it faithfully and truly, thinking it to be Gods will and pleaſure that we ſhould watch and ward, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt others take their quiet reſt and ſleepe.

For without doubt, ambition is a moſt gentle paſsion, which diues moſt gently downe into the moſt gentle man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and heroical ſpirits: but being there, is not to bee drawne out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine but with great paine.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:88:50"/>
is one of the cruelleſt inſtruments which opinion hath to torment vs withall: for becauſe ſhe cannot worke vpon vs, but by coſoning and beguiling vs, and that euery man can better ſee things preſent, then foreſee things to come: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſerues her ſelf with things to come, the ſooner to come to her purpoſes, ſhe lieth lurking in ſome darke or blinde corner, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atch her time and opportunitie, as theeues obſerue the night for their robberies, becauſe ſhe would not be diſcouered in her actions. Afterwards ſhe feares &amp; affrights vs with maskes of euils, which haue but a bare ſhew and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of euill, hauing nothing in her which may hurt vs, but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of a conceiued and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginarie euil, which maketh the

thing ſeeme euill, though it be not ſo indeede, and euen from that which is good draweth a kinde of euill to vexe and trouble vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And good God, how many men may we ſee continually, who for feare of beeing vnfortunate haue become miſerable, and ſo turned their vaine feares into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine miſeries? How many men are there in the world which haue loſt their friends for feare of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting them? and how manie haue been ſicke for feare of being ſicke? ſo that it may be truly ſaid, that feare is a heauy weight, which maketh vs ſtoope downe to the ground, and ſtumble as we runne haſtily from that which we thinke is to be auoyded. Therefore let vs take awayfeare, and we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue al danger of euill farre from

vs: at leaſt wee ſhall not feele it before it come, and when it comes it will neuer trouble vs ſo much, that we need greatly to feare it.</p>
            <p>If a man might haue his mind to chuſe from what euil he would bee exempted, in mine opinion hee ſhould chooſe to bee freeſt from feare: becauſe the paine of other euils dureth no longer then the cauſe, but feare is formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently as well of that which is, as of that which is not, &amp; which peraduenture is neuer likely to be; yea of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But alas, what is there to bee feared? Feare we that which is in our power or no? No: for then perhaps wee might remedie it. What then? is

it a thing out of our power? If it be ſo, it is no euill, and what cauſe then haue wee to feare it? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſerues this feare then?

On the contrary ſide, if wee can but beare a braue minde and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute courage agaynſt this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we ſhall bee well able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie and redreſſe many things which happen vnto vs, which by feare and aſtoniſhment are made farre worſe then they are: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many other euill effects which feare bringeth with it, this is one moſt dangerous, that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily it maketh a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hate that which he feares.</p>
            <p>Now hatred is a moſt deadlie paſſion, which troubleth vs very ſtrangely. For I pray, ſtay a while
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:88:52"/>
and conſider with your ſelues how when wee meane to hate a thing indeed, this affection of hatred is nouriſhed and increaſed within vs, though it bee neither watered nor laboured, and finally how it cauſeth in vs an vtter loathing and deteſtation of that which is hated. And what is that which we doe ſo greatly hate and abhorre? Mary that you may bee ſure which wee ſhould not: for if there bee any thing in the world which deſerues to be hated, it is hatred it ſelfe, and ſuch like paſſions which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the nature of that which ſhould commaund in vs. This is the onely griefe in the worlde to vexe vs withall. We hate the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons themſelues, and we hate their actions, either becauſe wee feare ſome euill to come, or remember

ſome euill paſt which we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by them, or els becauſe the nature of our ſences hath a kinde of contrarietie, antipathie, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepaſsion with the thing hated.

Whereby it ſo commeth to paſſe, that the paine of that euil which we doe wiſh vnto another

Wherefore let vs ſhut the gate of our ſoule againſt this great &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible paſſion: and to take away all pretence of entring in vpon vs, by a miſlike and lothing of thinges which may come into our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let vs propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to our ſelues this rule which is moſt true and infallible, to wit, that euery thing hath two handles, by the which a man may take and lift it vp: if we take it by one of the handles it wil ſeeme heauie and grieuous: if by the other, wee ſhall finde it light and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſie to be borne. Now na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may ſpeake vnto vs, as the Philoſopher did vnto his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; that which I offer vnto you with the right hand, you take with the left, you alwaies chooſe the worſt; if there be any good thing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:88:54"/>
you leaue it, and if there bee any bad thing that you will bee ſure to take. For example, there is one of your neighbours which ſueth you in the law, and therefore you can not thinke on him, but you muſt dreame of his proceſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently curſe and blame him therfore. See here the bad handle, for take him by the other handle, and then ſtraight waies you will thinke that he is a man as well as you, &amp; that God hath bound you to loue him by a likenes of nature, that he is your fellow citizen, and that you are ioyned together in a communitie of the ſame lawes, the ſame Churches, the ſame Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and the ſelfe ſame ſacrifices: againe, that you are fellow neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, bound by charitie to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and relieue one another, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:88:54"/>
ſhall not ſo many ſubiects of good will bee able to quench one little ſparke of hatred? Peraduenture you haue a brother which hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you, and if you chaunce to meditate on him, you thinke and meditate on him that hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you, and not on him which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued in the ſame wombe, that ſucked the ſame breaſts, was brought vp in the ſame houſe, and laſtly that hee is the one halfe of you. Let vs learne then to handle things rightly, to take them by the good handle, and ſo we ſhall find that there is ſomewhat or other to be loued in that which is now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of vs. For certainly there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the worlde which is not created for mans good. If there be any vicious thing in it which wee do hate, it is the euill of the vicious
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:88:55"/>
perſon himſelfe, and not ours. If happily hee offend vs, wee haue more cauſe to pitie and lament his caſe, then to hate and abhorre him. For he himſelf is the firſt that is offended, and receiueth moſt harme therby: for by this meanes he commeth to loſe thevſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and what greater harme can there happen vnto a man in this world? Wherefore in ſuch &amp; the like caſes, let vs turne our hatred into pitie, and ſtudie to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worthie of our loues which wee would ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aine hate. Thus dealt <hi>Licurgus</hi> when euery one forſook the companie of a certaine fellow which had thruſt out one of his eyes, hee abandoned not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, but carried him home with him, gently entreated him, and enioyned him no other puniſhment
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:88:55"/>
but this, that he ſhould ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die more earneſtly to bee ſoberly and vertuouſly brought vp: which being done, hee returned him to his fellowe citizens, which found that whereas he before was a very quarrellous and iniurious fellow, now he was become a good, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and ſober citizen.</p>
            <p>And looke as we ought to ſhun hatred, ſo likewiſe muſt we auoyd enuie: for they are ſiſters germaine of the ſame colour, and the ſame port, and both of them haue ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects equally daungerous. Enuie ſtirreth vp within vs a kind of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at the good which other men enioy, which ſtill lieth gnawing at our hearts, and tormenteth vs moſt cruelly. Indeede it is a cruel paſſion, and ſo cruell, that all the torments of the moſt cunning
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:88:56"/>
and exquiſite and profeſſed ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants in the worlde, could neuer haue found out a greater. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is of power to conuert and turne another mans good into her harme, what limits can there bee preſcribed vnto her torments, when both her owne euils and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens goods ſhal ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to torment and trouble her? Let vs therefore runne away from her as wee would doe from ſome wilde beaſt, which neuer ceaſeth to deuoure and gnaw our hearts, and ſeeke vtterly to depriue vs of any good that ſhall happen vnto vs. Whileſt the enuious man loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth wiſtly and ouerth wartly ouer another mans good, he letteth his owne be ſpoyled, and ſo loſeth the pleaſure thereof. Now the readie way to take away the feare of this
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:88:56"/>
enuie, will be to ponder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with our ſelues what is that which wee eſteeme good, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie another man the hauing: and we ſhal find, that all being put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet there is nothing which wee would willinglie haue our ſelues. For I finde that the things which commonly we enuie other men the hauing, are theſe: riches, honours, and fauours: but if a man ſhould ſpeake thus vnto vs, I am content that you ſhould haue as much as they at the ſame rate, I warrant you wee would ſtraight waies anſwer that we would haue none of them. For if wee would haue them as they haue them, wee muſt flatter and coſen as they do, ſuffer many iniuries, and needes loſe our libertie. For as the world goeth now, there is nothing to be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:88:57"/>
gotten for bare nothing. Perhaps you make profeſſion of honor and vertue: wel this cannot be bought but with the loſſe of other things which are gotten by a modeſt and ſhamefaſt kinde of patience.

This is a law, or at leaſtwiſe the cuſtome of the world, and it was a cuſtome before euer you were borne, and therefore why doth it grieue you to ſee it obſerued? This man ſels his libertie and freedome to receiue the price of an office or dignitie: why do you enuie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, for I am ſure you would not ſel yours to gain as much: you would faine haue ſiluer and cloath and

For loe here is all the difference, he hath his lettiſe, and I haue my mony. I eſpie my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour comming from a feaſt; when I conſider onely the good cheare which hath been made him, I ſhall be ſorrie that I was not there with him: but when I think how a man
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:88:58"/>
muſt flatter the maſter of the houſe, if he will be welcome, I had rather neuer haue good cheare, then at any time to neglect the dutie of an honeſt man. Let vs therefore, as we tender our reſt and quietnes in this world, take heede that wee grow not too enuious of another mans good. For if it be a true good which hath happened vnto him, we ſhould rather reioyce and bee glad with him for it: for euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould deſire the good one of an other; and to reioyce at the good of another is the way to encreaſe a mans owne.</p>

come vnto another man which wee deſire to haue our ſelues: but iealouſie is of our owne proper good, when wee feare leaſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man ſhould haue part with vs. But verely it is a ſottiſh and irkſome paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is the gall which maketh bitter the honey-ſweet of our life: for it is ordinarily ſeene in our pleaſanteſt &amp; ſweeteſt actions which it maketh ſo bitter and ſharp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Would you therefore faine know an eaſie way to cure you of theſe wounds? I will ſhew you it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; look vpon the skarres and wounds which other men of good account &amp; great reſolution haue receiued: and conſider how they haue laught at ſuch loſſes, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken occaſion to thanke God for them.

            <p>Doe you know how to ſuffer loſſe of things ſo that it ſhall not trouble you? It is quickly learned, there is no more in it but this, not to accuſtome your ſelfe to loue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing otherwiſe then it is, or better then it deſerueth. If a man haue an earthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> veſſell, let him loue it as a veſſell of earth, which may beebroken, and ſo if it chance to be broken, the matter will neuer trouble him much. Let vs paſſe from ſmaller thinges to greater things, from vile and baſer things to things of greater value &amp; more account, and let vs doe the like. If wee loue our children, let vs loue
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:88:66"/>
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as men, that is to ſay, as men ſubiect vnto infinit caſualties of death, and then afterwards when they happen to dye, their deaths will be neither ſtraunge nor grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is an imagination and opinion that vexeth and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs more then the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which is formed of thoſe words which a man vſeth when he is ſurpriſed with ſuch accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: for we call one thing by the name of another, and imagine it to bee like vnto that other, &amp; the image and Idea thereof remaineth ſo in our mindes. And therefore let vs mollifie and ſweeten our words as well as we can: for if one of our children chaunce to dye, ſay not I haue loſt one of my children: but this, I haue reſtored one of my
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:88:67"/>
children to God, of whom I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed them. And likewiſe if wee loſe any other of our goods, let vs vſe the like wordes. If a naughtie fellow take away our goods from vs, and it grieues vs at the verie heart, ſay no more but this: Was it not meet that God ſhould haue that againe which he had lent me for a time? For the reſt, remember your own opinion of the like miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps when they did happen vnto others<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and conſider with your ſelf how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you were not much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but rather how you did blame them, and neglect their friuolous and vaine complaints. Suppoſe that the iudgement which you giue of them, is a preiudice againſt your ſelfe which cannot be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For our iudgements in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans behalf are alwaies more
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:88:67"/>
iuſt and fauourable, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a mans owne cauſe. If a ſeruant of your neighbours chaunce to breake a glaſſe, you ſay, there is no great harme done, it was but a glaſſe broken. If his ſonne dye, you ſay, he was of eſtate mortall, not borne to liue euer: and I pray why can you not ſay as much when your owne ſonne dyeth, without cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, tormenting your ſelfe, or accuſing God and men for the loſſe of that which is ſo ordinarie? There happeneth nothing vnto you but that which you haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene and thought on a thouſand times: and wherfore then are you ſo much aſtoniſhed? For verely I am perſwaded, that if wee were as prouident and careful as we ought to be, and may be if we will, wee ſhall little neede to bee afraide or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:88:68"/>
troubled when any thing happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and principally wee ſhould not greatly care for that which we call iniurie. For let vs but ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of our mindes the manners and humours of men, with whom we doe conuerſe, (as they are for the moſt part) and we ſhall bee quickly reſolued, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you, to ſuffer many lewd parts at their hands, and to indure much of their indiſcretion: for the common nature of men is to reioyce in euil doing, and to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their authorities by nothing but by the iniuries and contempts of other men. So few there be that take pleaſure in well doing.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore determine with our ſelues, that on what ſide ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wee turne our ſelues, wee ſhall finde ſome or other that will bee
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:88:68"/>
readie to offend vs, ſo that a man may finde, as many men ſo many iniuries. But let vs take heed that we be not ſurpriſed by them, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alwaies vpon our garde, and hauing due regarde vnto them when they come. So that whither ſo euer wee goe, and what buſines ſo euer we vndertake, let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before hand what the euent is likely for to be, and how we ſhall be entreated. If we bee deſirous to goe to the baths, let vs wiſely caſt with our ſelues before hand what the actions of men are when wee ſhall come thither, how one gap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and cryes, another iuſtles and iumbles his fellow, here one daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with water, and there another readie to ſteale their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If wee haue well premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and forethought vpon all
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:88:69"/>
this, wee ſhall doe nothing but laugh at matters when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. If we haue occaſion to viſite ſome great man, let vs imagine that hee will make vs wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te at his gate, and when we ſeeke to get in at the doore, the porter will ſhut vs out, and clap the doore againſt vs; that we ſhall finde him buſie, or in ſuch a caſe that hee will not bee ſpoken withall, or when all is done that he wil not giue vs good countenance, and ſcarſe bid vs welcome. When we haue deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all this with our ſelues, little cauſe ſhall we haue to be moued or troubled.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, there is another thing which ſerueth greatly to ſweeten our iniuries, and that is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we excuſe them in our ſelues which haue offered vs any iniurie,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:88:69"/>
preſuming that they would nor haue done it without ſome occaſion. For example, if you ſhould call to your ſeruant, and he not anſwere you againe, thinke that hee did not heare you wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o goethither: and thus let vs doe in other matters, fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ming ſtill excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vnto our ſelues in the behalfe of other men: but eſpecially in matters of iniuries, let vs ſerue our ſelues with the commodity which they offer vs. For as there is no kinde of hearbe how venemous ſo euer it bee, which being well tempered and ordered to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, hath not ſome profitable vſe in it ſelfe: ſo is it in caſe of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. We may (to ſpeake with the

               </gap>, that they make vs know them which offer vs iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to learne to take heede of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt another time: the other, in that they diſcouer our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and infirmitie, and the place which lyeth ſo open to the batt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that we may be the better able to fortifie and ſtrengthen it. In ſuch ſort that if you chance to ſee a man which ſpeakes ill of you, conclude by a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d by with your ſelf; doubtles this man is an euil man, I may not truſt him at any hand. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> examine whether that which he ſaith be true, either in whole or in part, and correct that fault in your ſelfe, leaſt happily another man take occaſion to ſpeake as much, or more of you. For I pray you, what better reuenge can a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:88:70"/>
man take of his enemies, then to profit by their iniuries? But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the laſt fence and ſtrongeſt rampier that we can haue againſt theſe or the like accidents is this, to be reſolued that we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any harme but of our ſelues: and that if ſo be our reaſon be ſo well gouerned as it ought to bee, we cannot be wounded at al. And therefore wee may crye out with <hi>Socrates; Anitus</hi> and <hi>Melitus</hi> may put me to death, but they can not doe me any harme.</p>
            <p>Now he that is prepared to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the iniuries &amp; rebukes of men, will not bee to ſeeke to beare the paine of baniſhment. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is allotted vnto honeſt and good men, by the iniurious dealings of the wicked. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is but a vaine ſhew of euill,

where with opinion terrifieth our minds, and vſeth to draw forth the bitternes of griefe and ſorrow; let vs therefore conſider it more particularly, and try whether it be as grieuous vnto a man when he ſtands by it and viewes it more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, as it ſeemeth vnto him when he is a farre of. Who hath taught vs that it is the nature of man to ſtay ſtill in the ſame place? What greater diſpleaſure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

exiles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Euery place in the world is a wiſe mans countrie, or rather no place at all is his countrie. For his habitation is in heauen, whither hee aſpireth after hee hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the time here beneath of his ſorrowfull pilgrimage; making his abode in cities and prouinces, as trauailers do in Innes and oſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Againe, we cannot ſee paſt ten or twelue leagues of ground: but the face of this great heauen gliſtering with ſo many faire and beautifull ſtarres, doth ſhew her ſelfe once a day, becauſe we ſhuld ſee her turne round about when ſhe diſplaieth her beautie to the full. Wherefore then ſhould it grieue vs ſo much to loſe the ſight of the place where we were borne? It was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of our mothers
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:88:72"/>
(and if they liſted) to haue been brought a bed in other places, and ſo to haue made vs changed our countries.</p>
            <p>This is a barre againſt all that may be obiected concerning this matter, that we were borne either here or there, it matters not where, and therefore we need not ſorrow ſo much at our baniſhments. <hi>Pompey</hi> ſeeing the effeminatenes of the Romanes mindes which were with him at the battaile of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> and perceiuing how they turned their eyes &amp; thoughts towards the citie of Rome, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully regreeting their houſes, and ſighing as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baniſhed from their countrie: My friends (quoth he) the countrie where good men dwell in, is their libertie. <hi>Rutilius</hi> declared this moſt manifeſtly vnto

               <hi>Sylla:</hi> for being by him ſent for back againe from baniſhment, he would not repayre vnto Rome, but rather endure the vaſues of a deſert and ſolitude of an Iland, rather then to abide the face of the tyrant in his owne citie. Euery country is fit to nouriſh and bring vp men, euery countrie yeeldeth them parents: for nature hath ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned al of vs together in bloud and charitie: euery countrie bringeth foorth friends vnto vertue, for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is of power to make men loue one another. What then is there which may cauſe vs to grieue at our departure from the place of our naturall abode? for the ſame heauen hangs ſtill on our heads, and the ſelfe ſame elements conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. If we loſe not our courages, we ſhall not loſe any thing by our

Now if you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto you, to auoyd theſe firſt paſſions well and good, I ſhal not neede to employ any further time to diſcourſe vnto you the way and means of preparing your ſelfe againſt the other.

fire in our hearts full of a thicke ſmoke which dazels our vnderſtanding, carrieth our cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations away with violence, and holdeth them hanging in the clowdes, vtterly depriueth vs of iudgement, and maketh vs to dreame waking. And as long as our hopes dure, we cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to forſake our deſires. On the contrary part, when deſpayre is once lodged within vs, it ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth our ſoule with an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our diſabilitie in obtaining of that which wee deſire, that euerie thing muſt yeeld vnto her becke, and giue her place: ſo that for the very loue of that which wee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine we ſhall neuer be able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto, we forgo the quiet reſt which wee alreadie enioy. This paſſion is like vnto little children,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:88:74"/>
which for ſpight that one of their toyes ſhould be taken away from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, throw al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt in the fire. This paſſion is angrie with her ſelfe, and of her ſelfe exacteth the paine of her misfortune. The meanes to cure a man of it, is to arreſt his deſires at their firſt peeping forth, and if they bee wicked not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to goe any further, and if they bee good to temper and make them goe and grow into a ſweete and peaceable affection, without looking afterwards for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymore fauour, then the nature of the thing and inconſtancie of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune doth ſuffer and permit: ſtill ballancing our hopes and feares together. For a wiſe man ought not to liue in hope more then in feare; and it is not his part to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe into Fortunes hands,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:88:75"/>
to hinder or diminiſh any thing from his pleaſures. In like manner he ſhould not deſpayre or doubt of any thing, as well for that his deſires ſhould be bounded within the limits of his power, as alſo for that ſuch is the vnſteadfaſtnes of things, that it doth as well relieue things deſperate, as altogether o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturne and quaile the hopes of things wiſhed for.</p>

wee haue no meanes of diſcourſe left vnto vs: yea euen at that time when our ſences are moſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.

To ſay the trueth, it commeth vnto vs at the firſt by a diſpoſition of nature, but after wards delicate nouriture and fonde education, preuaileth much vnto the increaſing of it.

            <p>O that we could be once fullie perſwaded in this poynt not to feare death, good God how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſhould we then be? For in this one thing more then in any other, opinion taketh occaſion to band her ſelfe againſt reaſon, that ſo ſhe

vs in this paſſion, is, that it ſeemeth to ariſe vppon a good ground, and may be iuſtly excuſed by the malice of other men. But what an excuſe is this? as if another mans iniuſtice could make the thing iuſt which is not iuſt of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elfe, or the loſſe which we receiue by another man could be deemed any way profitable vnto vs? Alas, ſhe wanteth that ſtrength which ſhe ſhould haue to doe vs good: ſhe is willing to cure one euill but by another. Briefly to commit the correction of offences vnto cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, were to correct one vice by an other. But reaſon which ſhould command in vs, will haue no ſuch officers which do al things of their owne heads, without ſtaying for any direction: ſhe deſireth to doe all things orderly and lawfully, as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:88:81"/>
well as nature. And becauſe it is not her propertie to vſe violence, therefore wee oftentimes thinke that where there is violence there is ſtrength. But alas wee deceiue our ſelues: for there is nothing ſo weake as an vnruly and diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red motion. Now all violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions proceede rather from weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes then from ſtrength: and may bee well reſembled vnto the force of young children and old folkes, which runne when they thinke they doe but walke and goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. For truſt me, anger and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is but an argument of weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and they are much deceiued that thinke otherwiſe. But what then, may ſome man ſay, ſhall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſee vice waxe inſolent, and yet not bee mooued at all? ſhall wee take away all manner of libertie
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:88:81"/>
from them, ſo that they ſhall not haue ſo much leaue as to ſhewe foorth their anger againſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? For anſwere to this I ſay, that vertue deſireth no more libertie then it is fit and meete for her to haue; ſhee maye not turne her ſtrength againſt her ſelfe, or bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing mooued with another mans euill. For it is the propertie of a wiſe man as well to ſuffer the vices of euill men without choler, as to brooke their proſperities without enuie: and he muſt be as readie patiently to ſuffer the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete parts of many raſh headed perſons, as the Phiſition can bee content many times to beare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iniuries at his patients hands, being ſicke of a phrenſie.</p>
            <p>Truly there is no greater wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nor more profitable in this
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:88:82"/>
world, then patience in enduring the follie of other men. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſo falleth out diuers times, that becauſe wee cannot ſuffer their fooliſhnes, wee make it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ours, and ſoreceiue much harme thereby. For firſt it makes vs loſe our iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, then it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs to hurt our ſelues, till in the end we throw our ſelues headlong into that danger which we would willingly auoyd. This paſſion alſo may be very well and fitly likened vnto great walles or houſes when they fall, which breake and bruſe all that they light vpon: and ſhe is ſo earneſt in procuring another mans euill, that ſhe hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at all vnto her owne good. Adde vnto all this that hath been ſpoken, that ſhe is very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and for the moſt part vniuſt:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:88:82"/>
and to ſpeake the trueth, offence and reuenge is but one ſinne, that hath diuers excuſes: for both of them haue one end, and that is to miſchiefe other men. Therefore let vs be diligent and careful, that wee doe not ſuffer any ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to ariſe in our minds: but as ſoone as any thing doth begin to moue vs any whit, or touch vs to the quicke, let vs pauſe and thinke vpon it a while: for if wee could but once find in our hearts to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the caſe with our ſelues, wee ſhould be well able to ſtoppe the courſe of this cruell feuer of the minde. For looke but vpon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and geſtures of men when they are once in choler, marke how ill euery thing becommeth them.

            <p>Let vs therefore accuſtome our ſelues to forgiue all the whole worlde. Let not the greatnes or grieuouſnes of the iniurie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold vs from pardoning them: but on the contrarie ſide let vs thinke, that the greater the iniurie is, the better it deſerueth to bee pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that the more iuſt our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge is, the more our gentlenes is to bee praiſed. But eſpeciallie ſuch as are ſeated by fortune in the higheſt degree of honour, ſhould take heede to their motions that they be remiſſe and temperate: for
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:88:83"/>
for as their actions are of greater importance, ſo their faults are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bee cured.

contribute with vs, but the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp and inſtitution of them is altogether in our hands, which wee muſt owe of dutie, firſt vnto God to whom wee muſt preſent and offer them: ſecondly to our countrie, for whoſe ſeruice they are borne: and laſtly to our ſelues, which are to looke for at their hands (if they bee well and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly brought vp) for al manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The ſharpe ſawce of our life is ſweetened by the ſugar of their friendſhips, by their care the care of our buſines is abated, nay wee may ſafely reſt our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their labours and induſtrie: let vs therfore haue ſuch a reſpectiue care ouer them, as they haue ouer vs; let vs think and dreame vpon nothing but vpon their reſt and quietnes, as being the moytie and the other halfe of our ſelues. But eſpecially let vs make it knowne vnto them, that we do not honor them for any pleaſure which their youth or beauties may affoord vs; as well for feare leaſt if we doe ſo, wee happen to puffe vp their courages, and make them take more ſtate vpon them then necdeth:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:88:94"/>
as alſo in this reſpect, that whereas this affection is founded and grounded vpon ſuch a ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and running thing, it is to bee feared leaſt the heate thereof bee ſoone quenched: but let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and worſhip them for the faith and loyaltie which we looke for at their hands, for their good qualities and modeſt behauiours: and laſt of all, for the eſpecial care which they haue of their children<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the better to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke and ſtirre them vp to loue and cheriſh vs, let vs ſhew that we wil not appropriate anything from them vnto our ſelues, but make them equally partakers of our goods, thoughts &amp; affections. For this communitie of all things maye greatly ſerue to nouriſh

good will and amitie betweene vs, which is cleane loſt and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the diuerſitie of willes and determinations.</p>
            <p>This affection paſſeth from our wiues vnto their kinsfolke, which are allied vnto vs by nature, their ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning together with their bloud, a ſecret inclination of good will and affection towards all them which are ſprung from the ſame branch, and accordingly as they are neerer vnto vs in bloud, ſo are wee more liuely affected towards them, &amp; bound to performe and yeeld vnto them neerer duties and ſeruices. Therefore herein as well as in all other matters to obſerue the order of nature, as being the ſoueraigne ornament of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, let vs (as I haue ſayd before) ſo diſpenſe the loue and affection
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:88:95"/>
which wee owe vnto our parents, as they doe neerer concerne and regard vs, yeelding them all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of helpe and ſuccour which can poſſibly be deuiſed.</p>
            <p>Hetherto nature hath as it were with her owne hand moued our affections: now wee muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie come to ſpeake of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inclinations which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue giueth, which bindeth vs to loue and honour vertuous &amp; wiſe men. And truely of all the goods which we enioy by the benefit of common ſocietie, there is no one that ought to bee more eſteemed and cheriſhed, then the friendſhip and amitie of honeſt men: for it is the very piller and vpholder of our happines: it is ſhe that gouernes our liues, ſweetneth our ſowre, and ſeaſoneth our ſweete: ſhe giueth

And as the poſſeſſion hereof is pretious, ſo we ought to employ our wiſedoms to haue this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as perfect as may be. And to this ende and purpoſe wee muſt hunt and ſeeke after men of the greateſt merits, honouring and cheriſhing them as if they were ſent from God to ioyne with vs in a ſocietie of certaine noble and worthie actions. Wee muſt ſeeke to purchaſe it by honeſt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: and hauing once gotten it, ſtudie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:88:96"/>
to preſerue it by a due performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of all duties. For all creatures, and principally men, are borne with a kinde of inclination of loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that which may any waies profit or auaile them. And yet for al this, a vertuous man doth neuer meaſure his profite by the ell of goods (as we call them) or riches: but by the commoditie which hee receiueth &amp; reapeth by his friends in the ſtudie of vertue. And if it ſo fall out that there be any commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, bee it neuer ſo ſmall, to bee parted betweene vs &amp; our friends, touching our goods and honours, or ſuch like things, it ſhall bee our parts to giue place vnto them: for all this cannot be better imployed then in purchaſing of true friends. On the contrary ſide, there is but one onely reaſon which may excuſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:88:97"/>
vs from leauing their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and amitie, and that is when they abandon reaſon and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, which ioyneth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bineth vs together. And yet this muſt be done very warily: for we may not be at plaine enmitie with them for all this. We muſt rather vnrip then rent their friendſhips from vs, and ſeeke out all reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable meanes (if it be poſſible) to bring them backe againe vnto their duties, without blaming their actions, or checking their opinios: neuer fighting with them, vnles it be by way of diſputation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which are the ſacred wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of true frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip: but though we loſe al hope of preuailing with them this way, yet wee may not become their open and profeſſed enemies. For though a good man
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:88:97"/>
leaue his friends when they leaue off to bee vertuous: yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo it is, that in forſaking that friendſhippe and familiaritie which hath been in former time betweene them, he retaineth that common affection which ought to bee amongſt men, which bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to wiſh wel vnto thoſe which haue not well deſerued at their hands: telling them that this is to imitate God, which as he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the good, ſo he doth not hate the bad. And therefore we haue a common ſaying, that a good man hath no enemies at all, becauſe he hateth no bodie.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the degrees of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which are betweene man and the things which are without him. But becauſe it commeth ſo to paſſe many times, that they doe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:88:98"/>
draw vs vnto diuers ends, and ſo hold vs ſuſpended in doubtfulnes and incertaintie, therfore we muſt eſtabliſh a rule vnto our ſelues of preferring the former duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter. We ought to make great account of an oth, and yet it were better broken then kept, if by keeping of it we offend God. We muſt of force highly reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce our fathers and mothers: and yet if their wils doe contradict right reaſon, which is appoynted by God himſelfe to gouerne vs, wee muſt rather forſake them, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake God and reaſon. Our kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes are to bee eſteemed deare vnto vs, but yet if they ſeeke to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy and moleſt father or mother, we may lawfully diſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Friends may preuaile much with a man, his wife and childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:88:98"/>
more: and yet for all this, there are certaine particular and priuate duties which are rather to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to them which are further off from vs, then to them which be neerer: but commonly it is in a matter of no great waight when ciuill ſocietie (becauſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſitie of men) incrocheth and vſurpeth ſomewhat vpon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As when wee ſay we ſhould helpe our neighbour in fetching in of his harueſt, and not our kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and in ſuch like caſes.</p>
            <p>I haue hetherto, as you ſee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented vnto you the reſpect which man oweth vnto thinges which are without him: it is now high time to cauſe him to deſcend into himſelfe, and bring backe his affections vnto his owne proper perſon, as lines are reduced vnto
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:88:99"/>
their center. A wiſe man without doubt yeeldeth much reſpect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e: and though no body regard him but his owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet hee will bee very carefull that he doe neither ſpeake nor doe any thing which is not fit and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient. For right ordered reaſon, which ought to gouerne all his actions, is vnto him the ſeuereſt iudge and cenſor of his actions that can be found. And therefore wee muſt ſtudie as well pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kely as priuatly ſo to frame and faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our actions in ſuch ſort, that wee may not haue occaſion to bluſh and be aſhamed of them: &amp; that nature which ought to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he rule of all our actions, be not violated in any ſort. Now it hath pleaſed nature to giue vs a bodie, as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie inſtrument for the preſeruation
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:88:99"/>
of mans life. Therefore we muſt take care for the bodie, but no otherwiſe then we would doe for a thing which is vnder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the minde, which muſt bee carefull for the ſafetie thereof, but no waies ſeruiceable vnto it: he muſt entreate it ſo as if he were a Lord and no tyrant ouer the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſtill nouriſhing it without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing or fatting it: ſo that it may euidently appeare vnto all men that hee doth not liue for it, but that hee cannot liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>A cunning workman is not a little forward in his buſines, when he hath gotten all his tooles about him in a readines: and ſo hee that loueth philoſophy doth not a little thing profit himſelfe, if he doe but once know how to ſerue himſelfe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:88:100"/>
with his bodie, and make it a fit inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for him to exerciſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Now the bodie may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in health two manner of waies: the one is by moderation in his diet: the other, by good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his exerciſe. For why the nature of things here beneath is ſo ſlipperie and vncertaine, that vnleſſe a man doe continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre that which time doth waſte and conſume, things will by little and little come in the ende to nought. Therefore wee muſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine and helpe the bodie once decaying by vſe of meates; but with this prouiſo or caueat, that wee doe not make it, by making too great cheare, heauie, dull, and vnfit for contemplation: nor by too ſpare diet and ill entreatance, weake and ſickly: ſo that it bee
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:88:100"/>
neither effeminated with riot, nor by neglect of it accuſtome it ſelfe to filth and beaſtlines.</p>
            <p>After meate followeth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, although they ſeeme to bee confounded and to follow one an other indifferently. For firſt wee exerciſe our ſelues, and then wee take our repaſt: and after meate then we fall a freſh to exerciſe: the firſt exerciſe ſerues to prepare vs to the better appetite and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our meates: the ſecond, to waken nature, and keepe the parts of the bodie in continuall motion. We muſt vſe our exerciſes ſo, that the bodie may bee the better for them, and our minde nothing the worſe: but we muſt not ſeek ſuch exerciſes as wraſtlers vſe, and ſuch like, which doe all things by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe and meaſure, and many obſeruations,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:88:101"/>
which ſerue indeede to keepe the bodie vpright &amp; ſtrong, &amp; to no other vſe: but therby they weaken the ſtrength of the ſoule, and take away from her her true and naturall motions. It is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie for a wiſe man to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for to find out fit exerciſes for the bodie, ſeeing that he may find euery where ſo many as are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and needfull for the health thereof.</p>
            <p>After the bodie is once nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and exerciſed in ſuch ſort as I haue ſhewed you, it is moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily faſhioned and framed vnto modeſt &amp; ſeemely actions, which we ſhould ſo much regard and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to attaine vnto, that in our very countenances and gate ſhuld appeare a great tranquilitie of mind, mixed with a ſober &amp; pleaſant
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:88:101"/>
kinde of grauitie. I doe not ſpeake this as if I would haue you to vſe anie affectation in your countenance and geſtures, as to looke with the flatterers ſmile, or the Philoſophers frowne. For as a ſober grauitie maketh a man to be reuerenced of all: ſo a kinde of portlike and conſtrained auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, makes him to appeare ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and odious vnto all.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it is ſpeech which giueth life vnto our countenances and dead geſtures, therefore wee muſt take great heede that we be able to rule and gouerne it. And ſurely the beſt precept which wee can giue any man in this caſe, is ſilence. For to know how to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with reaſon is a great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, if a man mark it, to him that meanes to ſpeake well: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or it is not
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:88:102"/>
poſſible for a man to ſpeake well, &amp; to ſpeake much, one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot doe both. Silence is the father of diſcourſe and fountaine of reaſon: contrarily in much talke there is much offence. They that ayme directly at anything, ſhut one of their eyes and winke with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and wherefore doe they ſo? but to ſtrengthen and encreaſe the vertue of their ſight. This teacheth vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſences being caſt abroad, doe by the very powring foorth of themſelues waxe feeble &amp; weake: and euen ſo is it with the ſpirit, being caſt abroad by ſpeech, and ſcattered and difuſed into many wordes, it loſeth his force and vertue. But on the contrarie ſide, if it be reſtrained with ſilence, it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth his wonted ſtrength, and ſtores himſelfe with prudence and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:88:102"/>
wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edome. The vſe of words whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſion bids vs ſpeake, ought to bee this: to ayde the trueth, and to carrie the candle before her that ſhe may be ſeene: &amp; contrariwiſe to diſcouer and reiect lyes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth: to praiſe that which is good, and blame that which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. We muſt not acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie our ſpeech with too great veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie or contention, for this ſheweth our paſſions. Againe, we muſt not vſe to diſcourſe of matters that doe happen in common aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies or Theaters, or to entertaine them that bee in our companie with ſuch or the like diſcourſes: for this ſheweth much leiſure and ſmall profit.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, it is not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſtand much vpon our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or to tell men what we haue
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:88:103"/>
done, &amp; what hath chanced vnto vs in our times: for there is much vanitie herein. Others peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture take not ſo much pleaſure in hearing you talk, as you do in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; recounting your owne va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. To ſpeake of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without offence, is a very dangerous and hard matter: for either wee commend them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, or els blame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing their intention. But aboue all other things, let vs take heede of making ſongs of men, or laughing and gibing at them: for ſo doth euery common ieſter, and it makes vs loſe our reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with good men. Beſides, theſe ieſts are for the moſt part mixed with fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and lewd wordes, which wee ſhould ſhunne and auoyd. Now the libertie of ſpeaking vnhoneſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:88:103"/>
and vnſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emely wordes, draweth after it the like effects. But wee muſt ſtriue (if it be poſſible) that our wordes may redound to the profit of them which ſhall heare vs, that they be ſtuffed with good and wholeſom precepts, that they ſerue to bring them back vnto the ſtudie of vertue which wander in the way of ſinne and wickednes. In our common diſcourſe wee muſt auoyd too profound and ſubtill queſtions. For a man may compare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to creyfiſhes, which affoord a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more picking worth then meate: the ende of them is nothing els but braules and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: and moſt commonly it ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>areth with them as it doth with men that haue weake ſtomackes, which vomit vp al that which they cannot well diſgeſt. As wee deſire
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:88:104"/>
to haue audience when we ſpeake our ſelues, ſo muſt we be attentiue to other mens ſpeeches, and heare them to the end without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We muſt not accord and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree vnto all that is ſayd: for there bee ſome which will not ſticke to ſay anything, and others that will contradict them as faſt: ſome be flatterers, others bee raſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate: but wee muſt yeeld our conſents to that which is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true, and peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that which is euidently falſe, and in doubtfull thinges ſuſpend our iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, till we haue found ſome reaſon or ground to ſtand vpon.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe a mans wordes and geſtures are framed by long cuſtome and imitation of others, we ſhould not ſort our ſelues too

I doe not ſpeak this as if my meaning were that you ſhould couet to bee ſeene in well doing, or call all the people about you to ſee your vertues, as they do which betake themſelues vnto Images for ſanctuarie.

            <p>There is nothing which can help vs ſo much to make that ſort well which wee haue luckely vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as the taking of times and opportunities. For time carrieth with it certaine moments, which are the ſeaſons and opportunities of buſines. If you loſe them, or let them ſlip, you loſe all your labour and pains. But if occaſion be once taken with opportunitie, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with diligence, you ſhall ſeldome miſſe of your purpoſe, but haue alwaies good ſucceſſe in your affayres. And therefore
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:88:108"/>
wee muſt looke that that which hath been maturely deliberated and thought vpon, be ſpeedily put in execution: and let vs not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome our ſelues to poſt that ouer to the morrow, which may be as well done the ſame day. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we doe anything, though we doe it neuer ſo wiſely, take all aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, chuſe all opportunities, vſe all poſſible diligence: yet for all this we muſt know that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the euent is altogether ouer maſtered by Fortune. Wee are lords and maſters of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and determinations, but al the reſt dependeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other matters which are not in our power. And therefore we can doe no more but vndertake a matter with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, purſue it with hope, and be readie to ſuffer whatſoeuer ſhall
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:88:108"/>
happen with patience. If good enterpriſes haue bad ſucceſſe, the anſwere which the noble man of Perſia made, may ſerue for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to all them which are wiſe, but vnfortunat. One was deſirous to know of him wherefore (ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knew him to bee a very wiſe &amp; valiant gentleman) his affayres went no better forward. Becauſe (quoth hee) in my affayres I can but giue good counſell, that is all I can doe, the ſucceſſe belongeth altogether vnto Fortune or God that is Lord ouer her. Therefore it is ſufficient for vs if wee doe all that belongeth vnto vs, that is, if wee attempt nothing but with a good end, and follow it not but by lawfull and honeſt meanes.</p>
