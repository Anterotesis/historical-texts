            <title>The Quakers house built upon the rock Christ Wherein neither their doctrines, principles, nor practices can be confounded, not disproved; being neither damnable, nor pernitious. As Samuel Hammond hath falsly affirmed in his book called, The Quakers house built upon the sand: or, a discovery of the damnablenes of their pernitious doctrins, in his answer to G.W. which to prove, he lays down seven grounds of delusion, and five arguments of damnable doctrine.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE QUAKERS HOUSE Built upon the Rock CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Wherein neither their Doctrines, Principles, nor Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises can be confounded, nor disproved; being neither damnable, nor pernitious. As <hi>Samuel Hammond</hi> hath falsly affirmed in his Book called, The Quakers <hi>House Built upon the Sand.</hi> Or, a Discovery of the damnablenes of their pernitious Doctrins, in his Answer to <hi>G. W.</hi> which to prove, he lays down seven Grounds of Delusion, and five Arguments of Damnable Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But in this Answer his seven Grounds is proved false in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if they were (as they are not) true against us; And his five Arguments is proved to be his own false Positions, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Doctrine and Principles: As first, he lays down false Positions, and then proves them false; and then boasts, as if he had proved our Doctrines or Principles false: The truth of which is herein clearly made manifest, and wherein he falsly accuseth us, he is justly guilty himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Also the ten Fundamentall Principles or Doctrines of the Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Priest-hood, here Discovered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is given forth, that all those that have wilfully, (and from pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpt on of spirit,) opposed the living truth, and the breaking-forth of light from the pure everlasting Fountain of life, may put their mouthes in the dust, and keep silence, if so be for them there may be hope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the lying Tongue will God confound, but the lipp of Truth will he establish for ever.</hi>

            <head>The <hi>Quakers</hi> House Built upon the Rocke CHRIST, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THe holy Seed which the living Father doth manifest his Life, Spirit, and Power unto in all Ages, hath been, and is, the reproach of the World, and of all them that be strangers to the life of God, and to Christs life manifest in the mortall bodies; And though this seed be that which the Father hath blessed, and hath received the truth, and by the truth is set free, (according to Christs words, <hi>John</hi> 8. 31.) yet in the world from slanderous Tongues and false accusations, we expect not to be free, but to beare his reproaches, and in the patience and power of the Lambe to overcome them, for God will bring forth our Righteousnesse, Truth, and Innocency to shine as the light before all people, whereby all hard speeches, and false reproaches will be wiped away out of the Nations: And that shall fulfill and accomplish, that which in words we declare; and in that are we known to God, and shall be known to the world. And now, seeing that it hath pleased the Father to reveale his Sonne in us, and to open the hidden treasures of his life, and hath given us of his holy Spirit, and the Tongue of the Learned, we shall not cease to improve his gift, in speaking what we know, and testifie what we have seen; both by holding forth the truth in the World. and by testifying against that in the World which is contrary to it. For now hath the living God opened the Fountain of Life abundantly, and is drying up the Fountain of words, (where the life is wanting.) And the Lord by his eternall Spirit is giving an understanding to many, whereby they are able to discern of things that differ, and to


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37375:3"/>
know every Tree by its Fruit, and to try all things by that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his light and holy spirit which he hath given them. And to that which is of God in all people doe I commit my Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to be read and understood.</p>
            <p>Now this from the meek spirit of Christ, in Answer to that which from the pride, presumption, and arrogancy of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> spirit, is come forth against the living truth it selfe, and the servants of it; but every Tongue that riseth up in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against us, will God confound. First, <hi>S. H.</hi> saith, That <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>House is built upon the Sand, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> How is it then that the Sea hath so long roared, and listed up its Waves, and the Winds hath blown, and it is not yet falne? Have not you (of all Professions) joyned together? and have not your Voyces been as the Voyce of many Waters against us? And have you not been as blustring Winds, which if we had regarded, we should not have sowne the seed of the Kingdom? (As the Prophet hath said, <hi>He that regards the Winde shall not sow,</hi> Eccl. 11. 4.) So, if we had regarded your noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, uproars, swelling words of Vanity, lyes, acensations, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, we had not been obedient to the Lord, nor done his worke. But the Lord hath made our persecutors to stumble, according to his promise; and his enemies are even <hi>weary</hi> with smiting of his children, <hi>(Ier.</hi> 9. 5.) And he is giving his power, and dominion to his anoynted ones of the whole Earth; And <hi>hath ordained his arrowes against the persecutors,</hi> Psal. 7. 13. And <hi>in the Lord shall all the Seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory,</hi> Isay 45. 25. in this the day of the Lords power, when the life of the holy Child Jesus is appearing in the dark places of the Earth, who is the Rock of Ages, and the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Generations, upon which we are built, and stand a witnesse against all the unrighteousnesse of men; the proofe of which is not because we say so; but the appearing, and breaking forth of his life, and the fruits of his holy spirit shall make it manifest: And to all these that desire the knowledge of Gods wayes, it will be known perfectly that God is amongst us, and that his spirit, power, and presence is with us.</p>

Again <hi>Sam. Hammond</hi> saith, That his Book <hi>is a discovery of the pernitious and damnable Doctrines of the</hi> Quakers. <hi>And for securing the Saints, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> A refuge of lyes will not secure the saints, (as I shall prove his Book to be:) neither can he which is in the Doctrine, which is pernitious and damnable, discover them in others, (nor to others;) as I shall prove in that which followeth, in reply to his Book.</p>
            <p>And first, to begin with his Method, which is as he saith. First, <hi>to shew the grounds of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Delusions.</hi> Secondly, <hi>to demonstrate the impossibility of salvation, in, and by their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>to answer</hi> George Whitheads <hi>cavills in his Pamphlet,</hi> as <hi>S. H.</hi> falsely calls it.</p>
            <p>First cause of Delusion.</p>
            <p>S. H. <hi>A spirit of giddinesse hanging loose to the truth, and the love of it, &amp;c.</hi> and to prove it, he saith, That <hi>there is three sorts of people that turne</hi> Quakers. The first, <hi>are unlearned, and unstable, and these are they which have been ancient Professors.</hi> The second sort, <hi>young men and women, which have been under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and awakenings of the Law, and are come to terrors and shakings, and brought into a Covenant of Works, &amp;c.</hi> The third sort, such, <hi>who for covetous ends to save their tythes, have rashly closed with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> As for a spirit of giddinesse hanging loose to the truth, that thou shalt never find in us, for we are staid and established in the Lord, and in his truth, and shall be faithfull in the truth of God which we have received, untill we see the Land clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of all Hirelings, and Deceivers, which make a Prey upon the people for dishonest gaine; for from you who pretend to be Teachers of others, is prophanesse gone forth into all the Earth; and your wayes and Doctrines have corrupted it, so that not a pure heart, nor an undefiled mind and conscience can be found in your Congregations, not one that is unreproveable in the sight of God; and Gods witnesse in you all, shall seale to the truth of my testimony. And as for those three sorts of people which thou saith turn <hi>Quakers.</hi> First, <hi>ancient Professors,</hi>


               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:37375:4"/>
these knew as much (and practised more) of things which were just and righteous (then thou dost) before they knew the life and power of truth, which now they live in, and are both learned and established in the things of God. And why doth thou accuse them <hi>for being unlearned and unstable</hi> before they turned to us, while they followed thee, and such like? Here thou proves thy own Doctrine that which doth not learn, not establish people, (and not ours:) For if they were <hi>anciest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors</hi> under that Ministery, and not <hi>learned nor established;</hi> consider where the cause was! How could they be established, where they found neither life nor power of God amongst you? But now they have found him of whom <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did Write that should come, and they doe not look for another: And now are they both learned and established in the wayes of God; And therefore doe not thou upbraid them with what they were before they received the truth in the love of it, and obedience to it. And <hi>as for the young men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of which thou saith <hi>is come to terrous, and shakings, and convictions,</hi> then they are come further then ever thou came; for they that are sensible <hi>of convictions, terrours, and shakings,</hi> wrought by the Spirit of God, they may be thy Teachers, which hath but the words of them, and art ignorant of the power by which they were wrought, and therefore thou brings forth such words of darknesse as thou hast expressed, <hi>as that thoso that follow the light of an awakened Conscience, and sit downe under that, and are under terrours, and shakings; that these are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nllod a sleep by Satan.</hi> Is not this blindnesse, and ignorance? is this <hi>according to the forme of sound words?</hi> were they nor a sleep before their Consciences were awakened? But now, when they follow the light which wakens their Consciences, (which is the light of Christ,) and when they, through the obedience to his light, doe the works of righteousnesse, is this a ground of delusion? or when they are thus led, dost thou say, they are then lulled a sleep by Satan? this is a putting darknesse for light, and light for darknesse; and in stead of shewing us to be in the ground of delusion, thou shews thy


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37375:4"/>
own ignorance and blindnesse to all that are able to discerne any thing of truth.</p>
            <p>And for the third sort, which thou saith, <hi>for covetous ends to save their Tythes, hath joyned with us;</hi> In this will all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber people, and men of understanding beare witnesse against thee, and by the effects, (even their sufferings) thou will be condemned, as hundreds of this Nation hath suffered the spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their Goods, and Imprisonment for a testimony against you, and them, which covetous men could not doe; as some, for the value of five shillings Tythes, have goods taken worth five pounds: and for three pounds worth of Tythe, goods taken worth ten pounds and for Tythes of the value of two shillings, taken ten shillings. And many I could instance which have had taken from them seven times the value, and ten times the value, and some forty times the value. And then, how is this for covetousnesse? And others here in this County of <hi>Bishopriok</hi> the Priests send their men to take peoples Lamb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The second ground of our delusion, as <hi>Samuel Hammond</hi> saith, is this.</p>
            <p>Priest. <hi>Our not being able to distinguish betwixt the rights<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse imputed upon the account of the blood of Christ; and the righteousnesse, or holinesse wrought in us by the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If this were true, this were not a ground of delusion, for God will not give any up to a reprobate sense; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them for their not being able to distinguish; for then he should condemne them for not doing that which they are nor able to doe. Here thou art ignorant of the Scriptures, and of the ground of delusion; and it being my Duty and Calling to instruct the ignorant, and him that is out of the way: I shall shew thee the grounds of delusion, according as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Scriptures, as <hi>Rom. 1. 21. Because that when they know God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankefull, but became vaine in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkned.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fooles;</hi> (as thou hast done:) And <hi>wer. 28. And even as they did not like to retaine God in their Knowledge, God gave them over to a reprohato minde, to doe those things which are not convenient.</hi> And this was not, because they were not able to distinguish; but because they did not like to retaine God in their Knowledge: And because, that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God; and by the Fruits by which they were manifest to be reprobates, Let all people of understanding judge, whether we, or thy Generation of Priests, be more guilty; and then they will know the Tree by the Fruit, as <hi>ver.</hi> 29. And as for thy charging of us, <hi>as not being able to distinguish;</hi> this is but thy false accusation; for the Lord hath given us of his spirit, whereby we are able to distinguish and discerne of things that differ; And that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse which is wrought by Jesus Christ in us, is to us a


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37375:5"/>
seale of that righteousnesse which was wrought in the Person of Christ, and of that which in his blood is imputed to us for justification. And whereas thou saith, <hi>That we confound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, and imputed Righteousnesse;</hi> that is but thy reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us. And here thou art erred from the forme of sound words; for the Scriptures doth not use these words to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of Christs righteousnesse, <hi>as inherent and imputed,</hi> though by thy meaning, that which is wrought in us by Christ, thou wilt call <hi>inherent;</hi> and that which was wrought in his Person without us, <hi>imputed:</hi> but this I say unto thee, That if thou continue ignorant of Christ, and his righteousnesse within thee, thy imputing of him, and his righteousnesse without, will not save thee: And while thou keeps people from Christ within them, and his righteousnesse within them, thou keep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> them from that mistery which the Apostle Preached amongst the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which <hi>had been hid from ages and generations; but now is made manifest to the Saints, which is Christ in them the hope of glory,</hi> (Col. 1. 26. 27) and this is your work, by your Preaching and Printing, (all of you in that Ministery) who are erred from the form of sound words (into your own imaginations) in this age, to hide the riches of the glory of this mystery from the people, <hi>which is Christ in them the hope of glory;</hi> and you would keep people in the sound of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Christ in words, and from his life, by which the saints was saved; and the life of Christ was made manifest in their <hi>mortall bodies,</hi> (2. Cor. 4. 11.) But <hi>Samuel Hammond</hi> affirmes, as his Principle or Doctrine in <hi>pag.</hi> 10. of his Book, <hi>That the Scripture sends us to the right hand of God, to Christ; not to Christ in us; Neither doe I know</hi> (saith he) <hi>any word of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that bids us goe to the light in us, though it should mean Christ in us, that is, the work of grace in us;</hi> And to prove it, he brings, <hi>Col. 3. 1. Heb.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> As I said before, it is my work and calling to instruct the ignorant, and him that is out of the way: Seeing that he saith, <hi>that he knows not any word of Scripture, that bids us goe to the light in us, though it should meane Christ in us, that is, the


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37375:6"/>
worke of grace in us.</hi> If he stand upon these very words, <hi>Goe to the light in us;</hi> neither doth the Scripture say, <hi>Goe to the right hand of God to Christ;</hi> but as it saith, <hi>that Christ is at the right hand of God, and sitteth at the right hand of God; and that they must seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth</hi> (Col. 3. 1.) so the Scripture saith likewise, <hi>that Christ is within,</hi> (Col. 1. 27.) And this was the Mystery the Apostle Preached; and the Apostle saith, <hi>Know you not that Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</hi> (2 Cor 13. 5.) and likewise he declares of the light in them, (2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6.) For God who commanded the light to shine out of darknesse, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the Knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ:</hi> so the light which shined in their hearts, did give them the light of the Knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ. And <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>that he had hid the Word in his heart; And that the Word was a lampe to his feet, and a light unto his paths,</hi> (Psal 119. 11. and <hi>ver.</hi> 105.) so here was light within, and by this light within he was guided, and by this light within they did not confound inherent and imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse (as he calls it) as he falsly accuseth us to doe. And the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> directs them to the light within, and saith, <hi>We have a more sure word of Prophesie, unto which ye doe well to take heed, as unto a light that shines in a darke place, untill the day dawne, and the day, starre arise in your hearts,</hi> (2 Pet. 1. 19) so the day was to dawne, and the day-starre to arise <hi>in</hi> their hearts.</p>
            <p>Obj. But saith the Priests, <hi>that sure Word of Prophesie was the Scriptures of the Prophets, and not a light within,</hi> because <hi>ver.</hi> 20. 21. it saith, <hi>Knowing this first, that no Prophesie of the Scriptures is of any private interpretation: For the Prophesie came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Scriptures of the Prophets is not more sure, nor more true, then the Scriptures of the Apostles; neither is the Visions of the Prophets, more sure that the Visions of the


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37375:6"/>
Apostles: Now that which the Apostle aludes to, Was the voyce which came from the excellent glory, which Voyce they heard, when they were with him in the holy Mount: so to them to whom he Wrote, the light which shined in their hearts, which brought them to waite for the day-daw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ssing was more neer, and more sure to them (though not to the Apostle) then the declaration in words, or writing, of that which others have seen or heard, though that which they have seen and heard be true as any thing that is Written: as thus, For me to be obedient to the measure of light and life that appears, and is manifest to me, is to me more a seale (or a more sure word) to take heed unto, then the words or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that proceed from a greater manifestation in another, though by this, the truth of the greater, (or surenesse of it) is not denyed by the lesser light; but wayted for that the greatest manifestation, or discovery of the Father, may be as sure, and as true to me, as to those that have declared it: He that hath an eare to heare the truth, let him heare; and he that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, let him.</p>
            <p>Now because Priest <hi>Hammond</hi> saith, <hi>that he knows not any word of Scripture, that bids us goe to the light in us, though it should mean Christ in us, that is, the worke of grace in us.</hi> Now whereas he falsly accuseth <hi>George Whithead, that he is not well read in the literall Knowledge of the Scriptures,</hi> he justly condemns himselfe: For if he were well read in the literall Knowledge of the Scriptures, he would know, that the Scripture speaks <hi>of the light within, of Christ within, and of the worke of gracs within,</hi> which he hath declared his ignorance of; but his end of so speaking, is to keep people from the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which gives the Knowledge of the glory of God, and from the Word within, and the Kingdom within, and the <hi>grace</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>in which their hearts should be established,</hi> (Heb. 13. 9.) <hi>and by grace they were saved,</hi> (Ephes. 2. 5.) <hi>and that being justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his Grace, we should be made beires according to the hope of eternall life,</hi> (Tit. 3. 7.) And the <hi>Word of Christ</hi> was <hi>to dwell in them richly in all Wisedome,</hi> from which they were

               <hi>to a imonish one another in Psalmes, and Hymnes and spirituall Songs, singing with grace in their hearts to the Lord,</hi> (Col. 3. 16.) and their <hi>speech was to be alwayes with grace, seasoned with salt, that they might know how to answer every man,</hi> (Col. 4. 6.) and all these is to be known within. And Christs Doctrine to the Pharisees was, to bring their minds to within; and told them, <hi>the Kingdom of God was within them,</hi> (Luke 17. 21.) and Christ bids them, <hi>Beleave in the light, while they have the light, that they may be the children of light,</hi> (John 12. 36.) And Jesus said unto them, <hi>I am the light of the World, he that followeth me shall not walke in darknesse, but shall have the light of life,</hi> (John 8. 12) and <hi>Iohn</hi> (a man sent from God) <hi>came for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to beare witnesse of the light, that all men through him might beleeve;</hi> and saith, <hi>this was the true light which enlightneth every man which commeth into the world;</hi> and in this light Christ bid them beleeve in, and follow. And <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>that he was sent to opes their eyes, and to turne people from the darknesse to the light, from the power of Satan unto God, that they might receive the remission of their sins, and be partakers of the inheritance among them that was sanctified,</hi> (Acts 26. 18.) and this was the Gospel which the Apostles Preached, and hereby may the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant be instructed which hath not read any word in the Scripture of light within, of Christ within, nor the worke of grace within, which I have read of all these to be within, and beleeved it.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans</hi> This is like the other, proceeding onely from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; For God will not give us up to delusions that we may be damned for that which we are not able to doe; for God doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

he will not condemne us for that; but for ahusing that power, and ability which he hath given us, to be obedient unto him in, for that he is condemned, and because that he doth not retaine God in his Knowledge, therefore he is given up to a reprobate sence, and to strong delusions. And whereas thou saith, <hi>That we cannot distinguish between the Grace of God, which is the favour of God,</hi> upon the account of Christs sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and the naturall light, <hi>which being improved,</hi> (thou saith) <hi>we call grace. Ans.</hi> Yea, We have alwayes distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed between the justifying Grace, and a naturall light, for the light of the Sunne, and of the Moon, and Starrs, is naro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; and by their light the naturall man sees the Creation, and the things in it. And we never said, that this <hi>(if improved)</hi> was the Grace, &amp; so thou falsly accuseth us. And that light which we say is within, and which Christ hath enlightened every man withall, is not to be distinguished from the favour of God; for it is the love and favour of God to man, <hi>that his free Grace,</hi> which <hi>bringeth salvation, hath appeared unto all men,</hi> (Tit. 2. 11.) and by this Grace, (and not another) are they saved, who are saved, though thou, and others, <hi>turne this grace into wanten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and then speaks despightfully against the spirit of it, and against its being within; For if people be once brought to the grace of God within, and the light within, then they will see your deceitfull Teachings without; but while you ear keep them blinde, you may Preach for Hire, and Divine for Money, and they will love to have it so: but so soon as any comes to the grace within, and the light within, then they see your wayes, and Doctrines, and receives the testimony of the Lord against you; which testimony is now going forth in the mighty power of the Lord; and God hath raysed up his Sonne, which is the light of the World, and his faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in his Children; and thousands shall come to the brightnesse of his rising, whereby you shall all be discovered who hath laboured to quench his appearance, and the breaking forth of his light, which will stand over you for ever.</p>

If he would have proved any thing against us, our Doctrine, or Principles, to be a ground of delusion, he should have proved it from our words or writings, and not from his own accusations (as by the <hi>Perfect Pharisee.)</hi> Againe, he brings our words, because that we have said, <hi>that Christ is the end of the Law for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse;</hi> therefore this proves the ground of our delusion; <hi>and that we cannot distinguish betwixt the Covenant of Grace and the Covenant of Works.</hi> Then the Apostle is proved to be in the ground of delusion, as well as we, for he said the same words, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 10 4.) and this (saith he) is the direct Popish Doctrine, who say, <hi>that Christ is the end of the Law for righteousnesse,</hi> as in the fifth <hi>page</hi> of his Book; but, saith he, they expresse it <hi>of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteousnesse,</hi> (and so calls it) <hi>because Christ works it in them.

If we say, <hi>that Christ is the end of the Law for Righteousnesse,</hi> this is not Popish Doctrine, nor ground of delusion; but both the Apostles, and we, must beare the reproaches <hi>of</hi> the World, and the conrradiction <hi>of</hi> sinners, if we beare witnesse <hi>for Christ against the World.</hi>

            <p>Pr. <hi>Our not distinguishing betwixt saving light given forth by Christ in conversion, and the light of conscience, which every man hath as a rationall Creature:</hi> and for proofe, brings <hi>the Perfect Pharisee;</hi> and saith, <hi>that will confirme it;</hi> as if his first lye would confirme his second.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans. Sam. Hammond,</hi> thou hast been too hasty in thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, to prove the grounds of our delusion; (and I cannot say in these things, that thou hast gone about in cunning devised Fables, but in such as is manifest to the least measure of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in all:) Hast thou known such a thing from any example before thee, to prove a thing against us from thy own words, without any ground from us, in thy so often mentioning the <hi>Perfect Pharisee;</hi> which is thy former reproach, to prove this latter. And truely, in those things (which are in plaine, and evident) I should not answer thee: But least that then should be wise in thy own conceit. And againe then saith, <hi>If we could but see a difference betwixt the light given by Christ as the Word,</hi> (John 1.) <hi>and the light given by Christ as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, it might help us out of some pits.</hi> Before, thou told <hi>of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing between the light of Christ in conversion, and the light of conscience:</hi> and now, <hi>betwixt the light of Christ, as the word; and as Mediator.</hi> Now all they which know Christ, and his light wherewith he hath enlightened them, as he is the Word, and as he is the Mediator; they will clearely, and perfectly see, that thou art in the pit (with thy distinctions) when as we are not in it (for want of them.) Where did the Apostles distinguish Christs light, as he is the Word? and his light as Mediator? or, how many lights did they declare that Christ had, that those that know but one light of Christ in its severall measures, and appearances of it, may know more lights? Was there other, and severall distinct lights of Christ to every severall distinct name which was put upon him, and so as many severall lights, as severall names? And where doth the Scripture speak <hi>of a naturall light, or of the light of a naturall Conscience,</hi> if it doth; declare it? or else

learne to speake in the Forme of sound words, according to the Scriptures: For we knew, that as Christ is one, so is his light, and so is his life, and so is his power, and the way to the Father; but in the world (among the Hirelings) as there is gods many, and lords many, so they make many lights; but to us there is but one God, <hi>even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> and one <hi>Lord Jesus, by whom are all things, and we by him;</hi> and one light of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which all that come unto the Father are led, and guided, and by which, all that deny him to have enlightned every man that commeth into the world, and that set up any other light besides Christ to enlighten them, or leade to the Father, is condemned: And by this light are we able to see all mens foolishnesse, and ignorance, and doe see all these pits and snares into which, through their blindnesse, they are led.</p>

                  <hi>Againe <hi>Samuel Hammond</hi> brings five Arguments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate our Principles, and Doctrines to be damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and its impossible for us to be saved, living and dying in them.</hi>
               </head>
               <item>First. <hi>Justification by Inherent Righteousnesse, a damnable Doctrine.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Second. <hi>The not owning the Imputed Righteousnesse of Christ, as the matter, and formall cause of our justification.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Third. <hi>To make our reconciliation to God to be wrought by our improving the light within, and the renewing of the Image of God in us.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Fourth <hi>To take men off from going to the fulnes of Christ at the right hand of God for teaching, and send them to look to the</hi> light within them.</item>
               <item>Fifth. <hi>The casting off all the known Ordinances of Christ.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> As to all those above mentioned, we have not holden any particular of them forth, (as our Doctrine, or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) in these words, in which he hath charged them against us. But as to the first, this we hold; <hi>that Christ is our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse: and that we are justified freely by his Grace, through Faith that is in him, and by it is made Heires, according to the hope of Eternall life,</hi> (Pit. 3. 7) <hi>and that Christ in us, is the hope of Glory; which hath been hid from Ages and Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but now is made manifest; and from that manifestation of him in us doe we witnesse him to be our Righteousnesse, Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Life from the Dead.</hi> And this is our Principle, and Doctrine which to us is saving, and not damnable; and we living and dying in this, shall never be condemned.</p>
            <p>Pr. And as to the second, where he charges us, <hi>not to own the imputed Righteousnesse of Christ as the matter and formall cause of our justification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is a false charge against us, for we never denyed


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37375:10"/>
any righteousnesse of Christ imputed unto us; neither did we ever hold forth any matter, or cause of our justification, but Christ and his Righteousnesse. But if <hi>Sam: Hammond</hi> might (in the devised words of his own wisedome) set downe <hi>Doctrines and Principles for us;</hi> then our Doctrines and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples would be damnable, and there were no possibility of salvation, living and dying in them; and so it is casie for him to set down a forme of unsound words, and then consute them, and falsly charge them upon us; and say, <hi>we hold dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Doctrine;</hi> but as we abide in him in whom we have beleeved, we shall not enter into condemnation: but every Tongue that riseth up against us, will God condemn.</p>
            <p>Pr. As to the Priests third Argument, which is, <hi>To make our reconciliation to God, to be wrought by our improving the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the renewing of the Image of God in us,</hi> which (saith he) <hi>is a damnable Doctrine,</hi> and for proofe, instances, <hi>the Perfect Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee pag.</hi> 10. 11. where <hi>A. P.</hi> hath said, <hi>Christ reconciles God and Man by the renewing of the Image of God in Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Now as to the first, we never said, <hi>that our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to God was wrought by our improving,</hi> or for our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving <hi>the light within:</hi> And as for Christ <hi>to renew the Image of God in us,</hi> that is the work that the Father hath given him to doe; and so far as the Image of God by Christ is renewed in any, so far are they reconciled to God: and this reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of the Creature to God, we never held to be, by, nor for our improving the light; neither was it by, nor for our works of righteousnesse, but by Christ, according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the Apostles testimony, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 17.) <hi>therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are past away behold, all things are become new: And all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himselfe by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministery of reconciliation. To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himselfe, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the Word of reconciliation, &amp;c.</hi> now here the Apostle doth not exclude the renewing of the Image of God, nor the new

weak Argument against us, to prove our Doctrine damnable; but rather that Doctrine is damnable, which keeps people from the light within, and so from the teachings of Christ, and from his fulnesse, and from seeing him at the right hand of the Majesty on high; and all that know Christ in any measure of his light, or have received of his fulnesse, will be a witnesse against thee in this thy Argument, to say, <hi>that turning people to the light within, is to take them off from Christs fulnesse:</hi> which is just the contrary; to bring men to it.</p>

            <p>Pr. <hi>Againe,</hi> Samuel Hammond, (in the 11. <hi>page</hi> of thy Book) <hi>thou takes the Lord to witnesse, that thou hast not any desire to passe sentence upon us.</hi>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is more properly called darkenesse, when there is not so much as the light of a Starre. Another proofe is, thou sayst, <hi>Godly Magistrates have two-lights, and so two eyes;</hi> that is, <hi>the


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37375:15"/>
light of Conscience</hi> (which is, as thou saith, <hi>pure darkenesse;) and the light of Faith (which I say, is pure light.) Ans.</hi> These two Eyes, are one contrary to the other: <hi>For light hath no fellowship with darknesse.</hi> And how can any Magistrate in this state manage justice; one of his Eyes (the evill eye) must be put out, if ever he manage justice well; for the one Eye will offend the other. <hi>And if thine Eye offend thee, plucke it out,</hi> (as Christ said) <hi>it is better to</hi> (doe justice, and) <hi>enter into the Kingdome with one Eye, then having two, to be cast into Hest fire.</hi> And this I am sure that neither Magistrate, nor any other, can enter into the Kingdome, while darknesse is his Eye: <hi>For if the Eye be evill, the whole body is full of darknesse,</hi> (as Christ said, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 23.) But if any judge for God, or doe justice for him, <hi>his Eye must be single, that his whole body may be full of light,</hi> (and fulfill Christs words,) <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 22. But we have learned better Doctrine, then to take <hi>Hammonds</hi> two Eyes for a perfect sight. And it was this Eye in him (which is grosse darknesse) with which he hath Read over our Writings, and so could not (see to) speak our own words again, because darknesse had blinded his Eye. And so all people may now see, what light this man hath, to Preach, and Print withall, or to prove damnable Doctrines by: But good is the Word of the Lord, which said, <hi>That their folly should be made manifest unto all men,</hi> as it now is in measure, and will be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>Againe,</hi> thy spirit is up against the light, and in <hi>page</hi> 18. thou sayst, <hi>what ever a man may call the light within him, if he call it, the life of Christ in him; yet if he live upon it as his righteousnesse for justification, it is a plaine Covenant of Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Here thou sets thy selfe against the light, and truth it selfe, in open and wilfull rebellion; but it is good for others, (who have formerly looked upon thee, to be a man indewed with Wisedome, and Knowledge of the Scriptures, (and now see thee so manifestly) to declare against what they speake:) for the Scriptures testifie of Christ; and saith, <hi>that


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37375:15"/>
in him is life, and the life is the light of men: and his life is manifest in the mortall bodies; and his life they live upon, and eat his flesh, and drinke his blood, or else they had no life in them; and living in his life, we are the righteousnesse of God in him; and in him are all the seed of Israel justified, and shall glory.</hi> And thou that saith, <hi>to live upon the life of Christ, is but a plaine Covenant of Works,</hi> that's blasphemy, and error! and the Lord hath made thee manifest.</p>
            <p>Pr. Another false Doctrine hath <hi>Hammond</hi> affirmed, <hi>That there are thousands in their state of darknesse, that cannot fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ, for want of light,</hi> pag. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Then, for what are they condemned? Whether are they condemned, because they cannot beleeve? or because they doe not beleeve on him whom the Father hath sent? And whether are they condemned, because they cannot follow Christ? or because they doe not follow him? Or, whether is it for want of light? or for want of obedience to the light, that men is condemned? And is it not, because they love the darkenesse, rather then light, when the light is come into the world? Is this the condemnation, that the light is not come into the world, nor given to men? or rather, is not this the condemnation, that light is come into the World, and given unto men, that every man in him might beleeve? Their loving the darknesse, rather then the light, when come, and given; Is not this the cause of condemnation? If so; then <hi>Hammonds</hi> Doctrine to thousands, is false.</p>
            <p>Againe, thou objects against <hi>G. Whitheads</hi> words, because he saith, <hi>that the light is greater then the conscience;</hi> which is true.

no example from <hi>Paul,</hi> to be so many yeares at <hi>New-easi le,</hi> and have yearely Wages above 100 li. a yeare, and yet not profit the people at all, but rather harden their hearts against the truth, and beget envy and wrath in them against the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Christ in any; so thou hast no warrant nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from the Apostle for these things; therefore make them no more a cloake for thy covetousnesse.</p>
            <p>Pr. Againe (thou brings <hi>Paul) that for the greatnesse of his Wages, the Primitive Saints layd downe their Estates at the Apostles feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> But thou, and thy brethren, may long Preach, before the people lay down their Estates at your feet; for if they did, you would spend it upon your lust, and pride; for your Gospel doth not open the hearts of people; neither can they account you worthy to partake of their carnall things, because they receive no spirituall things from you, as the Saints did from the Apostles. <hi>For that which he had received of the Lord, did he deliver unto them.</hi> But thy brethren, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the vineyard with thee, <hi>Henry Leavers, Richard Franklings,</hi> and <hi>Iosias Dockerey</hi> affirmed (upon the 21. day of the seventh Moneth) at <hi>Branspith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> castle, <hi>that they have the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and their Gospel, not from God, but from men:</hi> And to prove it, said, <hi>that</hi> Timothy <hi>received the Gospel not from God, but from man,</hi> (viz.) <hi>from</hi> Paul. Therefore, how can people lay down their Estates at your feet, which doe but deliver un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them a Gospel received from Man? For they can receive it from man, or have it from the Printer, for lesse money then they give you yearely for Wages: And they need not give every yeare the tenth part of their increase, for the Scripture and Gospel from man; for they may have it for five shillings, or lesse, which will serve for many yeares. Now the Apostle, he was worthy, and it was the least (if when he had Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered unto them spirituall things) that he did eate and drink of their carnall things; for the Gospel which he Preached, he received it not of Man, neither was he taught it; but by <hi>the Revelation of</hi> Jesus Christ; and so the people under his


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37375:17"/>
Ministery, did not spend their money for that which was not Bread, nor their labour for that which did not satisfie, as they doe under your Ministery; and therefore you must either make bargaines before-hand for your Wages; or get a Law to compell them to pay Tythes, as the complaint of many of your Priests is in this Nation, that if it were left to the freedom of people, they might starve, the hearts of people is so hard. What Gospel have you been Preaching all this while, that peoples hearts is hard yet? and that you dare not trust your Gospel, nor your Church for food and rayment; you are ashamed to all profession of godlinesse. Did ever the Ministers of the Gospel of Christ starve for want of food and rayment, where they had gathered Churches? Or for Wages, did they either goe to Law, or take mens goods by violence, as the Priests in <hi>England</hi> doe? but while they have received no Gospel from God, but from man; how should it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? so from man you have received the Gospel, and from man you have received a Law to take tythes; and so its ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gospel then <hi>Paul</hi> Preached; For he received it not from man, neither was he taught it by man; but from God, <hi>by the Revelation of Jesus Christ;</hi> but now you can no longer be hid, but are made to consesse, to the glory of God, the truth against your selves, that people may no more receive you, as sent of God, nor to have a Message from God, but from men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your consession; and your Gospel must needs be chargeable, and burthensome to people, contrary to that which the Apostle Preached.</p>

            <p>Pr.

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Oh! foolish man, thou makes it worse and worse; Is money a means to keep men from temptation?

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Now as to the first, <hi>if not from God, but from man</hi> they have received their Gospel, then it is not that which the Apostle Preached, but another; And, saith the Apostle, <hi>though we, or an Angell from Heaven, Preach any other Gospel unto you, then that which we have Preached unto you, let him be accursed,</hi> (Gal. 1. 8.) <hi>For</hi> (saith he, in the 12. verse) <hi>I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receiued it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ,</hi> so no other Gospel received in any other way, is to be received, or beleeved; for the Gospel is the power of God, as <hi>(Rom.</hi> 1. 16.) <hi>I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation, to every one that beleeveth, &amp;c.</hi> Now, to say tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they receive the power of God from man, not from God is ignorance and error; and to say that the Letter is the Gospel, is as great ignorance and error; and that Gospel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> accursed (and he that Preaches it) which is not received from God.</p>
            <p>Now as to the second:</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>That there is no knowledge of the Spirit without tho Scriptures:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If they had said, <hi>that there had been no knowledge of Scriptures without the Spirit,</hi> then they had spoken the truth, whereas now they have spoken the plaine contrary; for the Spirit gives the Knowledge of the Scriptures; but the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures gives not the Knowledge of the Spirit: and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle was of another judgement and Principle, for, saith he, <hi>the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life;</hi> and <hi>it is the spirit that quickneth,</hi> (John 6. 63.) And <hi>John</hi> said, <hi>they knew that they dwelt in God, and he in them, because he had given them of his spirit,</hi> (1 John. 4. 13.) And <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>an able Minister of the Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit, for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life,</hi> (2 Cor. 3. 6.) now those before mentioned, hath manifested, that they are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37375:21"/>
of the letter, not of the spirit, and so Preaches, that the letter must give the Knowledge of the spirit, when as the true Ministers said, That it was the spirit that gave the Knowledge of God, and of the Scriptures, as all that know God will confesse.</p>
            <p>Priests third Principle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That immediate Revelation, or Inspiration is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, nor looked for in these dayes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Then there is no Knowledge of the Father to be expected, nor looked for in these dayes, and to expect the Knowledge of God to be revealed is Diabolicall; but this is contrary to Christs words; for saith Christ, <hi>Mat. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and they that would not have us to expect to have the Father revealed unto us by the Sonne, this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a damnable Doctrine, and we cannot beleeve them; <hi>For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed things belong to us,</hi> as the Apostle said; and it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Father to reveale his Sonne in us; and it pleaseth the Sonne to reveale the Father to us; and by the Sonne we know the Father; and the Scripture testifies of those things, but doth not reveale those things unto any. And they are they which testifies of me, saith Christ, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. 39.</p>
            <p>Priests fourth Principle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That that which is contained (or Written) in the Bible, which appears visibly to the externall sences, is the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Nay; <hi>For Christ, the power of God, who is the riches of the glory of this Mistery, which was hid from Ages and Generations, which was Christ in them the hope of glory;</hi> is the Gospel which the Apostles Preached, <hi>(Col.</hi> 1. 26. 27. 28.) And the Apostle said, <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to those that are lost, whom the god of the world hath blinded their minds, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, which is the Image of God, should shine in their hearts,</hi> (2 Cor. 4. 3. 4.)

               </gap> is that flesh which Christ saith, <hi>Except ye eate my flesh, and drinke my blood, ye have no lefe in you?</hi> (John 6. 53.) And <hi>whosoever eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will rayse him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me,</hi> (John 6. 54. 45. 56. 57.) Here you have made it manifest, that the flesh of Christ you know not; you are not <hi>flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone</hi> as the Saints was, neither doe you dwell in him, nor he in you; neither have ye eternall life in you, by eating of his flesh, and drinking of his blood. But we that are in Christ, and he in us; as he liveth by the Father, so we live by him, and his flesh to us is meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and his blood is drinke indeed; and we doe witnesse his flesh to be spirituall, and not carnall, as you say, and it feeds the spirituall man, and so have eternall life abiding in us: But you that know nothing but carnall flesh, which the carnall man feeds upon; as Christ said to the Pharisees, so say I unto you, <hi>that you have not his Word abiding in you,</hi> (John 5. 38) <hi>and ye have neither heard his voyce, nor seen his shape,</hi> (ver. 37.) nor known his flesh.</p>
            <p>Priests sixth Principle.</p>

               <hi>That Christ had, and hath, a naturall carnall Body, and is in Heaven with a naturall carnall Body, and hath an humane carnall fleshly Body joyned to his Divinity, and is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with it.</hi>
