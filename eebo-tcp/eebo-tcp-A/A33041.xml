            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The violent incurſion of this ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Hoſte (compos'd of ſo many ſeverall Nations, that the different Idioms made it ſeeme a kind of Babel) found an unexpected <hi>Remora;</hi> and in very ſhort time was quite diſcomfited by a ſtrange contagious Sickneſſe that ſwept the men away by thouſands, which blaſted the Vaine hopes of the Ambitious Emperor. A certain <hi>French</hi> Gentleman that was taken Priſoner by the Spaniards, his horſe being kill'd under him, gave a notable check to his aſpiring thoughts by a witty and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Anſwer: This Priſoner being brought before the Emperor, amongſt divers other Queſtions he was askt, <hi>How many dayes journey it was from Aix</hi> to <hi>Paris?</hi> The Gentleman well perceiving the ſcope of that demand, replyed, <hi>If by Journeys your Sacred Majeſty doth meane Battels, (as in our</hi>

The gallantry of this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans anſwer in the Condition he then was, ſo pleas'd the humour of this great Prince, that he eſteem'd him much the more for it, and gave preſently order that he ſhould have all reſpectfull and honourable uſage du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>Alwaies before a furious ſtorme breaks out you ſee the Skie o're-ſpred with Vapours, the Clouds condenſe themſelves, and the raine blacken in them: Lightning precedes the thunder
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30010:16"/>
and the noiſe is heard long ere the thunderbolt falls downe. The Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of theſe great forces which the Emperour brought from <hi>Italie</hi> and the Confines of <hi>Genua,</hi> bred an extream terrour in Provence: And as Seafaring men who foreſeeing tempeſtuous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, haſten all they can to make into the Shore and bring their ſhips to ride in ſome ſafe Bay, ſo the affrighted people of Provence ſtrive to ſecure their goods and perſons within Cities, Caſtles and ſtrong holds, where they may be ſheltred from the Violence of this over-powerfull Enemy, and give teſtimony of their Valours by a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous reſiſtance; But in regard the moſt conſiderable places of that Country were too weake defences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt th' Impetuoſity of ſo fierce a Torrent, the richeſt and moſt noble families pitch't upon <hi>Avignon,</hi> (a City belonging to the Pope) which ſtanding neuter, and no way intereſſed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30010:16"/>
in the differences betwixt theſe two Monarchs, was choſen as the fitteſt and ſecureſt place of refuge for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen and Ladies, where (as in a Sanctuary) they might preſerve their honours, (dearer to ſuch then life) from the violence and Inſolency of the Souldiers: As for the men fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the dictates of true magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, they repaired all to their owne Princes Army, there in teſtimony of their Loyalty and valour to Sacrifice their blood and lives in the defence of their King and Country.</p>
            <p>'Mongſt theſe occurrences it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd that there were two of the moſt remarkable families of that Province, who by the Contagion of their too neare vicinity had contracted ſo much of the <hi>Italians</hi> diſpoſition, that they mutually inherited the hatred, as well as the poſſeſſions of their Anceſtours. But as the helpeleſſe Larks, ſpying the greedy Marlin leave off the private
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30010:17"/>
Skermiſhes, and ſeeke by ſoaring wing to procure their ſafety, and free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Pounces of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy; So at the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Imperiall Eagle upon the Ligurian ſhoare, theſe particular quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells were preſently appeas'd, theſe adverſaries trampling under feet all private grudges, to make a valiant and unanimous oppoſition againſt the publike Enemy of their King and Country. Whilſt they reſpectively execute their Kings Commands, in offices and employments ſuitable to their births and abilities, their Ladies are in <hi>Avignon,</hi> where in imitation of their husbands gallantries in this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affliction, they make a ſhew of ſo much reciprocall amity and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that by their carriage every one thought they had beene perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd, and had forgotten all former enmities; ſo crafty is that faithleſſe Sexe, that can ſo dextrouſly cover the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30010:17"/>
burning coales of their malicious pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctices under the white aſhes of ſo faire a diſſimulation; Sexe no leſſe ſubtile and addicted naturally to paint their hearts then their faces, and hide an irreconcileable hatred under the moſt ſpecious veile of ſeeming friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>But this great deſigne of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's, who aimed at nothing leſſe then conquering all <hi>France,</hi> Vaniſhed into ſmoake, as the hiſtory of thoſe times teacheth us, (to which I remit him that is more curious, to be more fully ſatisfied) this proud Peacock was enforc't to truſſe up his glorious tail: And of ſo great thunder &amp; ſtorm there remain'd nothing but dirt and water; In a word he left Provence with as much ſhame as he had gotten it with glory, like a ſtraw fire as ſoone quench'd as kindled. He being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to his owne Seate in <hi>Germany,</hi> the King having given order for repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30010:18"/>
of the breaches and ſpoiles this forraigne Army had made in his Country, and disbanded his owne, retired to <hi>Paris,</hi> his Metropolitan City, the reſidence of his Court and Center of his Kingdome: And thoſe of Provence went to repoſſeſſe their former habitations.</p>
            <p>But as theſe publike troubles had qualified for a time th' Inveterate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of theſe two families (whence I derive the proceſſe of this diſcourſe) the publike Peace reviv'd it. As the ſuppreſſing of fire in a cloſe Furnace augments the heate, and as a ſtiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running ſtreame ſwell's and redouble's it's rapidity the more it finde's oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: So this forc't retention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd their animoſity; beſides in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, Ambition and Envy, (two ſpurres of the Emulation which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly growe's 'twixt equalls) might re-enkindle this hatred upon occaſion of ſervice in the Army, where each
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30010:18"/>
Chiefe by advancing his owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſtrove to out-vie his Competitor. Inſomuch that being return'd to their owne manſions (which were not far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder) after this publike ſtorme roſe a particular one betwixt them, ſo Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent that it could not be allayed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the effuſion of much blood. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Duell, Scourge of our Nation, diſturber of our tranquillity, wherefore muſt thou deſtroy in the ſweetneſſe of a quiet Peace, thoſe whom the Sword had ſpared in the fury of a raging Warre?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Silvin</hi> and <hi>Poliecte</hi> (the two Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) deſirous by this laſt encounter to ſet a period to all their differences (which would never be compoſed by the mediation of all the friends they had) ſeek to make parties &amp; Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies on each ſide, and levy a kind of petty civil war in Provence. In the end to avoid ſhedding of much blood, they reſolv'd upon a forme of battell of ſix,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30010:19"/>
againſt ſixe, and to end all their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, by the death of the one or the other party. <hi>Silvin</hi> choſe his brother and foure of his Allies for his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants againſt <hi>Poliecte</hi> and his Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates. <hi>Poliecte</hi> had a hopefull gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to his Sonne, about twenty yeares of age, newly come from the <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> very expert on horſebacke and at his weapon and of a Courage anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his dexterity. As ſoone as this gallant heard of his Father's engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt <hi>Silvin,</hi> he would needs be of the Party; but the Father having no other Children, was ſo tender of him, that he could not be perſwaded to let him expoſe himſelfe to that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thinking that although his owne fortune might be to dye in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, his Sonne ſurviving would keepe up the name and honour of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But <hi>Laurean</hi> being youthfull and of a fiery Spirit, was enrag'd at his Fathers reſuſall, and vowed he would
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30010:19"/>
precipitate himſelfe into a thouſand deaths rather then ſuffer his Father to engage without him. <hi>Poliecte</hi> no way diſtruſted his agilitie nor his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantrie, but fear'd the tenderneſſe of his youth, of the mature vigour and experience of thoſe whom his Enemy had taken for his ſeconds. At laſt <hi>Laurean</hi> exclaimed, intreated, conjured, and ſtormed ſo much that his Father was enforc't to condeſcend to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and ſuffer him to meaſure his Sword with <hi>Fructule Silvin</hi>'s brother and ſecond.</p>
            <p>Without troubling my ſelfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe every particular of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, not to ſpeake according to the Proverbe, as a Clerke at armes; I will relate you onely the Event, which was thus. <hi>Silvin</hi> was kill'd out-right by <hi>Poliecte</hi>'s owne hand, <hi>Fructule</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and diſarmed by <hi>Laurean,</hi> two others of <hi>Silvin</hi>'s ſide ſlaine in the field, the other two put to flight: of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30010:20"/>
               <hi>Poliecte</hi>'s party, onely kept the dead Adverſaries company, another eſcap'd unhurt, but the foure others were ſo deſperately wounded, that <hi>Poliecte</hi> and his ſonne were carryed off as dead; and although the glory of winning the Field was theirs, it was a dear-bought Victory. They were carryed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignon,</hi> where their Wives yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. The one received newes of her Husbands death, with ſuch inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant skreeking and complaints, as paſſe all tearmes of expreſſion; the other was not much leſſe aggrieved, ſeeing her Husband and her Sonne in ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable a condition, that their deaths ſeem'd neerer by much then their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. <hi>Fructule</hi> was alſo brought thither, but through the loſſe of ſo much blood he had ſuch frequent <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copes,</hi> that every moment 'twas thought he would expire. <hi>Fortunate (Silvin</hi>'s wife) receiv'd her Brother-in-law in this dolefull equipage, and with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30010:20"/>
               <hi>Clione</hi> (her Husbands onely daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and heireſſe) ſo carefully ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, that within ſome daies there were evident ſignes of his recovery. <hi>Eulalie, Poliecte</hi>'s wife, was no leſſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied about her Son and husband, whoſe deſperate wounds put her in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall apprehenſion of their deaths. Her conjugall and motherly afflictions bred in her moſt inſupportable affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for her heart being equally ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and bearing a ſhare in both their ſufferings, could no way condeſcend to the looſing of either of thoſe ſo neerely and ſo dearely beloved per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But the Heavens not willing to keepe her ſoule any longer ſuſpended betwixt theſe two Idols determined to take one of them: Both were ſo neare death, that 'twas thought, one while the Father, another while the Sonne would leade the way; theſe ſad uncertainties gave ſtrange convulſions to the dolefull heart of <hi>Eulalie.</hi> At laſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30010:21"/>
               <hi>Poliecte,</hi> who was more perplex't for his Son then for himſelfe, obtain'd at length what oft he had deſired, which was, that by the ſhortning of his dayes his Son's might be prolonged. So he deceaſed after long languiſhing and many pangs which his patience and true repentance made very inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to the expiation of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
            <p>His death was conceal'd from <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> as much as might be, leſt that ſorrow added to the extreame anguiſh of his wounds ſhould cut in ſunder the weake ſpun thread of ſo fraile a life; as ſoon as there appear'd ſome ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of health in him, and that the Conſolidation of his wounds gave hopes of his recovery, I know not how the loſſe of his Father came unto his knowledge, but whether through the motives of his owne good diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the great affection he bare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him that gave him his being in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30010:21"/>
this world, or the ſuddainneſſe of the griefe which ſeized him unprepar'd, or whether as yet not throughly having gathered ſtrength, but ſtill languiſhing with paine, his heart was inſufficient to reſiſt ſo violent an aſſault, this news ſo ſtrongly wrought upon his fancy, that falling into a continuall feaver with extravagant ravings, he was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes'd with a melancholly Imagination that he was dead himſelfe. Theſe kinds of diſeaſes which trouble and pervert the ſenſe and Judgement are the Phyſitians croſſes, and which they hold the leaſt incurable of any; for what remedies can be applyed to one that eſteemes all medicines uſeleſſe, or out of a wilfull obſtinacy refuſeth to take any? This or worſe was poore <hi>Laurean</hi>'s condition, none could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to take any kind of nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaying that dead Bodies did not eate, and that it was ridiculous, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature to take any victualls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30010:22"/>
preſcriptions of the Phyſitians, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of Religious men, nor the inceſſant teares of the bewailing Mother, could prevaile any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his opiniative obſtinacy, untill one of his owne Servants extremely perplex't at his Maſters malady, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelfe of an ingenious Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, which proved no leſſe profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then pleaſing. He knew that men tainted with ſuch Hypochondriake diſeaſes, are ſooner cur'd by conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to their humours, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting them; for croſſing them doth but imprint their folly deeper in the braine, which nothing but ſome witty querk of invention can deraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: ſo faining himſelfe dead, he was lay'd upon a bed in <hi>Laurean</hi>'s ſight, and there taking ſuch meat as was brought to him, at laſt bred an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite in his Maſter, who reſolv'd, to imitate the dead man, and eate as he did. By this means, by little and little,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30010:22"/>
his braines began to ſettle, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably as he recovered ſtrength of body, thoſe melancholly Vapours diſperſed themſelves, which obfuſcated his imagination, and his youthfulneſſe added to the cure, and remedies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to him, called him back from Deaths dore to the hope of a happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and in ſhort time his wounds being throughly heal'd, he re-enjoyed as perfect health as ever. But as all worldly pleaſures ſeldome are entire, he ſcarce had left off mourning for his Father, but he was re-obliged to the like ſadneſſe, both of heart and habit, for the deceaſe of <hi>Eulalie,</hi> who quite overcome with ſorrow for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands death, and the continuall feares ſhe was in for her Sonne, fell into a lingring diſeaſe, which conſuming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly her ſpirits, enforc'd her at laſt to follow her ſo much beloved <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecte,</hi> leaving <hi>Laurean</hi> the moſt diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate man living.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:30010:23"/>Now let us ſee what paſſeth in the Adverſary <hi>Silvin</hi>'s family, where mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſſe Death ſweeping all before him, makes dolefull evidences of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuleable puiſſance, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the coldneſſe of his aſhes is not of force enough to extinguiſh the coales of their implacable anger; their hatred paſſeth the grave, which in my judgment is too large an extent, and ought to be the utmoſt point, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of any malice ſhould reach unto. <hi>Fortunate</hi> not being able to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in the wounds (which the griefe for <hi>Silvin</hi>'s loſſe had cauſed) the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of any Conſolation, never conſidering that the Combate where 'twas his chance to fall, was fairly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed without any treachery; and that <hi>Poliecte</hi> himſelfe, though not kill'd in the field, was ſince dead of the wounds her husband gave him, and that <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> had eſcaped no better then <hi>Fructule:</hi> Incens'd with furious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30010:23"/>
of revenge, breathes nothing in the eares and heart of <hi>Clione</hi> but a deſire to procure the death of <hi>Laurean.</hi> Moſt wicked woman who not ſatisfied with ſo much blood as is already ſpilt; wilt thou yet bathe thy ſelfe in his, whom the Heavens had preſerved from ſo many dangers? Shee would faine perſwade her brother-in-law <hi>Fructule</hi> to fight againe with <hi>Laurean,</hi> but he not ignorant of the lawes of armes, retain'd himſelfe within the tearmes of his profeſſion, expecting ſome other occaſion to ſatiate the irreconcileable hatred he bare <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecte</hi>'s heire. At laſt Death ſent his Summons to <hi>Fortunate</hi> by an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable meſſenger, a burning Feaver, yet the violence of her diſeaſe could not make her heart relent, nor renounce her unworthy deſire of Vengeance; but ſhe bound her daughter with this execrable Oath, never to marry any man, but ſuch as ſhould firſt bring
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30010:24"/>
her <hi>Laurean</hi>'s head, as a ſacrifice to her Father's Ghoſt. Whether ſhe dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abſolutely in this minde or not I cannot ſay, but I'le aſſure you after her death, <hi>Clione</hi> kept but too ſeverely the promiſe ſhe had made her Mother, although it be rather an act of irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then of piety to obſerve ſo ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded engagements.</p>
            <p>Being now her Uncle <hi>Fructule</hi>'s ward her beauty, which was tranſcendent, &amp; the noiſe of her great riches, made her the mark that the ambition of the moſt conſiderable perſons of that Province aymed at. But ſhe's a ſecond <hi>Atalanta,</hi> her love cannot be purchaſed without the hazard of the ſuitors life, ſhe makes her ſelf the price of <hi>Laureans</hi> head, ſo deeply her Father's death, &amp; the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing perſwaſions of her dying Mother, had engraved in her heart the hatred of this innocent gentleman. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ill intents have bad events, and ſad repentance followes for the moſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30010:24"/>
part all unadviſed enterpriſes; Foure of the moſt eager aſpirers to the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this golden fleece, one after the other receiv'd a due chaſtiſement for their temerity. The firſt remained a Cripple all his life, bearing in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity a perpetuall marke of <hi>Laure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s Valour, the ſecond was kill'd in the field, the third delivered ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully his armes, and the fourth had ſerv'd as a trophy to <hi>Laureans</hi> gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, if friends comming in had not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated them, and raviſhed this palme from our Champion.</p>
            <p>In meane time, as the ſame waters of the deluge which over-flowed the world, raiſed the Arke to the very Heavens, ſo the ſame meanes which <hi>Clione</hi> had invented to deſtroy her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, were to him as ſteps and degrees of Glory: For 'tis incredible how much the ſucceſſe of theſe combats increaſed his reputation; and although the act in it ſelfe was not commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30010:25"/>
yet the cauſe (in regard he aymed at nothing but his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) ſeem'd ſo juſt, that his praiſes were trumpeted out by the very mouths of thoſe that were jealous and envious at his honour. Seeing he was the onely object of <hi>Clione</hi>'s inveterate hatred, and that like <hi>Hydra'es</hi> heads, the defeating of his Adverſaries begat him freſh Encounters: his friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him often to abſent himſelfe from Provence, and go to the Court, where the Kings preſence might be a meanes to hinder the no leſſe frequent then inſolent provocations of <hi>Clione</hi>'s franticke Lovers. But he was ſo farre from conſenting to theſe perſwaſions, that he ſlighted and rejected them as frivolous, and contrary to his honour and courage, fancying (like the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian King) that no man was ſtronger, or better then himſelfe as long as he could hold his Sword. And indeed this inflexible magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30010:25"/>
ſcorning the dangers he was like to fall into every moment, made his Valour ſo cryed up through the whole Country, that the moſt inconſiderate and ſtouteſt of <hi>Clione</hi>'s Suitors became more moderate, and learned at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of other mens ſad fates to ſeeke the enjoyment of her, without inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſing themſelves in the Vindication of her unjuſt paſſions.</p>
            <p>In ſhort time ſhe found no body would love her, nor that would hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to her when ſhe offered her ſelfe, as the price and recompence of a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wives purchaſed with bloud are not uſually beloved: It being a thing not ordinary to take a Wife pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to put ones life in hazard, but rather to preſerve it, for the generation of hopefull Succeſſours. So that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt all her hopes on that ſide, finding no body that to obtaine her favour would coap with the Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Laurean,</hi> ſhe fell into a profound
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30010:26"/>
melancholly, which made her take the moſt extravagant and furious reſolution that could be imagined. She determines to execute her deſigne with her owne hand, but knowing how redoubtable <hi>Laurean</hi>'s vigour was, and that naturall weakeneſſe of her ſexe was incapable to reſiſt the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his invincible fury, ſhe ſtudies how to compaſſe by ſubtilty that which ſhe deſpair'd by ſtrength of armes to accompliſh. After long ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and muſing which way to effect her intention, ſhe reſolves to tranſveſt her ſelfe, and getting into <hi>Laurean</hi>'s Service, to watch her opportunity to murder him; but ſhe ſuddainly recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that enterpriſe, conſidering how ſhrmefull a thing t'would be for a young Lady of her quality, to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone disguiſed in that manner, and to how many ill cenſures ſhe ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her honour by ſo extravagant and unadviſed an action; beſides ſhe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30010:26"/>
thought it almoſtimpoſſible to procure a Maid of confidence and courage enough to follow her, in ſo hazardous an attempt. Yet Heaven which had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the event, far different from her intention, ſuffered her not to remain long in this perplexity, by putting into her hands a bold <hi>Virago,</hi> who like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sara</hi> offered her ſelfe to wait upon this couragious <hi>Judith</hi> in her perilous deſigne, and to put in execution what Commands ſoever ſhe would lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her; But then preſently ſhe found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother difficulty of no leſſe conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce then the former, which was, how they ſhould get out of their houſe, and retire the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves awhile out of the ſight of <hi>Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctule</hi> her Unkle &amp; gardian, who watcht her with no leſſe Vigilancy then the reſtleſſe Dragon that had in keeping the apples of the Heſperian garden. But t'is in vaine to ſtrive to prevent a woman that is wilfully reſolved, the inventions they have to precipitate

               <hi>Clione</hi> faines her ſelfe much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with thoſe obſtructions which alter the Complection of ſo ful-blown roſes in a Virgins cheekes, and throw downe the freſh colours of the maiden bluſh, placing in their ſtead the pale enſignes of the Lilly: And having well greaſed her Doctours hand to preſcribe in her Uncle's hearing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which ſhe deſir'd, he ordered her to goe to the Baths and drinke the water of <hi>Baquieres,</hi> which are in <hi>Bigorre,</hi> a Province of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> at the foote of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> mountains. <hi>Fructule</hi> condeſcends to the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this journey, which ſhe ſo much deſired, and the Phyſitian af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed was neceſſary for her health. Amongſt other lands and houſes which ſhe inherited by her Parents deceaſe, there was one in low <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:30010:27"/>
juſt in her way where ſhe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put in practice her Stratagem. She had to attend her two men and two maid Servants, whereof her faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Melicerte</hi> was one. They were no ſooner come to this houſe in low <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi> but <hi>Clione</hi> counterfeited her ſelfe ſo ſick, and ſo ſtopped with theſe opilations, that reſolving to ſtay there till ſhe could procure ſome remedy for this diſeaſe, (which ſhe ſo cunningly diſſembled, that the moſt curious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervours might have beene deceived) ſhe ſent back her Uncle's two men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving onely her maids about her, which with the helpe of her Farmer's family ſhe judged ſufficient for her preſent Service. Now ſhe is farre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough out of <hi>Fructule</hi>'s ſight, <hi>Melicer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> is onely privy to her enterpriſe: as for the other maide, ſhe eaſily found ſeeming pretexts enough to turne her away, and the good honeſt Farmer is ſatisfied with any thing ſhee's pleas'd
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30010:28"/>
to tell him. By this meanes ſhe ſee's her ſelfe in a full liberty of executing her extravagant purpoſes. She cauſeth to be bought her two horſes with good weapons, two mens cloathing for her ſelfe and <hi>Melicerte,</hi> and having cut their haire (a ſtrange reſolution) and fitted themſelves to their minds, they rode towards <hi>Laurean</hi>'s houſe.</p>
            <p>Being lodged in a neighbouring Village, <hi>Clione,</hi> under the name of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> and <hi>Melicerte</hi> calling her ſelfe <hi>Nartal,</hi> they gave out that they were <hi>Languedochian</hi> youths that wanted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: ſince they have now taken the names and habits of men, we will ſpeake of them whilſt they continue thus, as of men, their enterpriſe being bloudy and Martiall. In ſhort time they inſinuate themſelves into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of ſome of <hi>Laurean</hi>'s fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, 'mongſt whom they learn't that their Maſter was a great lover of muſick, finding it the onely ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30010:28"/>
and Charme to divert the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy his generous minde was afflicted with, ſeeing himſelfe the onely object of the malicious practiſes of ſuch implacable Enemies. <hi>Florent</hi> could Sing ſo exquiſitely to the Lute, that his voice ſeemed to declare no leſſe than an exact agreement betwixt the vocall and inſtrumentall Muſick, thereby charming the rocks into ſuch a poſture, as if they had danced mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to that Harmony. <hi>Nartal</hi> had no ſuch pleaſing Voice, but he had ſo excellent a hand upon the Virginalls, that joyn'd in concert with the Lute, and <hi>Florents</hi> admirable Voice made ſo Harmonious a melody, that it ſweetly ſtole out at the Ears the Soules of all the hearers. Theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly deceitfull allurements, our <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes</hi> make the prologue of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable tragedy they intended againſt this innocent <hi>Uliſſes.</hi> At laſt ſome of his Servants that had heard them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30010:29"/>
them to <hi>Laurean,</hi> whoſe eares being infinitely raviſh'd with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Harmony, and his eyes no leſſe taken with their winning counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and demeanure: he conjured them to make his houſe their lodging, aſſuring them to treat them like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of noble Extraction, (as he dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them to be) and that they ſhould command all he had as freely as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The cunning Females perceiving with what impernoſity their prey caſt himſelf into the ſnares they had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him, made many ſeeming excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; refuſals of his Civility, although they deſired nothing more than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine there; but that was meerly to engage <hi>Laurean</hi> into deeper Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to cover their ſtaying with the colour of conſtraint. At laſt (like <hi>Hellen</hi>) they were forc'd with their own conſents. <hi>Laurean</hi> gives them honourable entertainment, Feaſts them in the higheſt manner he can,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30010:29"/>
knowing how fantaſticall Muſicians naturally are; and how hard it is to hold theſe <hi>Protheuſes</hi> which change places and humours as often as they vary their tunes and notes.</p>
            <p>Oh the Admirable effect of Civility and courteſie! which wrought ſo powerfully upon <hi>Florent</hi>'s diſpoſition, that preſently it chang'd his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His heart like Lead melts all at once, and love takes full poſſeſſion of that breſt, where a mortall and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable hatred had ſo long kept his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>Laurean</hi> is ſo ready in doing <hi>Florent</hi> all obliging and civill offices, that his heart muſt have beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of Steel or Marble if it had not relented at ſuch evident teſtimonies of affection: And <hi>Florent</hi> being of no rocky ſubſtance, nor compos'd of any other inſenſible matter, remarked ſo much grace and Comelineſſe in <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi>'s perſon, ſuch pleaſing diſcourſe and ſo winning behaviour, that by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30010:30"/>
little and little his perfections made a moſt ardent impreſſion in the heart of this <hi>Virago.</hi> Who can but admire this change? ſhe that came purpoſely to ſurpriſe, is her ſelf ſurpriſed, and wounded to the heart; ſhe is become a friend, nay a paſſionate Lover, that went out a Capitall Enemy, and with the moſt felonious and deteſtable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that the malice of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taleſt and moſt inveterate hatred ever could ſuggeſt. What various thoughts now agitate her diſquiet mind? What pleaſure now ſhe takes in the preſence and Converſation with <hi>Laurean?</hi> Now if ſhe could perſwade her ſelfe that <hi>Laurean</hi> would ever beare as much love to <hi>Clione,</hi> as he makes ſhew of inclination to <hi>Florent,</hi> ſhe ſhould eſteeme her felicity a degree beyond infinite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nartal</hi> obſerving his Companion very penſive and Melancholly, thought that the apprehenſion of the danger,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30010:30"/>
and the difficulty of atchieving their enterpriſe, had beene the occaſion of his diſcontent: But how much was he miſtaken in his conjecture, ſince <hi>Florent</hi> now deſires as vehemently the preſervation of <hi>Laurean</hi>'s life, as formerly he had thirſted after his death. <hi>Nartal</hi> endeavoureth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him to purſue their deſigne, perſwading him that thoſe teſtimonies of affection which <hi>Laurean</hi> ſhewed them, would be a meanes for them to accompliſh with more facility their intention; too much Confidence opening the gates to perfidious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, as much as miſtruſt is Mother of ſecurity. But how much did he finde <hi>Florents</hi> Courage and reſolution altered, and what amazement ſeiz'd him when he heard expreſſions of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection proceed from the ſame mouth that had uttered ſo many menaces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Laurean,</hi> whilſt the heart which gave her tongue it's motion

was fraught with ſo much gall and rancour.</p>
            <p>Having reſolv'd with my ſelfe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandone all that might breed tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in my hiſtories, I cannot without countervening my reſolution now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the ſeverall diſcourſes upon this occaſion betwixt theſe two diſguiſed damſels. In the upſhot <hi>Clione</hi> that had not been aſhamed to diſcover to <hi>Melicerte</hi> to what extremity her rage and malice againſt <hi>Laurean</hi> had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported her, thought it no diſhonour to confeſſe the new flame his merits had kindled in her breaſt. This Confeſſion much ſatisfied <hi>Melicerte</hi>'s curioſity, though ſhe diſſembled it as much as might be, and fed <hi>Clione</hi> with hopes of terminating their deſigne with Joy and Contentment, notwithſtanding ſo difficult and knotty a beginning. But a buſineſſe of this intricacy could not be ſo eaſily diſembroil'd. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of honour retaine <hi>Clione</hi> from
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30010:32"/>
making her ſelfe knowne to <hi>Laurean,</hi> but much more forbad her to diſcover the extreame paſſion wherewith her heart was inflamed for him. On th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, he, whether through a ſecret inſtinct of nature, more forcible then any artificiall diſguiſements, or by the ſweetneſſe of <hi>Florents</hi> behaviour and Muſicall charmes, or by any other private motive, he knew not what, he could not without great reſentment abſent himſelfe from the company of theſe new gueſts, and when the night conſtrained him to retire into his Chamber, and called them to theirs, It was but to ſpin out the howers inſtead of ſleeping in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ravings, which ſtill began againe when he did thinke to end them, loſing himſelfe in a Labyrinth of reſtleſſe Imaginations. Who ever ſaw a blinde Creature in Love with a thing he never ſaw, and paſſionately ſeeking after that he loves without knowing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30010:33"/>
what it is: Such is the diſquietneſſe of <hi>Laurean</hi>'s troubled minde, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently deſiring he knowes not what, and ſuffering ſtrange effects, whoſe cauſe he was not able to for penetrate. Weake is the force of art againſt the inſtinct of Nature, <hi>Florent</hi>'s perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons diſplay their attractive power through the Shadowes of all theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall diſguiſes.</p>
            <p>It's true, 'twas no ſmall <hi>Alarum</hi> which Love gave to <hi>Clione</hi>'s heart, where triumphing like a Victorious Generall, he put all other paſſions to the route, and made a ſtrange diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in her breſt. But <hi>Laurean</hi>'s diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is farre greater, feeling ſometimes much pleaſure in his paſſion, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tormented with Dolours unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſable, being inclin'd to love an object which he could not enjoy in the manner he did deſire. How oft did he accuſe Nature of miſtaking, in placing in the body of a man (as he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30010:33"/>
thought <hi>Florent</hi> to be) beauty and qualities that ſeemed much more Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to a Lady; for the lineaments of his face were in his eye ſo exquiſite, his complexion ſo delicate, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſo quainte, his Voyce ſo femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine, his geſtures ſo comely, and all his actions ſo little ſavouring of any Martiall breeding, that he was much perplex't to finde ſuch rare perfections in a perſon whom the Divine lawes, as well as thoſe of Nature, forbade him to love with that horrible luſt which ſo much defameth th'Orientall cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, but never ſo much as entreth into the thoughts of the Septentrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls. How much did it torment him to withdraw his eyes from an object which was ſo pleaſing that he could never ſatisfie himſelfe with looking upon it, and yet could not contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate it without a Crime? had he lived in the age of the Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, how would he have importun'd
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30010:34"/>
the Heavens to have made one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſire? Amongſt many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars that paſſed whilſt <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> and <hi>Nartal</hi> remained in <hi>Laurean</hi>'s houſe: I will only relate two or three, which ſeeme no leſſe remarkable than delightfull.</p>
            <p>One day, as they were diſcourſing of the Combates, which this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had fought againſt thoſe, that through the inſtigations of <hi>Clione</hi> had challeng'd him; there was one of the Company that fell into high Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Cruelty and Malice of that Lady, reviling her with the tearms of a Viper, a Fury, and a Fell-ſavage Beaſt; wiſhing her out of the world, that <hi>Laurean</hi>'s life might be ſecured from ſo many dangers, to which her irreconcileable hatred dayly expoſed him. For in effect, every moment he expected ſuch kind of Meſſages; and every time any one knockt at his Gates he fancyed himſelf to be in one
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30010:34"/>
of thoſe enchanted Caſtles of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romans, where thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained muſt alwayes be ready arm'd, and in a poſture to anſwer ſome new Challenge: But <hi>Laurean</hi> not ſuffering him to proceed in ſuch Violent rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt a Lady that he eſteemed full of Honor. You blame her (ſays he) for her hatred to me, and do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it proceeds from the extream love ſhe beares to the memory of her Parents. Her Mother dying, made her ſwear my Ruine, as <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> made <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Amilcar,</hi> his Children, ſwear the deſtruction of the Romans, and make a ſolemne Vow upon the Altars never to be reconciled to them. And in this ſhe doth an act both of Honour and Piety in ſo ſeverely keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Oath and Promiſe. Beſides, according to the Lawes and Maximes of the world, who knowes not that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is held a point of Courage and Magnanimity? If ſhe be poſſeſſed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30010:35"/>
with this Errour, ſhe doth but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſtreame of the generall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which tranſports oft times the moſt diſcreet, and conſiderate perſons: Moreover, ſhe takes me (if not for her Father's murtherer) at leaſt for the Son of him that kill'd him; and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect how can ſhe but abhor me? and why ſhould not ſhe endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of life whom ſhe looks on as her Fathers Homicide? It is true, I could object many very lawfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, in regard the Battell was fought according to the Lawes of Armes without Treachery; and that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſince deceaſed of the wounds which he received from hers: that my hands were not otherwiſe dipped in her Fathers blood, but in the juſt defence of my own Fathers cauſe and quarrel; and that I my ſelf was brought off the Field with more probability of Death than Life. But a heart poſſeſs'd with prejudice, and ulcerated with an incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30010:35"/>
paſſion can admit of no reaſon, though never ſo juſt; if the light of Truth and Equity could but once pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the breſt of this faire Enemy, with it's reſplendent rayes, and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the miſty clouds of this ſavage and inhumane Opinion which ſhe hath conceiv'd againſt me, I am confident it would abate her fury, and that ſhe would acknowledge me to be more ready to honour, and ſerve Ladyes of her quality and merits than ſhee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines. I have had the thought a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times to write her this reſentment of my Soul, (that being the onely meanes I had to accoſt her) for my ſight I know is moſt odious to her: But a vaine ſhadow of honour ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained me, fearing leſt ſhe ſhould make trophyes of my Letters; and that ſome indiſcreet readers might believe that the apprehenſion of Death had dictated them to me, ſeeing my ſelfe daily attack't with freſh Combatants;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30010:36"/>
and no ſooner cured of my firſt wounds, but enforc'd to hazard the opening them again in a ſecond Duel. Indeed had I but one Enemy to deal with, in a moment our difference would be ended by the death of one, or other, but I muſt Encounter as many as the Beauty of my dear Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (which charmes even thoſe that have the leaſt inclination to love) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth every day. I believe really, that nothing but death can releaſe me from this miſery; It being impoſſible but that <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelf muſt at laſt fall under ſo many Adverſaries. But beſides the comfort I have from the goodneſſe of my Cauſe, (which is but a juſt defence) ſo that I die honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, without any ſtaine to my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am ſatisfied. Happy beyond my deſerts if this faire Enemy having ſacrific'd me to her Vengeance by the hand of ſome new Lover, may one day acknowldge her Errour, and how
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30010:36"/>
ſhe had ſhortned the dayes of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Honour, that ambitioned nothing more than to be her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
            <p>Theſe laſt words pronounc'd ſo feelingly, and with ſuch a grace, as was enough to have made the very rocks ſenſible of a relenting diſpoſition, ſtruck <hi>Florent</hi>'s heart with ſuch ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, that the blood ſtarted out of his eyes, and the teares trickling like Pearles of dew amongſt the Roſes of his cheeks, augmented much that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which <hi>Laurean</hi> contemplated but with too much attention. Perceiving his teares, What, <hi>Florent,</hi> (ſaid he) is it the default of my courage that breeds this effect of pitty in you? No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no, doe not thinke, though I am called every day to Death's doore, that I will ever abate the leaſt punctillio of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which is ſo hereditary to my Family: Rather bewaile the miſ-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of thoſe, that through <hi>Clione</hi>'s
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30010:37"/>
meanes have fallen by my Victorious hand. So unworthy a diffidence (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Florent</hi>) never entered into my thought, the proofes that you have given of your Valour in ſo many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions are ſo publicke, that he muſt be a great ſtranger in this Province that is ignorant of them; I am onely ſorry that ſuch eminent vertues ſhould be ſo unjuſtly expoſed to the Cruelty of a barbarous Maid, who cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve (for ſo many unworthy actions) that you ſhould eſteeme ſo highly of her as you have expreſt: And I believe if ſhe knew your true worth, ſhe would change her animoſity into affection, whereby you might gather the roſes of friendſhip in the ſame plot, that produced you the thornes of hatred. But that which forceth me to ſhed theſe teares, is the Sorrow that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth me to ſee ſo generous and ſpotleſſe a life expoſed to ſo many deaths, and to ſuch a Continued ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30010:37"/>
of tragicall adventures. Would to God that I were able with the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my blood to ſecure you from theſe troubles, or worthy to receive ſo much honour from you as to goe a ſharer with you in your dangers, for I ſhall never eſteeme my life better employed then when it is expos'd to doe you ſervice. Theſe complements iſſued ſo gracefully out of that ſweet mouth, that <hi>Laurean</hi> melting with ſuch enchanting language, had much adoe to refraine from teares, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe himſelfe in tearmes ſuitable to his paſſion.</p>
            <p>It chanc'd at that ſame time that <hi>Laurean</hi> was viſited in his houſe by a kinſwoman (whoſe name was <hi>Octavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane</hi>) daughter to one of <hi>Poliecte</hi>'s Siſters, and whoſe Father had beene engaged in the long quarrell betwixt <hi>Silvin</hi> and <hi>Poliecte,</hi> whoſe cauſe (for the mothers ſake) he ſtrove to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and juſtifie. This Lady hearing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30010:38"/>
of her kinſman's ſad condition, being every day in danger of his life through the provocations of <hi>Clione</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, ful of a Courage not ordinary in her Sex, and animated with a ſtrange <hi>Rodomontado</hi> like diſpoſition, came purpoſely to break to him the deſigne ſhe had to challenge <hi>Clione</hi> to fight with her, and ſo with each of them a dagger to revenge upon one another their Father's Deaths. An heroick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for a maide, had not deſpaire beene the principall motive to it. <hi>Laurean</hi> received her with the greateſt teſtimonies of reſpect, friendſhip and Courteſie, that could be ſhewed to ſo neere a kinſwoman, and ſo gallant a Lady. But when ſhe diſcovered her deſigne (although he admired her <hi>Amazonian</hi> Courage) he could not hold from laughing to ſee how vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the deſire of revenge was in a Sex of ſo much imbecility, like fire that flames with ſo much violence when
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:30010:38"/>
it meets with any light and combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble materiall. Thence he took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to excuſe within himſelf <hi>Clione's</hi> fury, who uſed all means poſſible to be reveng'd of him by her Lovers; ſince <hi>Octaviane</hi> would expoſe her owne life to ſo extream, and almoſt inevitable danger to ſeek ſatisfaction for her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death. Oh could he have pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the ſecret of darkneſſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <hi>Florents</hi> diſguiſe, he would eaſily have perceived that <hi>Clione's</hi> ſpirit was enrag'd with no leſſe fury againſt <hi>Octaviane!</hi> He abſolutely diſapproves of his kinſwoman's propoſition, telling her it was not onely a furious raſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and contrary to all reaſon, but impoſſible to be effected; and that comming to the knowledge of the world, it would make her the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-talk of all <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octaviane</hi> much diſtaſted would not bate one Ace however of her reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and what ſhe had communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30010:39"/>
to him in private, ſhe ſpared not to ſpeak openly, and in <hi>Florent's</hi> owne hearing (whom ſhe did not take to be <hi>Clione</hi>) which ſtruck this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed Damſell ſo to the heart, that her Face became like a Rain-bow for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Colours; and you may well think her ſpirit was agitated with no leſſe diverſity of thoughts. Her heart working like the troubled Sea, one while ſhe reſolved to accept <hi>Octavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane's</hi> defiance, and engage, that <hi>Clione</hi> ſhould meet her; then the fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering her ſelf enforc'd her to bridle that impetuoſity. But that which ſtretch'd the pin of <hi>Florent's</hi> patience to the uttermoſt, was, to hear <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viane</hi> in a Raunting manner ſay, <hi>I have no leſſe Noble blood in me, nor am I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in Eſtate to that inexorable murthereſſe; and if my Lovers flatter me not, nor my owne Glaſſe deceive me, I think Nature hath been no leſſe favourable to me than her: I have</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:30010:39"/>
               <hi>Suitours as well as ſhe, who all make me the higheſt proteſtations that may be. Were I as cruelly minded as that barbarous Imp; or had I as little pity upon thoſe that make Love to me, I could impoſe the ſame Law upon them, and enjoyne them to fight with thoſe that ſhe employes to revenge her Father's death upon a man that's no way guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. But rather then to be the cauſe of ſo much Blood-ſhed, I will En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter her my ſelfe with a Poniard, and make a paſſage with my Blade for that Black Soule to ſally out of her cankered Breſt.</hi> Here <hi>Florent</hi> was fain to ſuppreſſe his Choller with both hands, and ſtrive to keep himſelfe within the bounds of modeſty; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of reſpect of his owne Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and partly out of hope to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe, by effects, the inſolency of thoſe outragious words. And indeed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a very little time, fortune gave him fit opportunity to accompliſh that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30010:40"/>
deſire; for <hi>Octaviane</hi> having heard him ſinge and joyne his voyce to the raviſhing accords of his Lute and <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls</hi> Virginalls, ſhe was ſo enchanted with that delicate voyce iſſuing from a face all of flowers, a mouth of pearle and Corall, and a breath of amber, in an inſtant ſhe loſt the knowledge of her ſelfe, and giving way to this new flame, ſhe became all ice to her old Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Florent</hi> not ignorant of the paſſions that her Sex was ſubject to, ſuddainly perceived by <hi>Octaviane</hi>'s lookes, ſighes, and carriage, that the glances of his beautifull eyes had made no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary impreſſion in her heart; deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to make this love an inſtrument of the hatred he bare her, for her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective language againſt <hi>Clione,</hi> he adds fewell to this new fire by fained demonſtrations of a reciprocal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and augments with high hopes of fruition the deſires of this imprudent
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30010:40"/>
Damſell, like Faulconers and Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that never preſent their baits to the unwary birds or fiſhes, but to take them and deprive them both of life and liberty. You may imagine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Octaviane</hi> bit greedily at that baite, Nature enclining us to believe eaſily what we deſire. It is not my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to deſcribe the particulars of this affection, no leſſe ſincere and ardent on <hi>Octaviane</hi>'s part, then cunningly diſſembled by <hi>Florent.</hi> In meane time doe not you admire the ſeverall parts which Love doth act in humane breſts, and are you not amaz'd at theſe ſtrange intricacies? Seeing at once two Enemies infinitely enamour'd of each other, and two Lovers mortall Enemies: And each of the three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Actours in this ſcene, (<hi>Clione, Laurean</hi> and <hi>Octaviane</hi>) were in love with what they hated, and hated what they lov'd. Who would not ſay that all this were inchantment, were it not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30010:41"/>
apparent that <hi>Florent</hi>'s attractive beauty and diſguiſe were the origine and cauſe of theſe charmes. Meane time while the Spirits of theſe three Lovers are thus incumbred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in this Labyrinth of confuſions, arrives a new ſubject of diſorder, which will produce many different effects of paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montdor</hi> a young Gentleman of the County <hi>Venaiſsin,</hi> having liſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe amongſt the Suitours of our <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelope</hi> (I meane <hi>Clione</hi>) in her abſence makes his addreſſes to <hi>Fructule</hi> her Uncle and gardian, demanding his conſent. He (knowing to what <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> dying had ingag'd his Neece, and the reſolution ſhe had taken to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme her Mother's injunction, which was to admit of no man to be her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but him that ſhould bring her <hi>Laurean</hi>'s head conceal'd not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from him, aſſuring him withall that he would deliver <hi>Clione</hi> into his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:30010:41"/>
hands, if he could but effect it. Love and the deſire he had to advance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (two powerfull goades to an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious youth) ſoone made <hi>Montdor</hi> accept the tearmes, although he knew the injuſtice of the cauſe, and the ſad ſucceſſe of divers that had preceded him. To this effect furniſhed with very good Armes, and an excellent Horſe, he comes to a Village within three leagues of <hi>Laurean</hi>'s houſe, whence he ſends a Challenge incloſed in a packet, which he pretended was ſent from Court. <hi>Laurean</hi> who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuch kinde of meſſages, read it without ever changing his Countenance, or giving the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the Contents, reſolving with himſelfe to give the ſame ſatisfaction to this new Combatant as he had to the reſt, onely he was to beware leſt under pretence of a ſingle Duell, there might be ſome treachery intended, and ſo he might baſely be deprived of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30010:42"/>
that life, which he had expos'd with ſuch unparallel'd gallantry. However he could not carry his buſineſſe ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, but his deſigne was diſcover'd by the preparation of his Horſe and Armes: It was preſently nois'd through the whole Caſtle, and came to <hi>Octaviane</hi>'s, <hi>Florent</hi>'s and <hi>Nartal</hi>'s eares. What diverſity of thoughts (thinke you) were <hi>Laurean</hi>'s and his Ladies minds then poſſeſſed with? his onely care was to preſerve his honour and his life, and make his Enemy, feeling the ſharpneſſe of his Sword, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent too late the temerity of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. <hi>Florent</hi> and <hi>Nartal</hi> Studied nothing ſo much, as by what meanes they might divert or compoſe this quarrell, <hi>Octaviane</hi> employed all her Rhetorick, but in vaine, to diſſwade her kinſman from anſwering the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge: For (beſides that he was of himſelfe too magnanimous to refuſe that party by a Womans perſwaſions
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30010:42"/>
onely) hee ſtop't her mouth with her owne reaſons, repreſenting to her the deſperate deſigne ſhe was ſo inflexibly bent upon to fight her ſelfe with <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi> And the offer ſhe made him of employing one of her Lovers to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe the raſhneſſe of his Challenger, he rejected as a propoſition highly injurious to his Valour and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Florent</hi> took her at her word, to whom ſhe had rendred many teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of affection, not onely by her actions and demeanure, but alſo by her owne confeſſion, (although ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a baſhfullneſſe that becomes modeſt and chaſte Virgins.) <hi>Florent</hi> would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot let ſlip this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, but made it ſerve as a ſpecious pretence to cover the deſigne he had already fram'd, either to fight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with <hi>Montdor</hi> in <hi>Laurean</hi>'s ſtead, or at leaſt to be his ſecond againſt him. But <hi>Laurean</hi> taking theſe offers
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30010:43"/>
as affronts, and as diſadvantageous to his honour, impoſing ſilence to his kinſwoman, entreated <hi>Florent</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him if he could not commit ſo baſe an action as to ſuffer him to goe in his place, ſince 'twas a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the Lawes of Honour and of Armes; neither could he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him for his Second, ſince <hi>Montdor's</hi> Ticket mentioned that he would fight ſingle, being unwilling to engage any other in that Duell. <hi>At leaſt then</hi> (replyed <hi>Florent</hi>) <hi>you ſhall permit me to goe before, and view the place he aſsignes you, neer the Village where he expects your Anſwer, that there may be as little Treachery on his part, as there is much generoſity on yours. Laurean</hi> ſuſpecting, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing aright the wile of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, who deſired that Commiſſion for no other end, but to quarrell with <hi>Montdor,</hi> and prevent their Combate, would by no meanes be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30010:43"/>
perſwaded to conſent to that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But not to diſcontent him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, he ſuffered, with much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, <hi>Nartal</hi> to performe that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, gueſſing, by his deportment, that he was not a man fit to conteſt with <hi>Montdor,</hi> who had the repute of the moſt expert and compleat Horſeman of that County. <hi>Florent</hi> was enforced to be ſatisfied with that, ſince no more could be obtained: Whereupon he diſpatch'd a Letter by <hi>Nartal</hi> to <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor;</hi> wherein he forbade him expreſſely under pain of his perpetuall diſ-favour to fight with <hi>Laurean,</hi> for reaſons which he ſhould know at their firſt meeting: This he wrote with his owne hand, and ſubcribed <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nartal</hi> with this Letter, and other private inſtructions from <hi>Clione,</hi> takes his way towards <hi>Montdor,</hi> where being arrived, he delivers the Letter, the Contents whereof diſtracted <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:30010:44"/>
mind with a thouſand confuſed imaginations: for knowing very well the hand, and bearing a reſpectfull awe to the abſolute Command of that ſevere Miſtreſſe, who had no leſſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make her Lovers fear her, than Beauty to attract their Loves. Love ſolicites hard for Obedience to that Command; repreſenting often to him <hi>Clione's</hi> threats to deprive him of that which he ſought for in that Duell with perill of his owne life, ſince he had no other occaſion to be <hi>Laurean</hi>'s enemy. But to revoke the Challenge he had ſent, he thought that would make too great a breach in his reputation; and that expoſing himſelf to the blame of Cowardiſe, would ſtaine him with perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy: At laſt he concludes in favour of his Honour, and to the prejudice of his Love; chooſing rather to be deprived of <hi>Clione,</hi> than of that glory which ſuch magnanimous Spirits
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30010:44"/>
aſpire by vertue of their Armes. So to be rid of <hi>Nartal's</hi> importunity (who preſſed him extreamly to acquieſſe at <hi>Clione's</hi> entreaty) he fained to believe that the Letter <hi>Nartal</hi> had delivered him (though he knew it to be of <hi>Clione's</hi> own penning) was counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by ſome other, but would by no meanes tax <hi>Laurean</hi> with it, leſt that might give occaſion of defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Enterprize which he then was too deeply engag'd in to repeale with Honour. Hereupon <hi>Nartal</hi> pray'd him to obſerve well his Phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; ſeeming to wonder that a mans Habit, and a Hat cover'd with plumes, ſhould make him ſo much miſ-kenne that <hi>Melicerte</hi> whom he had ſo often ſeene attending on <hi>Clione;</hi> aſſuring him by many particulars, that 'twas none but ſhe; and that her Miſtreſſe had put her into that diſguiſe, having no body elſe about her that ſhe could entruſt with a Meſſage of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:30010:45"/>
               <hi>Montdor</hi> at this was ſeiz'd with ſuch aſtoniſhment, that for a good while his tongue could not performe it's office; at length recovering his ſpeech, he ask'd her diverſe queſtions concerning her Miſtreſſe, wherein ſhe ſatisfied him with as many quaint, and cunningly fram'd inventions, never confeſſing that <hi>Clione,</hi> under the name of <hi>Florent,</hi> was in <hi>Laurean's</hi> houſe. But neither her entreaties, conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor threats, could in the leaſt divert <hi>Montdor</hi> from the reſolution he had taken to maintaine the Challenge he had ſent to <hi>Laurean,</hi> deeming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unworthy ever to wear a Sword, if he ſhould be guilty of an act that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented of ſuch notorious and eminent baſeneſſe.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>Nartal</hi> returning gave <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> an exact account of the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Combate, and that he perceived <hi>Montdor</hi> to be free from any baſe treachery; But <hi>Florent</hi> was in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30010:45"/>
the greateſt perplexity imaginable to heare that his perſwaſions, nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, could not availe any thing with <hi>Montdor,</hi> nor divert his obſtinate reſolution to fight with <hi>Laurean,</hi> ſo making neceſſity a vertue, he ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that bitter pill, leaving th'event to fortune, ſince there was no remedy nor meanes to hinder nor defer that Duell. <hi>Laurean</hi> us'd all entreaties poſſible to perſwade <hi>Florent</hi> to ſtay with <hi>Octaviane,</hi> (but all in vaine) for he would needs beare him Company, and be at leaſt a ſpectatour of the Combate, hoping at laſt to apply that remedy which he more fear'd then deſired.</p>
            <p>The two Combatants being come into the field, mounted upon goodly Steeds, and armed each with Sword and Piſtoll, at the firſt encounter <hi>Montdor</hi> did no execution, <hi>Laurean</hi> dexterouſly ſlipping aide: But he not loſing the opportunity ſhot <hi>Montdor</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:30010:46"/>
through the right arme, and making his Piſtoll fall immediately, he put him out of his fighting poſture: Then preſently drawing his Sword he gain'd the crupper of him, and had run him through the body, if <hi>Montdor</hi>'s horſe by a fortunate ſtumble had not caſt his rider. <hi>Laurean</hi> however ſcorning to make uſe of this advantage, leap't from his horſe, and comming to him (that was neither able to draw his Sword, nor riſe, being much bruiſed with the fall) bid him aske his life, and deliver him his Sword. <hi>I cannot deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sword which I cannot draw</hi> (<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd</hi> Montdor) <hi>and which I never would deliver to any man if I were in a capacity to uſe it, much leſſe will I begge my life of you, which I had rather loſe a thouſand times then make ſo foul a breach in my Honour. Fortune may make me miſerable, but never baſe; I am now in your power, you may deale with me as you pleaſe, and make what uſe of your victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:30010:46"/>
               <hi>you liſt.</hi> This high ſpirit which ſo imminent danger could notintimidate, and which look'd ſo undauntedly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo preſent and preſſing a death, took infinitely with <hi>Laurean,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſoile the glory of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph with inſolency, anſwered, <hi>You are much worthier of life, than if you had demanded it; and I will aſſure you, that for your Generoſity and Courage, you ſhall ever hereafter find me your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, not an Enemy; and I'le acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it was my good Fortune, not my Valour that hath given me this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over a man whoſe courage I finde invincible.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Montdor</hi> replyed, <hi>Now I acknowledge my ſelfe conquered ſince your Courteſie doth preſerve what your Sword might juſtly have taken away: But if God permit me to recover of theſe hurts, I will not die ungratefull for this favour.</hi> Hearing this, <hi>Laurean</hi> flung away his Sword; and having lifted him up, with the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30010:47"/>
help of his Servants, he carried him back to the Village, lodged him in a friends houſe, and ſent preſently for a Surgeon to dreſſe his Wounds, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him his owne Caſtle at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand aſſoone as he ſhould feel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf able to go thither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Florent</hi> and <hi>Nartal</hi> that ſtayed a loof off to watch the ſucceſſe of this Combate, with ſuch anxieties and feares, as you may imagine, perplex a tender Lovers heart in like occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſeeing this incomparable Valour joyn'd with ſo rare a Courteſie, quite raviſh'd with ſuch Heroick Vertues, rode preſently back to <hi>Laurean's</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, under pretence to carry <hi>Octaviane</hi> the newes of her Coſins Victory, who remained Maſter of the Field without any hurt. Mean time, whileſt they joyfully celebrate this Tryumph; and that <hi>Octaviane</hi> (deceiv'd with <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent's</hi> out-ſide) feedes her eyes with that pleaſing object, and her eares with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30010:47"/>
his accuſtomary Courtſhips: <hi>Laurean</hi> ſtayes with <hi>Montdor,</hi> ſhewing him as much reſpect, and friendly Offices as if hehad been the moſt intimate and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Friend in the world, which ſo tranſported <hi>Montdor,</hi> that he almoſt forgot his paine. The ſhot being in his Shoulder, was not ſo dangerous as troubleſome, being likely to be long a Curing; but he was ſo bruiſed with the fall, that there was more fear of him for that, than for the Wound he had received.</p>
            <p>One day <hi>Montdor</hi> lying in his Bed, and <hi>Laurean</hi> ſitting by him, (whoſe Civility and Gallantry he could never ſatisfie himſelfe with extolling) they fell upon the diſcourſe of the ſubject of their quarrell. <hi>Montdor</hi> confeſſed that he was juſtly puniſh'd for his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity, having obſtinately tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the expreſſe Commands of <hi>Clione</hi> in fighting with him. <hi>How?</hi> ſaid <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean, I thought ſhe had enjoyned you to</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:30010:48"/>
               <hi>it. Not ſhe</hi> (replyed Montdor) <hi>but her Uncle told me that I could never hope upon any other tearms to enjoy his Neece, who at preſent is gone to certaine waters neere the</hi> Pyrenean <hi>mountains, for the recovery of her health, which of late hath beene ſomewhat impaired:</hi> With that he ſhew'd <hi>Laurean</hi> the Letter ſhe had ſent him, and told him the particular meſſage he had receiv'd from her, by a Gentlewoman diſguis'd in mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell. <hi>Laurean</hi> could not imagine what might be her meaning to forbid <hi>Montdor</hi> that whereto ſhe had engag'd ſo many others formerly, unleſſe that bearing him more affection then the reſt, ſhe would not expoſe him to ſo great danger.</p>
            <p>After ſome daies time <hi>Laurean</hi> tooke leave of <hi>Montdor,</hi> promiſing to ſee him often, and to bring with him two <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedochian</hi> youths that had beene ſome time at his houſe; and which, amongſt other perfections, were rarely
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30010:48"/>
Skill'd in muſick. Being come backe to his Caſtle, he made a full relation to his kinſwoman, and his two gueſts, of all the paſſages betwixt him and <hi>Montdor,</hi> and what he had told him of <hi>Clione</hi>'s Letter, and of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman Cavalier that brought it him. At theſe words <hi>Nartal</hi> and <hi>Florent</hi> were almoſt out of Countenance, imagining that they were diſcovered.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Laurean</hi> had taken notice of the comming and going of the Colours in their faces, he might eaſily have gueſt at their inward diſturbances, (but how ſhould the mind imagine what the eyes doe not obſerve?) So theſe alterations paſſing without his reflecting on them, built a confidence in the two diſguiſed Damſells, that they were not yet knowne to be what effectually they were. But when <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> pray'd them to beare him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the firſt time, he went to Viſite <hi>Montdor</hi> againe (as he had promiſed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30010:49"/>
they ſhould) they then believed abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely that this was only a wile to draw them in, and that without doubt their plot had been diſcovered. Therefore <hi>Florent</hi> could never be at quiet, till he had found a handſome excuſe to be gone away, having no deſire to appear before <hi>Montdor</hi> in that habit. So faining to have received newes from an Uncle of his that was deſperately Sick, (whoſe eſtate after his deceaſe he was to inherit) he acquaints <hi>Laurean</hi> with it, and deſires his permiſſion, who charm'd with his winning carriage and Converſation could not reſolve to part with him.</p>
            <p>What an Alarum did this news give to poor <hi>Octaviane</hi>'s heart? who plac'd all her felicity in the preſence and company oft her beloved <hi>Florent,</hi> whom ſhe had engag'd her ſelfe to marry. How oft did ſhe upbraid him with inconſtancy and ſlight affection, but with reproaches of ſo amorous
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30010:49"/>
a Choller, that one fire augmented the other, and made a more full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the exceſſe of paſſion. <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> (rejoycing at her paine, and to continue her in this agreeable errour) made a thouſand proteſtations of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſervice, as if he had beene ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of accepting the offer ſhe had made him to marry him, he added many Vowes and deſperate Oaths, to anſwer her love with a reciprocall and moſt inviolable affection, beſeeching her not to be a hindrance to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but give him reſpit onely for ſome few daies, that he might goe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fruit of the Inheritance that fell to him by his Uncle's death. <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viane</hi> deceived with his faire language, and holding the mouth ſhe ſo dearely loved as an oracle of infallible verity, conſented at laſt to this ſeparation, but with ſuch dolorous reſentments as caſt her into a Swound, an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſigne how neere it touched her
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30010:50"/>
to be deprived of ſo beloved a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>Being come againe to her ſelfe, by the application of ſeverall remedies, her dolefull and amorous complaints bred ſome pitty in <hi>Florents</hi> heart, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the occaſion he had to hate her. At laſt, ſeeing no remedy, ſhe was enforc't to give way to his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which would have much more neerly touched <hi>Laurean,</hi> had he known that <hi>Clione</hi> was hidden under <hi>Florent</hi>'s cloathes. However, it troubled him very much to part with him, yet he was ſomewhat conſolated with the hope he had that <hi>Florent</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promiſe, which was, ſhortly to returne and ſtay longer with him.</p>
            <p>But then grew another conteſt about <hi>Nartal</hi>'s going, for <hi>Laurean</hi> was very urgent to detaine him, imagining all pleaſure and contentment would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fly from his heart if his eares were depriv'd both of his and <hi>Florents</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:30010:50"/>
enchanting Harmony: <hi>Nartal</hi> is as earneſt to accompany his coſin, (for ſo he ſtiled <hi>Florent</hi>) and <hi>Florent</hi> could not be perſwaded to leave him as a pledge. <hi>Laurean</hi> promiſed to furniſh <hi>Florent</hi> with as many attendants to convoy him ſafe home, as he would deſire, and to wait upon him himſelfe. <hi>Florent</hi> was incumbred with ſo many extraordinary Civilities, that he knew not which way to ſhape an anſwer. Indeed it is more difficult to come fairly off in a Combate of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Courteſe (although there be no bloodſhed) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vulgar ſpirits can imagine. But in the end he found this expedient to ſatisfie all parties, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſend back <hi>Nartal</hi> as ſoone as he ſhould arrive at <hi>Bezieres</hi> (which <hi>Florent</hi> fain'd to be his Native ſoile) to bring <hi>Octaviane</hi> and <hi>Laurean</hi> newes of his proceedings, and ſtay with them as an hoſtage till he return'd himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Thus parting they carry with them</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:30010:51"/>(but in a different manner) the hearts both of <hi>Laurean</hi> and his kinſwoman. In what a cloude of diſcontent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd the deſolate <hi>Octaviane,</hi> being depriv'd of an object that was the light and delight of her eyes, I give you leave to imagine. <hi>Laurean</hi> to divert his melancholy, went againe to ſpend ſome time with <hi>Montdor,</hi> who began to recover of his hurts.</p>
            <p>Meane while the time of <hi>Nartal</hi>'s comming backe expires, and <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viane</hi> dying with impatience to heare from <hi>Florent,</hi> thinks every day an age till ſhe ſees him. This impatience puts her in deſpaire, and being not able to ſtay any longer in her kinſmans houſe, ſhe tooke a ſodaine reſolution to retire to her owne, purpoſely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her ſelfe for the execution of a folly, which cannot be excus'd, but in attributing it to the Violence of a paſſion which Reaſon could not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. So faining her ſelfe very ſick,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30010:51"/>
ſhe repaires homewards, where being arriv'd and fittted with mans appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, a horſe and one footman, ſhe takes her Journy to <hi>Bezieres</hi> in hopes to find <hi>Florent</hi> there, but 'twas in vaine, no body there could tell any newes of him, for the houſe where <hi>Clione</hi> had retird her ſelfe, was in another part of <hi>Languedoc</hi> not far from <hi>Niſmes.</hi> What troubles was <hi>Octaviane</hi>'s minde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext with, ſeeing her ſelfe deceived? how did not ſhe exclaime againſt <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent?</hi> whoſe trace ſhe could no more finde out then that of <hi>Fantomes,</hi> which vaniſh as ſoone as they appeare: Yet this pleaſing illuſion which had ſo ſweetly carryed away her ſenſes, and diſtill'd a delicious Venime through the eyes into her heart, made her reſent a thouſand ſeverall diſtractions. How ſhall ſhe finde out him that ſhe knowes not where to ſeeke, and who is no more the ſame he ſeem'd to be? for <hi>Clione</hi> having re-aſſum'd her own name and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30010:52"/>
habit, left nothing of <hi>Florent</hi> but the bare Idea. Nevertheleſſe ſhe being no leſſe taken with <hi>Laurean</hi>'s perfections, then <hi>Octaviane</hi> was with hers, fail'd not to ſend back <hi>Nartal</hi> in the ſame diſguiſe with a Letter to <hi>Laurean,</hi> which contein'd nothing but Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, onely in the Cloſe ſhe entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to give full credit to what the bearer thereof ſhould tell him in her behalfe.</p>
            <p>How did the blood riſe in <hi>Nartals</hi> face when he was fain to take off the maske of their diſſimulation, to make <hi>Laurean</hi> ſee the Viſage of the truth? Heavens! how <hi>Laurean</hi> ſtood amaz'd at the recitall of this Hiſtory, which ſeemes more like a fable or Romance then verity, yet I have it from an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Author, that averreth it to be very true.</p>
            <p>I will not ſtand to recount the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of this diſcovery, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready much gone beyond the limits
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30010:52"/>
of brevity which I had preſcrib'd my ſelfe in this worke: I will onely tell you that the Scales fell from <hi>Laurean</hi>'s eyes, when <hi>Nartal</hi> ſhewed him what remarkable tumours were in his breſt, not ordinary to be found in men's: So comparing one thing with another, and calling to minde the many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing deceipts which had deluded his ſenſes in <hi>Florent</hi>'s preſence, he made no further queſtion of what <hi>Nartal</hi> told him. I will omit the divers Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations that then poſſeſt his braine, without making reflection upon the wrongs <hi>Clione</hi> had done him, (whoſe perſon he never hated, but the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions wherewith ſhe diſturb'd his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) her beauty and good parts repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves to his fancy in a more advantageous forme, then if ſhe had beene preſent, and adding more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over this unexpected change; that had transform'd her from a Tyger to a Dove, and from a mortall Enemy,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:30010:53"/>
into a paſſionate Lover, he thought one heart too little to reciprocate ſo entire an affection. In a word he was more ready to anſwer <hi>Clione</hi>'s flame, then fire is to catch at any bituminous matter.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Nartal</hi>'s word without any diffidence he goes alone with him, taking no attendant but one Lakey, and in ſhort time he arrives at <hi>Clione</hi>'s houſe. Theſe two Souls felt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the ſame inſtant kindled with a flame ſo equall in it's extremity, that it had beene hard to judge which had the better in that amorous Warre. Ti's nothing to ſay they were perfectly reconcil'd to one another: I muſt ſay, they ty'd themſelves ſo ſtrictly with deepe Oathes and promiſes of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that nothing but Death could ever diſſolve that band.</p>
            <p>Theſe words and this faith being given and received in preſence of a Prieſt, they paſt to the Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30010:53"/>
of that which Lovers ſo ardently deſire, being both ſo fully ſatisfied, that their life was but a continued ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment of delight. But prickles ſtill accompany Loves roſes, and fire cannot be without ſome ſmoak. <hi>Laure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s being at <hi>Clione</hi>'s houſe was ſoone nois'd all the Country over, and ſhe, like the Queene of <hi>Carthage,</hi> cares not to hide their amorous ſtealths, ſince all was cover'd with the Cloake of Matrimony.</p>
            <p>Fame that hath no leſſe tongues then wings, ſoone carries this report to her Uncle <hi>Fructule,</hi> which Stunn'd him as if he had been blaſted with lightning, or rather thunderſtriken. It ſeemes to him a Paradox, eſteeming that as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible a thing as to joyne fire and water. A ſecond report which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is truer then the firſt, aſſured him that what he feared was but too cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Upon this he fall's into a rage, exclaimes, ſtormes and threatens
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30010:54"/>
both his Neece, and <hi>Laurean,</hi> with more thunder then th'Heavens hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore darted againſt the Rebellious Gyants. All the other friends of both the Families bleſſe God for this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py alliance, which promiſing an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red peace betwixt them would ſtop the effuſion of ſo much blood, and hinder any further quarrells. Onely <hi>Fructule</hi> animated with a deſperate rage, and fury, reſolves to put all in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he thus fret's and fume's with madneſſe, ſtudying the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of ſome premeditated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge againſt them, let us conſider th'amazement poore <hi>Octaviane</hi> was in, being already return'd from her Knight Errantry, when ſhe heard that her Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin was marry'd to his faire Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that this ſweet Enemy was the ſame <hi>Florent</hi> whoſe Idea was ſo deeply engraven in her heart. How ſtrange the Hiſtory of this transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30010:54"/>
ſeeme's to her? for better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction ſhe goes to give <hi>Laurean</hi> a Viſite, (who was ſo overcome with the affection of his loving Enemy; that he could not abſent himſelfe one moment out of her ſight) and if her owne eyes had not beene witneſſes of all theſe paſſages (that had beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to her, beſides the aſſurance <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> gave her of them by Letters) ſhe could nere have believed them.</p>
            <p>Cur'd both of her love and hatred, immediately ſhe embraceth, as her chiefe friend and kinſwoman, her in whoſe breſt not many daies before ſhe would have ſtuck her poniard. Oh Love! it's thou that tameſt the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage beaſts, and makeſt tractable the moſt fierce Lyons and Tygers, what force is able to withſtand thy power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſweetneſſe! Meane while that <hi>Laurean,</hi> wholly taken up with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of his new ſpouſe, ſeeme's to have forgotten both himſelfe and his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30010:55"/>
Family, <hi>Montdor</hi> recover's his perfect health, and hearing the good ſucceſſe twixt <hi>Laurean</hi> and <hi>Clione,</hi> he rejoyc'd exceedingly that he was prevented in the deſigne, wherein he had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to employ all his power and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, for the reconciliation of thoſe two Families devided by ſo many ſtreames of blood. He was ſo farre from being troubled with jealouſie, ſeeing in <hi>Laurean</hi>'s Armes her who was cauſe of that Duell: that quite contrary he look't upon him as the preſerver of his life, as the mirrour of Courteſie and valour, and as one for whom he would have reſign'd a Scepter to have plac't him in a throne. He went to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this new married Couple, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate their felicity, and aſſure them that there was nothing in the world to which his Soule ſo much aſpir'd as to doe them Service.</p>
            <p>There he found <hi>Octaviane,</hi> who diſabus'd of her errour, was a blanke,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30010:55"/>
free from all love and Paſſion: <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> being throughly heal'd as well of the wounds which <hi>Laurean</hi> had made in his body, as alſo of thoſe which <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one</hi>'s beauty had made in his Soule, felt a private inclination to render himſelfe to <hi>Octaviane</hi>'s ſweetly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive graces: And ſhe conſidering the comelineſſe of this Gentleman, (who was one of the richeſt and ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Cavaliers of the County of <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>) had no leſſe diſpoſition to affect him.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt foundation of their reciprocall liking, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of time increas'd through <hi>Montdor</hi>'s faithfull ſervice and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of reall affection, untill at laſt it was conſummated by that honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bond which makes of two bodies one fleſh. Now he bearing a great hand with <hi>Fructule,</hi> at whoſe inſtance he had engag'd himſelfe in that unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Duell againſt <hi>Laurean,</hi> tooke
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:30010:56"/>
upon him to appeaſe his anger, and procure his approvement of <hi>Clione</hi>'s Marryage, which he ſeem'd to be ſo diſcontented and enraged at. In this confidence he went to him, but having reck'ned without his hoſt, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if he found his expectation fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. <hi>Fructule</hi> gives him very ill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and had like to have fallen foul on him. This was an ill beginning, yet he deſiſted not, but ſuffering all the injurious treatments th'others furie tranſported him to, he endeavoured to winne him with the faireſt and moſt plauſible language he could invent; Yet this wrought nothing upon him, the Ulcers of his minde being like thoſe of the body, which Hony doth more inflame, contrary to the holy text which ſaith, <hi>good words Molifie anger.</hi> Thence <hi>Montdor</hi> went to viſite <hi>Clione</hi>'s other kindred, and by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions prevailed ſo farre with them that they all ſeem'd very joyfull of that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30010:56"/>
alliance, as an extraordinary effect of the Divine Providence which onely was able to procure that recconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But all their conſents were of no great importance, the chiefe was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that was, <hi>Fructule</hi>'s, (he being Guardian &amp; adminiſtratour of <hi>Clione</hi> his niece and ward's whole eſtate,) and to obtaine that ſeemed impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>He talk't of nothing but challenging <hi>Laurean</hi> himſelfe, which <hi>Laurean</hi> might wave with two very lawfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, for one he might alledge his late Marryage which made <hi>Fructule</hi> his Unkle, th'other that having once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worſted him in the Field, he was not oblig'd the ſecond time to fight againſt him. <hi>Fructule</hi> fearing the latter objection, which would not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to his honour, bethought him of ſome other meanes how to make <hi>Laurean</hi> away. To this effect he corrupts with money a Cooke, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30010:57"/>
formerly had ſerv'd him, Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to try how he might get into <hi>Laurean</hi>'s ſervice and poyſon him. This baſe fellow pretending that <hi>Fructule</hi> had miſus'd him, came to proffer his Service to <hi>Laurean,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him at <hi>Clione</hi>'s entreaty, ſhe having known him at her Unkle's houſe, aſſur'd him of his fidelity, in which ſhe was much miſtaken. Thus ſhe contributed to her owne miſchiefe, in receiving within her husbands Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (whither he had carried her) this threacherous Trojan horſe. Had not <hi>Montdor</hi> given him warning to take heed of that Cooke, queſtionleſſe the Villaine had executed his baſe deſigne. Upon this advertiſement <hi>Laurean</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended him, and partly by entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, partly by promiſes, and partly by threatnings, he made him confeſſe the truth, and ſhew him the poyſon he was to mingle in his meat. Obſerve the extreame Courteſie of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30010:57"/>
who ſent him back to <hi>Fructu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> not ſuffering the leaſt harme to be done him, to the end that he might inflict ſuch puniſhment upon him as he ſhould thinke fit himſelfe for ſo unworthy a fact, deſiring him not to uſe any waies to deprive him of his life, ſo ignoble and ſo misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming a Gentleman of his birth and honour. <hi>Fructule</hi> ſorry that his powder had not taken fire, nor his treachery ſucceeded to his minde, and aſham'd to owne ſo diſhonourable a deſigne, diſclaim'd his Cooke, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was ignorant of that diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and that it was a good while ſince he had turn'd him away. But not imagining how <hi>Laurean</hi> ſhould be acquainted with this plot, out of Suſpicion he manumitted divers of his domeſticks, who blazed all abroad the truth of the buſineſſe to his great infamy, yet this malicious Soule was not ſo Satisfied, ſeeing every body
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30010:58"/>
cry'd ſhame on him for his treachery and hard-hartedneſſe, and that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly withheld his Ward from her eſtate, becauſe ſhe was marryed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent to his and her Enemy: He chang'd his note, and faining to be better pleas'd, and to deſire a faire reconciliation (juſt as the cunning Fowlers uſe their calls to entrap the innocent birds) <hi>Clione</hi> and <hi>Laurean</hi> who deſired nothing more then to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their felicity, greedily hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kned to the propoſitions that were made by ſome perſons whom <hi>Fructule</hi> had deceived, and who uſed as much ſincerity and Candour in the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he had baſeneſſe and diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his propoſalls.</p>
            <p>He pretends that his greateſt deſire was to ſee his Neece, that he could not foregoe his owne blood, that he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd her with all his heart, and that he believed if he could but ſer her at his Houſe, and learne of her ſelfe what
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:30010:58"/>
moved her to marry <hi>Laurean,</hi> perhaps he ſhould be ſatisfied with her reaſons, reſtore her to her Eſtate, and make a handſome agreement with her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. She (like an innocent Dove, or an inconſiderate Partridge) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap's her ſelfe by caſting her ſilly harmeleſſe eye upon the ſpecious luſter of this Fowlers glaſſe; having begg'd leave of her Husband to goe treate their peace with her Unkle. Although <hi>Laurean</hi> preſag'd that Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney would produce no good event, yet he lets his Wife goe againſt his will, conſenting to that ſeparation induced by his Friends perſwaſions, who were very earneſt with him, not to ſhew himſelfe irreconcileable, but yeild as much as in honour he could to <hi>Fructule</hi>'s humour, who by his marriage to <hi>Clione</hi> was then his Unkle. <hi>Clione</hi> of her good Nature miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing fell into the Snares her Unkle had prepared for her. At firſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:30010:59"/>
he treated her with more Civility then ſhe expected, but this was onely as a faire leafe to hide the Serpent in his treacherous deſigne, and a Figg where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (like the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Queene) he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his prernicious aſpe. How de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull is the Spirit of man! It's a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth that's full of falſe cunning paſſages and ſubtile evaſions. A tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt is moſt to be fear'd when the Sea is calmeſt: All the feaſting and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of joy which <hi>Fructule</hi> made his Neece, were but ſo many treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous baits to inveagle her; Apes kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who kill their young ones with hugging them. Being entred in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with her, by little and little he cunningly fell from conteſtation to reprehenſion, from reprehenſion to threats, thence to rayling and ſuch offenſive tearmes, as drew very tart replies from <hi>Clione</hi>'s mouth, then irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with Choller and incited with a too great ſenſe of Honour; which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30010:59"/>
gave <hi>Fructule</hi> occaſion to colour his premeditated revenge under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of correction. Hereupon he makes her be lock't up in a Chamber, and kept as a Priſoner with all the baſe uſage that may be imagin'd, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to drive her into deſpaire. And according to the proverbe, one miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune never comes alone: The newes of <hi>Clione</hi>'s captivity was ſoone brought to <hi>Laurean,</hi> who then lay ſick in bed of a Feaver, that Melancholly for his deare Spouſes abſence had been the occaſion of. Heavens! how it ſtroke his heart, he is mad to riſe up, being ready to burſt with Choller and fury, he will precipitate himſelfe into a thouſand deaths, rather then ſuffer ſuch indignities to be done, to a perſon that was ſo neere and deare unto him, as one whom he affected with a more love then what he bare unto himſelfe. But this exceſſe of rage redoubles his paroxiſme, and makes his Feaver con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30010:60"/>
from that his Violent burning grew to finde no intermiſſion, ſo that he fell into ſuch extravagant ravings, as bred aſtoniſhment and pitty in all that were about him. <hi>Clione</hi> is alwaies in his mouth, &amp; her Image perpetually before his eyes, ſometimes he fancies her all bloudy and deformed with blowes, ſometimes crying out to him for ſuccour, ſometimes purſued by her Unkle, he ſtruggles and keepes a Coile, he ask's for his Sword, he leaps out of his bed, &amp; makes aſſaies beyond any ordinary mans ability, ten men can hardly hold him, they are faine to bind him with cords, amongſt all theſe Violences he neither would nor could take any remedy the Phiſicians did preſcribe him, ſo that there were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any hopes either of life or his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. This being reported to <hi>Fructule,</hi> he believ'd that the Heavens in that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſeemed to aſſiſt him, executing his revenge upon <hi>Laurean,</hi> whom he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30010:60"/>
Styled the ſeducer and raviſher of his Neece; and to augment her ſorrowes he preſently carries her the newes of her Husbands indiſpoſition, but with ſuch joyfulneſſe, that it even broake her heart. For that confirm'd her opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that <hi>Laurean</hi> then was poyſoned or bewitched, for (beſides what her Uncle told her) ſhe heard ſuch ſtrange reports of the exceſſe and Violence of her Husbands ſickneſſe, that there was nothing of ill but ſhe imagin'd was befallen him: And for accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her miſeries ſhe felt her ſelfe with Child, a condition ſo choiſe and tender, that the leaſt affliction either corporall or ſpirituall, often caſts into the grave thoſe that ſeeme the beſt diſpoſed, and of the ſtrongeſt conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fructule</hi> who hated both the tree and the Fruit, and wiſh'd no leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the Mother and her Child, then he did to the Father, uſed her
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30010:61"/>
worſe and worſe, and ſtrove by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſubtilties how he might make <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one</hi> away, and deſtroy her Child, by a precipitated and untimely birth. But God (who preſerve's the innocent, to whom all hatred and malicious practiſes are unpleaſing) confounded the wicked deſignes of this incompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Guardian, who (more like a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous wolfe then a faithfull Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard) us'd all meanes poſſible to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the deſtruction of the ſheep, which the Lawes both divine and Humane oblig'd him to preſerve and cheriſh. Indeed thoſe that are under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Almighty, cannot be taken out of his hand, they are (ſaith the Prophet) deliver'd out of the ſnares of the hunters, and ſheltred from all outrages and injuries, for the Lord doth hide them under the ſhadow of his wings, and is as a Buckler to them.</p>
            <p>It had beene abſolutely impoſſible
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30010:61"/>
but that <hi>Clione</hi> beaten with ſo many cruell ſtormes, had fallen into ſome deſperate ſickneſſe, which would have made a double murther in her, if God had not ſuſcitated <hi>Montdor</hi> to reſcue and deliver her. He was once in the minde to challenge <hi>Fructule,</hi> and by his death give both life and Liberty to that unfortunate Priſoner, but upon maturer conſideration, he thought it more convenient to take a Foxes then a Lyons skin, and try what might be done by wit and induſtry rather then attempt any violent Courſe. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Danae</hi> teacheth us this Verity, that Gold will make it's paſſage through the ſtrongeſt holds. He ſpar'd for nothing that might corrupt <hi>Clio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>'s guards, procuring at length her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, by the meanes of thoſe that were encharg'd to keep her. Having free'd her from this Slaverie he carries her back to <hi>Laurean,</hi> who at the very firſt ſight of her began to feele him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30010:62"/>
better, he left his raving fits and the ardour of his Feaver grew more moderate, ſhewing that the Cauſe of his diſeaſe being ceas'd, the effects could no longer have their being. Within a ſhort time he recovered his health, and the lightſomeneſſe of his heart ſoone replanted freſh roſes in his cheeks. As ſoone as he felt his ſtrength perfectly come to him againe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to employ it for the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him who had ſo barbarouſly treated his <hi>Clione.</hi> But ſhe never ceas'd weeping and entreating, untill to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie her he altred his reſolution, to which he more willingly condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of fear, that (she being very big with Child) that apprehenſion might caſt her into deſpaire and cauſe her to miſcarry. Nevertheleſſe though he was perſwaded to omit the uſe of his Sword, he reſolv'd to make good his Intereſt by force o'th' Pen, entring a ſuite in Law againſt <hi>Fructule</hi> to make
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:30010:62"/>
him render accompt of his Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to reſtore to his Wife the eſtate he unjuſtly kep't from her. During this proceſſe which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by thoſe that make it their trade and lively-hood, to foment ſuch conteſtations, <hi>Clione</hi> is brought to bed of a Daughter, and <hi>Montdor</hi> had ſo ingratiated himſelfe with <hi>Octaviane,</hi> that he was become her Husband, and kinſman to <hi>Laurean.</hi> Thus were thoſe two houſes now united in the bonds of conſanguinity, who before thirſted after nothing but the blood and deſtruction of each other.</p>
            <p>It is a generall Maxime that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo contrary as fire, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, can never be converted one into th'other, but to that Soveraigne power which governes and gives eſſence to all things, nothing can ſeeme difficult. Thus at the deſtruction of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> that Sacred fire of the Temple which was hidden in a well, by the induſtry
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30010:63"/>
of ſome Religious Prieſts, fearing leſt it ſhould be prophan'd by the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Conquerours, was found at their returne from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> chang'd into thick Water, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the hot Sunne beames reſum'd it's former colour and property of fire. I muſt confeſſe according to th'ordinary courſe of this corrupt age, it is hard to ſee ſuch effects of Love, proceed from ſuch mortall hatred, but nothing is impoſſible to God's omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Providence who daily worketh miracles.</p>
            <p>This conſideration made the Wiſe man ſay, that men muſt hate as if one day they were to Love, implying that their hatred ſhould not be irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable. And another ſaith, that Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ought to be mortall, that is, that they ſhould take end and dye.

               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:30010:63"/>By this <hi>Montdor</hi> through his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant endeavours had wrought all <hi>Clione</hi>'s other kindred to be friends with <hi>Laurean,</hi> &amp; the Senſe of the Court began to let <hi>Fructule</hi> ſee with ſhame the unjuſtneſſe of his cauſe: But to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Conviction, he meditated another deſigne ſo damnable, as could not enter into the thought of any man but one given over to all wickedneſſe; which to effect he gives out that he would willingly reſtore <hi>Clione</hi> her Eſtate, and approve of her Marriage, provided that her Husband and ſhee, would give him an acquittance of his Gardianſhip upon ſuch accompts as he ſhould produce. <hi>Laurean</hi>'s Friends and <hi>Clione</hi> her ſelfe (who deſired no better then to be at peace upon what tearmes ſoever) adviſed him to take what he could get from ſo ill a Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, and to quit th'Adminiſtration for the time paſt, ſo that he would give them quiet poſſeſſion of his

Neece's eſtate. Friends on both ſides at laſt concluded the matter, and the Articles were ſign'd according to <hi>Fructule</hi>'s owne deſire.</p>
            <p>That done they met, the Unkle em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced lovingly his Neece, and <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> as his Nephew, preſſing them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely to goe to his Houſe, where he would feaſt them and the whole company, drowning in good cheere and wine all their former differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and publiſh to the world an act of eternall oblivion. <hi>Laurean,</hi> who was of a generous free diſpoſition, promiſed to be there with his Wife, and ſome other Friends, whereof <hi>Montdor</hi> was now become one of the moſt intimate: Who knowing <hi>Fructu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi>'s treacherous humour, endeavour'd to caſt ſome diffidence in <hi>Laurean</hi>'s Spirit, but could by no meanes make him ſuſceptible of it. So he reſolv'd by vertue of the powder of Gold, to ſound ſome of <hi>Fructule</hi>'s domeſtick
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:30010:64"/>
Servants, who diſcovered his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enterpriſe; Which was to ſet fire to certaine barrells of Powder, that he had plac'd directly under the Hall, where he intended to make this deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able banquet, having firſt made his owne friends goe out and ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by retiring into another part of the Caſtle. A deſperate reſolution, and ſuch as could not proceed but from the ſuggeſtion of him that is a Homicide from the beginning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montdor</hi> preſently acquainted <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> with this plot, who would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perſwaded to believe it. But <hi>Clione</hi> that had more experience of her Unkle's baſeneſſe and malicious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, gave credit to it, and beſought her Husband to ſend him ſome hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome excuſe, that he could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promiſe at that time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking notice however that he knew any thing of that bloudy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. But <hi>Laurean</hi>'s high Courage
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:30010:65"/>
ſuggeſted him another reſolution, the boldneſs and gallantry whereof prov'd of moſt availe to their entire reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, by a meanes which in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability was abſolutely contrary. But as it hapneth that the exceſſe of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (ſo much forbidden thoſe that are in Feavers) ſometimes cureth them, ſo <hi>Laureans</hi> free-hartedneſſe and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage by an action full of heroick no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe in one inſtant drew away all the malignity from <hi>Fructule</hi>'s heart, imitating (in that) the lightning which falling upon a Serpent, takes away all his Venime without killing him.</p>
            <p>He aſſembles his kinſmen and moſt truſty Friends (who being all well arm'd) he deſires them to accompany him to <hi>Fructule</hi>'s houſe, firſt infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them of the treachery <hi>Montdor</hi> had diſcovered. They all agreed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to goe ſo ſtrong that they would maſter that Traytour, and make him ſuffer the ſame puniſhment
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:30010:65"/>
that he had prepar'd for them. But <hi>Laurean</hi> pray'd them to moderat their Choller, for he deſir'd the converſion, not the death of his wicked Unkle: Thinking himſelfe ſufficiently reveng'd if he could caſt the burning coales of ſhame and confuſion in his face, by manifeſting before his Friends the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of his darke deſigne.</p>
            <p>Being arrived there, <hi>Fructule</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them with all kinde of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of a moſt ſincere friendſhip, ſo expert was this man in diſſembling his unworthineſſe. As they were all come within the Hall that was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the tragedy, he fell into a long diſcourſe of the quarrells betwixt their two Families, reckoning up their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells and Combats, and how much blood had beene ſhed upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, proteſting withall how joyfull he was after ſo many bloody conflicts and murthers, that all thoſe debates were ſo neere an end, hoping that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:30010:66"/>
thence forwards they ſhould live peaceably together, having ſmothered all their former enmities in good cheere and wine; That he was more rejoyc'd to ſee them there then the beſt Friends he ever had in his life, and that he was moſt ready to reſigne them the place, and give them free poſſeſſion both of that houſe and all the eſtate that belong'd unto them.</p>
            <p>Thus he expreſt himſelfe, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Powder plot was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd. But t'is in vaine, ſaith the holy writ, to lay nets for birds that Soare a loft. <hi>Laurean</hi> knowing that all this ſmooth language tended to nothing elſe, but onely to prepare them for the Sacrifice, which he had deſtin'd to his fury. That <hi>Fructule</hi> might not have the leiſure to put in execution his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, nor to mingle in their meates any other powders no leſſe dangerous then that he had hiden under the Hall, without any further delay, ſaid, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:30010:67"/>
he entreated his friends (that came thither with him) to pardon that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, proteſting for his owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, that both that and all the former attempts he had ſo unworthily made upon his life, ſhould abſolutely be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in oblivion; to the end that this extraordinary goodneſſe joyn'd to the ſhame which <hi>Fructule</hi> ought to have reſented for ſo ignoble an action might ſomewhat induce him to repentance, and to acknowledge the preſervation of his life as an act of grace and favour from them, who had then the power to deprive him of it, and yet ſpar'd him.</p>
            <p>However <hi>Fructule</hi>'s obdurate heart relented nothing at this incomparable Courteſie, the moment of his viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being not yet come.

of words as confuſedly pronounced as his Countenance was unſetled, he ſet himſelfe to juſtifie the fact, alleadging that he had reaſon to ſeek revenge for ſo much bloud, as <hi>Laurean</hi> and his friends had drawn out of the Veines of thoſe of his family, and that he could never enjoy any content or quietneſſe of minde, untill he had ſacrific'd unto his Anceſtours Ghoſts the Authour's of their Death's; yeilding himſelfe willingly into their hands to inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the ſame torments, which he would have made them ſuffer, had they beene in his power, as he then acknowledg'd himſelfe to be in theirs.</p>
            <p>This anſwer no leſſe deſperate then preſumptuous aſtoniſh'd the whole Company, who ſeeing the obſtinacy of his inflexible heart, began to conſult amongſt themſelves what to doe to him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Love, where hatred had ſo long rul'd as Empreſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fructule</hi> (like a lump of lead which for a while reſiſt's the Violence of the fire, but at length melts all at once) became ſo chang'd on a ſodaine, that it was enough to have made thoſe who knew him beſt ſuppoſe him Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed. <hi>Clione</hi>'s teares having made their approach ſo neer as to undermine and blow up that unmalleable rock which lay invelop'd in his boſome, and no leſſe ſeated on his heart, that this ſtone diſtill'd its water through the Limbick of his eyes; But being not yet a perfect Convertite, ſome relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy of his converſion reverberated the ſtreame back againe to his heart, till the heart ſurcharg'd with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and humility together, ſent the pureſt Spirits of a relenting expreſſion unto his tongue, that like an over-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Violl, it gave ſuch evident teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of a ſodaine Change and reall
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:30010:69"/>
reſſentment, as therewith he fell upon his Neeces neck, ſtill lying at his feet, and mingling his ſighs and tears with her's, confeſs'd that her goodneſſe had overcome him, and quite eradicated all his hatred and obſtinacy; and ſince that by her meanes his life had beene preſerv'd, he would upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion employ it and all he had to doe her ſervice, conjuring her to forget what formerly had paſs'd, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile him to her Husband whom he was not willing to embrace as his moſt deare Nephew, to whom thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he would be ready to render with moſt ſincere affection all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs of a good Uncle and faithfull friend, and endeavour to give him as many teſtimonies of hearty good will, as he had formerly deſir'd and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to doe him miſchiefe.</p>
            <p>What ſatisfaction was it to all the friends of both parties to ſee this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall reconcileation ſo farre beyond all

their hopes or expectation! But as we ſee the moſt delicate and beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed bodies, are ſuſceptible of the greateſt corruptions, the firmeſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips converted oft-times into the deadlieſt hatreds, and the keeneſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger made of the ſtrongeſt wines: So ſometimes it hapneth that an inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friendſhip is fram'd amongſt ſuch as have beene moſt inveterate Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. This is confirm'd by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable example of <hi>Fructule,</hi> who chang'd in an inſtant (like <hi>Polemon</hi> in the Metamorphoſis) of a violent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie became ſo great a friend to <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> that he could not live without him, loving him not as his Nephew, but as his owne Sonne. This good affection continued to the end of his life; which expir'd, he inveſted his Neece in the ſucceſſion of his Eſtate, induc'd thereto by his owne incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as well as by the obligation of Nature.

violent and implacable hatred ended in Love and amitie; <hi>Laurean</hi>'s incomparable Courteſie and Valour, crowning his Memory with a never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying fame.</p>
