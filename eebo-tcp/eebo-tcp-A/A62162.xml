         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Both these persons charge me that I should say, <hi>That death did not so much trouble me, as that I had endeavoured to defend so bad a Cause, which I was drawn unto, as well by my own Ambition, as by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of other men;</hi> and that I

wished that all the Actions of the Parliaments Forces might hereafter be unsuccessefull; and especially that I should desire God and the King to forgive me this great sin of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. They that know me well, know that I have not so much vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to think any discourse neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for my defence in this case; yet that I may stand cleer, aswell in the thoughts of strangers as of my friends, I thought fit to render this account to the world. The apprehension of death never hitherto so neerly toucht me, but that if God shall once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store me to my former strength, I shall by his help with as much ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie, and I hope courage, endeavour to defend and maintain with my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest bloud, this so good a cause, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I was at first engaged in it. <hi>Not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62001:3"/>
my Ambition prompted me unto it,</hi> but a legitimate and ardent desire of advancing that cause, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive honours the meanest of them that are imployed therein; nor was I drawn into this businesse by any <hi>Perswasions,</hi> but such as were bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the best of Arguments, the maintaining of the true Religion, the honour and security of my Prince, the Rights and Priviledges of the Parliament, and the whole Kingdom; Such a successe I pray for to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of the Parliament, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to this Army under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Exellency the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> as by the best of men can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be desired, both on His Majesties Person, and this whole Kingdom. And lastly, I professe to the whole World, that my conscience did when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62001:4"/>
I was in the greatest danger of death, and doth still clear me from the guilt of rebellious or tumultuous thoughts and that the most puissant motive which carryed me on to this Action, was, loyalty to my Soveraign, and love to my Religion and Countrey: They certainly thought me dead when they writ these Letters, and by this meanes hoped to have served their ends, upon some feeble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved spirits. But I wonder they should write there are so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of our men slain, when it is most apparent, that the number both of them that dyed in the place, and since, never amounted to thirty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and their losse no way inferior to ours, considering their great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of place, and that they were at least double for number. There was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62001:4"/>
indeed a Divine, who I thinke was the Dean of <hi>Worcester,</hi> who came to me to the house where I was first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, and accompanied me to the place where I now lye, he continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged and pressed my conscience, how great a sin I was guilty of in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Arms against my Soveraign, I was not then in case to entertain him in discourse, only at last answered him, I never had, nor ever would take up Arms against my Soveraign, but ever should be ready to lay my life and whatsoever was dear unto me at His feet: of this judgement and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution I still am, and solemnly make this Protestation in the same sence I have here already declared, &amp; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the sense of the Parliament in all their Declarations, of which I hope with Gods blessing upon my recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

to give further testimony to the World, by the continued ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my life and fortune, in this so just and honourable a cause.</p>
