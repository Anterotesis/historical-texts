         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Wrote this Piece (<hi>flagrante dolore</hi>) in the just
<hi>paroxiſms</hi> of extreme <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>horrour,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
upon the <hi>Murther</hi> of the <hi>late Excellent
King,</hi> 1648. as ſoon as the <hi>aſtoniſhment</hi> of
<hi>ſorrow</hi> gave leave to regular thoughts and
words to vent themſelves; I ſent it (<hi>incognito</hi>)
in its ſackcloath and aſhes to <hi>London,</hi> where I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
it might finde way to publick view. My aim was, not onely to
gratifie my Own and the Nations vehement paſſion, by expreſſing a
juſt indignation againſt that prodigious Villany, but to <hi>repreſent</hi> in true
colours that horrid ſin and ſhame of <hi>killing the King,</hi> whereof ſome
men then were ſo impudent as to glory. And ſince I could not divert
them from that <hi>flagitious</hi> Fact by ſuch <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Religious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances</hi>
as I ſent them, I thought it <hi>high juſtice</hi> to take this
<hi>vengeance</hi> on them, either to bring the Authours and Abettors
(if poſſible) to <hi>repentance,</hi> or to preſerve others from <hi>partaking</hi> of
their ſins and plagues, by any after <hi>comprobation</hi> of their then proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
impiety, ſo as to make it the ſin and ſhame of the Nation.</p>
            <p>But my <hi>Papers</hi> found no hand ſo <hi>adventurous</hi> in thoſe <hi>Tyrannous</hi>
times as to <hi>Print</hi> them; although conveyed to a perſon who had
hazarded and ſuffered much in that way of <hi>loyal-ſervice</hi> and
<hi>danger:</hi> So that having no Copy left of it, I did not ſee it, or hear of
it for many years, ſuppoſing it had periſhed in the common <hi>ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack</hi>
of thoſe dayes, until this <hi>Feb.</hi> 1661. occaſionally meeting
with Mr. <hi>Dugart</hi> (to whom I firſt ſent it) and enquiring what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of ſuch a Piece, he told me it was Printed, and brought me
the Book with a new <hi>Title (Tragical enough</hi>) put to it (viz. <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels
bloody Slaughter-houſe diſcovered,</hi> &amp;c.) whereas I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
it after the example of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> when he wrote
his two ſharp invectives againſt <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) the <hi>Steliteutick</hi> of that <hi>Army,</hi> juſtly <hi>araigning</hi> and <hi>condemning</hi> them that were guilty of that <hi>bloody</hi> and <hi>barbarous</hi>
Fact, which I hereby expoſed, as upon a <hi>publick Pillar,</hi> to the <hi>view</hi>
and execration of all men.</p>
            <p>When I had thus recovered this Piece beyond all expectation,
I well remembred upon <hi>review,</hi> its priſtine <hi>lineaments;</hi> and found it
ſignally marked with the <hi>ſad drops</hi> of my paſſionate heart &amp; pen; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:106802:3"/>
ſuch an occaſion in which no <hi>Ink</hi> could be <hi>black</hi> enough, or have
too much <hi>Salt, Vinegar, Gall, or Aquafortis</hi> in it. Upon a <hi>calmer
view</hi> of it (after thirteen years abſence) finding it to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it of a <hi>confuſed rapture,</hi> not misbecoming ſo <hi>intenſive</hi> a
grief, and ſo pious <hi>impatience,</hi> with an <hi>unfegined abhorrence</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of ſo <hi>abominable</hi> a <hi>Fact,</hi> and <hi>monſtrous</hi> a <hi>ſcandal</hi> to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Religion, I have been perſwaded by the Printer to own it as a
<hi>legitimate Iſſue</hi> of mine, with ſome-other pieces born in the ſame ſtorm,
though in another ſtyle and language, in order to make him ſome
compenſation for his firſt (but not ſo beneficial) <hi>Loyal printing</hi> of it,
while yet it appeared an <hi>Orphane</hi> or <hi>fatherleſs,</hi> becauſe <hi>nameleſs:</hi>
I am now content my name be called upon it, that the world may
ſee in this <hi>unflattering glaſs,</hi> with what thoughts they ought for
ever to <hi>reflect</hi> upon ſo enormous a <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> which no time
can <hi>bury in oblivion,</hi> no colour can <hi>palliate</hi> or <hi>excuſe,</hi> ſcarce
any repentance can expiate; being then the Nations <hi>infinite horrour,</hi>
and ſo muſt be an <hi>abhorrence</hi> to all <hi>poſterity:</hi> Nor may the preſent
<hi>ſerenity</hi> of the times (which <hi>miraculous</hi> mercies have reſtored) ever
make us forget the <hi>blackneſs of darkneſs,</hi> which lyes upon that day,
beyond <hi>Jobs</hi> birth-day for that <hi>facinorous Fact</hi> committed in it.</p>
            <p>For whoſoever ſhall think of that crying <hi>Regicide,</hi> without juſt <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,</hi>
will contract the <hi>poſthumous</hi> guilt of the <hi>Murther,</hi> and as
a dog lick up the blood of the King which was ſo cruelly and unjuſtly
ſhed. And whoſoever ſhall remember it with <hi>approbation</hi> perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
the <hi>paricide</hi> afreſh, and is a <hi>mental murtherer</hi> of his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign.</hi>
O how great then was, and is their ſin, who were the firſt
malicious <hi>contrivers</hi> and cruel actors in it? What <hi>repentance</hi> will
be ſufficient for them? What <hi>contrition, deteſtation, confeſſ on,
ſatisfaction</hi> can be proportionate to the enormity of the crimes
committed with ſo high a hand, followed with ſo many tragedies and
confuſions, yet uſhered in with ſo many <hi>pretenſions</hi> of <hi>Religion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
ſancity</hi> and <hi>devotion,</hi> yea ſpecial <hi>Revelations</hi> and
<hi>Miracles,</hi> the ſtrong deluſions and ſtratagems of Satan, that grand
Impoſtor, a lyar, and murtherer from the beginning, who affected the
<hi>faireſt vizards</hi> of an <hi>Angel of light,</hi> when he was to act the fouleſt
part of a Devil: ſo expreſly againſt the <hi>word of God,</hi> and diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trally
contrary to the examples of all true Saint, no leſs than the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and ſanctifier of them?</p>
            <p>A dreafull example indeed of pride and faction, betraying men to
hypocriſie and barbarity, by which the <hi>juſt God loudly warns</hi> the
ſtill <hi>diſcontented</hi> ſpirits, the <hi>murmuring</hi> tongues, and <hi>malicious</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106802:3"/>
hearts of ſome men, not to venture again on the confines of ſuch ſins,
by any <hi>temptation,</hi> never ſo ſpecious and potent. Sin is ſeldome
ſolitary or goes along, but is followed with a train or ſucceſſion, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,
yea expoſing from leſs to greater, and from the greater to the
moſt heynous and truculent ſins, if for no other reaſon, yet for this, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
or cover the leſſer: Nor can any man eaſily forſee, what will be the
impudent <hi>period</hi> of his ſin, how modeſtly ſoever it begins. <hi>Davids</hi> idle
humour, and an occaſional look, betrayed him to wanton <hi>thoughts,</hi>
theſe to <hi>unlawfull luſts,</hi> this to <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> theſe to
<hi>Murther,</hi> and all to the higheſt both <hi>perfidy</hi> and <hi>ingratitude</hi> to God
and all valiant loyal <hi>ſubjects. Hazaels baſhfulneſs</hi> was at firſt <hi>aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
to finde himſelf under the Prophets ſuſpicion of thoſe cruel <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Tumultuating</hi> and <hi>traiterous</hi> thoughts (much more ſuch words)
muſt be ſtifled in the cradle by every <hi>good Chriſtian;</hi> who knows how
<hi>great a fire a little ſpark will kindle? Kings</hi> muſt not be curſed, no
not in the <hi>Bed-chamber; <hi>theſe leſſer</hi> thieves</hi> of <hi>ſchiſmatical</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious</hi>
mutinies let in at the <hi>window,</hi> will open the door to <hi>greateſt</hi>
Rebellions and Regicides. <hi>Subjects cutting</hi> off the lap of their <hi>Kings
garment,</hi> or leſning the <hi>Robe</hi> of royal Majeſty, that is their juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
honour and authority, will imbolden them to venture at their
heads and throats, yea to take away their lives and Kingdoms: which
<hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart, ſo much abhorred, that his heart
preſently ſmote him for that cautious eſſay, as petty Treaſon, upon
<hi>Sauls Veſture,</hi> which carried with it ſomething of injury and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
to the King the Lords anointed; nor did his juſtice ſpare
thoſe King-killers, who having ſlain <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iſhboſheth, Davids</hi>
enemies, thought he had done a meritorious ſervice.</p>
            <p>A mans greateſt <hi>flatterers, enemies</hi> and <hi>traytors</hi> are thoſe in his
own <hi>breaſt,</hi> where proud diſcontents, inordinate luſts, and extravagant
paſſions (as the populacy, rabble, and vulgarity of people) are prone
daily to conſpire and mutiny againſt that <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi>
which ought to have a conſtant rule and <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> in the ſoul.</p>
            <p>I believe many men never intended in their firſt Schiſmatical motions
ſo ſinfull a concluſion; many no doubt are now ready to alter their <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
at the ſcene and ſucceſs of affairs, yea to think thoſe <hi>counſels</hi> &amp;
<hi>actions</hi> very wicked, which they find are become ſo unproſperous; but he
ſees ſins <hi>too late,</hi> who doth it (as <hi>Adam, Cain</hi> &amp; <hi>Judas,</hi>) by <hi>retroſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
only in the glaſs of <hi>puniſhment.</hi> It is beſt <hi>diſcerned</hi> by a <hi>forward</hi>
and <hi>direct view</hi> in the firſt <hi>acceſs,</hi> by that <hi>proſpect,</hi> which the <hi>Word
of God,</hi> and the Laws of the Land give us.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:106802:4"/>
Had this been done by thoſe blood thirſty and deceitfull men, this
Piece might have been ſpared; now it will ſerve on the <hi>Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi>
of <hi>Englands Lamentation,</hi> Jan. 30. to excite that juſt paſſion of

Devils: whoſe Servants you are, whoſe work you do, and whoſe

            <p>Nor do we doubt but all the <hi>Curſes</hi> written in the Book of
God (which like that of <hi>Meroz,</hi> have been cauſeleſly, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,

            <p>We hope God will in his infinite goodneſs not ſuffer this dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>We tell you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are ſo far from counting you <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours,</hi>
that we look upon you as the Tophet which God hath
indeed prepared for the King, and theſe Kingdoms, to try and
torment them a while; But we doubt not, but God will at laſt
caſt you (who are our Sin, our Death, and our Hell) into the
Lake that burns with fire and brimſtone for ever.</p>
            <p>Unleſs you <hi>repent,</hi> ſo many of you Officers, Souldiers, and

and unreaſonable Sinners, make no conſcience to <hi>damn your
Souls,</hi> for the perfecting their ambitious and covetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
for which they have hitherto made uſe of the hands of ſo
many valiant men, worthy of a better work, and a nobler
War, whereby to deſtroy your and our King, ſubvert our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
Laws, Government, and Religion; And all this,
againſt all your and our Proteſtations, Vows, Oaths, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
to God and Man.</p>
            <p>O you that have followed theſe <hi>Theudaſſes,</hi> as the ſeduced
people ſometime did <hi>Abſalom</hi> in the <hi>ſimplicity of your hearts,</hi> not

theſe <hi>Korahs,</hi> theſe Sinners who know themſelves accurſed of

the <hi>habitation of Devils, and the Hold of every foul Spirit, a Cage

which they hold forth in that poyſonous, and filthy Cup

Actors and Contrivers of theſe wicked and cruel Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
whoſe Names as we well know, ſo we are ſure the hand of
God will find them out, making them (who have been the terrour

and torture of men of all degrees,) to become as <hi>Paſhur Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gornoiſſabis,

from proſperous wickedneſs, to miſerable puniſhments; as
<hi>Chaff</hi> toffed to and fro by the breath of Gods diſpleaſure, and
the execration, or abhorrence of all people in all Nations, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
and Heathen, where ever they are driven to be <hi>Vagabonds</hi>
and <hi>Runnagates,</hi> carrying with them in their feſter'd Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
the forked Arrow, of their deceiving, and then cruelly
deſtroying both their <hi>King,</hi> and their Country.</p>
            <p>And this, till they are caſt into <hi>the chains of utter darkneſs,</hi>
who have <hi>quenched the light of Iſrael,</hi> and to everlaſting flames,

            <p>No perſon of Worth, Honour, or Piety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but will ever <hi>loath

abhor ever <hi>to marry, or make any affinity with them, or their

abominated will they be as to <hi>any Communion with them in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or other religious duties,</hi> who having turned the <hi>Grace of God
into wantonneſs;</hi> cannot but already hear <hi>Judas's</hi> ſilent clamors,
deep deſpairings, and ſelf-condemnings; Like <hi>Julian the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi>
they cannot but feel the ſecret and ſmart ſtrokes of God in
their Conſciences, for betraying, perſecuting, and deſtroying
the innocent blood of our King. O Earth cover it not, O Time
forget it not, O Heaven fail not to revenge their prodigal and
cruel waſt of ſo royal and precious blood! Surely without any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
raſhneſs, <hi>they</hi> may be ſuſpected to be paſt all grace,
and recovery by any Prayers. There remaining for ſuch <hi>ſinners
of the ſin to death,</hi> ſuch <hi>relapſing Swine,</hi> and <hi>reſorbing Dogs,</hi> who
pretending to have <hi>eſcaped the pollutions of the World,</hi> are returned
to their mire and vomit; feigning to be illuminated Saints, yet
have wrought ſuch works of thick darkneſs, nothing but a fearful
<hi>expectation of vengeance,</hi> and fiery indignation to conſume them,
without infinite mercys</p>
            <p>They have impudently, and trayterouſly judged, condemned,
and murthered the King, upon the pretence of his <hi>raiſing War
againſt the Parliament;</hi> of which Fact themſelves are doubly,
and moſt unqueſtionably guilty before all the World, twice me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing,
invading, and forcibly aſſaulting their Maſters in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106802:13"/>
two Houſes of Parliament. Nor if their charge had been true
againſt the King (which upon his death he both denied, and
moſt evidently proved by the legal right he had to the Militia,
and the date of their Commiſſions for raiſing VVar, before His
Majeſties were out) yet were not theſe Uſurpers any <hi>competent
Judges</hi> by God or Man appointed: Nor was indeed that calumny
the real motive of their ſudden, bloody, and reſumed cruelty;
but only that extream fear, hatred, and terrour, their hypocriſie,
and villany had conceived againſt the Kings excellent wiſdom,
conſtant piety, and immovable goodneſs; which they had ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and ſo unmeaſurably abuſed; and which they ſaw was the
chiefeſt obſtacle in the way of their Sacrilegious Ambitions.</p>
            <p>And now like deſperate Empyricks, upon whoſe cruel tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
we have ſpent our Blood, our Eſtates, our Lives, the honour
of our Nation, and the credit of our Reformed Religion: You
(now) pretend to ſtop that bloody iſſue (which by tumult and
treaſon you have made) by deſtroying the whole Royal Family,
and letting out all the Antient blood of our Kings out of the
veins of theſe Kingdoms: To extirpate Kings, Peers, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments;
and by <hi>addle fictions</hi> of your weak and confuſed brains,
to obtrude the <hi>frippery</hi> and <hi>gullery</hi> of your <hi>Agreement of the
People</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if all Rules of Juſtice, all true Policy, and Reaſon of State,
and good grounds of Government (no leſs than all wickedneſs,
cruelty, hypocriſie, and treaſon) only dwelt in your <hi>ſhallow
brains,</hi> and <hi>narrow hearts;</hi> Who for the moſt part are not guilty
of any Learning, or Civil Improvements, are open and declared
Authors of Ignorance, Confuſion and Tyranny, Enemies to all
ſober Manners, and good Orders, both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>Nor do thoſe <hi>great things</hi> (as you call them) which you have
hitherto with moſt infamous treachery, and cruelty, peracted and
attained, any way render you conſiderable with ſober, godly,
and truly wiſe men: For what may not Frontleſs <hi>Hypocrites</hi> do,
who have forſaken God, and given themſelves over to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
Captivity, when impowered with Arms and Might, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve

            <p>But you O hardned and <hi>infatuated Regicides,</hi> can you in good

the wide deep and feſtered wounds, which your treacherous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty

            <p>No, your ſelves know, that very Title, which you ſhameleſly

            <p>
               <hi>Conſcience</hi> you can have none; ſince your <hi>lights</hi> are ſo <hi>Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>

            <p>It is hoped, that God hath yet ſo much mercy left in ſtore for

Chriſtians without Chriſt, Churches without Miniſters,

God, willfully degeneraring to Beaſts, without ſenſe of Vertue
or Vice, ſhame or honour, without fear of Hell, hopes of
Heaven, or thoughts of Eternity; and all this to maintain a few
Tyrannous Hypocrites, and Sodomitick Saints, the cry of whoſe

cannot countervail, or expiate, being but as ſo many Dogs heads
to ſuch a Boon.)</p>
            <p>Unleſs you can ſtop the Mouths of all men, or cut their
Throats, or ſear their Conſences, or perſwade them to damn
their Souls, for your ſakes, to gratifie a few <hi>Cauteriſed</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
bloody and ambitious Spirits among you.</p>
            <p>You cannot but hear the ſound of much Vengeance coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, to which your own <hi>black Souls</hi> ſummon you, and which
your own Conſciences will in the firſt place ſilently, but yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
execute upon you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:106802:20"/>
Nor will your <hi>Seeming Smiles,</hi> and <hi>forced confidences,</hi> nor yet
the Applauſes of your ſordid Flatterers, and deſperate Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
nor yet the aſſiſtance of your numerous and deluded
Souldiers, be able to exempt you from that ſtorm of Fire and
Brimſtone, that Pit, Snare, Curſe, and Hell, which purſues you,
and is ready to overtake you.</p>
            <p>How can ſuch <hi>Zimri's,</hi> who have ſo trayterouſly ſlain ſuch a
King, their Lord and Maſter, ever hope to have peace, or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in this, or the other World? Since the Juſtice of Divine
Providence (in a Caſe where his Name was not blaſphemed,
and ſo his Glory not ſo concerned, as in this, (of your murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo lawful, and ſo Chriſtian a King) ſuffered not any of the
Murtherers of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> who was but an Uſurper, to dye
other than a violent, and immature death. Nor will (we hope)
our <hi>Solomon</hi> by Gods bleſſing, and his Subjects aſſiſtance, ſuffer
the hairy Scalps of thoſe who were the chief Counſellors, and
Actors, in deſtroying his dear Father, and our Dread Soveraign,
to go down to the Grave in peace, or to dye a dry death, who
have ſhed the blood of War, in a time when all Differences were
by a Treaty drawn to a Peace and Union.</p>
            <p>We can never think, that a <hi>Babel</hi> of ſo confuſed a faſhion, of
ſuch a headlong height, as yours is; ſuch a Toads-ſtool ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grown out of the Earth of Beggary and Ignorance, by Fraud
and Cruelty, lately watered with the blood of the King, and his
Subjects, can long thrive or ſtand; having no foundation in the
World, or any ſhew of reaſon, equity, honour, peace, liberty,
or piety to ſupport it. Not any ſeeming Authority (for due
and legall you could have none upon Earth.) Not any general
deſire, delight, conſent, or Agreement, in what you have
done, or propound further to do; but rather a general deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
an utter abhorrence, and a perfect hatred of you, and your
deeds; which honeſt men will then agree to, and ſubſcribe, when
they can be content to love <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> or to hate God, and
their Souls.</p>
            <p>Nor doubt we, but many of thoſe <hi>Souldiers,</hi> whoſe <hi>valour</hi>
and <hi>ſimplicity</hi> you have thus far groſſely abuſed, by ingaging them
in ſuch deſperate aſſiſtances (whoſe profit will redound to but

deſperate men, filled with the Quinteſſence of all wickedneſs,
fraught with flatterie, crueltie, hypocriſie, tyrannie, and all
degrees of malicious Villany, incident to humane nature, have
ſince the world began, and Mankind hath been planted upon the
Earth, ever committed the like Villanies (which exceed all
names of Vice and Infamies) or ever more deſerved to be made
a publick Curſe, and univerſal Execration to all Mankind, to
have their perſons cut off from the face of the Earth, and buried
with the burial of an Aſs; to have their Poſterity, as a Peſtilent
Progenie ſpewed out of the Land, (unleſs they fully declare their
unfeigned and utter abhorrence of their Fathers Villanies, who
have defiled the Land with the blood of the King;) That their
Houſes (which are neither great nor many) may be raiſed;
that their memories may be blotted out from under Heaven, or
only remembred with perpetual ſcorn, curſing and infamie.</p>
            <p>Since they have beſides many other preparatorie miſchiefs, by
murthering the King, diſ-inheriting his Poſteritie, and diſſolving
this antient and flouriſhing Monarchy, (as far as lies in their
power and malice) put us upon this miſerable choice; Either
cowardly, baſely, and ſhamefully to ſubmit to their deteſtable
and unſatiable Tyrannie; or to be ever oppreſſed with a War in
our own bowels; in which we muſt either expoſe our Lives and
Fortunes to theſe mens covetous Cruelty, or help to enſlave and
deſtroy our ſelves by aſſiſting theſe Uſurpers; or compel the
Rightful Heir of theſe Kingdoms, our hopeful <hi>King</hi> CHARLS

denied that juſt aſſiſtance, which as his Subjects we ought to
afford him againſt the Murtherers of his and our Countries Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
his own Enemies, and indeed of all <hi>Kingly Majeſty,</hi> and
Mankind; the Diſſolvers of our Parliaments, the Oppreſſors
of our Liberties, the Exhauſters of our Eſtates, the Suckers of
our Blood, the Blaſphemers of our Religion, the Damners of
our Souls (unleſs God preſerve us,) the Crucifiers afreſh of
the Lord of Glory, and putting him to open ſhame.</p>
            <p>The Crie of the blood of our King, the Voice of the Genius
of this Nation, and the Alarm of Gods Juſtice, call aloud to all
honeſt men of Foraign Nations round about, to all loyal Subjects
in theſe three Kingdoms, to all men of any common honeſty or

Gods and Mans ſevereſt Juſtice on theſe perfidious Truce-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
proud Uſurpers, cruel Hypocrites, traiterous Apoſtates, and
barbarous King-killers.</p>
            <p>We cannot but ſend the divided parts of our dead but endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

whether this hideous Villany were committed with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,

it was ever thus done in any Chriſtian Nation or Kingdom,
by any Army of pretending Saints, or any men, we ſay not of
Common Honeſty, but of the moſt exquiſite and ſtudied Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
Whether any thing can be produced out of Common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of ſound Reaſon, out of the Laws of God, out of Chriſts
Holy Precepts, out of the Actions and Examples of any holy

or excuſe the Actions of theſe men; or to ſatisfie any mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
that doth not utterly abhorre, and ſeriouſly endeavour
to expiate the ſin and guilt of ſuch Deteſtable Villanies.</p>
            <p>According to the heaped and over-running meaſure of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

fears God, knows the Memory and Vertues of ſo good a King,
loves his Country, will keep a good Conſcience, and deſires to
