            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

known love all conspire to make
me obnoxious to any good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
you please to give me; yet the
aversness I have from answering Books,
permitted me not, in our last enterview, to
promise obedience to your directions. But,
since that happines of seeing you, an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
consent of other friends has made
me more steadily reflect on what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd;
and considering besides, that the
Doctrine of <hi>Rushworth's Dialogues</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:47186:3"/>
takes a path not much beaten by our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Controvertists, I resolv'd to imitate
the example of the penitent Son, who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
denial, perform'd his Fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
Behold then, here, the brood hatcht
and brought forth by your advice: 'pray
heaven it prove worthy your acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!
which I say, not, to engage you in the
patronage of what I deliver, farther then
truth shal convince your judgment; or to
make the World imagin these Conceptions
may find shelter in your breast: No, I am as
cruel to my writings, as the Ostridge to her
Eggs: when once they are laid, let nature
play her part to foster or smother the Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens,
as she pleases. Let truth commend
or condemn my sayings. He that is ready
to renounce falsity, and acknowledge his
weaknes, is stronger then envy, and beyond
the shot of malice. Neither have I occasion
to suspect any imputation should fall upon
you for this publishing my Present to you,
as I fear it happen'd to another friend:
For, I apprehend, I may have written here
some Periods, which none wil expect should
be approved by you; Only, who understands
<pb facs="tcp:47186:3"/>
the amplitude of your soule, may know, it
is able to harbour with indifferency what
is spoken against your own sense and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
it being the gift and task of a wise
man, <hi>Imperare liberis.</hi> What I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
wherin fail'd, is your part to judg;
for my self, I can profess I desire not to
irritate the meanest person, nor seek I the
glory of oppugning the Greatest: my ayne
is, to open and establish truth; Frivolous
and by-questions I have on set purpose
avoided. Whether all objections of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are answered, as I cannot affirm, so
I can protest I am no more conscious of
declining any, then of dissembling, when
I write my self</p>

to you was written, that no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it should now be asham'd to
come abroad without some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
to justify the slowness of its
pace; which is no other, then a simple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
that it has not stuck in my hands for at
least a whol yeer and an half. Upon these
few words I could sit down and confidently
promise my self your pardon; But emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
imputations force me to a larger Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy:
The expedition in some other late

Now, since, from that long and constant
commerce you have stil maintain'd with
true Vertue &amp; Learning, I cannot but expect
a great rationality and amplitude in your
Soul, even to bear with the defectuousnes of
others, as far as you see they govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
by that measure of understanding
which God affords them, I find my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to give you the best account I can of
my proceedings, which I doubt not wil
prove so much an easier task, as you, with
whom I am to deal, are of a higher strain,
then our trivial discoursers; for, as I think,
those who set up their rest, that there is no
science to be attain'd by study, are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
if they chuse opinions by pretence of
devotion or reality of interest: So I give my
cause for lost, if <hi>they</hi> be my Judges. But I
hope the great fire of truth, which first kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
in my young breast a glowing of it, and
an earnestnes of seeking it in St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his
way, has not been by length of time as much
quench'd in you, as quickn'd in me; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with a ful confidence I represent my
Case to you, not doubting but the evidence
I produce wil justifie, if not the action it
self, at least the necessity I have to act as long
as the present perswasion is not forc'd from
me.</p>
            <p>To come then to my Plea; If St. <hi>Peter</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb facs="tcp:47186:5"/>
us <hi>to be ready to give satisfaction to all
that shall ask it, concerning the hope that is in
us,</hi> by which is meant our belief, the basis
and firm support of our hope; If the design
of all that meddle with this sort of study
should chiefly aim to shew, that the doctrins
of Christianity are conformable to reason,
and such as a prudent Person, though also
learned, may imbrace, without prejudice ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his discretion, or knowledge: If the
suggesting to our first parents, that God
sought to govern them like fools, without
the least discernment betwixt good or evil,
be the greatest and unworthiest calumny Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
himself could invent to charge upon the
Almighty: If it be the basest condition that
can befal a rational Essence, and the most
contrary both to God and man, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
consist in knowing and reasoning;
what can I conclude, but that such Teachers,
as, for ignorance or interest, obstinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
(in treating with those who are out
of the Church) to maintain opinions, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
no account can be made, either out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
or Reason, are unworthy the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they profess, and highly obstructive to
the progress of the Catholik faith?</p>
            <p>You, who have looked into the large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
of Controvertists on both sides, cannot
but know they are petty questions, and the
<pb facs="tcp:47186:5"/>
impugnances of private opinions, that swel
those vast Tomes into such an unweldy and
intolerable bulk; I'm sure not only I, but
divers of my friends have had experience,
that those very opinions (for opposing
which, I am exclaimd against) have been the
retardment of the most ingenious and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interessed
party of Protestants; and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who were become Catholiks, out of a
pure necessity which they saw of submitting
themselvs to some unerring authority, when
they heard their faith declar'd in a rational
way, found themselvs eased, as it were, of
chains and imprisonment, and translated
into a natural state and liberty. I need not
press, how ulcers in our vitals, are more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
then in our outward members; and
that we cannot convince others, whilst our
selvs are ignorant in the Points we pretend
to teach them. No wise Captain searches the
Hospitals for <hi>Perdues</hi> &amp; Forcers of breaches.
It is a great step towards the reducing others
to reason, if first we make our own thoughts
rational. This is my endeavour, this is my
fault, for which I am so deeply censur'd, even
by Catholiks.</p>
            <p>As for Persons, my writings neither name
nor touch any: and those who make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
pointed at by their forward boasts of
defending the opinions I dispute against, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:47186:6"/>
understand not me or themselvs: for, did
it deserve the pains, I would undertake to
shew out of their printed Writers, that they
doe not, with any universality, maintain
those tenets I contradict. If in this present
Treatise I have in one place descended to
more particulars then my course and nature
incline me to, I appeal to your own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether I do more then follow my
Adversary, by replying upon his very
words; and therfore your commands ought
to be my excuse.</p>
            <p>But some think, at least this conjuncture
improper to begin this Work, &amp; I wish they
could give me a good cause of delay; they
should finde me very ready to accept it; But
I know no time in which destructive Errors
should live unconfuted; our great Master
securing us by his example, <hi>neque ad horam
cessimus;</hi> nor can your self be ignorant with
what fury and violence the opposite opinion
strives at this very day to possess the Chruch
of God, and break the eternal Rule of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
faith. Wherfore, though conscious of
my own weaknes, and that, unless God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
shews his power, my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
wil take no place, yet <hi>propter</hi> Sion <hi>non
tacebo, &amp; propter</hi> Hierusalem <hi>non quiescam.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus it will sometimes happen;
that events of greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
take their rise from smal
occasions. The <hi>Controversy,</hi> this
following <hi>Treatise</hi> undertakes,
began in a slight familiar conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two intimate friends and <hi>kinsmen,</hi> as
it were only for exercise to train themselvs,
and practice their postures: but since by
the entrance of new <hi>Allies</hi> is become of so
high concernment, that what at first was a
private voluntary <hi>skirmish,</hi> seems now to
spread it selfe into a publique and solemn
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47186:10"/>
                  <hi>War.</hi> Nor need I strain much to make good
the <hi>phrase,</hi> since the <hi>eminent Names,</hi> on the
one side, and the great advantage of ground
on the other, may justly be admitted to
supply the number of an <hi>Army</hi> in both.</p>
               <p>And, because I desire to prepare my self
with the fittest proportion I could for the
<hi>assaults</hi> of my Adversaries, I have declin'd
the Sword and Buckler, and taken up a
single Rapier; chang'd the antique weapons
of <hi>Dialogue,</hi> (though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in my opinion, they
want neither ornament nor particular effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy)
into the modern <hi>mode</hi> of direct dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
Wherein, as I confesse, <hi>Their</hi> guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Armour</hi> shines more, and dazles the ey;
so I fear not, when we come to charge, our
courser steel wil prove substantial and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable.
However I shall not spend much
time in <hi>parley;</hi> but after a short relation
how I come to be drawn into the quarrel,
and by what method I intend to carry it
on, I shall immediately advance to a close
<hi>encounter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before those <hi>Dialogues</hi> (wherein that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
private conference is at larg delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
were brought to light, or (as I think)
fully conceiv'd in the Authors brain; an
honoured friend,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sr.</hi> K. D.</note> and Patron of mine had
couch'd some smal, but quintessential part
of their doctrin in a little pithy Present to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47186:10"/>
a new-converted Lady; and having cited it
afterward for brevity sake, in a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sial
Epistle to an eminent Friend,<note place="margin">L. Digby.</note> engag'd it
therby into an almost fatal combat; nothing
but truth being able to rescue it from so
potent an enemy.</p>
               <p>Besides, a deceased friend of mine having
oblig'd me to declare my opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a witty discourse made by one of his
acquaintance, extorted from me an unlick'd
<hi>Mola,</hi> representing suddenly and imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">L. Falkl.</note>
my judgement in reference to that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
work. This again, stirring the same
humours, drew the doctrin into an eminent
danger of encountring opposition. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
God so ordering it, many years past,
in calm and happy daies of peace, the two
Adversaries (whom these occasions had
provoked) not publishing their Labours, as
things below their persons; till all-disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
time (as I believe) against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
intentions, brought them both to
light, and, by consequence, an imputation
on those <hi>Dialogues,</hi> and a necessity on me to
dis-engage the honour of their Composer.</p>
               <p>In order to which, my intention is not to
reply minutely to either of the Opponents
works; muchles to handle any by-questions:
but only to chuse out of them, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
what I conceive may possibly be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47186:11"/>
thought as yet unanswer'd, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
capable of prejudicing those <hi>Dialogues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this reserv'd and moderate temper, I
hope to free my self from all such incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as necessarily attend on the undertaking
to convince a particular person of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or inconsequence in his discours, from
which kind of captious proceedings, besides
my Reason, I am beholding to my Nature
for its extream aversnes. Besides, in answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a writing, many impertinent quarrels
are pick'd, the substantial controversie lost
or confounded, and the Truth it self, by
multiplicity, left more obscure then when
the disputant began: for, where many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
are started and none deeply searched
into, the Reader goes away without any
resolution, more then what himself brought
along with him. I intend therefore with all
candor and fidelity, to select such objections
as I think really interest the Controversie;
and handle them without relation to Books
or distinction of Authors, or citations of
places: as one who seeks Truth, not the
glory of confuting or vanity of answering.</p>
               <p>But some may be unsatisfied with my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
and demand, if this be my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
why do I cite <hi>those Authors</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and, as it were, make a shew of answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
without any effect: I desire those to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47186:11"/>
consider, that the <hi>names</hi> of Author's carry
weight, among two sorts of Readers; One,
such as diligently peruse the books written
on both sides; to whom I offer this satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
that they may find the solution to
any difficulty which occurs concerning this
subject, in their writings: The other, such
who look no farther then the Title page, or
whether a book be answer'd or no, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
upon the writers name, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely
clamorous, that 'tis a Piece beyond
all possibility of reply, be it never so weak
and trivial; to whom the simple profession
that <hi>'tis answered,</hi> is a wedg fit for their
knot.</p>
               <p>I must confesse, next to the assurednesse of
my Cause, 'tis my chiefest comfort to deal
with <hi>Persons</hi> of such <hi>quality:</hi> such as the
Protestant party never produced before: it
seems to have chosen them to live by, or die
with. Two, whose Merits found the way
of honouring their Descents, by their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity;
whose eloquence none were found
to exceed, whose wits none wil be found to
equal. What erudition in <hi>Languages,</hi> or
acutenes in <hi>Logick</hi> could furnish, was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
in their breasts: But above all, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
judgement, in managing the
numerous and weighty affairs of a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
to the very heightning that sublime and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47186:12"/>
subtlest Office, <hi>(Secretary of State)</hi> which
<hi>they</hi> both, successively, exalted to such a
pitch, that it must expect a fall in whoever
shall succeed them.</p>
               <p>One is, the right honourable <hi>George Lord
Digby</hi> (now Earl of <hi>Bristol)</hi> ever mounting the
scale of Honour to a degree so far above the
reach of others, that 'tis even beyond their
sight: The other, <hi>Lucius Lord Falkland,</hi> who
crown'd his deserved <hi>Lawrell</hi> with a wreath
of Oaken <hi>Scyons;</hi> dying in such a posture, as
if mischief could not have ravag'd <hi>England,</hi>
had it not made its passage through the
brest of that Martyr of Peace. I can accuse
him of nothing, but that he left this Book
behind him; it being too plain what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
impression it maks in his Friends,
since my self, almost a stranger, cannot read
those quaint and gentile expressions, those
rarities of wit, those coruscations of <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Latine</hi> remarques, and (which most of
all surprizes my admiration) those Noble
sweetnesses and civilities so unexpected in a
quarrelling Treatise; but I feel in my heart
an unusual sorrow and regret, that our
thoughts cannot stay on him, without the
sad check of a <hi>fuit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, since we are out of hope to resusci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
him that's gon, like the day he died on;
let us (by <hi>Davids</hi> example) leave these flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47186:12"/>
weaknesses of nature, and seek severe
reason in the controversy we pretend to
manage.</p>

               <head>THE
FIRST ENCOUNTER, Explicating the Argument, by which
RUSHWORTH proves the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of Tradition.</head>
               <p>THe Dialogues (in whose defence we
now appear, as Second) govern their
discourse by this fair method: First, they
treat and settle these definitions; <hi>Tradition
we call, the delivery of Christs doctrin from hand
to hand, in that part of the world which, with
propriety, is call'd Christian:</hi> By <hi>Christs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
we mean <hi>that</hi> which was <hi>generally</hi>
preach'd by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and contains <hi>all</hi>
such points as are <hi>necessary</hi> to the salvation
of the <hi>World;</hi> not only in particular, to
<hi>single</hi> persons, but for <hi>government</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and bringing <hi>multitudes,</hi> with <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,</hi>
to perfection in this life, and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in the next. Which being establisht,
they immediately proceed to this general
Position, that <hi>All Christ taught, or the Holy
Ghost suggested to the Apostles, of this nature,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47186:13"/>
is, by a direct uninterrupted liue, entirely and
fully descended to the present Church, which
communicates with, and acknowledges subjection
to the Roman:</hi> Adding also the convers of
that proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> Nothing is so descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but <hi>such Truths;</hi> nor any thing held by
this tenure, but what is <hi>so</hi> descended; which
being cast up, amounts to this great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
<hi>No errour was ever, or can be embraced
by the Church, in quality of a matter of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The proof consists in this: Since 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the Catholik Church goes upon this
Maxim, that <hi>Her Doctrine is received from
Christ, and still handed along to the present
generation;</hi> they who cavil at this assertion,
should assign some Age when they conceive
an errour crept in; and the maintainer
should prove it enter'd not in <hi>that Age,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>that</hi> Age held nothing was to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
as of Faith, except what was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to it by the former: but the Objectors
themselves say, this supposed errour was
not deliver'd by the former, since they put
it to be, now, first, believ'd; therfore the
Age in which they imagin this errour crept
in, could not be the first that believ'd it.</p>
               <p>And, lest some might reply, though the
<hi>present Roman Church</hi> stands now upon the
proposed maxim, yet anciently it did not;
the same argument may be thus reiterated,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47186:13"/>
If this principle which now governs the
Church had not always done so, it must
have been introduced in some Age since the
Apostles: name therfore the Age, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
'tis urged, either the Church had assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
in that Age, all she held was descended
lineally, as we spake, from the Apostles, or
not: If so, then questionless she held her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
upon that maxim; For it is the only
undoubted and <hi>self-evident</hi> principle: If not,
then she wilfully belyed her self, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
to damn all her posterity, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
taking up this new Rule of faith and
commanding it to be accepted by all the
world, as the necessary doctrin of Christ
and his Apostles, descended upon the present
age by universal Tradition from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
and for such to be deliver'd to their
children; and all this against the express
evidence of her own conscience. Thus far
reaches the argument.</p>
               <p>He that shall compare this perpetuation
of the <hi>Church,</hi> with the constancy of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
mankind; and proportion the love
of happiness and natural inclination to
<hi>truth,</hi> (which is in the superiour part of
mankind, and commands powerfully in it)
to the material appetite of procuring <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
succession, and weigh what accidents are
able and necessary to interrupt the progress
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47186:14"/>
of one and the other, will find the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Religion</hi> far stronger and less defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then <hi>that</hi> of <hi>mankind;</hi> supposing them
once rooted alike in universality and setled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Since therfore the means of conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nature to its true and chief end, <hi>Felicity,</hi>
are more principally intended, then those
by which it is simply preserv'd in <hi>being;</hi>
this Contemplator will clearly discern, that
if humane nature continue to the last and
dreadful day, this succession also of a <hi>true
Church</hi> must be carried on through the same
extent of time: there appearing indeed no
purpose why the world should endure a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
longer, if this once come to fail; that
part of mankind, which arrives to bliss, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the end why the rest was made, as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is the end for which all the other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Creatures are set on work.</p>
               <p>Again, if a rational discourser should
plot in his head how, with condescendence
to the weakness of our nature, he might
bring mankind to bliss; and, to this end,
plant in it a perpetual and constant know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the true and straight way thither; &amp;
did observe that Man in his immature age
is naturally subject to believe, and after
his ful growth, tenacious of what he had
suck'd in with his milk: could he chuse
but see, that to make the <hi>Mothers</hi> flatter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47186:14"/>
into their <hi>Children</hi> the first elements of the
acquisition of Beatitude, and continually
go on nursing them up in the maxims of
piety, till their stronger years gave a steddy
setledness to their minds; must needs be the
most sweet and connatural way that can be
imagin'd, to beget a firm and undoubted
assent to those happy principles.</p>
               <p>If he think on, and chance to light on
this truth, that the greatest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
some through dulness of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
some by the distractions of seeking
necessaries for their subsistence, or at least
conveniences for their accommodation, and
others for the diffluence of nature to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and Vanities, are, to their very depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
hour, wholly incapable of searching
out their <hi>Religion,</hi> either by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
or the learned books of others:
I cannot doubt but such a considerer would
without the least difficulty or hesitation,
conclude that, were it his design to set up a
Religion, which he would have constantly
and universally propagated, he must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
pitch upon this way; And so, with a
resolute and pious confidence pronounce, if
God has not already taken this course, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he should have done it.</p>
               <p>To these considerations give my pen leave
to add the confession of our Adversaries,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47186:15"/>
who boldly acknowledge the <hi>Roman Church</hi>
has had universal Tradition for the whole
body of its faith ever since St. <hi>Gregories</hi>
days; which is now a thousand years, and
very near two parts of the three that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion has endured. They confess
those Doctrins, which are common to us
and them, remain in our Church uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and have still descended from Father
to Son, <hi>by vertue of Tradition,</hi> since the very
times of the Apostles. They will not deny
the Ages, betwixt <hi>Constantine</hi> and St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi>
flourisht with an infinity of Persons
famous both for piety and learning; and
the Church never more vigilant, never more
jealous, being continually alarm'd by such
Troops of powerful and subtle Hereticks:
so that there is no likelihood, gross errours
(such as Idolatry and Superstition import)
could creep in undiscern'd, in those days.
And perhaps, much less betwixt <hi>Constantine</hi>
and the <hi>Apostles;</hi> the time being so short that
it scarce exceeds the retrospection of those
who liv'd with <hi>Constantine:</hi> At least that
age could evidently know what was the
faith of Christendom in the age of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
great Grand-children, and they again
be certainly assured of the Doctrin of the
Apostles disciples, their Grandfathers.
Which is an evidence beyond all testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47186:15"/>
of writers, that since <hi>Constantines</hi> time
it was known by a kind of self-sight what
the Grandchildren of the Apostles held, and
it could not be doubted of them but they
knew and held the doctrin of the <hi>Apostles;</hi>
that, I say, in <hi>Constantines</hi> time, the publike
doctrin of Christianity was the doctrin of
the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, the communication of Christians
being very difficult and infrequent, during
those persecutions; the contagion also of
heresies scatter'd it self slowly among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in those times. And here I shall note
a ridiculous cavil, very common not only
in the mouths of the more rash and shallow
Protestants, but even in the writings of many
of their gravest and most solemn Doctors,
who cry out against the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of our
Church, as the cause of our errors, and yet
put the Ages in which they insult, that <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebat
Scriptura cum vetustis Autoribus,</hi> some
hundreds of years after the time, wherin
they acknowledg the doctrins, term'd er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
were already flourishing; as if they
could proceed, from a defect which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
them: A slander so palpably absur'd
that all the charity I have can scarce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
me to think they are not blinded ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with malice then ignorance, that dare
vent such gross contradictions.</p>

And now, having abridg'd as 'twere, the

               <head>THE
SECOND ENCOUNTER, Defeating three oppositions made against
Tradition.</head>
               <p>THe first objection against the form is,
that I put my Adversary to prove his
position instead of going about to maintain
my own. This they imagin, because I bid
them assign the Age; which they take to be
as much as a demand of them to prove that
in such a time came in the error: but 'tis a
plain mistake. For I do not require they
should prove the errour began in such an
Age; but only exact of them, for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sake, to name the Age in which they
find most difficulty for me to conclude, or
wherin they conceive the sinnews of my
discours will be most slack and feeble: for
the force of the main argument is indifferent
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47186:16"/>
to any Age they can pitch upon, equally
demonstrative in all, and so, by striking at
every one, concludes against all. This I say
not, any way to disclaim the advantage we
Catholicks have, whilst we press our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
to prove his <hi>Thesis,</hi> being no less a
just then strong and secure retreat; and
which I reserve my self the liberty of reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to, perhaps, at another time: but now
I only urge him to name one Age at haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
meerly to give way to the prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the argument; a Justice I might do for
my self, if I would, without his courtesie,
and have all the laws of disputation bear
me out in it.</p>
               <p>It is therefore to litle purpose to demand,
whether I ask of the first man that held such
an opinion, or when it came to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
(though the question be plainly of this
later, for we hold it was ever so;) nor is
there any art necessary to answer it, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
made being indifferent to all. The
skill therefore required, is only to know
what belongs to the form of demonstrating;
for the most part, indeed, not found in the
quaint discourses of Rhetoricians. But the
Adversary thinks, when the Question is put
concerning a Doctrine's being <hi>Vniversal,</hi> it
must suppose none to hold the contrary
opinion; as if we could not know what is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47186:17"/>
the publick Faith of <hi>France,</hi> because perhaps
a few conceal'd persons may believe som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
different. Wherin, he reflects not, that
<hi>Heresie</hi> signifies the cleaving to a private
opinion: so that, when there were any such
in former ages, that very thing made them
<hi>Hereticks</hi> (how good wits or great learning
so ever they had) if they dissented from the
doctrine deliver'd by their forefathers. He
presses, Catholiks cannot tell when the
communicating of Children began, since
St. <hi>Austin</hi> thinks it an Apostolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
We answer, we are of that mind too:
but with this qualification, that it was a
Tradition begun by some Apostles, not all,
in some Countries, not all, in some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
not all: And therfore 'twas neither
superstition to use it, nor sacriledg to leave
it off; how strongly soever the opponent
avers one of these two to be unavoydable.</p>
               <p>The second opposition made against the
form is, that 'tis a fallacy of that kind, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Soritae,</hi> in which the <hi>Scepticks</hi> found so
great difficulty, that they used to press
them against the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and other dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
as insoluble and manifestly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
there was no science. But, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the meaning of this objection, the
demonstration propos'd is to begin from
the Apostles time: and so it must be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47186:17"/>
that the next Age after the Apostles, in
any controversy against new doctrins, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
no farther then on which side stood
the verdict of the Apostles, wherof they
could not be ignorant. The Argument
therfore pressed that the next (that is, the
third Age) must of necessity take the same
method against its Novellists, convincing
them of falsity, because their doctrine was
contrary to <hi>that</hi> of those who had heard the
Disciples of the Apostles speak. And so,
since the Tradition of Faith was convey'd
from age to age, stil with this caution, that
the latter was to believe such a doctrin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
receiv'd from the former, upon this
warrant that it descended lineally from
Christ in the same manner, to them, as they
deliver'd it to their posterity; it necessarily
follows, that this doctrin could not but
continue pure even to our present time: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
some age should prevaricate all bounds
of truth and nature, and deliver somthing
to the following age, as traditionally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from Christ, which had not been so
receiv'd.</p>
               <p>This argument, so propos'd (though I
know not whether so understood) seem'd to
the opponent like the ratiocination of one
Mr. <hi>Thinn,</hi> a melancholy Philosopher, who
perswaded himself, a person might be found
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47186:18"/>
that could leap from off <hi>Pauls</hi> (for sure he
needed a high standing) to <hi>Rome,</hi> because
'twas possible some man might leap full
twenty foot, and no doubt but another som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more, and still another more then he,
and so without end; therfore among all,
one quick springer would be found, who
could make his jump from hence to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But certainly he that weigh'd the two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
might without extraordinary stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
have found there was some difference in
their form: Mr. <hi>Thinn,</hi> being oblig'd to take
variety of men undetermined: but this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
engaging only sixteen ages, and
peradventure, not needing above six, or in
rigour, some three, and those such as have
had a real existence, wheras the Worlds du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and latitude are not sufficient to find
men enough to justify Mr. <hi>Thinns</hi> Proces.
This I say was obvious enough to any mean
understanding, not preoccupated with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
against the conclusion. But one,
who had understood how <hi>Aristotle</hi> unwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<hi>Zeno's</hi> fallacies, might easily have
known that Infinity it self could not add
more then one full foot to Mr. <hi>Thinns</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers:
if the encrease were made by sub-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional
parts, wherof the first was one
half foot; and if by equal quantities, as Feet
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47186:18"/>
or Inches, he would soon come to an end of
his addition, unlesse he put mens strength
and nimblenesse to be infinite. But to sit
Judge of Religion, of eternal bliss and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
some curious and unhappy wits dare
think requires neither so much indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
nor reflection as the composition of
quantity.</p>
               <p>Yet I cannot but admire it could scape a
piercing ey to discern, that as the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of Mr. <hi>Thinns</hi> discourse is ridiculous
and impossible, so <hi>that</hi> of the proposed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
is evident and undeniable. For
what ingenuous forehead will deny, but
such verities as all the world allows to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
still untainted in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
have descended by this traditionary way to
us from Christ? Wherfore both the possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and actuality of this way is not only
acknowledg'd by the unanimous confession
of all parties, but its force and efficacy
made evident by the downright violence of
reason: all the controversie being meerly
about the multitude and sufficiency of the
things receiv'd, not the impotency of the
means to convey them to us.</p>
               <p>But, to make an end of this petty Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
I appeal to all Masters, nay even Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in Geometry, whether this form of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
be not the same that <hi>Euclid, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:47186:19"/>
and <hi>Apollonius</hi> use in their severest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations?
As when <hi>Euclid</hi> undertakes
to demonstrate this plain and elementary
<hi>Theoreme,</hi> that <hi>No Circle can touch another in
more then one point;</hi> himself acts the part of
the Denier, and according to the law of
Mathematicks, supposes at random the other
point, to see whether the Proposition be
maintainable: and if the <hi>Contactus</hi> in the
point assign'd be proved impossible, by an
argument applyable to any other that can
be offered, the <hi>Theoreme</hi> remains infallibly
demonstrated, and the Rules of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and strict Science perfectly comply'd
with.</p>
               <p>The third opposition is drawn out of a
conceited impossibility of the case; and so
they demand how can it come to passe that
all the Doctors of one age should meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to instruct the world of Scholars
that are to succeed them in the next? an
action, if not impossible, at least so incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
as by no means to be aver'd without
legitimate Authority, which they say, is
wanting: And further, should we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
that not only all Doctors, but all
men of one age met with the men of the
next, to teach them; it were an enterprize so
highly impossible, as not to be thought on
even among the wildest capriches of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47186:19"/>
yet to so hard straits are we driven,
that we must defend the possibility of this
later assertion.</p>
               <p>Which to compasse, we distinguish this
word, <hi>Together,</hi> as capable of signifying an
<hi>unity</hi> either in <hi>place</hi> or <hi>time:</hi> and, if the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
mean one Age cannot meet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a <hi>Town</hi> or great <hi>Hall,</hi> as <hi>Councils</hi> use,
I am easily perswaded such interviews are
impossible; but if this Assembly needs only
the unity of time, I think it will require but
a moderate stock of faith to believe, either
that men of the same Age live together in
that Age, or that Fathers meet with their
Children. If then we put all Fathers and
Mothers, all Pastors and Teachers to make
one Age, and all Children and young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who come to be instructed, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
outlive their Tutors, to compose the
other age; I see no great impossibility in
this position, but a clear one in the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For, I cannot believe the Opponents
think, men, since Christs time, start out of
mole-hils with clods on their heads, as it
seems <hi>Empedocles</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> imagined, and
the <hi>Toscans</hi> of their wise <hi>Tages,</hi> high Master
of their skill in <hi>Augury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this answer cuts off another difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
urg'd by certain Speculatists, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
in some rude times, they imagine the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47186:20"/>
learned were few, and therfore subject to
corruption by hopes or fears, they might
more easily be prevail'd with to proclaim
a fals <hi>Tenet</hi> in that Age; whence, this claim
of infallibility would remain broken: But
the former answer saves it; for since neither
the great multitude of Instructors, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
persons can meet in any other as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
then that of the whole and open
World, all possibility of corruption is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
avoided.</p>

               <head>THE
THIRD ENCOUNTER, Solving two other Objections against the
infallibility of Tradition.</head>
               <p>THe fourth opposition denys the necessity
of assigning any Age wherein an errour
may be said to have crept in; because (say
they) an errour might begin first in one
Country, and insensibly steal over into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without any notice taken of its novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so that there is no time wherin its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
is discoverable: For proof, they
instance in some errour held by divers He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
in divers ages; and tell you, the best
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47186:20"/>
Historian knows who was first mentioned
to have broacht that errour: wheras perhaps
a less diligent or careless Writer may cite
some middle or late Author, attributing
to him the original invention of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>To this we reply, 'tis too desperate an
Answer to call a hundred years an insensible
time, to suppose all the Pastors stupify'd,
and the Doctors asleep for a whole century
together. At least, let us ask this fair que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
Was there no Doctor or Bishop made
it his business to promote that new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
within a hundred years? If you say, no;
how could an innovation of any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
importance get footing which had no
eminent patron? If you say yes; see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that was not the occasion of impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all heresies, when extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
divulged them: I, but you'l say, it was
so transcendent a Doctor that he overtopt
all. Here, I confess my weakness: for if
some sky-faln Angel, indeed, should come,
with tongue and pen more then humane, I
doubt not but he might perhaps endanger
a great part of the Church: but, if we make
our comparison only betwixt men; who
ever had the like reputation in the Greek
Church, as <hi>Origen?</hi> yet he was condemned
by the same Church. Who was more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47186:21"/>
then <hi>Eusebius Caesariensis?</hi> more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
then <hi>Eusebius Nicomediensis?</hi> more
subtle then <hi>Arius?</hi> Let us add a faction so
powerful, as to make ten Councils, to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
three hundred Bishops; yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this, the <hi>Arians</hi> were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
The <hi>Dragon</hi> drew but a <hi>third part</hi> of
the Stars; and the Apostle has armd us, even
against the treachery of Angels; charging
that, in spight of them, we cleave fast to
what we have receiv'd, to what was Preach'd
to us, that is, to <hi>Tradition:</hi> For rely but on
what, in memory of our own age, the
Church has universally held, and deliver'd,
as from Christ, and no subtlety of men or
Angels can make you mistake.</p>
               <p>Yet, Let it be supposed, some unparallel'd
Brain had the power to make a doctrin uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal;
could this stand with the still way of
creeping in insensibly? Is not this position,
that a Doctor was so great, &amp; took so much
pains to divulge his opinion, wrote so many
Books in defence of it, that he overcame all
opposers, and at last made it universal; and
yet all this while the new doctrin stole in
unawares, the Pastors of the Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dreaming any such thing: is not this as
very a Bull as to say, an Army shot off all
their Attillery, that the Enemy might not
discover where they lay? or to do, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47186:21"/>
of an acquaintance of mine, who
being in good company, to ride through a
Town, where he was afraid to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, at his entrance set spurs to his horse,
holding his Cane straight before him, and
Trumpeted <hi>Tararara Tararara</hi> the whole
length of the Town? Nevertheless, since
'tis for our side (says the <hi>Zelot)</hi> 'tis an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
demonstration.</p>
               <p>But we desire leave to consider one point
farther; In what times came in the errours,
our Adversaries so loudly complain of? see
whether they be not those ages when there
were great quarrels about innovations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching
on the Church, and multitudes
of exceptions taken: so that, had any side
entertain'd a new errour, not common to
both parties, especially if the novelties
were any way notable, they could not have
been pass'd over without mutual contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
or upbraidings. The doctrines
therfore which in those times pass'd unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
and were currantly admitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all parties, as being common to them
all, without question were not <hi>Errata, sed
Tradita.</hi> Whence, certainly it must needs
appear a manifest folly, to think any errour
could run through the Church so uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol'd,
as to gain, without the least sign of
opposition, an universality: and much like
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47186:22"/>
the story, that the great <hi>Turk,</hi> with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of three or four hundred thousand men,
should steal upon <hi>Germany</hi> by night and
take all the good fellows so fast asleep that
not a man should escape, nor so much as a
Goos <hi>gaggle</hi> to wake the drowsy neighbours,
and, having thus silently run over the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
should pass into <hi>France;</hi> and thence
into <hi>Spain,</hi> and still catch them all napping
without the least notice or resistance: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
if any slow and dull heart should doubt,
as seeming indeed somwhat an improbable
story, the reporter should immediatly prove
all with a <hi>why not?</hi> since the Greeks had
surpriz'd <hi>Troy</hi> so, and perhaps some other
great Captain one single Town or Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>Besides, if we venture to throw away a
little faith on so extravagant a fable; the
action will still remain unpossible to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd.
Who shall hinder the Conqueror
from proclaiming such unparalleld victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to applaud himself and terrifie the rest
of the world? who can forbid his souldiers
to Chronicle their own valours, and every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
boast such un-heard of exploits?
Certainly, were there no Catholick testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of these late unhappy divisions from
the Church, yet would succeeding ages find
evidence enough (as to the matter of fact)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47186:22"/>
even in the writings of the Reformers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs.
How often do their Books insult o're
the blindness of their Predecessors, and
triumph in the man of God <hi>Martin Luther,</hi>
and the quicker light <hi>Jo. Calvin,</hi> as first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers
of their new-found Gospel? can
we think it possible distracted <hi>Europe</hi> should
blot out of her memory the sad effects of
schism and heresy, before the tears they have
caus'd be wiped from her eys? for my part,
I am confident our once happy Island will
never forget the graceless disorders of <hi>Henry
the hights</hi> unfortunate intemperance, though
there were not one English Catholick left
in the world, to remember them by the
smart he endures ever since.</p>
               <p>Add to all this, the points, wherin <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
accuse us, are the most palpably absurd
positions that can fall into a Christians
head; as, making Gods of Saints or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which were the dotages of the basest
sort of Pagans.</p>
               <p>Nor is the example of errours often
sprung and often quell'd again, of any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the Opponent. For our questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerns opinions remaining till this
day, and by himself, supposed to have gaind
the mastery of the Church, and never fail'd
since their beginning: because all doctrins,
which appear to have a <hi>being</hi> before any age
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47186:23"/>
the Adversary can name, are thereby evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
proved perpetual Traditions; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when the Authors were such as lived
in Communion with the Catholik Church
then extant, and remain'd in veneration
with the Church succeeding.</p>
               <p>Methinks also since the opposer maintains
it was more then a whole Age in working it
self up to this universality, if the errour
were gross, it must without doubt have been
a long time in one Country, before it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into another; else we shall scarce find
a reason why it became not general in a
shorter period of years; and so it would
easily appear, until such an age that new
doctrin was never heard of: and in every
Country the beginnings would be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Historians and other writers: as,
who came out of <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>France</hi> to plant
<hi>Images,</hi> who first introduced the <hi>Priests</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of <hi>absolution,</hi> who invented the doctrine
of preferring the <hi>judgment</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our own <hi>private</hi> interpretation of
<hi>Scripture;</hi> all which we see exactly perform'd
against every considerable <hi>Heresy,</hi> a minute
and punctual account being stil <hi>upon Record,</hi>
who were the original contrivers, who the
principal abettors, where they found patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
where opposition, How long they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and when they died.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:47186:23"/>
To evade this reason, is fram'd the next
crimination, by saying what is answer'd
has its probability, if the errours laid to our
charge were <hi>contrary</hi> to Christian doctrine:
But they only pretend to accuse us of <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faetations,</hi>
or false and defective additions to
the Faith first planted; which excrescencies,
only, the Reformers seek to take away. And,
though it be manifest, when they come to
charge us in particular, they instance in
doctrines <hi>substantially</hi> opposite to the Faith
of Christ, as <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> could
their calumnies be justify'd against us: yet,
because this objection civilly renounces
such harsh and uncharitable language, let
us see what may be intended by <hi>Superfae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Either the disliked additions are of <hi>truths,</hi>
or of <hi>falsities.</hi> If, of <hi>truths,</hi> we expect they
would demonstrate who has forbidden us
to learn and advance our knowledg in
Christian Religion, or matters belonging
to it. Did God give his <hi>Law</hi> to Beasts, that
have no discourse nor capacity, by joyning
two <hi>revealed</hi> truths to arrive at the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of a third? Again, where is it prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
for the Doctour and Preacher to know
more then the Ideot and old wife? What
fault then can even the proud and peevish
humour of this age find in this point? If He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47186:24"/>
will raise dust, and obscure the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
articles of Christian faith, and that so
maliciously, as without setling some further
explication, the people are in danger of
being perverted: is it a sin to establish such
defences and Ramparts against encroaching
errours?</p>
               <p>If the addition be of <hi>falsities;</hi> let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
how the Opposer knows they are false?
If he reply, because they are contrary to
clear <hi>Scripture:</hi> then they are also contrary
to that Faith which deliver'd Scripture to
be true. If the points be not against Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
either they crosse some known Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Faith, or only the Principles of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
reason. If they be purely objects of
natural reason (though truths) they belong
not <hi>so</hi> to Religion, as to be accounted <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith:</hi> if they contradict some other
fore-taught Article, then the Argument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
explicated (concerning the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Tradition, and the creeping in of
Errours against it) returns to its force. If
neither of these, why are they false, or upon
what grounds condemned?</p>
               <p>But peradventure he excepts not against
the Truths, but the obligation to believe
and profess them. Admitting then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
points to be, in themselvs, true;
why will not the Opposer assent to them?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47186:24"/>
has he a demonstration against them? No,
for then they could not be true. Has he such
Arguments, that nothing opposite is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to their eminent credibility? No; for,
setting aside demonstration, no argument
can be comparable to the <hi>Churches Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
The reason therfore, if the inward
thoughts be faithfully sifted, will at length
appeare no other, then the preferring his
own Opinion before the judgement of the
Church: which being the effect of an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and malepert pride, makes no legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
excuse for not believing.</p>

               <head>THE
FOURTH ENCOUNTER. That unlearned Catholiks rely upon the
infallibility of Tradition.</head>
               <p>THe next exception is of main impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
for it undermines the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
at the very root, denying that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> relys on Tradition: and
having divided the believers into learned
and unlearned, first undertakes to prove the
unlearn'd not to be grounded on Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
at least, not for their whole Faith.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47186:25"/>
For, if a question arise never thought on
before, and once a Council determine the
Controversie, that decree is accepted, as if
it had come from Christ by Tradition; and
all professe a readiness to obey, and therfore
are like to perform their word, if occasion
be offerd. Besides, in Catechisms and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
the Common-people are not
taught, that the doctrine comes handed
down to them from the Apostles. In Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
we see, when any proposition of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
or concernment is treated, proofs are
alleag'd out of Scripture and ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
a practise even the fathers themselvs
continually observe, who, having propos'd
a point, are ready to adde, it is not they
alone that teach this doctrin, but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
or Christ, or some renouned Father;
never mentioning Tradition, unlesse to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
or disable it, when some Hereticks have
laid claim to it, as the <hi>Quartadecimans,
Chyliasts, Communicants of Infants,</hi> and the
like.</p>
               <p>The charge I confess is fierce; let us see
what powder it bears, what shot. We agree,
the Church comprehends both learned and
unlearned, and so are bound to maintain
that both sorts rely on Tradition. As for
the first objection then, concerning the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to embrace a Councils definition,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47186:25"/>
with the same assent, as if the truth were
descended by Tradition; I can either and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
grant or deny it: Since, if I please
to grant it, I have this secure retreat, that a
conditional proposition has no force, unless
the condition be possible: and for the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of the condition, I distinguish the
subject; which may be matter of Practice
and Obedience, or a speculative propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
Of the first I can allow the assent
to be the same; that is, an equal willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to observe it: Of the second, I deny it
ever was or can be, that a Council should
define a question otherwise then by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Therefore, to rely on the Councils
definition taks not away, but confirms the
relying on Tradition. This, if need were,
I could easily justifie, by the expresse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of all the principal Councils. Thus
the condition having never been put, nor
supposed ever will be, all this Argument
rests solely on the Objectors credit, and
is with as much ease rejected as it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
               <p>Now should I chuse (according to my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
reserv'd liberty) to deny such equality
of assent; the Opponent has offerd no proof,
and so the quarrel is ended: for though I
could produce instances to the contrary,
I think it not fit to multiply questions when
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47186:26"/>
the argument can be solved with a simple
denial.</p>
               <p>But how the Opponent can justify the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
branch of his exception, that in <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms</hi>
this doctrin is not taught, I am whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant. As far as my memory will
serve me, I never heard the <hi>Creed</hi> explicated,
but, when the Catechist came to the Article
of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> he told them how
<hi>Catholick</hi> signify'd an universality of place
and time; and that, for this title of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
we were to rely on her testimony.
Likewise, in the word <hi>Apostolick,</hi> he noted
that the Apostles were the founders of the
Church, and her doctrin theirs, as being first
receiv'd from them and conserv'd by the
Church ever since; and that for this reason
we were to believe her Authority. Thus
you see, that famous phrase of the <hi>Colliers
faith</hi> is built on this very principle we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
True it is, Catechists do not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
descend to so minute particularities, as
to tel ignorant people whether any position
may be exempt from this general Law:
But then we also know the rule, <hi>Qui nihil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit,
omnia includit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sermons (upon which the third instance
is grounded) are of another nature; their
intention being, not so much literally to
teach the Articles of Christian doctrin, as to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47186:26"/>
perswade and make what is already believ'd
sink into the Auditory, with a kind of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
&amp; easiness, that their faith be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into a principle of action to govern their
lives, the principal end perhaps for which
the <hi>Scripture</hi> was deliver'd and recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to us. Therfore, neither the common
practice, nor proper design or use of <hi>Sermons</hi>
reaches home, to make us understand on
what grounds the hearts of Catholicks rely;
who after all disputations, retire themselvs
to this safe guard, To believe what the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik
Church teaches; as none can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
that has had the least convers with such
Catholiks as profess not themselvs Divines.</p>
               <p>For the last period of this objection,
where the <hi>Fathers</hi> are brought in to cry out
against Tradition, and <hi>Hereticks</hi> made the
sole pretenders to that title: 'tis a bare as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
without so much as a thin rag of
proof to cover it; of which, I believe, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
we shall have particular occasion to
discourse more largely. Thus cannot all
the diligence I am able to use find any
ground of difficulty in the belief of the
unlearned, but that assuredly their faith is
establisht on Tradition, if they rely on the
Church as it is <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apostolick;</hi>
which all profess, from the gray hair to
him that but now begins to lisp his Creed.</p>

               <head>THE
FIFTH ENCOUNTER That Catholick Divines rely on the same
infallibility of Tradition.</head>
               <p>Tis time now to come to the second part,
and see what is objected against the
learneder sort and the long Robe's Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of their faith into Tradition: And
first is brought on the stage a couple of great
Cardinals, <hi>Perron</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> the former
saying, out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> that the <hi>Trinity,
Freewill, Penance,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> were never
exactly disputed, before the <hi>Arians, Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Donatists:</hi> Whence is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
that, as more was disputed, so more
was concluded; therfore more known,
and consequently not all deriv'd by <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we should answer, that disputing,
betwixt Catholicks and Hereticks, is, on
the Catholick part, no other then proving
and defending those points which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
by Tradition, and found in Christian
action and behaviour, this argument were
cut up by the roots, and all pretence and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47186:27"/>
colour of it taken away: Which is the very
truth of the business: this being insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the difference betwixt Heresy and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicism,
that when those perverse novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
first peep out of their dark grots, the
Catholick Religion securely possesses the
World; and upon such opposition is at first
surpriz'd, and the Divines, perhaps, put to
cast about for plausible defences and
grounds to satisfy unstable heads, who easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceit themselvs wiser then their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
and scorn authority, unless reason
proportion'd to their capacity or humour
marshal it in.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, because disputing cannot
chuse but bring to light some deductions,
consequent to the first &amp; principally-defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Position; I shall not deny the Church
may come to know somwhat, which haply
before she never reflected on. But then those
new truths belong to the science we call
<hi>Theology,</hi> not to Faith; and, even for those,
the Church rely's on Tradition, as far as
they themselvs emerge from doctrins deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
by Tradition: so that the truth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
by the learned Cardinal out of St.
<hi>Austin,</hi> is, that, by much canvasing, more
cleer proofs and answers are discovered, or
more ample Theological science concerning
such mysteries, acquir'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:47186:28"/>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is brought in excusing <hi>Pope
Iohn</hi> 22. from being an Heretick, though he
held no souls were admitted to the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, before the day of Judgment;
because the Church had not as yet defin'd
any thing concerning it: I confess, many
more might be produc'd deprehended in the
like actions; and, before all, St. <hi>Austin</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> on the same score. Now, to
draw a conclusion from hence, this is to be
added, that surely if there had been a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
neither the <hi>Pope</hi> nor St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> could
be ignorant of it, and therfore not excusable
upon that account. But, in truth, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this point is no harder press'd; for, if
any would take pains and look into our
<hi>Schoolmen,</hi> they might find very many of
them maintain, that <hi>Tradition</hi> is necessary
only for some points not clearly express'd
in Scripture: whence it seems to follow
they build not the whole body of their
Faith upon Tradition.</p>
               <p>For satisfaction of this difficulty, I must
note, there is a vast difference betwixt rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on Tradition, and saying or thinking
we do so. The <hi>Platonists</hi> and <hi>Peripateticks</hi>
are divided about the <hi>manner of vision; Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
teaching, that the object works upon
the eye; <hi>Plato,</hi> that the eye sends out a line
of Spirits or rays to the object: Yet nothing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47186:28"/>
were more ridiculous then to affirm, the
<hi>Platonists</hi> saw in one fashion, the <hi>Peripateticks</hi>
in another. Some (as I fear may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
in too many of our modern <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks)</hi>
are of this desperate and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
opinion, that we have no maxims <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
by Nature, but contradictories may be
true at once; the rest of Philosophers think
otherwise: yet we see, in all natural and
civil actions, both sides proceed, as if those
maxims were evident and irresistable. So
likwise, there is a wide distance betwixt these
two questions what a man relys on for his
assent of Faith, &amp; what he says or thinks he
relys on. Look but among the <hi>Protestants</hi> or
other Sectaries, they are al taught to answer,
<hi>they rest wholly on the Bible, the Bible, for their
Faith;</hi> but nine parts of ten seek no farther
then the Commands of their own Church:
that is, all those who either cannot read or
make it not their study to be cunning in the
Scriptures, or have so much modesty as to
know themselvs unable to resolve those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
intricate controverted points by the
bare letter of the Text; who, perhaps are
not the less numerous, but certainly the
more excusable part of Protestants.</p>
               <p>Whence, farther, it is clear that; to ask
on what a private person grounds his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and on what, the Church? is yet
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47186:29"/>
a more different question; especially, if you
enquire into what he <hi>thinks</hi> the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvs
her faith. For, supposing the Church,
as to some verity, should rely on Scripture
or Councils; a Divine may know the
Church holds such a position, and yet
(though of a just size of learning) not know,
or, at least, not remember on what ground
she maintains it: and in that case, no doubt
but his faith stands on the same foundation
with that of the Church; yet he cannot,
perhaps, suddenly tel, whether it be resolved
into Scripture or Councils. To conclude
therfore this demand, whether <hi>Bellarmin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
rely'd on Tradition, for all points? has
not the least resemblance with this other,
whether he thought the Church did so? And,
to come yet closer to the question; 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
every believer, under that notion, <hi>as a
believer,</hi> is unlearned and ignorant: For,
as such, he rests upon his teacher, who in
our present case is, undoubtedly, the <hi>Church</hi>
as <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apostolick;</hi> so far, therfore,
the <hi>Collier</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> depend on the same
Authority. As for the other part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory,
on what he thinks the Church
rely's for her doctrin? it may be enquir'd
either in common or particular. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
(relating generally to the body and
substance of Catholick doctrin,) there is no
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47186:29"/>
doubt, among Catholicks, but their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is upon <hi>Tradition,</hi> this being the main
profession of great and smal, learned and
unlearned, that Christian Religion is and
has been continued in our Church, since the
days of our Saviour, the very same faith the
Apostles taught all Nations, and <hi>upon that
score,</hi> they receive it: Speaking thus therfore,
no Catholick makes any scruple but Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
comes to him by Tradition.</p>
               <p>There remains now, only, what learned
men think, concerning the ground wheron
the Church rely's, in some particular cases:
which we have already shewn concerns not
their private belief, as 'tis the foundation
of their spiritual life; for, so, they rely on
the Church, and what the Church rely's
on: and by consequence, it will prove but
a matter of opinion in an unnecessary que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
belonging purely to Theology, not
Faith, whatever is said in it. Whence Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
in this may vary without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the Church or salvation, either in
private or in order to Government; seeing
the main foundation is surely establisht,
that every believer, as such, rely's on the
Church immediatly. This difficulty ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is so far resolv'd, that it little imports
what opinion <hi>Bellarmin</hi> or any other private
Doctor holds in the point: since it follows
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47186:30"/>
not that the Church, or any particular
member therof, rely's on such a ground;
no not <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself, though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
in some points, the Church rely's on
Scripture or Councils.</p>
               <p>But, since St. <hi>Austin</hi> marches in the head
of this Troop for defence of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> let
us proceed with more diligence and respect
in reconciling the difficulty. We are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
'tis a different question, to ask
Whether an opinion be Heresy? and, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Maintainer be an Heretick? the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
becomes heretical by being against
Tradition, without circumstances; but the
Person is not an Heretick, unless he knows
there is such a Tradition. Now, St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi>
case was about a doctrin included in
a practice, which, he saw well, was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the <hi>African,</hi> but knew not to be
so of the universal Church, till some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the whole Christian World
had made it evident. And herein consists
the excuse St. <hi>Austin</hi> alledges for St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian;</hi>
'tis true, I have no assurance this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
can be alledged for <hi>John</hi> 22. but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perhaps may, that the multitude of
Fathers (which he conceiv'd to be on his
side) might perswade him, the opposite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
could not be a constant Tradition.
There remains only <hi>Bellarmins</hi> excuse to be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47186:30"/>
justify'd, which is not of so great moment:
Divines helping themselvs by the way that
occurrs best to them, and missing in such
reasons, without any scandal to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>One of these two solutions will generally
satisfie all such objections as are drawn
from some fathers mistakes against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Faith. For nothing can be more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
then, if any Father had known the
doctrin, contrary to his errour, to have
been universally taught in the Catholik
Church, by a derivation from their ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
beyond the memory of any beginning,
he would readily without dispute have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to such an Authority, and so much
the sooner, as he being neerer the Fountain,
could less doubt that the stream, of which
he saw no other rise, reach'd home to the
Spring-head. This therfore is evident, that
whoever erred, knew nothing of such a
Tradition, whencesoe're that ignorance
took its root: the severall causes of which
depend upon the several cases of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
here not pressed, and therfore not
examin'd.</p>

               <head>THE
SIXTH ENCOUNTER, Disabling three other Arguments brought
against Tradition.</head>
               <p>THe seventh objection pretends, not only
different, but opposite Traditions might
be deriv'd from the Apostles. And this
they support with these two crutches: one
consists in a demurrer, that the contrary is
not proved: the other in an Instance, that
it plainly hapned so in the case of the <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadecimani,</hi>
who inherited from St. <hi>John</hi> a
certain custom, which was condemned by a
practice deriv'd from some other Apostles.
But the weaknesse of this objection appears
by its very proposal: For, since all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
when they speak of Tradition delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
and exactly, define it to be <hi>a Doctrine
universally taught by the Apostles,</hi> we may
safely conclude, where two Apostles teach
differently, neither is <hi>Tradition:</hi> And that
this word, <hi>universally,</hi> may not seem, by slight
of hand, cog'd into the definition, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to take away this objection; the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of it is evident: because, all that weare
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47186:31"/>
the name of <hi>Christian</hi> unanimously agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, in point of <hi>truth,</hi> one Apostle could
not contradict another; wherever two such
Traditions are possible to be found, it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
follows, no point of <hi>truth</hi> is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
An inference expresly verified in the
example of the <hi>Quartadecimans;</hi> their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
being meerly about a Ceremony,
not an Article of Faith. Wherfore, only
indifferent and unnecessary practises are
subjects of such a double Tradition: and,
by consequence, such Traditions are not of
Christian beliefe, or concerning matters,
here, in controversy; this very definition ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
directly excluding them.</p>
               <p>The eighth Argument seems to take its
rise from our own confessions; telling us,
We acknowledge some points of Faith to
have come in later then others, and give the
cause of it, that the Tradition (whereon
such points rely) was, at the beginning, a
particular one, but so that yet at the time
when it became universal, it had a testimony
even beyond exception, by which it gain'd
such a general acknowledgment.</p>
               <p>The example of this is in <hi>certain Books</hi> of
Scripture, as the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and
the <hi>Apocalyps;</hi> whereof, in St. <hi>Jerom's</hi> time,
the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches refus'd the one, and the
<hi>Latin</hi> the other; yet now both have prevaild
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47186:32"/>
into an universal reception. To which I
return this clear answer: 'tis the nature of
things acted, (that depend on Physical and
mutable causes,) to have divers degrees in
divers parts, according to the unequall
working of the Causes: and so, Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
deliver'd, by the hands of his Apostles,
two things to his Church, <hi>his Doctrin, as the
necessary and substantial aliment thereof,</hi> and
<hi>his Scriptures, ad abundantiam;</hi> it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
the strength of <hi>Tradition,</hi> for <hi>one,</hi>
should far exceed its strength for <hi>the other;</hi>
yet so, that even the weaker should not fail
to be assured and certain. Upon this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the <hi>Doctrin</hi> was deliver'd to all the
Apostles, and by them to the whol commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Christians: the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to some
particular person or Church, (yet such
whose credit was untainted) and from them,
by degrees, to be spread through the whol
Church, and communicated to the <hi>Pastors,</hi>
in the <hi>Books themselvs;</hi> to the <hi>people,</hi> by their
<hi>Pastors reading</hi> and <hi>explications.</hi> For, who
does not know, before Printing was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the Bible was not every mans money?
Whence it appears, <hi>Scriptures</hi> are derived to
us by a <hi>lower degree</hi> of <hi>Tradition,</hi> then that
of Catholik <hi>doctrin;</hi> and consequently our
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>acceptance</hi> due to them is not of
so high a nature as what we are bound to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47186:32"/>
in respect of doctrin. For the <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
is to be judged by the <hi>doctrin:</hi> as the
<hi>Church</hi> and <hi>custom of Antiquity</hi> teaches us:
alwaies commanding and practising, that
no man exercise his wits in interpreting the
holy Scripture against the <hi>receiv'd</hi> Faith of
the Church; as, in all matters of science,
they who are Masters in the Art, judge the
text of Books written upon such subjects
by their unwritten skil and practical expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
               <p>And here I would willingly ask, what
such <hi>Protestants</hi> as object this to us, can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for themselvs? since they directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
not to know <hi>Scripture</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and
therfore must necessarily rely on <hi>Tradition;</hi>
especially those who take for their rule to
accept only such Books for Canonical, as
were never doubted of: for they cannot
deny, but the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were receiv'd in one
Church before another; as the Epistles of
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> or St. <hi>Marks Gospel,</hi> &amp;c.
and how do they admit the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> so
long refused by the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, whom
they use to prefer before the <hi>Latin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they presse us farther; that, if a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Tradition became universal, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on the <hi>Logick</hi> of those Ages, to
discern what testimony was beyond excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I demand what signifies <hi>Logick?</hi> do
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47186:33"/>
they mean common sense, sufficient to know
three and four make seven; or wit enough to
comprehend and manage with a just degree
of discretion, the ordinary occurrences in
humane actions? If they do; I must confess
it depends on <hi>Logick:</hi> For I cannot think
God Almighty deliver'd the Scriptures to
Apes or Elephants, who have a meer imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of reason in their outward carriage; but
to Men, that have truly understanding, and
a capacity of evidence within their Souls.
But, if they take <hi>Logick</hi> for an ability to
discourse beyond the reach of ordinary
prudence, and that human evidence which
governs our lives; I see no occasion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
any such <hi>Logick</hi> in our present
question.</p>
               <p>The ninth attempt consists in a diligent
survey of our <hi>Fortifications,</hi> to spy out some
<hi>breach,</hi> or weaker place, by which errour
may creep into the Church. This I cannot
call an Argument; for none are so unwise
as to make such a consequence: It may be,
therfore 'tis; unlesse they bring strong proof
of this necessity in some particular instance,
that may shew it to be an exception from
the common maxim, <hi>à posse ad esse non valet
consequentia:</hi> And yet, in this discourse, I
find not so much as the very <hi>posse,</hi> which
I thus declare. If any should deny that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47186:33"/>
                  <hi>George</hi> could leap over <hi>Pauls-steeple;</hi> and a
quaint Oratour (to maintain the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive)
should largely discourse, how the rise
of the last footing, the help of a good staffe,
the cast of his body, and many such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
give advantage to the leap; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
think of comparing these with the
height of the Steeple: no sensible person
would say, he had proved the possibility of
performing such a wild and extravagant
enterprize. So, he that discourses at large,
how errours use to slide into mans life,
without comparing the power of the causes
of errour to the strength of resisting, which
consists in this principle, <hi>Nothing is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
but what descends by Tradition;</hi> as also,
without considering the heat and zeal stil
preserv'd alive in the Churches bowels from
the great fire of <hi>Pentecost:</hi> says no more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
proving an errour's overrunning the
<hi>Church,</hi> then the Oratour we exemplified, for
<hi>Georges</hi> leaping over the <hi>Steeple.</hi> Wherfore
this attempt is so far from the business, it
deservs not the honour of being accounted
an Argument.</p>
               <p>Yet, because we compar'd the propagation
of the Catholique Faith, to the perpetuation
of Human kind, let us propose the like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
against it: and say, that in <hi>Affrick</hi> or
the Land of <hi>Senega,</hi> there are under earth,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47186:34"/>
great mines of <hi>Arsnick:</hi> Whereof one may
at some time or other, vapour a contagious
smoak, which, encountring with a strong
wind from the South, may breed so great a
Plague in all the North Countries, that
none can escape it; and hereupon presently
conclude, that all, on this side the <hi>Line,</hi> are
quite dead, and those who seem to live and
discourse are but phantasms and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of real in them: though I believe the
instances (brought in, for declaration of so
groundless a conceit) may seem better to
deserve that name.</p>

            <div n="7" type="encounter">
               <head>THE
SEVENTH ENCOUNTER. Answering the Greeks and some Divines,
who object new Beliefs to the Catholick
Church.</head>
               <p>THe first is of the Greeks; <hi>Hieremie Nilus</hi>
and <hi>Barlaam,</hi> who profess to stand to
Tradition and the first seaven <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
and can be no way disprov'd, say's the
objector, unless by what shall be as forcible
against the Catholick cause. But truly,
this instance is so lame, it needs a new ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
before it be answered: For the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47186:34"/>
expresses not in what points of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt us and them, he intends to
urge it. If, about <hi>shavings</hi> or <hi>fastings</hi> and the
like; we shal have no quarrel against him;
if about the <hi>Procession of the holy Ghost,</hi> I
doubt he will find himself entangled in an
equivocation, betwixt the matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of that mystery. However, <hi>that all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
against them will serve against us,</hi> is
but the Authors liberal addition, without
any proof or means to guess at it. That
they accuse us, to corrupt Tradition by
sowing tares among it, has two parts;
one justify's my plea, that we rely on Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
since they charge us with endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to corrupt, not disclaim it: the other,
that we do indeed corrupt it, is only said
not proved; and farther shews that the plea
of the Greeks is <hi>non-Tradition;</hi> alleadging
only this, that their Fathers do not deliver
the doctrin of the <hi>procession</hi> of the Holy
Ghost, not that they say the contrary;
which clearly demonstrates, there are no
opposite Traditions between them and us.</p>
               <p>As little force has the Note cited out of
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> to prove that he thought more
was to be believ'd, then what was drawn
from antiquity; because he was content
private men might begin good customs in
their own houses: For sure he could not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47186:35"/>
believe, that <hi>omnis fidelis</hi> could <hi>constituere</hi> for
the whole Church, or even for his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
house. So that we need a great deal
of Logick to draw from this remark, the
creeping of an errour into the Church: not
a word being so much as intimated, that
this good custom should be against what
was already receiv'd; which had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to make it rejected, and not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
in <hi>Tertullians</hi> known judgment.</p>
               <p>There is another instance, strongly urg'd
and largly dilated; but, if I guess right, of
so much less credit, the more 'tis opened.
It is out of a history by one <hi>Wadding,</hi> an
<hi>Irish</hi> man, concerning two Treaties of two
Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> with two <hi>Popes,</hi> to <hi>tear</hi> from
them a definition for the <hi>Immaculateness of
our Ladies Conception.</hi> (I follow an Authors
words who has read the book, and it seems
found a great violence in the carriage of the
business, which made him express it, by the
word <hi>tearing.)</hi> Who this <hi>Wadding</hi> is I
know not, for I have heard of more then
one; but whether this be any of them, I am
totally ignorant, having never seen the
Book nor any other signs by which to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Author.</p>
               <p>Out of this Book they collect three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
One from <hi>Waddings</hi> testimony; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
from the State of the question he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47186:35"/>
handles: a third, from his practice, joyntly
with the practice of divers others of the
same degree. For the first, I am desirous
notice should be taken of the Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
When he wrote this book, he was
Secretary to the Bishop of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and
He his Kings <hi>Ambassador,</hi> to move the <hi>Pope</hi> to
define our Ladies Conception without ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sin; and, in solliciting this, to use an
extraordinary importunity: Wherin I see
two circumstances that concern the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his Book; One, that he was to act
a business of great heat; and, if his zeal
were not conformable to the eagerness of
his senders, he was like to have little thanks
for his pains; The second that he was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
to an Ambassador, by which he had
priviledg to say and publish <hi>Dicenda Tacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
whether they were his own opinions or
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, so they any way advanc'd his
cause.</p>
               <p>Now, this encouraged Secretary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to affirm, that many things have been
defined against the opinions of some Fathers;
and in the present case, he says, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it has been defin'd, that our Lady was
free from all actual sin: He adds, the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of Hereticks Baptism, the beatifical
vision before the day of Judgment, the
spirituality of Angels, the souls being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47186:36"/>
created, and not <hi>ex traduce,</hi> the
Assumption of our Lady, and her delivery
without pain. To <hi>Wadding</hi> we may add
<hi>Salmeron,</hi> who has the boldness to say <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctores
quo juniores eo perspicaciores. Poza</hi> is
no les audacious, in citing opinions defin'd
against the Fathers. <hi>Erasmus</hi> says <hi>myriades
Articulorum proruperunt. Fisher,</hi> Bishop and
Martyr, and as learned as any in his age,
consents that <hi>Purgatory</hi> was brought in by
little and little: and <hi>Indulgences,</hi> after men
had trembled a while at the torments of
<hi>Purgatory. Alphonsus de Castro</hi> puts, in the
rank of newly receiv'd Doctrines, <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Transubstantiation,</hi> and the <hi>procession of
the holy Ghost.</hi> But beyond all, is the fact of
<hi>Clement the eighth,</hi> a grave and wise <hi>Pope;</hi>
who, desirous to end the controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and the <hi>Jesuits</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by them of <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> neither sent
for learned men, by way of a <hi>Council,</hi> to
know what their <hi>Forefathers</hi> had taught
them, nor examin'd with which of them the
purest Ages sided: but refer'd the whole
matter to what St. <hi>Austin</hi> said: and so it
had been defin'd, had not <hi>Cardinal Perrons</hi>
advice prevail'd. And St. <hi>Austin</hi> was so
various in his own opinion, that he knew
not himself what he held: wheras, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him all the ancients sided with the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47186:36"/>
                  <hi>Jesuits.</hi> Thus far that Book.</p>
               <p>I know this term <hi>Defining,</hi> is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used by our Divines in matters of the
Churches determinations; nor do I see
any great inconvenience in the <hi>word,</hi> if the
<hi>thing</hi> be understood, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Defining</hi> is
nothing els but the <hi>acknowledging and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a Tradition,</hi> from the dirt and rubbidg
opposers had cast upon it. For the rest,
that some Fathers have had their eys ty'd,
in particular points, so far as not to see the
force of <hi>Tradition,</hi> by which the Church had
notice of the truth of some position, is a
thing not to be doubted. And, if it were
fit or necessary, I could bring instances of
bold Divines, in our days, so blinded by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
that they see not the light of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
in some particular questions; and so,
the expressions only changed, hold condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
heresies: So short is the sphear of our
discours, if not directed by a carefulness to
wel-imploy our Logick, or by a secret grace
steering us towards truth beyond the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Reason.</p>
               <p>But, what consequence any can draw,
out of these sayings, against Tradition, I
understand not: unless this be taken for a
Maxim, that every one must necessarily
know, of a special point, that it is deriv'd
by Tradition, because really 'tis so; an
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47186:37"/>
inconsequence, I hope already sufficiently
demonstrated. Now, if these two can stand
together, that, truly the <hi>Church</hi> has a <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for a point, and nevertheless some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man may be ignorant of it; this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
has no force at all.</p>
               <p>As to the positions he cites for newly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted
into the family of faith; he fairly
shews the priviledg he and his Master had
to speak any thing that sounded to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and let his adversaries take care whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
true or no: For, nothing is more clear
then that the validity of Baptism by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
was a Tradition, and decided by it: so,
the Beatifical vision of the Saints before the
day of judgment, the spirituality of Angels,
are not yet held matters of Faith, but only
Theological conclusions; as likewise, the
souls being concreated to the perfecting of
the body: Then for the blessed Virgin's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
free from actual sin, as also her Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and her delivery without pain (which
others add) these either are known by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
or not matters of Catholick Faith:
and so, no ways advance our Adversaries
pretences. For <hi>Alphonsus de Castro,</hi> 'tis
plain by his very expressions, either he
means the manner only, or at most some
circumstances unessential to the things,
and therefore certainly not cited without
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47186:37"/>
some violence offerd to his words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poza</hi> is a condemned Authour: and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron's</hi>
saying not to be followed, or to be
understood (as it is, whence he took it) in
such things as later disputes have beaten out
more plainly; <hi>Erasmus</hi> was learned in Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism,
and one whom, if not others, his very
English Patrons, <hi>Warham</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,
Fisher</hi> of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and <hi>More</hi> in the <hi>Chancery,</hi>
exempt from all calumny of being a deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the ancient Faith: besides his own
Books, especially his Epistle <hi>Ad Fratres in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferioris
Germaniae,</hi> by effects demonstrate
his loyalty; whatever bad impressions a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
liberty of practising his wit too freely
may have made in some even great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
persons. But, what he speaks concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Articles of Faith, he either took from
the scoldings of some ignorant Divines,
(who are ready to call every word, they
found not in their books, when they were
Schollers, Heresie) or else because, truly, he
understood not what belong'd to Decisions
in that kind.</p>
               <p>There remain two Authorities really
considerable; one of the holy Bishop <hi>Fisher;</hi>
the other, of the prudent <hi>Pope.</hi> As for the
first, I conceive there is a great equivocation
through want of care and warinesse in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing.
For, let us take either the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47186:38"/>
of <hi>Florence</hi> or <hi>Trent,</hi> in which we have the
Churches sense concerning both <hi>Purgatory</hi>
and <hi>Indulgences;</hi> and see whether the holy
Bishop says any of the points, those <hi>Councils</hi>
defin'd, are either denied by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or
brought in by private revelations or new
interpretations of Scripture. For, how
could he be ignorant, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> had
agreed to the <hi>Latin Church,</hi> about the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence;</hi>
or forget himself so far, as not to remember
a publick practice, <hi>Indulgences,</hi> in all the
ancient Church, for remission of the <hi>Penal
injunctions</hi> laid upon sinners? Besides, he
says, <hi>the Latins did not receive Purgatory at
once, but by little and little.</hi> Whence 'tis
evident, by the name <hi>Purgatory,</hi> he means
not only so much as is established in the
Council, but the manner also and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
were introduced by revelations of
private persons and argumentations of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.
The like he expresses of <hi>Indulgences,</hi>
saying, <hi>They began, after men had trembled a
while at the pains of purgatory.</hi> Whence it
is plain, he contented not himself with the
precise subject of the Councils Definitions,
or the sense of the Church; but included
also such interpretations as Divines give of
them. So that, by speaking in general terms,
and not distinguishing the substance of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:47186:38"/>
from the Accidents and dressing of it;
as likewise, in <hi>Iudulgences,</hi> not separating
what the Church has alwaies practiz'd from
the interpretative extention which Divines
attribute to them; he is mistaken to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
new Articles of Faith may be brought
into the Church. Neither imports it, that
he uses those words, <hi>No Orthodox man now
doubts;</hi> for that's true of such <hi>Conclusions</hi>
as are term'd <hi>Theological</hi> and generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in the Schools, yet are not arriv'd to
the pitch of making a point of <hi>Catholick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:</hi>
besides, he expresses himself, that this
generality extends no farther, then <hi>That there
is a Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth's action, the main
point is to consider, on what grounds he
sought to establish the Definition he went
about to make. And, upon the immediate
step, we both joyntly stand; to wit, that it was
to finde out, whether parties opinion was
conformable to St. <hi>Austin:</hi> But, if I mistake
not, my Adversaries make not the same ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of it that I do. They seem to take
St. <hi>Austin</hi> for one Doctour, peradventure a
great one, peradventure the chief, but yet
only one: I apprehend him as the <hi>leading
Champion</hi> of the Church in the Question of
<hi>Grace;</hi> whence it follows, that the Doctrin
of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> was the Doctrin of all those
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47186:39"/>
Catholick Writers, by whose demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and authority the <hi>Pelagians</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
that is, it was the faith of the
Church in that age, and consequently, which
the Church continued ever after.</p>
               <p>Father, because St. <hi>Austin</hi> neither had
the Authority to bring in a new Faith, nor
pretends it; but both proves his dictrin to
have descended from his Forefathers, and
found <hi>Pelagius</hi> his opinion condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he medled with it, by some Council;
that is, by the apprehensions of the then
present Church; and, as it spread from
Country to Country, was stil found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the receiv'd doctrin, every where
planted in their hearts before <hi>Pelagius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
it. Therefore, I say, I cannot but
esteem, that, in the point of <hi>Grace,</hi> it is all
one to say, <hi>the Doctrin of St. Austin,</hi> and <hi>the
Doctrin of the Apostles,</hi> planted by them and
continued to St. <hi>Austins daies,</hi> illustrated
by him, and transmitted to his posterity,
even to our present time. If this be true,
(as no Catholik can deny, nor prudent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
doubt but we esteem it so) <hi>Pope Clement</hi>
had great reason to endeavour the decision
of that question by the Authority of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin:</hi>
since the doctrin of St. <hi>Austin</hi> was
evidently the faith of that Age; and the
faith of that Age the faith of the Christian
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47186:39"/>
Church, from the Apostles to us.</p>
               <p>But we have another quarrel about St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi>
doctrin, that It is so uncertain, himself
knew not what he held. Nor do I wonder
such a thought should fall into the head of
a Gentleman-Divine; especially in a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of wit, to censure, without the least
respect or reverence of Antiquity: But I
tremble to hear, that some (of whom we are
in justice as wel as charity bound to expect
more staydness and Religion) seem so wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to their own Sect, as to mutter the
same. My answer, I believe, is already un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>
               <p>I say therefore, such as have made it a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
employment of their lives, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in St. <hi>Augustin;</hi> those who with great
attention had read his Polemical Treatises
against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> (as I take it) some <hi>five
and thirty</hi> times, were of another mind:
And so are all those who at this day study
him, not to make him speak what they
think, but to make themselvs speak what he
thinks.</p>
               <p>But this question <hi>transiit in rem judicatam,</hi>
since, when it was handled at <hi>Rome</hi> before
the <hi>Congregations,</hi> when both oppositions
and defences were solemnly made by the
proof of present books, when the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nainers
of the opinion accus'd of <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:47186:40"/>
were the choicest wits and ancientest
Scholers could be pickt out of that so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Society:</hi> nevertheless, almost in every
Congregation the sentence of St. <hi>Austin</hi> was
judged to be against them; as is evident,
both out of the printed <hi>Compendium</hi> of the
Acts of those Congregations, and the very
manuscript Acts themselves, extant at this
day.</p>
               <p>But, let us hear the Pope himself speak.
Upon the 8. of <hi>July</hi> was held the second
Congregation; His Holiness began with
these words. <hi>Nos personaliter vidimus conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riem
locorum, quam vos, qui</hi> Molinam <hi>defendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
induxistis ex Augustino; &amp; nullus inventus
est qui faveat; immo contrarium tenuit Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus:
Vnde mirum quòd tot artibus utamini.</hi>
And hence it seems they were forc'd to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
St. <hi>Austin</hi> to the Popes face the 30 of
<hi>September</hi> following; which being discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Authour died of melancholy and
disgrace. Again, in the tenth Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
the same <hi>Pope</hi> taxed them, <hi>Quod
Scholasticis, maxime suis, non Scripturâ, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliis,
Patribus, uterentur.</hi> A sign how sound
their way of doctrin is, how sincere their
proceedings to defend it.</p>
               <p>Yet, 'tis urged farther, that the Fathers
who lived before St. <hi>Austin,</hi> are generally
of the contrary opinion. This is a simple
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47186:40"/>
assertion without proof, and my name is
<hi>Thomas:</hi> I would entreat therfore such of my
Readers as light on this objection, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that the question, of the force of
<hi>Grace,</hi> and liberty of <hi>Free will,</hi> consists of
two truths, that seem, like the <hi>Symplegades,</hi>
to butt at one another, as long as we look
at them afar off; but if we make a neerer
approach, they shew a fair passage betwixt
them. So then, it is not hard that one who
studies the question for pleasure, especially
in such Fathers as wrote before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
of the truth by Heresies, should be
deceiv'd, by the seeming overlaying of that
side, which the Fathers had occasion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate;
though they meant nothing lesse
then to prejudice the verity, which stands
firm on the other side the <hi>fretum</hi> of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
Adde to this, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
examin'd the Fathers, and found in
them the doctrin he maintain'd; nor could
it be otherwise, the general apprehension of
the Church being against <hi>Pelagius.</hi> Therfore
I shal follow the advice of the Proverb, and
be fearful to <hi>leap before I look:</hi> especially,
since a great reader of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profess'd he could shew as strong places
in him for <hi>Grace,</hi> as in St. <hi>Austin;</hi> though
he be the man chiefly set up against St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin.</hi>

               <head>THE
EIGHTH ENCOUNTER, Shewing, our Ladies immaculate concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not likely to become an Article
of Faith.</head>
               <p>AS for the state of the question, about
<hi>our Ladies being conceiv'd in Original sin,</hi>
some would willingly perswade us, the
Negative is in great probability to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd;
whereas certainly there is no Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for it (if <hi>Wadding's</hi> sayings be rightly
reported.) But if <hi>defining</hi> signifies the <hi>clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Tradition,</hi> (as we explicate it) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more evident, then that there
is no probability of defining the negative
part: rather it may be in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
at least, censured, for rashly put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an exception in the generall rule of
Scripture, which expresly condemns all but
our <hi>Saviour</hi> to Original sin; except the
defenders can shew good ground for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg
they pretend, which I much doubt.
For, as far as I can understand, the whol
warrant of that opinion stands upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to our Lady, arising chiefly from a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47186:41"/>
perswasion that original sin is a disgrace to
the person in whom 'tis found: So that,
if the people were taught original sin is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a disposition to evil, or a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
weakness, which, unless prevented, brings
infallibly sin and damnation; and that in
it self it deservs neither reproach nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
as long as it proceeds not to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
sin, the heat of vulgar devotion would
be cool'd, and the question not thought
worth the examining.</p>
               <p>However, ther's no great appearance of
deciding that point in favour of the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
since the earnest sollicitations of two
so potent Kings could so little prevail to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it: For, all that was done had only
this design, to appeas the seditions sprung
up in <hi>Sivil</hi> by occasion of a <hi>Dominicans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,</hi>
in which he affirm'd that our Lady
was <hi>Conspurcata</hi> with <hi>Original sin.</hi> But, the
controversy was so uncivilly carried, that
it scandaliz'd our English Merchants; as one
of them there present told me not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
meeting him at <hi>Dunkirk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But because this objection is much urged,
let us see the probabilities of its being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd.
The first is, that the maintainers of
the Affirmative are only a few of one <hi>Order,</hi>
and some few taught by them: But, if good
account be made, I believe these few will
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47186:42"/>
prove some thousand or fifteen hundred of
the most learned in the Christian world.
Their <hi>Order</hi> is known to have always been
the flower of the Schools; to have had
the Inquisition many ages in their hands:
to have a stile of Divinity of a higher strain
then ordinary; by their great study and
adhesion to the Doctrin of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine:</hi>
Their Monasteries numerous, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> no great Convent
wherin there are not a dozen or more grave
and learned Divines, almost all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
amongst them being distributed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the probate of ability in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg:
so that the <hi>Order</hi> is no contemptible
part of the <hi>Learning</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Neither
is it credible their Schollars can be few;
much less, as this Author passionatly terms
them, <hi>unus et alter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He objects farther, the subscriptions of
many Prelates, Orders and Universities,
the general acclamation of the people, the
weighty necessity of cutting off scandals;
That some Universities oblige the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
to make vows to maintain the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
and in a word that the Affirmers hold
against the whole Church. Nor do I doubt
that many Prelates, Orders and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities
subscribed the Negative, and
peradventure to the Petition, or that the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47186:42"/>
people (who follow the greater cry) did
demand the same: but, that the Affirmers
held against the whole Church, I totally
deny, and shew manifestly the contrary.
For, <hi>Buls</hi> having been accepted and standing
in force, by which all <hi>Censure</hi> against the
Affirmative is forbidden, and no one sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
obtain'd any way derogatory to the
probability of the opinion; but generally,
a <hi>caveat</hi> to the contrary expresly put into
such instruments and the Defenders of the
negative submitting to them: 'tis clear, that
all the maintainers of the Negative alow the
Affirmative to be probable, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
not against the consent of the
Church; since it seems to imply a flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
that the Church should believe
a Negative to be true, and yet at the same
time admit the affirmative may be true.</p>
               <p>Now, as for Universities, there are entire
ones for the Affirmative; and that, not on
the score of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> but of the <hi>Fathers.</hi>
What Universities strive for the Negative, so
ranckly as to make men take vows, I know
not: The Article of <hi>Paris,</hi> as I hear, is
only that they shal not teach it in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity;
els-where every one is free. As
for hindring scandals, 'tis a necessary part
of Government; but certainly obliges not
to a defining or deciding of Truths accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47186:43"/>
to the inclinations of the people,
push'd on by the clamours of violent Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all this, our adversary
presumes this very point may prove an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith; especially, if a Council
should meet about the decision: wherin he
proceeds with a very high confidence, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as he thinks, now ready to topple into
a matter necessary to salvation. But I am
far from that mind: for I see the fervours
of the Schools are a quite different thing
from the judgments of the Church, and
how little all those tumults moved the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and certainly would have
made far less impression in a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
The controversy betwixt the <hi>Jesuits</hi>
and the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> what a busle makes it
in the School and in the world; while it
stands upon the fairer tongue, upon motives
esteemable by the people, and meer plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities?
Wheras coming to be examin'd
before the <hi>Pope</hi> in Congregations, it could
not hold water; but the weaker part was
forc'd to break off the cours of judgment,
by mingling Princes quarrels into Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
questions. I dare confidently say,
if the Point of <hi>our Ladies, Conception</hi> were to
be handled, either in a Council or grave
Congregation: the party that free her (set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47186:43"/>
aside the passions of Princes) would be
distressed to find an argument that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
should hope would endure the discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
And so, the pretty gradations of our
imaginative adversaries, who so easily frame
a ladder for this opinion to climb up into
a matter of Faith, is like an odd attempt of
an acquaintance of mine; who, being come
out of <hi>Lancashire</hi> to go beyond-sea, and
repuls'd at <hi>Dover</hi> for want of a Pass, put off
his hose and shooes and began to wade into
the sea; when, being asked what he meant,
he answer'd he would go on foot, since they
would not let him pass in the Boat; for, said
he, I have often waded through the <hi>Beck</hi> at
my Fathers door when the bridg was taken
away. By which counterfeiting of simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
he got to be admitted into the ship:
wheras those who make their argument
from the School-discussions to Church-defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,
will (if I am not mistaken) remain
on the wrong side of the water.</p>

               <head>THE
NINTH ENCOUNTER. Shewing the unanimous agreement of
Divines, that all infallibility is from
Tradition.</head>
               <p>THe third argument is drawn from this
<hi>Waddings</hi> proceedings and his consorts,
with the addition of another not unlearned
man (according to the cours of these times)
who puts Scripture and definitions of the
Church to be the adaequate ground into
which our Faith is resolv'd. Besides, 'tis
urg'd, that even those who speak of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
seek it not in the testimony of the
present Church, but of the ancient Fathers:
This being already answer'd in the sixth
Objection, we need not here add much to
it; For what imports it, if <hi>Wadding</hi> and his
associates understood not upon what
grounds the Church uses to resolve and
decide controversies, (and therfore bring
Revelations, Metaphorical expressions of
Scripture, the cry of the people, a multitude
of School Divines, and the like arguments)
so that in their lives and believing or acting
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47186:44"/>
as Christians, they proceed not out of these
grounds, but, by the <hi>Colliers</hi> principle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the Church, and by her, on what she
rely's. <hi>Galilaeo</hi> dislikes the notions of wet
and dry, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> gives: do they
therfore disagree or not know one anothers
meaning, when they talk of a wet and dry
cloth? Among our modern Philosophers
great quarrels there are about the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place:</hi> yet this hinders not,
but that in common discours, when they
speak of years and days, Country's and
Towns, they make a shift to understand one
another.</p>
               <p>The reason is; because these conceptions
(used in ordinary discours) are planted in
them by nature; the same objects working
the same effect upon souls of one nature:
But the other notions are made by study
and artificial proceeding, and prove fals or
true according as the precedent discourses
are fallible or solid. Even so, believing is
made by nature in us, and is all alike in
those to whom the object is proposed alike:
But to explicate and declare it, happens dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
among Doctors, as they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
better or wors.</p>
               <p>Now then admit all those we call School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were against the doctrine I maintain,
though I conceive such an universal agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47186:45"/>
impossible, unless they be supposed to
demonstrate their <hi>Tenets,</hi> (which if they do, I
readily submit; if not) what doth it impeach
the opinion I defend? or what would it avail
to bring one or more on my behalf, whose
authorities may be rejected with the same
facility as offer'd; since they neither carry
with them security from error nor evidence
of Truth? let us therfore permit Divines to
try out their own quarrels in their own
Schools: not mingling them in our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>Yet, to give some satisfaction, let the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector
answer me himself: Does not the
greater part of Divines seek out <hi>Tradition?</hi>
Yes will he say: but not that Tradition
which rely's on the present Church: for
they seek it in laborious quotations of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in all ages. Let's agree then in this,
They seek Tradition as well as I: But I
pray what do they intend by so great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in heaping of Fathers? do they mean
it was those Fathers opinion? and so make
their conclusion good, because such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Doctors held it: or do they farther
pretend, out of these Fathers testimonies, to
shew it was the publick doctrin of the Ages
in which they lived? If the adversary be as
ingenuous as he is ingenious, he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
they pretend to argue the <hi>publick belief</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:47186:45"/>
out of this numerous Catalogue. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
for fear some other may be more
reserv'd, let's remember, what was before
objected, that some points have been defin'd,
notwithstanding the opposition of many
Fathers; and this, by the verdict of these
Divines: Whence it clearly appears that this
numbring of Fathers would not make a
doctrin certain to them; unless they
thought the sense of the respective Ages
were imply'd in it: Therfore, in conclusion,
it is evident that they also rely, for Faith,
upon the succession of it through divers ages;
which is the same as the Doctrin's being
handed from the Apostles to us. So that
you see we all agree; and I, whom you
took to be particular in this conceit, am
thus far of the common opinion.</p>
               <p>But the adversary urges, that I come to
the knowledg of this succession, by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the present Church; wheras they
who search it in Fathers find it by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of antiquity. Suppose it be so: what
difference makes this? It is too great a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
to be bound not to say any word but
what has before faln in my adversaries way:
Yet, at least, can he justify this? do not those
Divines according to what himself would
have them say, profess that the present
Churches definition makes a certainty in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47186:46"/>
our Faith? Admit then the present Church
(in a Council or otherways, as it shall
please those Divines) should define, that a
point doubted of were come down by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
from the Apostles to us; would not
they say, Tradition were sufficiently known
by such a Testimony? Surely it cannot be
deny'd; I ask again: whether the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a point of doctrin to be hers, by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it from hand to hand, be not to testify
and define that Tradition stands for this
doctrin? Therfore all such Divines confess
Tradition may be known by the testimony
of the present Church.</p>
               <p>Why then do they use such diligence in
collecting so many passages out of Fathers?
chiefly for this reason, because Sectaries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that principle: therfore they are forc'd
for their satisfaction (not for instruction of
Catholicks) to take so much pains with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
thanks many times. Though it be true
their learned labours confirm, besides, some
weak believer, and enlighten the borders
of Catholick Faith: and so in themselvs are
both ornamental and profitable to the
Church.</p>
               <p>And now, what if I should add, that these
very Doctors hold there is no security of
Faith, but only by <hi>Tradition?</hi> I know I am
thought subject to talk Paradoxes: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47186:46"/>
because it is a point important to
the unity of the rule of Catholick Faith,
out it shall go, and the discours be neither
long nor obscure. I ask therfore, do not
these Doctors require to the <hi>certainty</hi> of a
<hi>Definition,</hi> that the <hi>Definers</hi> proceed without
malice or negligence, and use all human
endeavours to discover the truth? I cannot
answer for every particular, but am sure
the principal Divines require these conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
otherwise they doubt not but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions
may be erroneous. I ask again,
what <hi>certainty</hi> can we have of this procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the <hi>Definitors?</hi> or was there ever
Council yet, against which the condemned
Party did not cry out, that they had fail'd
in observing them? I conclude therfore two
things; first, that, in the Churches definitions
of this nature, there can be no more then the
certainty of moral Prudence, according to
these mens opinions, (if they follow their
own grounds:) Secondly, that there is no
Moral quarrel betwixt Sectaries and them,
concerning the infallibility of such definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
for the exception generally, in the first
condemnation of any heresy, rises from this
part, Whether the Judg proceeded equally?
and not, Whether, if he did so, his authority
were to be rejected? there being seldom
found so blind a boldness in any as to say, a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47186:47"/>
Judge does him wrong, and yet proceeds
rightly: for either he judges what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
not, and that's rashness; or, seeing
the right, he pronounces wrong, and that's
malice: both which are unexcusable from
injustice. So that, I believe, in this point,
they do not assure the Church against Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
though both sides should agree in the
speculative part, that the <hi>Difinitors</hi> were
infallible.</p>
               <p>I know, Divines say, Catholiks are bound
to believe the <hi>Definitor</hi> proceeded as he
ought, unlesse the contrary be evident; and
I see they speak with a great deal of reason:
but withall, I see this maxim is a principle
of Obedience and Action, not of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and belief.</p>
               <p>I have yet a little scruple about this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.
For, either the Definitors are assur'd
the doctrin they define is true, or no: If not,
how can it be said they proceed rationally,
who determin a position, as certain, which
they see not to be so? If they are, then the
Opinion was certain, before the Definition,
on some ground precedent to, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of it; and so, not made certain by the
definition, but only declar'd to the ignorant,
by the Authority of the Definer, that it was
and is certain, upon other grounds. Now,
excepting <hi>Tradition, Scripture</hi> and <hi>Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:47186:47"/>
I know not any thing men seek into for
an irrefragable Autority: Therefore, what
is <hi>defin'd,</hi> must be, before, certain, either by
<hi>Scripture,</hi> or by <hi>Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let those Divines, now, chuse which
they think fittest to cleave to: For <hi>Rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
has declared his opinion sufficiently;
and it is clear enough, what all they must
say, Catholiks or Protestants, who think
the Scripture needs Explicators, to make a
point certain. Neither can we doubt of
this, if we look into the actions of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik
Church; where we see an Heretick
is term'd so, for chusing an Opinion against
the Faith certainly received, and in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church from which he separates
himself. But this separation is, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the errour, and before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposure
of the Church: He is therefore an
Heretick, before any decision makes him so.</p>

chiefly they insist upon the <hi>Chiliasts</hi> errour,
as an unquestionable Apostolicall Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
To try the busines, let us remember,
we cal'd <hi>Tradition, the handling of a doctrin,
preach'd and setled in the Church of God by
the Apostles, down to later ages.</hi> Now then,
to prove the <hi>Chiliad</hi> opinion was of that
nature, the first point is to evince, that it
was publish'd and setled by the Apostles:
the contrary whereof is manifest out of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>
History, who relates that the root of
it was a by-report collected by <hi>Papias,</hi> a

being indeed bolster'd up by the like mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applications;
a scandal that ever since the
practice of the Tempter upon Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
may wel be expected to importune
Christians.</p>
               <p>But first is objected in behalf of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liasts,</hi>
that they had no Tradition against
them. To which I reply, A contrary Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
might be two waies in force against
them; one formally, as if it had been taught
by the Apostles directly, <hi>Christ shall not raign
upon earth a thousand yeers, as a temporall
King:</hi> The other, that something incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
with such a corporal raign was
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47186:49"/>
taught by Them: and of this I finde two;
one general, another particular; the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
one is, that the pleasures and rewards
promised to Christians are spiritual, and
the whol design of the Christian Law aims
at the taking away all affections towards
corporal Objects; whereas this Errour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
corporal contentments for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of Martyrs, and by consequence, either
encreases, or at least fosters the affection to
bodily pleasures and temporal goods: The
particular one is, that Christ being ascended
to Heaven, is to remain there till the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
judgment: Wherfore it is evident,
by the later, that it is against Tradition;
and, by the former, that it is not only so,
but a Mahumetan, or at least, a Jewish
errour, drawing men essentially to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
as teaching them to fix all their hopes
and expectance hereafter on a life agreeable
to the appetites of flesh and blood.</p>
               <p>'Tis opposed also, that the Fathers of
the purest Ages receiv'd it, as deliver'd from
the Apostles. A fair <hi>Parade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but, if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by the Fathers, <hi>One,</hi> St. <hi>Irenaeus;</hi>
and him deluded by the good Zeal of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias</hi>
(as <hi>Eusebius</hi> testifies) but good even to
folly (for lesse cannot be said of it;) where
is the force of this so plausible argument?
Adde to this that the very expression of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:47186:49"/>
proves it to be no Tradition; for he
sets down the supposed words of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
which plainly shews it is a <hi>Story,</hi> not
a <hi>Tradition;</hi> a <hi>Tradition</hi> (as we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
it) being a sense delivered not in
set words, but setled in the Auditors
hearts, by hundreds of different expressions
explicating the same meaning.</p>
               <p>There follows <hi>Justin Martyr's</hi> testimony,
That All Orthodox Christians in his age
held it; (for <gap reason="foreign">

are not so different, but one may be taken

               </p>
               <p>No more does it help the Adversaries
cause, that <hi>Justin</hi> compares the maintainers
of the conrary opinion to the <hi>Sadduces</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Jews: For, he mentions two sorts
of persons denying his position; wherof
one he resembles to the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> the other
he acknowledges to be good Christians,

of Christians.</p>
               <p>Nor wil the next Objection give us much
trouble, That none oppos'd the <hi>Millenary</hi>
errour before <hi>Dionysius Alexandrinus:</hi> To
which we apply this answer: First, for any
thing we know, it was hidden and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
till his time, and then began to
make a noise, and cause people to look
into it. Secondly, there are probable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to perswade, it was impugn'd long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
For, it being clear, that both Heretiks
and Catholiks sustain'd the contrary, we
cannot wel suppose it was never contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
till then, though the report of it
came not to their ears; since, who consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the few monuments we have of these
first Ages, must easily discern the hundred
part is not deriv'd to us, of what was then
done. But lastly, admit there was no wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
against it till <hi>Dionysius Alexandrinus;</hi>
does it follow, there was no preaching nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>As little can be gathered out of St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's</hi>
being half afraid to write against it;
both because he did write against it, as is
clear in his comment upon St. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
and upon <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where he cals it a <hi>Jewish
Fable,</hi> l. 11. and because the multitude he
speaks of, argues nothing of Tradition, but
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47186:50"/>
the numerosity of that sort of believers,
occasion'd by the writings of the Heretick
<hi>Apollinaris,</hi> as the same Saint testifies, <hi>Comment.
10. in Esaiam.</hi> Neither doth St. <hi>Austin</hi> stick
to condemn it, since those words <hi>c. 7. 24. de
Civit. Dei, esset utcunque tolerabilis,</hi> signifie,
that it is not tolerable.</p>
               <p>Yet truly I cannot but admire, that he who
puts the <hi>Chiliasts</hi> opinion to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
duely and really from the Apostles by
verbal Tradition, should conceive that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
St. <hi>Hierom</hi> or St. <hi>Austin</hi> could think
such a Tradition to be no sign of the
Churches doctrin, or not care whether it
were or no: which seems to me the same
as to impute to these Saints a neglect of
what they thought to be the Churches opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
or els, to the <hi>Church,</hi> a neglect of
what was Christs doctrin, if She would not
accept what She knew was descended verbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from Him; or, at least that St. <hi>Austin</hi> and
St. <hi>Hierom</hi> lay this great slander, of neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the known doctrin of Christ, upon the
Church.</p>

               <head>THE
ELEVENTH ENCOUNTER, That there was Tradition for the Trinity,
before the Council of Nice.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Chiliad</hi> errour seems to have been
only an Usher to the <hi>Arian;</hi> which
speaks far louder for it self. And that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> is placed in the front of
their Evidence, whose testimony is, that The
<hi>Arians</hi> would gladly have been try'd by
the writings yet remaining of those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
who lived before the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi>
for in them will be found certain proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which now (since the Church-Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
is more examin'd) would make the
Speaker thought an <hi>Arian.</hi> From whence
the Opposers infer, that before the Council
of <hi>Nice,</hi> there was no Tradition for the
mystery of the blessed Trinity. But to
maintain this consequence, I see no proof;
for the Cardinal's words clearly import
that the Fathers before that Council (though
being Catholiks, they knew and held the
mystery of the Trinity, yet) in somephrases
spake like <hi>Arians:</hi> How then can any man
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47186:51"/>
draw out of this Antecedent, that these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
believ'd not the <hi>Trinity,</hi> or had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by Tradition the knowledg of that
Mystery? I confess my self unable to see the
least probability in such an inference.</p>
               <p>If it be permitted to guess what <hi>they</hi> aim
at that make this objection: I believe it is
that, some propositions concerning the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
by disputation and discussion, have
been either deduced or clear'd, which before
were not remark'd do draw so much conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
upon the mystery, as since is found
they do: out of which they think it follows
that such propositions were not delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Tradition, and so not our whole
Faith. To this the answer is ready; that,
as he who says a mystery was taught by the
Apostles, does not intend to say the Apostles
taught what the words were, in every Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
which were to signify this Mystery;
so neither is his meaning that they taught,
how many ways the phrase in one language
might be varied, keeping the same sense:
But, as they left the former to the natural
Idiom of the speaker or writer, so the latter
to the Rules of Grammar; as likewise they
left it to the speakers skil in Logick, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
explications or definitions for the
terms wherein they deliver'd the Mysteries.</p>
               <p>It is not therfore to be expected that men,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47186:52"/>
who had receiv'd the Mystery simply and
plainly, should, without both art and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
know how in different cases, to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
it according to the exact rules of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And thus, the defect of the argument
or arguer is, that he supposes, not only the
main verity should be formally convey'd
by <hi>Tradition;</hi> but all manner of explication
and in all terms, which the subtlety or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of Hereticks could afterward
drive the Catholicks to express this Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
by: a task both impossible to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
and most unreasonable to require,
and perhaps unprofitable if it were done.</p>
               <p>Nor therfore does it follow that som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is to be believ'd, which came not
down by Tradition: For, as he that says
<hi>Peter is a man,</hi> says he is a living creature, a
body, a substance, (though he uses not those
words,) because all is comprehended in the
term <hi>Man;</hi> so, he that delivers <hi>One God is
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> delivers, that
those persons are not <hi>Alia</hi> but <hi>Alij,</hi> and
that truly the Son is not an Instrument, a
commanded servant &amp;c. Yet, as it may
happen, that one man sees another to be,
but knows not what the definition of him
is; nor needs he ordinarily know it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knows the thing defined: so may
it also chance that some Fathers, who knew
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47186:52"/>
well enough the mystery, might falter in
explicating it precisely according to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of Logick; and 'tis no good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
The Fathers were less exact in some
expressions concerning the Trinity, therfore
they held it not or had not learn'd it by
<hi>Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I must also intimate, these differences
of speech proceeded many times from the
various usage of the words; as the Greeks
generally say, the Father is <hi>cause</hi> of the Son;
the Latines abhor it, calling him <hi>Principium:</hi>
which difference is not in the meaning, but
in the equivocation of the expression. So we
read in St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that he found an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in some people; one sort saying there
were in the Trinity three <hi>Hypostases</hi> and one
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; another three <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and one <hi>Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis:</hi>
and St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> though perfect in the
Greek Tongue, was so exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with this question, that he sent to St.
<hi>Damasus</hi> for the resolution of it; yet he
wel knew there was no difference in the
sense, but only in the terms; however he
fear'd lest, by the wrong use of the words, he
might unawares be drawn into a wrong
meaning. So likewise did St. <hi>Athanasius</hi>
find, that the two former parties, of which
we spake, agreed in the Catholick <hi>sense,</hi>
though their <hi>words</hi> were opposite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:47186:53"/>
The reason of this opposition is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of these two words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
which primarily and radically signify
the same thing; <hi>Aristotle</hi> telling us, that
<hi>Hypostasis</hi> is <hi>prima</hi> or <hi>primò substantia,</hi> which
in Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: whence it appears, this
word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, does not signify what in Latin
is call'd <hi>natura,</hi> (to which the word <hi>substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
by use, is now appropriated, when we
speak of this mystery) but only in a secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
sense. Again, the word <hi>Hypostasis</hi> is
deriv'd from <hi>Substando,</hi> or <hi>Subsistendo,</hi> and
therfore usually translated <hi>Subsistentia</hi> and
might properly be exprest by <hi>Substantia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, applying this to the mystery of the
<hi>Trinity,</hi> Because in God there is one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Nature,</hi> abstrahible from three <hi>proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
therfore the <hi>nature</hi> seems to <hi>substare</hi> to
the said <hi>properties</hi> and so deserv the name
<hi>Hypostasis:</hi> wherupon some explicated the
<hi>Trinity</hi> to be <hi>una hypostasis, et tres Ousiae.</hi> For
<hi>Ousia</hi> being deriv'd from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Ens,</hi> and <hi>Ens</hi> or
<hi>Substantia,</hi> and (in Greek) <hi>Ousia</hi> signifying
primarily what the Schools term <hi>Suppositum</hi>
(that we see with our eys, a demonstrable
singular, named substance, as <hi>Bucephalus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos</hi>
&amp;c. which among men (if restrain'd to
particulars) is call'd <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> (if u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at larg) in the common name a person:)
these men, very Catholikly, said three <hi>Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia's</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:47186:53"/>
and one <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> meaning three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and one God. But, the Fathers of the
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> (by much pondering these
words, by their debates with the <hi>Arians,</hi>
and to determine a rule in speaking, that
Catholicks might not be subject, through
equivocation, to be drawn into errour,) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon the contrary; because <hi>Hypostasis</hi>
was more commonly in use for that we call
a <hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>Ousia</hi> was rather a School term
fetch'd from Philosophers books, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might, with less violence to common
language, be taken in a secondary sense.
Thus it became the rule of speaking in the
Church, to say three <hi>Hypastases</hi> and one
<hi>Ousia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, those speeches which <hi>Perron</hi> cites
are not so harsh, but as, in a rigorous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
they are fals, so, in a moderate
sense, they contain undeniable truths. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
divide instruments into <hi>Conjuncta</hi>
and <hi>Separata;</hi> and, among the <hi>Conjuncta,</hi>
number up our Arms and Legs &amp;c. which
are our very substance: It does not therfore
follow, if the <hi>Son</hi> be called an <hi>Instrument,</hi>
that his <hi>substance</hi> is distinguish'd from the
<hi>Substance</hi> of his <hi>Father;</hi> because the <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality</hi>
consists in nothing but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their notional conceits of <hi>Being</hi>
and <hi>Knowledg,</hi> wherof <hi>Knowledg</hi> seems to be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47186:54"/>
but the <hi>Vehiculum</hi> of <hi>Being</hi> towards the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or effect: So likewise, whoever works
by a power that is not in himself, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then from another in whom 'tis <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pialiter</hi>
and (as the Greek speaks both anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
and at this day,) <hi>Authoritativè</hi> may,
not improperly, be said to be commanded;
though the other be not his <hi>Master</hi> or <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
Neither is there such rigour in the
genders of <hi>aliud</hi> and <hi>alius,</hi> but that <hi>aliud</hi> is
many times apply'd to the person; and only
Ecclesiastical use, grounded on the height
of propriety and distinction of Genders,
binds us to this manner of speaking, which
for unity and charity sake we observe.</p>
               <p>Out of what has been discours'd about
the name <hi>Ousia,</hi> we may easily solve the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
contradiction of the Council of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
to that of <hi>Nice:</hi> for, if <hi>Ousia</hi> may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
a <hi>person,</hi> (as we have shew'd it does, in
its best and chiefest signification;) then <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moousion</hi>
signifies <hi>the same person.</hi> So that
the Conncil of <hi>Antioch,</hi> denying Christ to
be <hi>Homoousios</hi> to his Father, deny'd no more
then that he was the same person with his
Father; which no subtlety can ever prove
to be against the Fathers of the <hi>Nicen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi>
Nor is this said to reconcile contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories,
but discover equivocations: For
that this was the true reason of the opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47186:54"/>
is easily deduc'd out of both St. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
and St. <hi>Hillary,</hi> and the question which
St. <hi>Hierom</hi> made to St. <hi>Damasus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be urged, if there were a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
Tradition, how could the Christians,
through want of caution, contradict one
another: or, had it been as known a part
of Religion as <hi>the Resurrection,</hi> how could
<hi>Constantine</hi> have so slighted it, when it first
rose, or <hi>Alexander</hi> the holy Bishop for a
while have remain'd in suspence? To this
I answer, If, by <hi>verbal Tradition,</hi> be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that the Tradition was deliver'd in <hi>set
words;</hi> certainly those <hi>set words</hi> could not
be doubted of, though their sense must needs
be capable of eternal controversy: but the
meaning of <hi>verbal,</hi> here intended, is only as
contradistinguisht to <hi>written</hi> Tradition;
which (being in <hi>set words,</hi> whose interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is continually subject to dispute) is
therfore opposed to <hi>Oral</hi> or <hi>mental,</hi> where
the <hi>sense</hi> is known, and all the question is
about the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>expressions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheless, suppose it had been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
in a set and determinate phrase, and
that Hereticks began to use other words;
a controversy might be about those terms
which the Hereticks introduc'd, and many
might demur, uncertain of the question in
such new expressions: as we see, those who
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47186:55"/>
rely on Scripture are in perpetual quarrels
about the sense; wheras, to Catholicks,
the <hi>sense</hi> of their Faith is certain, though
the <hi>words</hi> be sometimes in question.</p>
               <p>The reason therfore, why, at <hi>Arius</hi> his first
broaching that desperate heresy, <hi>Alexander</hi>
remain'd a while in suspence, was not that
he understood not his own Faith, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he apprehended not what <hi>Arius</hi> meant,
nor whether his propositions were contrary
to the receiv'd truth: But when once <hi>Arius</hi>
broke into those speeches, that <hi>Christ was a
creature,</hi> and that <hi>there was a time when Christ
was not;</hi> then that holy Bishop likewise
broke into those words, <hi>Quis unquam talia
audivit?</hi> and this is the crime which <hi>Socrates</hi>
reprehends in <hi>Arius,</hi> that he began to move
points <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, formerly not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd,
but receiv'd with an uniform con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and credulity. As for <hi>Alexanders</hi> prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
somtimes one, somtimes the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it proves no more then that he was a
prudent man: though <hi>Ruffinus</hi> seems to tax
him of oversoftness. But, because few fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
can be void of all truth, and few truths
(at least before much discussion) totally
free from all mixture of circumstantial er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
therfore it could not be otherwise
then wel, to praise both sides ingenuously,
according as they spake truth and reason,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47186:55"/>
and discommend them, when they fell into
falsities.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Constantine's</hi> slighting the Question
at first, it shews no more but that, then, he
did not penetrate the consequence of it, or
rather, was not well enform'd concerning
it. For, ordinarily, the craftiest and most
active party are they who make the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
and if themselves be in the wrong,
(as many times such are more eager and
diligent then those that hold the right)
their remonstrance is accordingly. And so
it was: for, <hi>Constantine</hi> receiv'd his first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
at <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> very probably too,
from <hi>Eusebius,</hi> Bishop of that City, a most
perverse adherent to <hi>Arius:</hi> nor did <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
himself know wherin the question
consisted; as appears by this, that in his
whol Letter there is not one word of expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the point, but only in common,
that it was of slight questions, not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the substance of Faith; the <hi>Arians</hi>
stil craftily endeavouring to diminish the
importance of the controversie. Besides, we
have good ground to believe, that some
learned men in Court were prevented by
<hi>Arius,</hi> and sollicited into a secr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> favour of
this errour; from whom, 'tis likely, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
that motion of <hi>Constantine</hi> to the
<hi>Council,</hi> for determining the point out of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47186:56"/>
                  <hi>Scripture.</hi> Nor imports it, that the Bishops
contradicted not this proposition of the
Emperour in words; because they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to follow it, (though not to that end to
which the Emperour propos'd it, <hi>viz.</hi> the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the question, but) to the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and satisfaction of the
world.</p>
               <p>For, to speak to the reality of the business,
there was no doubt among the Fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the truth or falsity of the main matter,
(being fully satisfied concerning that, by
Tradition, even from their childhood:)
but the question was about the answer to
their enemies proofs, and to consult what
arguments and reasons should be alledged
against them; for the satisfaction of the
Church, and the world without the Church,
and for the expression of the Catholik
doctrin, in such words as the <hi>Arians</hi> could
not equivocally interpret to their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
meaning: especially, finding they had
fo puzled the world with the dust they had
rais'd in mens eyes, that even some good
Catholiks could scarce see their way, but
were in danger of stumbling against the
blocks those Hereticks maliciously cast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their feet. <hi>Eusebius Caesariensis</hi> testifies
of himself, that He thought <hi>Alexander's</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had held the <hi>Son</hi> of God to be divided
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47186:56"/>
from the <hi>Father,</hi> as one part is cut from
another in Bodies; which would have made
God a body, and truly two Gods.</p>
               <p>For these reasons was their <hi>magna conqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitio,</hi>
their turning of Scriptures, and their
meeting in Council, as St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
speaking in the name of the very
Council it self, in his Epistle <hi>de Synodis:</hi>
We met here (says he) not because we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Faith, (that is, <hi>because we were uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
what to hold)</hi> but, to confound those
who contradict the truth and goe about
novelties.</p>
               <p>Neither can any argument be made out
of <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s Epistle to some <hi>Arians,</hi> in which
he says, The Bishops of the Council appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the word <hi>homoousion,</hi> because they found
it in some illustrious Fathers: for, though
the inward sense of that term was perfectly
traditional, yet was it not til then precisely
fixt to that particular expression. But the
same Bishpos consented to the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Contradictors, <hi>to hinder men
from using unwritten words:</hi> and was not
that a proper and prudent remedy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the inconveniences that easily arise
from confusion and incertainty of language;
when every one phrases the mystery, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his private fancy, and governs not
his terms by some constant and steady rule,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47186:57"/>
as, the writings of the Apostles or ancient
Fathers: which interpretation exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with the Greek of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

that literally and truly signifie
Words written neither in Scripture nor any
where else, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was in the
Fathers. And so, I need not alledge He was
a secret <hi>Arian;</hi> though, if he were, his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
as far as it reaches, would be so much
the more efficacious against them, as <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
imploys it.</p>
               <p>Now, by all this may be seen, why in
Councils there are engag'd so many dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
for no calumny can be so impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as to deny, the Fathers know their
Faith before they meet there; which is
plainly imply'd by the Hereticks ordinary
protesting against them, as unfit Judges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are parties, and therfore refusing
to come to the Council; besides, the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the old Religion being as publik
and notorious, at such times, as the Sun it
self at noon: wherfore, to say they come
to seek out or dispute their Religion, by
those long conferences, is a pure folly. They
then hold their Religion upon <hi>Tradition</hi> or
<hi>possession:</hi> but dispute things, either for regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the Churches language, that all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks
may keep a set form of explication
of their Faith; or else to convince their
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47186:57"/>
Adversaries out of such grounds as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
admit.</p>
               <p>To dispute, whether a <hi>Council,</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by the <hi>Pope,</hi> makes an Article <hi>de fide,</hi>
or no? concerns not the difficulty now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us; and engages Catholick against Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
which is not our present work.
In the mean while, out of all which has been
said, we may gather, that there is no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the Catholick Doctrin, concerning the
<hi>Trinity,</hi> was diversly taught before the
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and, then first, establish'd out
of the Scriptures: but, that it was the known
and confessed faith of all the Ages before,
as St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> expresly teaches; avowing
confidently he had demonstrated it, suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the Emperour to permit the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
to live in the belief of their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and upbraiding his adversaries that
they could not shew their progenitors. And
to say the truth, unless a man be so perverse
as to affirm Christians did not use the form
of <hi>Baptism</hi> prescrib'd by Christ, there can be
no doubt of the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the blessed <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi>
the very words of Baptism carrying
the Tradition in themselvs.</p>
               <p>Lastly, 'tis objected, there was no
reason for the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> in this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
to look into <hi>Tradition,</hi> since they had
such abundance of <hi>Scripture.</hi> But we must
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47186:58"/>
put out our eys, if we do not see that even
at this day the <hi>Arians</hi> are so cunning as to
avoid the strongest Texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and
explicate them by other places; and that
'tis impossible to convince, in this manner,
any Heretick, as long as one place can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
a hundred opposed. The Council
therfore, at last, (though favour'd with as
much advantage as Scripture could give
over its adversaries) was forc'd to conclude
out of <hi>Tradition:</hi> as <hi>Theodoretus,</hi> St. <hi>John Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascen,</hi>
and chiefly St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself
confesses: a necessity which the Rules of St.
<hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Basil,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius
Lyrinensis</hi> (who teach, <hi>it is to no purpose to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with Hereticks out of Scripture,)</hi> and our
own experience of above a hundred years,
plainly convince and fully justify to any
rational man, whose humour or interest is
not to have all Religion obscure and
doubtful.</p>

               <head>THE
TWELFTH ENCOUNTER. That the necessity of Communicating In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
is no Tradition; But Prayer to
Saints is.</head>
               <p>THere are yet two instances urged against
<hi>Tradition.</hi> One that, for six hundred
years, 'twas believ'd necessary to give the
holy <hi>Eucharist</hi> to children; which custom
has now been a long time disused. The
proof, as far as I know of the <hi>necessity,</hi> is
drawn only out of St. <hi>Austin</hi> and St. <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius,</hi>
and some words of St. <hi>Cyprian:</hi>
The former of which Fathers are cited to
make this argument against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi>
The <hi>Eucharist</hi> cannot be given, unless to
those who are baptized: But the <hi>Eucharist</hi>
is necessary for <hi>Children:</hi> Therfore <hi>Baptism</hi>
is necessary for them. To which I answer
with a formal denyal, that any such argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is made by those holy Fathers: For
their discours runs thus, It is necessary for
<hi>Children</hi> to be incorporated into Christs
mystical body; but this cannot be done
without Baptism: therfore Baptism is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47186:59"/>
for <hi>Children.</hi> Whether of us take the
right sense of these Fathers, let the Books
judg; I will only add, 'tis a great shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to think the <hi>Pelagians</hi> (who deny'd the
necessity of Baptism) should admit the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> or that it was easier
for those Fathers to prove the necessity of
the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> then of <hi>Baptism;</hi> So that, their
argument must be suppos'd, by the objector,
to be drawn <hi>ex magis obscuro ad minus obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, because, especially, St. <hi>Austins</hi> words
seem equivocal, I will briefly set down the
state of the question. St. <hi>Dennis</hi> tels us, no
Priestly function was compleat without the
administration of the blessed Sacrament:
Thence came a custom to communicate
those who were baptiz'd. This custom rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
even to Infants, but neither universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that is, in all Churches nor indispensably:
For, it was only then used, when <hi>Bishops</hi>
were present at Baptism; as is apparent,
both because <hi>Communion</hi> was never admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
anciently, but after <hi>Confirmation;</hi> and
because, it was always held for the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all Priestly Benedictions, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
declared: Besides, in some Churches,
there is not the least sign that ever it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>Infants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another thing to be understood is, that St.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47186:59"/>
                  <hi>Austin</hi> uses to explicate the Communion to
be an incorporation into Christs mystical
Body; of which no doubt but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
body is both a figure and cause.
This St. <hi>Austin</hi> himself, upon the sixth of
St. <hi>John,</hi> plainly delivers, and, in his phrase,
takes the <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> of <hi>Christs Body</hi>
to be <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Baptism:</hi> So do <hi>Orosius, Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
Fulgentius</hi> and <hi>Facundus,</hi> either expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
or following him. This equivocal
manner of speaking makes those, who are
either not attentive enough, or not willing
to have him speak orthodoxly, construe his
words <hi>Grammatically,</hi> that are spoken Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically;
which last his best Interpreters,
and most expert in his works, accompt to
be his opinion.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this History, After their
loud and full cry, as if the prey were in their
sight, which I believe wii never come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their reach, (for a deep mouth is a sign
of slow heels;) let us see how necessary the
<hi>African</hi> Church (an objection more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
urged) thought Baptism it self was to
<hi>Infants,</hi> that is, in how perpetual use. And
presently <hi>Tertullian</hi> (the mainly cited and
glorify'd for St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> Master) tells us
<hi>lib. de Bap. c. 18. Itaque pro cujusque personae

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47186:60"/>
to the other two) reports what hapned to
himself, having ask'd Baptism in his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,

can we think the Eucharist was? or
is here any probability it was <hi>so</hi> us'd to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as not to be also often omitted, and
that lawfully?</p>

so directly against the Council of

assertion is manifestly fals: Since, 'tis known

<hi>Confirmation;</hi> and <hi>Baptism,</hi> without <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi>
was held sufficient for salvation;
as is beyond cavil, expressed by St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,

               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:47186:60"/>
The last instance is of <hi>Prayer to Saints,</hi>
which is proved not to have proceeded by
<hi>Tradition</hi> from the Apostles time; by four
arguments. First, because divers Fathers
held that the souls of Saints were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
into Heaven, till the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
therfore certainly they would teach
no prayer to Saints. The Antecedent I
will not dispute; not that I believe it, but
that I know not what it is to our question:
For, suppose they are not; may they not
nevertheless pray for us? we Catholicks
think that <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Prophet was not in
the <hi>Macchabees</hi> days admitted into Heaven,
yet we make no difficulty to believe that
he did <hi>multum orare pro populo &amp; sancta civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</hi>
Those Fathers that are cited for the
<hi>Receptacles,</hi> are acknowledg'd to place the
Saints in <hi>Sinu Abrahae;</hi> and our Saviour
teaches us, that <hi>Dives</hi> prayed to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
The Protestants, as well as we, allow prayer
to living Saints: wherever then the dead
Saints are, are they worse then when they
were living, that they may not be prayed
to? But the principal answer to destroy ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
this objection, is, that those who say
we learn by <hi>Tradition,</hi> that <hi>Saints are to be
prayed to,</hi> say likewise we have learn'd by
<hi>Tradition</hi> that Saints go to heaven, that is,
are admitted to the fight of God, before the
day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:47186:61"/>
The next proof is, that prayer to Saints
began with a doubting preface of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
to which I find my self no ways engaged
to frame a particular answer, having no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ground from my Adversary (who cites
not any Author) to explicate the meaning
of this objection. I remember, <hi>Cardinal
Richelieu,</hi> at his death, is reported to have
taken his kinsman, <hi>Marshal de Meilleray,</hi> by
the hand, and told him that, <hi>if the next world
were such as was figured to us here,</hi> (I deliver
what I conceiv to be the sense, not the words)
<hi>he would not fail to pray for him:</hi> Now some,
who had a hard opinion of that great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
would press out of this speech, that he
beleev'd not the Immortality of the Soul.
Whether this also be pretended to be the
meaning of that Optative term, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
I cannot judg; for then I should easily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it has some force against the Tradition
of praying to Saints: But, if it be but an
Oratorial expression and obtestation, such
as is in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he presses men to
good works, by the like phrase; I know not
how it reaches any way to his intent, and
much less against the receiving of this use
by Tradition: except the objector suppose
that, truly, the first Prayer he finds in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
was the first that ever was made, which
is neither proved nor probable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:47186:61"/>
The third opposition is out of <hi>Nicephorus
Calixtus,</hi> who reports, that Prayers to the
<hi>Virgin Mary</hi> were first brought into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>Liturgie,</hi> by <hi>Petrus Gnaphaeus,</hi> a Heretick.
The consequence I should make out of this
antecedent is, that, seeing the Author's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Heretik (a condemnd and hated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
could not hinder this institution to
take root and be approved, 'tis a sign it had
a deeper foundation then of his beginning:
not that it was before in the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> but
that it was an ordinary practice among
Christians; which use, because we know no
origin it has in <hi>Scripture,</hi> must have been
out of <hi>Tradition,</hi> and not of a short time:
how our Adversary wil prove the contrary,
I am not able to make any likely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
               <p>The last argument is drawn out of the
confession of our own Doctours, who affirm,
there is no Precept for praying to Saints in
the Church of God (for so much is meant
by those words, <hi>sub Evangelio;)</hi> and yeild
the reason, that Pagans might not think
themselves brought again to the worship of
men. Which Antecedent having two parts,
the non-precept, and the reason thereof:
out of the first part nothing can be deduced;
out of the second this consequence is infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
Pagans would be equally scandaliz'd
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47186:62"/>
by the Permission, as by the Precept. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if it be commanded, neither certainly
ought it be permitted.</p>
               <p>Although no law obliges one Divine to
maintain the reasons of another, yet I see
no such evidence in this consequence, as, for
it, to renounce the reason: for, me thinks,
if those we call <hi>Saints,</hi> were meant to be
Gods, we should of <hi>necessity</hi> be bound to
worship them; whence it follows, if it be
not <hi>necessary</hi> to worship them, neither are
they Gods, nor the worship exhibited to
them, such as is due to God; but only of
that degree which we give excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
a position so conformable to Nature,
that it can scandalize none but the enemies
of Perfection; who, under pretence of avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Idolatry, take away the due honour
and excitation to Vertue. But, which way,
out of a <hi>non-Precept,</hi> can be infer'd the <hi>non-Teaching</hi>
of the Doctrin, I cannot imagine;
since what those Doctors hold, continues
true at this day, when it cannot be denied
that <hi>Praying</hi> to <hi>Saints</hi> is both taught and
practiced: For though, in our prayers, there
be some directions to Saints; yet, generally,
Christians are not bound to such d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>votions,
and they that are, 'tis but their own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
acceptance of the obligation to which
such prayers are annexed.</p>

God would have us trust the Church, he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47186:63"/>
was not both to specifie so much, very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in them, and farther deliver such signs as
were necessary ever to know Her by.</p>
               <p>For answer, I ask a cross question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if God Almighty would have all men
see by the <hi>Sun,</hi> he was first to tell them
which It is, and paint 'Its picture on every
wall, that so we might know which is the
<hi>Sun?</hi> And because any question may seem
rather offensive then deserving any answer,
I proceed to the application; and ask, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any of those Christians, of whom Saint
<hi>John</hi> says, <hi>exierunt ex nobis,</hi> could doubt
which was the Church, wherof he had been
a part and left it? And, since you cannot
answer otherwise then affirmatively, I think
I need not repeat the same question, of <hi>Arius,</hi>
and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and <hi>Luther.</hi> If then God has
provided for all these, that they were taught
to yeild obedience to the definitions of this
<hi>Church,</hi> so clearly, that they could neither
doubt which <hi>Church</hi> was their teacher, nor
of what <hi>Church</hi> he spake; how dare they
presume to accuse him of deficiency in his
providence? The same <hi>Authority</hi> that gave
you the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and told you it was the
<hi>Word of God,</hi> said likewise, that what she
taught was <hi>no lesse</hi> the Word of God. If
you believe her report for the <hi>Book,</hi> why
refuse you it for the <hi>Doctrin?</hi> If her recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47186:63"/>
be not security enough for the one,
they will certainly prove far less for the
other; since, unlesse I am strangely mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the doctrin of the <hi>Catholik Church</hi> is
not so hard to believe, as the story of the
<hi>Bible:</hi> let any <hi>Atheist</hi> or discreet <hi>Moore</hi> or
<hi>Pagan</hi> be judge.</p>
               <p>Oh, but since the Evangelists wrote <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,</hi>
they wrote all they preach'd; for they
preach'd nothing but the <hi>Gospel.</hi> The <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>
is known to be the same with the Greek
<hi>Evangelium,</hi> that is, the <hi>Good-spel,</hi> or happy
tidings of Christs comming: so that the
Book or Preaching which tels us <hi>Christ is
come,</hi> is a <hi>Gospel,</hi> be there never so much,
more or lesse, in the Book or Sermon: how
then it can be infer'd out of the name <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
that the Apostles writ as much as they
preach'd (for it is not credible they preach'd
all they wrote) I am not able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>
               <p>The second consideration is, how we
know when the Church has defined? To
which I answer, In the practice of sixteen
ages it has no more been doubted, when
the <hi>Church</hi> had <hi>defined,</hi> then when a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
had <hi>enacted:</hi> Why then is there requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
more information? But, some Divines
say more, some less to be enough. Let them
be doing in the Schools, as long as the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47186:64"/>
goes on sufficiently for the Churches
government.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to consider, Whether suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
notes be left to know the Church by?
But who shall use these notes? Catholicks?
They are in the Church. Hereticks? They
know what Church they forsook. Pagans?
They look not into the Scriptures to finde
the Churches mark. Peradventure those He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
whose separation is so long since,
that they remember not out of what Church
they went. But none are grown so aged yet.
However the marks of the Church are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
enough in Scripture, if there want not
wil in the seeker to acknowledg them.</p>
               <p>The fourth consideration is, Whether
points of Faith, or to be of Faith, be infinite
(new ones continually springing) or finite?
if finite, why are they not all delivered at
once, to make an end of incertitude and
defining? The answer is, they are both fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and infinite: finite, in <hi>gross,</hi> and wholy
deliver'd by the Apostles, wholy believed
and practis'd by this present Church; but
infinite, in the <hi>detail,</hi> by which mans wit can
parcel out this general stock of Faith. For,
as soon as any sharp and crafty Heretik has
varied some proposition, necessary to the
explication of a fore-believed Doctrin,
there may be occasion of setling some new
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47186:64"/>
proposition, which shal be no other then a
part of what was formerly believ'd in <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
though not so explicitly deciphred.
As he that professes Christ is a Man, implies
he has a mans Nature, a mans Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and Will, and Action; though this
word <hi>Man</hi> distinguishes not precisely these
faculties: nor does he that repeats all these
qualities in particular, say any more then
he that said in general he was a Man. Now
then I answer the objection, as <hi>Aesops</hi> Master
did those who would have bound him to
drink up the Sea: stop the Rivers (said he)
and I will performe my bargain: So say I,
hinder impertinent curiosities from impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning
the Church, and her Truths wil be
undoubtedly seen in her belief and practice,
without making new Definitions.</p>
               <p>The last objection; that it will appear a
shift to say the Churches definitions are
certain, and yet not let it be known when
she has defin'd, of it self falls flat to the
ground: both because I take not that way;
and, if I did, since we are not troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
knowing our Churches Definitions,
who have the burthen of obeying and do it
in practice, the Objectors are confuted as
<hi>Diogenes</hi> did <hi>Zeno,</hi> (when he disputed against
<hi>motion,)</hi> by walking before him.</p>
               <p>For all this, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> must not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47186:65"/>
escape yet: And so, we are told that, if she
were design'd for the <hi>Pharos</hi> to know the
rest of the Church by, somwhat had been
advan'd; for, otherwise (say they) we can
assign no mark of the true Church, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
being deny'd to be such as we make
her. First, I answer, we have no need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> it being the
infallible distinctive sign of the Church, <hi>to
lay claim to the handed Doctrin,</hi> or <hi>Tradition,</hi>
which evidently appears cannot be claim'd
by two: For, if two agree in a point to day,
and one dissent to morrow, it were mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to say the disagreer can lay claim to
yesterdays opinion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we say, if we would fly to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, the oppositions force us not
from it: For, why is not <hi>Cardinal Perrons</hi>
answer to <hi>Plessis</hi> invincible, that the <hi>whole
Church</hi> condemn'd St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> proceedings?
Likewise the <hi>Asian Bishops</hi> were condemn'd
in the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> The <hi>African Bishops</hi>
question was about the enacting a Law,
which nevertheless, was carried for the
<hi>Bishop of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Fathers remit us to the <hi>Apostolical
Churches,</hi> whose <hi>successions</hi> were, then, visible
and evident; what's that to us, now, when
all <hi>successions</hi> are interrupted, save only
that of the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> The definition
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47186:65"/>
of the <hi>Council of Calcedon</hi> is known to be only
the conspiracy of a <hi>Cabal,</hi> never approved
as legitimate; but revers'd afterwards: So
that all these angry darts turn their points
against their Authors; the judgment in every
instance having past in favour of the Church
they oppose. But this question, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is of greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and importance then to be huddled
up in one sheet of Paper: Therfore, let us
leave Her to the acknowledg'd Majesty she
possesses in the Christian world; and not,
by slight objections and answers, rather
seem to undervalue her Dignity, then either
oppose or defend her Authority.</p>
               <p>You present us therfore next, with what
is kept for the closing of our stomacks; and
they are two dishes: One, that at last we
Catholicks resolve into <hi>Reason,</hi> as well as
<hi>Protestants.</hi> To this I answer, if you mean
we must see <hi>Reason</hi> why we give credit to
<hi>Authority,</hi> I agree with you: But then, since
Reason is on both sides, Why (say you)
must it be a <hi>Wall</hi> to us, and a <hi>Bulrush</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
Ile tell you. <hi>Reason</hi> has two parts,
<hi>Demonstration</hi> and <hi>Sophistry;</hi> and, in <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,</hi>
that evidence which governs our
Lives, is the most familiar to us, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
besides its firmness, 'tis the most
clear and least denyable: Now, this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47186:66"/>
that we ought to <hi>believe</hi> a <hi>knowing
person,</hi> in <hi>that</hi> wherin our selvs are <hi>ignorant,</hi>
is, of this nature, a Maxime that governs
all our life, publick and private: wherfore
<hi>our</hi> ground or <hi>Reason,</hi> is a <hi>wall,</hi> a rock, or
if any thing be yet more solid. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, of all parts of <hi>Sophistry,</hi> that which
is built on broken ends of obscure sentences
of dead men, who cannot declare themselvs,
is the most weak and contemptible: and
<hi>this</hi> being that you rely on, <hi>Reason</hi> therfore,
to <hi>you</hi> is weaker and more deceitful then any
<hi>Bul-rush.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second dish is, that whatever is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
in defence of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> only
proves that, <hi>as yet,</hi> she is the true Church:
not that she cannot leave the way she is in,
and fall to reform (as her adversaries cal
it;) or that there may not happen some
<hi>Shism</hi> among the Churches <hi>now</hi> adhering to
her, where both parts may claim Tradition:
and then where is the guide? To this I ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
I will not weigh the proofs of others
for the eternity of the <hi>particular</hi> Church of
<hi>Rome:</hi> since there is no contest betwixt us
here, about that: but those who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>controversies,</hi> cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that our writers intend to prove <hi>Her</hi>
indefectibility. All I'le say is, did you but
agree with us, that she is at <hi>present</hi> the true
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47186:66"/>
Church, it would be argument enough for
you to submit, til the cases happen which
you suppose possible; and I should think
my self too grating and severe towards a
Person, in other respects extreamly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
if I should press harder, then
<hi>so</hi> upon him, nor could I desire a repast
more delightful to my soul, then to have
seen <hi>that</hi> in practice concerning him, which
is now too late to be hoped.</p>

               <head>THE
FOURTEENTH ENCOUNTER. Four other Arguments revers'd.</head>
               <p>SUch is the condition of Religion, when
the liberty of chusing is permitted to all
that have the boldness to challeng it; who
having no other Scales, to poise any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
propos'd them, then the affection to
their own wils or prejudice against others
reasons, suffer every light objection to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verballance
the most weighty and solid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.
Therfore am I forc'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
certain other Adversaries (my chase
not being confin'd only to the <hi>noble</hi> game)
into every by-turn and beat every little
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47186:67"/>
bush, where either the necessity of a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
cause, the fables of some wild Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or the craft of any jugling Hypocrite
can drive them to hide their weak heads in.</p>
               <p>As for reason, in our present business,
they tel you, every one is born in <hi>liberty</hi> to
Religion, and, til it be demonstrated he is
bound to acknowledg some Teacher, the
presumption stands for <hi>liberty,</hi> and 'tis meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of curtesy and graciousness, they take the
pains to bring arguments for the Negative.
This I shal answer as the <hi>Caprich</hi> of some
pragmatical Chaplain; not having incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
enough to entertain the least suspition,
that so great a Wit, stored with Art, in so
busy a time about questions of government,
should bring forth so mishapen a Monster.
But alas! what cannot an unruly fancy,
that bites the bridle of reason? Say then,
my young Divines, of Politick, of Paternal
government, what you say of Religion: Is
not the absurdity so palpable, it wil make
you asham'd? That no child is bound to
honour Father and Mother, till it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
to him he ought to do so? No
Subject to obey the Magistrate, til, after a
long dispute his power be evidently proved
legitimate? Pass from these to Arts, and say
every one may play the Physitian, the Pilot,
the Judg, (for Doctor of Divinity, you free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47186:67"/>
give your licence to all the world)
without having any Master or Teacher,
what a goodly Common-wealth you wil
make?</p>
               <p>But 'tis reply'd, <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit
veritati,</hi> no more then <hi>Regi;</hi> since <hi>veritas
fortior est Rege.</hi> I, Sir, but in your <hi>major</hi>
you put <hi>veritas,</hi> and in your <hi>minor, falsitas.</hi>
For, what is your truth, when you come to
declare your self, but probable arguments,
of which nothing is more certain, then that
they have no truth in them? a proof, as
such, still carrying its truth in its force of
concluding; but probable arguments have
no force to conclude, and consequently, no
truth. For, the truth of a <hi>saying</hi> is different
from that of an <hi>argument:</hi> a true <hi>argument</hi>
being <hi>that</hi> which <hi>proves</hi> the thing to be; a
true <hi>saying</hi> which only <hi>affirms</hi> it to be.</p>
               <p>And, if we look into it, we see, what I
say is but the Law of Nature, and naturall
constancy: for as, <hi>to not act,</hi> 'tis enough to
have <hi>no</hi> reason; but, <hi>to act,</hi> we ought to
have a <hi>positive</hi> cause: so, to <hi>remain</hi> in the
Religion of our Birth and Education, there
is no other reason requir'd, then because
we are in it; whereas, to <hi>change,</hi> we must
have efficacious motives to perswade us.</p>
               <p>Here, my Adversary wil exult, and think,
at least, Protestants cannot become Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47186:68"/>
without evidence, which he conceives
impossible. And, I grant his consequence,
if he can prove his supposition. For, to my
sight, nothing is more clear then, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
<hi>chang'd</hi> their Religion from being
Catholiks, and that upon but probable
grounds: whence it is evident, no Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
who is formally such, (that is, holds
his Religion on probable arguments, against
the Catholik Church) but stands in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
formal rebellion against <hi>Her,</hi> who
by his own acknowledgment was once his
Magistrate, and against whom himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
he has no more then probable excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Therfore, whoever, of a Protestant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Catholik, goes so far with evidence,
that he reconciles himself to a government
under which he once was, and had no just
reason to depart from it, (none being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to excuse so great a disorder) and so,
ought, under peril of eternal damnation,
return to his first obedience. For, where he
is, he is certain to find no security; since,
his relyance, by his own verdict, is at most
but upon plausible arguments: wheras, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the other government, there may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
for ought he knows; of which there
is this fair motive, that they all professe it,
which is more forcible for the credit of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47186:68"/>
it, then what ever he can say in abetment of
the contrary. Rashly, therfore, he opposes
himself to follow a fals way, a way that
assuredly leads to unavoydable precipices.</p>
               <p>They reply, the <hi>Turks</hi> also agree in the
<hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and yet that brings no
evidence their Law is true. But alas! they
observe not that, in saying so, they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
call themselves no Christians: For,
to us, this consent is no argument <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metanism
is true,</hi> because it carries no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then that <hi>the Law is Mahomets;</hi> And so
far is manifest out of <hi>their</hi> common agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
therfore, in parity, 'tis evident, out of
the consent of <hi>Christians,</hi> that the doctrin
handed down from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> is <hi>Christs;</hi>
and the doubt may perhaps remain with
the Objectors, but not with us, whether
<hi>Cbrists</hi> doctrine be true? as neither we nor
they doubt that <hi>Mahomets</hi> preaching was
fals.</p>
               <p>And seeing the case is common to all
Christians, against the Roman Catholik,
he only relying on <hi>Tradition,</hi> they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
it, he only can run his Religion
up to the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> and there leave it
securely establisht, upon the infallible credit
of his word. And as no other sort of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
society can pretend to this priviledge, so
neither can they with any colour of justice,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47186:69"/>
exempt themselves from the Authority of
that Church that enjoys it: an Authority,
which, if ever she had, and such as she claims
it, is of so unchangeable a nature, being
constituted by God, being the <hi>rock</hi> on which
the salvation of mankind is built, and the
fundamental <hi>stone</hi> of the Church, no time
nor variation of material accidents can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
or prescribe against it. Wherfore, if
Protestants at first departed unjustifiably,
they remain for ever guilty of the same
crime, til they restore themselves to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
union.</p>
               <p>Again, who, unles he had renounc'd all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
ever call'd it <hi>liberty,</hi> not to know, or
not be bound to the rules and principles of
good life? Sure these objectors either think
religion concerns not good life, but is a vain
and empty <hi>Idea</hi> in the air, little important
whether it be known or no: or forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so far, as to fall into the sequel of this
gross absurdity. Besides, who can be so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly
passionate, as to term it liberty, to have
no good <hi>government;</hi> and relaps again to the
rude state of barbarousnes, where murther,
rapes, &amp; a thousand intolerable insolencies
are publikly permitted? For, if we cast our
eys on the End of Religion, we shall see, that
to want the due Rules, is as inconvenient
towards the direction of mankind to final
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47186:69"/>
beatitude, as the Laws of <hi>Canibals</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to all civil and friendly society.
So that 'tis to be ignorant of all reason, to
cry up a liberty to have no Religion, or to
chuse one indifferently, as unconcern'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be right or wrong. Were it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
plainly to avow the preferrence of the
pleasures and profits of this world, before
hopes so far off as the future life; then,
with these ambushes, to ensnare unwary
souls into the same inconveniencies, under
title of <hi>a probable Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly, if we look upon their lives,
we shall find that <hi>hoc Janus summus ab imo
Personat.</hi> I intend not by this any waies to
derogate from the old <hi>Roman vertues,</hi> in this
sort of people, as if there may not be found
<hi>Regulus's,</hi> or <hi>Cato's,</hi> or <hi>Seneca's</hi> among them:
for, I doubt not but the very vapour of
Christianity has this wholsom effect among
whom it passes, to breed in them as <hi>Heroick</hi>
spirits as ancient <hi>Rome</hi> ever saw, and more
too, if the like occasions presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
But Nature, and Generosity, and
Opinion, too often challenge their shares,
or rather mastery, in such actions; and how
little can justly be ascribed to the hope of
heaven, I rather suspect then declare.</p>
               <p>To return therfore to our discourse. The
<hi>Jew,</hi> the <hi>Turke,</hi> the <hi>Heathen,</hi> can pretend a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47186:70"/>
profession of his Religion; for all these stick
to such conclusions as their principles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
them: But the <hi>Christian,</hi> who cals
Christs doctrin <hi>his,</hi> and confesses that he or
his Sect has deserted those who alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the <hi>successive livery and seisin</hi> of it, can
no way presume to the possession, till he
plainly demonstrate the clearness of his
title. Wherfore, it avails not any drowsie,
rather then quiet, nature, to say his Father,
(and peradventure Grandfather) was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
before him, and therfore he is <hi>Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
bonae fidei,</hi> whilst he pretends only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
arguments: for so long he implies
the possession to be unjustly detain'd from
the advers party, who has the actual receit
by succession; especially when this so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld
a Riot is committed without sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
evidence, by the very Actors confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
A <hi>Protestant</hi> then, has no better claim
to posse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sion of Christs Doctrine, by his so
long continuance in Heresie, then the <hi>Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide</hi>
in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who, having beaten his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleaded that his Father had beat his
Grandfather, and his Grandfather his great
Grandfather: as though such a graceless
<hi>entail</hi> could prejudice the law of Nature.</p>
               <p>Though not so absurd, yet as weak is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Objection taken from the Jewish
<hi>Cabala:</hi> however, it seems worthy of thanks
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47186:70"/>
to the Suggestor. What it was, is not hard
to guess, our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself having given us
the hint of it, when he reproach'd the <hi>Jews</hi>
for following the <hi>Traditions</hi> of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
or <hi>Elders,</hi> to the ruin of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
But to decipher it better, I ought
to divide it into <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form.</hi> The form
I call the Rules: the matter, what was
deliver'd or found out by these Rules. As
for the <hi>matter,</hi> it seems in some way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd
to the proceedings of certain of
our Divines, who pretend to be <hi>mysticall;</hi>
and their imployment is, in the sublime
mysteries of our Faith, to invent or imagin
what they think congruous circumstances,
to move the affections to petty devotion:
which imaginations, as they are fram'd out
of good intentions, so have they many
weaknesses, and little or no doctrin in them.
Conformable to this we may conceive that,
after there were no more <hi>Prophets</hi> among the
<hi>Jews,</hi> (who fail'd them, not long after the
second building of their <hi>Temple)</hi> the <hi>Rabbins</hi>
began to frame explications on their Books
of holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the mysteries learn'd
from the <hi>Prophets.</hi> These interpretations,
according to the degree of their skil and
prudence, some perform'd better, some
worse. But, as the Jews were a superstitious
and ignorant Nation, not having principles
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47186:71"/>
of true knowledg naked before their Eys,
but wrapt up in Metaphors and Allegories;
all together went among them for sound
Law. Til, after our Saviours time, and the
dispersion of that generation, some foolish
knave, to give authority to this mess of
good and bad jumbled together, invented
the story how <hi>Moses</hi> had deliver'd this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
to the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> and they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
it, by <hi>traditional</hi> conveyances from
Father to Son. A story as impossible and
incredible, to one who penetrates into the
carriage of that Nation, as the Fables of
<hi>Jeoffrey of Monmouth,</hi> and King <hi>Arthur's</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
<hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if we look into the <hi>form,</hi> we shal
find it more ridiculous then any <hi>Gypses</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or the jugling of <hi>Hocus Pocus,</hi> and as
pernicious to true Doctrin, as any <hi>Pseudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy.</hi>
To make good this censure, I shal
in short describe their form: it consists in
inventing the <hi>sense</hi> of Scripture by three
abuses of the <hi>Letter,</hi> which (as far as my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
servs me, for I have not the books ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary)
are these. One by taking every letter
of a word, for a whole word beginning
with that letter: Another, by changing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
according to certain rules fram'd by
themselvs: The third, to find numbers of
years or other things, by the numbers which
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47186:71"/>
the letters of the word compound, in such
Languages where their letters are used for
cyphers. So much being deliver'd in short, I
cannot conceive any indifferent judgment so
blunt, that he sees not how far these ridling
ways of explication are from the natural
intention of a Writer; and how destructive
to all truth, if used otherwise then for
pleasure and as a disport of chance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.
Our Country man, Doctor <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaster,</hi>
invented a far more convenient
trick, by purely dividing words and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ends of the former to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the following: as we also do, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in English, to disguise common words;
and the Hebrew is far more apt for such
knacks. But he found this age too subtle, to
cozen any considerable number with such
trivial bables: Wheras the <hi>Cahala</hi> gain'd
upon the <hi>Valentinians</hi> and <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> to build
prodigious errours, in very good earnest,
upon their more ridiculous invention. I
am not ignorant some eminent persons
have been pleased somtime, to give way to
such toyes, through luxury of wit and gaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of humour: But it is one thing to play
for recreation, and a far different to estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
a <hi>Basis</hi> of Faith and doctrin, which is
abominable, on such Chimerical dreams.
And yet, this it is our Opposer would Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47186:72"/>
upon no less then <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin</hi>
and all the sacred Magistracy of the old
<hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us give a step farther and see, if it were
true, how like it were to our case. The
<hi>Tradition</hi> we speak of, is the publick prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and teaching and practice exercised
in the Church, setled by the Apostles tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the World: This <hi>Cabala,</hi> a doctrin
pretended, as deliver'd to few, with strict
charge to keep it from publicity, and so
communicate it again successively to a select
Committee of a few; wherein you may see
as fair an opportunity for jugling and coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
as, in our case there is impossibility.
The <hi>Moderns</hi> therfore, who profess <hi>Cabala,</hi>
may say they receiv'd it from their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors:
but they can yeild no account why
any Age may not have chang'd that which
was in the breasts of few shut up together in
a chamber; and so ther's no possibility
of farther assurance, then the vote of a
Council of State, for its being deriv'd any
higher.</p>
               <p>But the Arguer demands, whether they
cannot ask me, In what age or year their
doctrin was corrupted? And I answer, they
may very boldly: But, if I assign an age or
year, can they acquit themselvs in point of
proof? clearly they cannot: for, since there
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47186:72"/>
was no Register nor visible effects of this
doctrin (it being forbidden to be divulg'd)
'tis evident, <hi>that</hi> cannot convince it was not
corrupted in that year or age. He urges
farther, the notoriousness of the ly, so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
as few would venture on: not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
that he speaks of a secret, altogether
incapable of notoriousness. May not they
add, says he, the dispersion of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
through so many Countries and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages?
I yeild they may, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
unless they continue <hi>Sanhedrins</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Country: For otherwise, this dispersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will prove but the derivation from their
Council of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> or such like time,
which is nothing to the succession from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
Add to this, that the Nation since
Christs time, is infamous for falsifying do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins
and corrupting Scriptures: and, even
in our Saviours time and long before, their
<hi>Rabbins</hi> were justly branded with the foul
imputation of frequent forgery; their Sects
and heresies being grown up to that despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
height, as to deny there were any spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
or shall be any Resurrection, which is
the very top of impiety.</p>
               <p>But (what is no less to be consider'd, then
any thing yet offer'd) the very subject of
the question is different. The <hi>Church,</hi> we
speak of, is a vast and numerous body, spread
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47186:73"/>
o're the world; and he must be a mad man
that would go about to deny this <hi>Body</hi> has
remain'd perpetually visible, from Christs
time to ours: however some Heretick may
pretend the invisible part, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
<hi>Faith</hi> has been interrupted. But, for the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin,</hi>
what assurance, nay what probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is there of deriving its pedegree, from
<hi>Moses</hi> to the daies of our <hi>Saviour?</hi> In all
their oppressions during the time of the
<hi>Judges,</hi> in the division of the <hi>Tribes,</hi> in the
raign of their <hi>Kings,</hi> in the captivity, first of
the ten, then of the two other <hi>Tribes,</hi> very
little mention of any such Magistrate, much
less evidence of a perfect continuance. How
far then, are we from having any certainty
of a doctrin's succession, by them, of whom
'tis very obscure, whither any such persons
were or no?</p>
               <p>A third objection is collected, from the
natural proness in Mankind to conserve
<hi>Tradition;</hi> by which they intend to shew
Religion is corrupted: Wherin you may
note the force of wit and Logick, to draw
arguments against a truth, even out of these
very causes, which are made to conserve the
truth impugned. The arguments are three.
First, that divers Fathers, for zeal to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
doctrin, were very earnest against the
belief of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> which, new, is an
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47186:73"/>
ocular certainty. That divers Fathers did
oppose that doctrin, I willingly grant: but
that it was for zeal to Religion, and not
through the opinion of absurdity in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
I am not satisfy'd, nor does the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
bring any proof. I remember they
object, as absurd, that men should stand
feet to feet; I remember they conceit those
under us would fal into heaven; for the
rest, some places of Scripture are alledg'd;
so that, not our of zeal to Tradition, but
through misunderstanding the Scripture,
they fel into this errour. Yet I deny not
there may, perhaps, be some argument out
of Religion; as men confirm their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from all they can.</p>
               <p>The second proof, I imagin touches the
History of <hi>Virgilius;</hi> who, for a like opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is reported to have lost his Bishoprick.
But 'tis a mistake; for that holy man was
no Bishop when he was charg'd with this
errour, That he held there was another Sun
and Moon, belonging to the hemisphere op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to us, and a new world: nor is it
certain, whether truly he thought so, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted,
or was falsly accus'd; but wel
known he was afterward made Bishop, and
lived and dyed with opinion of sanctity.</p>
               <p>But though the two first proofs are slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the third wil require more strength to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47186:74"/>
resist it; and therfore 'tis especially recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to the Reader, to look on the
place: it being in a Council and our own
proper confession, and so apparently strong
and altogether insoluble; if the Author be
<hi>inexpugnabilis Dialecticus,</hi> as well as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
in his <hi>Burlesque</hi> phrase.</p>
               <p>Thus then begins this Onset, which our
Adversary manages with as much civility
as strength. I wil also desire you (says he)
to look into the 584. <hi>Page</hi> of the <hi>Florentine
Council,</hi> set out by <hi>Binius:</hi> and there you
wil find, that the <hi>Latins</hi> confess they added
to the Creed, <hi>the procession of the holy Ghost
from the Son,</hi> because the contrary opinion
seem'd to them, by consequence, opposite to a
confes'd Tradition of Christs eternal Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
which yet appears by what Cardinal <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
has excellently shown, not to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to Faith, but that this consequence
was ill drawn: which may have been in
other points too, and so have brought in
no smal number of errours; since neither
was their Logick certain to conclude better,
nor were they less apt to add to their Creeds
accordingly, at any other times, then they
were at that. Thus far the charge: And I
have been obsequious to so ingenious a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
as wil, I hope, appear by my answer,
if I first wash my hands from <hi>Cardinal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:47186:74"/>
with whom I do not engage: nor need
I, since the <hi>Council</hi> has age and can speak for
it self. As also, by the way, note that, since
the addition of <hi>Filióque,</hi> (which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the year 440, in St. <hi>Leo</hi>'s time) there
has not any tittle been added to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Creed; though very many Heresies
have been condemn'd. So that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector
is forward in his assertions, without
seconding them with solid proofs.</p>
               <p>To come now to the Combate, I doubt
much he, who was so sollicitous to have me
look into the Council, was not so careful
as to cast an eye upon it himself: Else he
would have found, the question had not
been of <hi>adding</hi> the words <hi>Filióque,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
but of the <hi>using</hi> them; the <hi>adding</hi> having
been for the controversy with <hi>Photius,</hi> the <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
for the expression of our belief; which the
Council says, consists in two points; First,
that the Divinity is the <hi>same</hi> in all the three
Persons, that is, there is not three Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in three Persons, nor yet one Divinity
from which the Persons or Personalities be
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> different, and not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
The Second, that none should have
any cause to suspect the holy Ghost to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Wherfore, the insufficiency of
the consequence, which (he says) Cardinal
<hi>Perron</hi> demonstrates, is not to our purpose;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47186:75"/>
no such inference appearing in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil:
the <hi>Latins</hi> or <hi>Roman Church</hi> only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
that, if the holy Ghost did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
out of the Father and the Son, as one
<hi>principium</hi> or cause, then the Divinity were
divided in the Father and Son, and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
in the Holy Ghost too, and so
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as the Council speaks.</p>
               <p>Whence, we may see, the Opponent mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the whole case, there being no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the cause of adding, but of what was
express'd; nor any dispute of Christs Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
but of the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi> with
the <hi>Persons</hi> and in <hi>it self;</hi> Nor any drawing
of consequences, but an expression of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
doctrin; nor any supposed errour, but
a truth confess'd both by Protestants and
us: and finally, the words are said to be
used, to express this point, that <hi>He proceeds
from the Son;</hi> and not question'd <hi>why</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is held, that He proceeds from the
Son, which is far different from what we
now contend about.</p>
               <p>There is another objection, and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Perron</hi> made the Author, as having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
out of <hi>Isidore,</hi> that the Jews com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotted
together to abolish the book of <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
because it spake too plainly of Christ.
The story the Objector himself wil not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch,
because it would rank the Book (by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47186:75"/>
him pretended to be <hi>Apocryphal)</hi> too high:
yet, though it be acknowledg'd fals, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
it strong enough against us, because it
shews such a thing might be done. Let us
poize a little the weight of this Argument: It
might have been done; therfore your Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may fail you. First I demand, how you
prove it might have been done; because <hi>Isidore</hi>
said it was done. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Conquerors,
when first they enter'd the miracles of the
Western World, reported, They climb'd up
great hils in the Sea: Therfore was it possible?
They talk't much of waters which restor'd
Youth: Therfore it is credible? But <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore's</hi>
authority convinces this. If it were
<hi>Isidore</hi> the holy Bishop of <hi>Sevil,</hi> somthing
were said: But 'tis <hi>Isidore,</hi> surnamed <hi>Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
one that collects and patches together
truths and falsities, almost indifferently; at
least our men spare not to reject him in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of great moment. Thus the bare possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<hi>that it might have been done,</hi> is not, it
self, yet, sufficiently prov'd.</p>
               <p>But let us pass that, and, without much
straining our charity, grant among Jews it
might have been done, as not a few think
the very Law was lost in the times of their
wicked Kings or other oppressions: what
inference can they make against Christian
Tradition? Of Books of Scripture, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47186:76"/>
there was a time, when some one,
or rather any one might have been lost;
because it was in few hands: shall we ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conclude the same possibility of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
when we treat of Doctrins univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
profest by so many Millions? when
we dispute of Practices every day frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the whole Church.</p>
               <p>Stil ther's one jarring string, that grates
my ears with its loud discord; though the
stroak come not from the hand of these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors,
yet I wil endeavour to put it in
tune. Some sick heads roving up and down
in their extravagant phansies wil needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
a wild conjecture, that at first our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
was indeed stil'd God, and though the
learned, who had the knack of distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
knew wel enough the inward meaning
then signify'd only a most eminent aud god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
person, yet the common People under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
their Preacher simply, as the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sounded, came by degrees universally to
believe his true and real divinity. But with
what ingenuity can such rambling wits
think the chief Principle of Christianity
should be so negligently taught? or accuse
so many holy Saints of those purest times
to be such deceitful Teachers? Besides, did
not their rashness blind them, they would
easily see the raising the Person of Christ,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47186:76"/>
from humane to divine, would necessarily
infer a notorious change in the solemn
Prayers of the Church and daily devotion of
the People, which certainly would give so
great a stroak to both, it could not possibly
be attempted, either undiscern'd or unresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
Lastly the Christian Faith being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not in a set form of words, but in sense a
thousand ways explicated &amp; enforc'd accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the variety of occasions and capacity
of the learners: how can any ambiguity of
phrase endanger them into a mistake, who
attend not so much to the dead letter, as the
quickning sense, so variously exprest, so often
incultated to them by their masters?</p>
            </div>
            <div n="15" type="encounter">
               <head>THE
FIFTEENTH ENCOUNTER, Declaring the state of this Question,
Whether the Scripture can decide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies?</head>
               <p>THere remains yet a second part of our
<hi>Apology;</hi> for, as this is the Catholicks
principle to adhere to the authority of the
Church, that is, to the living word written

so, by too much experience, she

abus'd, against the Catholick sense, in the
mouths of the Devil and his Ministers.</p>
               <p>But, before we set our feet within the
lists, I am bound to take notice of an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
no less common then slight and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd:
and this it is. When we retire to
<hi>Tradition,</hi> after both parties have lost their
breath in beating the aerial outside of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they presently cry out, Cannot <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
cannot <hi>Plato</hi> make themselves be understood?
why then should not the <hi>Bible,</hi> as wel, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
Controversies? If this were not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sixteen hundred years of experience, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so much pains of our own, since <hi>Luthers</hi>
time, idly cast away, in tossing the windy
balls of empty words, without coming to
resolution of any one point, peradventure
it were pardonable: but now, alas, what
can it be, but an obstinate desire of darkness
and a contempt of Gods Law and truth, by
a bold and irrational assertion and loud
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47186:77"/>
clamours to beat down the Catholick
Church; like <hi>Dametas</hi> in the Poem, striking
with both hands and his whole strength,
but winking all the while?</p>
               <p>Let us, therfore open our <hi>Eys</hi> and look
thorow this objection, <hi>Cannot Plato and
Aristotle make themselvs be understood?</hi> Yes;
but what then? <hi>Ergo</hi> the Scripture can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
controversies? The supposition
wherin all venom ly's is conceal'd; which
thus I display: As <hi>Aristotle</hi> wrote of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks</hi>
and <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> so the Scripture was
written of those controversies which since
are risen among Christians: But <hi>Plato</hi> and
<hi>Aristotle</hi> can make themselvs be understood
concerning those Sciences: therfore the
<hi>Scripture</hi> can do as much concerning these
Controversies. This ought to be the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
But had it been cloth'd in so thin
and transparent a dress, the Authors would
have blusht to thrust it into light: For, tis
a most shameless Proposition, to say the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> were written of the Controversies,
long after their date, sprung up in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world.</p>
               <p>Beginning from <hi>Genesis</hi> to the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi>
let them name one Book, whose theme is
any, now-controverted, Point betwixt
Protestants and Catholiks. Tis true, the
intent and extrinfical end of writing St.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47186:78"/>
                  <hi>Johns</hi> Gospel was, to shew the Godhead of
Christ, which the <hi>Arians</hi> afterward deny'd,
but that is not so directly his theme, as the
miraculous life of our Saviour, from whence
the Divinity of his Person was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd:
and yet the design so unsuccessful,
that never any Heresy was more powerful,
then that which oppos'd the truth intended
by <hi>His</hi> Book.</p>
               <p>But, I suppose, their reply wil be, they
purpose not to say the Scripture was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of our present controversies, but of the
precepts of good life and Articles of Faith
necessary to them, about which our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
arise. If this be their meaning,
their Assumption is as ridiculous, as, in the
other, their <hi>Major</hi> or chief Proposition. For,
their argument must be framed thus. As
Scripture was written of the necessaries to
good life; so <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> of Physicks
and Metaphysicks: But <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi>
writ so plainly, that all questions, rising
about their doctrin, can be declared out of
their words: therfore all questions relating
to good life, may also be clear'd out of
Scriptures. Wherin the <hi>Minor</hi> is so ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to any that have but open'd a Book of
Philosophy, that 'tis enough, not only
to disanul the proof, but discredit the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:47186:78"/>
And yet were it true, the consequence
would not hold: For whoever considers
what belongs to the explication of Authors,
knows, there is a great advantage to discern
the sense of those who proceed scientifically,
above the means to understand one that
writes loose Sentences. An <hi>Archimedes,</hi> an
<hi>Euclid,</hi> a <hi>Vitruvius</hi> wil be of far easier inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
where the Subject is of equal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
then a <hi>Theognis, Phocyllides,</hi> or <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
because the antecedents and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
do, for the most part, force a sense on
the middle propositions, of themselvs am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous.
Now, the works of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
are generally penn'd, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
so rigorously, yet stil with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the Mathematical way: The
Scripture uses a quite different method, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
its precepts without connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
one another. And though I deny not
but, peradventure, the Articles of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
have, in themselvs as much connexion,
as the severest discourses of those Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers:
yet the style, wherin they are couch'd
in the Bible, is accommodated to vulgar ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
and the delivery by way of plain
and direct affirmation, without attending
to the artificial rules of demonstration.</p>
               <p>But, because no controversy can be clear
and fit for decision, unless it be prepar'd by
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47186:79"/>
an exact and rigorous stating the Question;
I first intend to set down my own sentiment,
which I conceive is also that of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church: and afterward what I collect
to be the opinion of my Adversaries; leaving
them this free and just liberty, to correct me
if I mistake their mind.</p>
               <p>First then, we Catholiks no way doubt
but the Scripture is the word of God, and of
infallible truth, if rightly understood: and
that whoever, being out of the Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the Scripture in that quality; the
ground of such reception (if rational) can
be no other, then because we taught him so,
and deliver'd it to him, as such. For I do
not intend to dispute against those <hi>Spiritati,</hi>
who, by an Enthusiastical light, can judge of
Scripture without sense and reason: And,
to those, who pretend either Fathers or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christians out of our Church, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
my meaning is to comprehend in <hi>our</hi>
Church the Fathers; for so goes our positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and consequently all <hi>Sects</hi> either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the Scripture immediately from us, or
from those who received it from us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we doubt not but the Scripture
is highly profitable, for the enablement of
Preachers to teach, reprove, confirm, in all
points of Catholik doctrin, both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Speculation and Practice: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47186:79"/>
that the Church were not so tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
furnisht for all kind of exigenccis
without it; for which reason it is of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
usefulness, and indeed necessity to the
Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we confesse the Bible contains
all parts of Catholik Doctrine, in this sense,
that all Catholik doctrin may be found
there, by places and arguments be deducted
thence, nay more, be topically or Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially
proved out of it: so that, if an <hi>able</hi>
Preacher be in a Pulpit, where he speaks
without contradiction, with a full and free
scope; he may, meerly discoursing out of
Scripture, carry any point of Catholik
doctrin before the generality of his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and convince at the present such a
part of them, as either are but indifferently
speculative, or have not taken pains in the
question.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I affirm, that if any point be
brought to an <hi>eristicall</hi> decision before Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
where the parties on both sides are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
bent to defend their own positions,
by all the art they can imagin: so the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be not, which part is true, but only which
is more or less conformable to Scripture;
the Catholik position may be victoriously
evidenced, by arguments purely drawn from
thence, compared and valued according to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47186:80"/>
true <hi>Criticism;</hi> without ayd of Fathers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
or any other extrinsecal helps.
Thus far I esteem all good Catholiks ought
to hold; and believe that all, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
doe, <hi>de facto,</hi> hold.</p>
               <p>Now then, to come to the true difference
betwixt our Adversaries and us: I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it consists in this, That having stated
a material point, (as whether that which we
see and touch in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> be truly
Christs body, or only a figure of it, it self
remaining substantially Bread) and that
this question be to be handled contentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before Judges, each party pretending to
convince and demonstrate, by quotation of
places critically exalted to their highest
force: whether the Scripture (I say) be a
sufficient Storehouse to furnish either side
with Texts, unavoidable and convincing
beyond any shadow of reply; in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sworn and expert judges, who are
wel practis'd what <hi>convincing</hi> signifies, and
how much the various acceptions of words
and mutability of meanings import in the
construction of sentences. This is that
wherin I engage the Catholik Negative; and
suppose all Adversaries must hold the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative.</p>
               <p>And the first reason of my supposition is,
because I never see them attempt any other
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47186:80"/>
way of disputing, but out of Scripture:
nor yet, in that, do they use so fair play, as
to put the places which favour them on the
page of receipts, and those which Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks
bring to the contrary upon that of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences;
and then having by rules of good
Criticism examined the qualities of both,
prefer that party which is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving.</p>
               <p>Next, I know not how that man dare
shew his face before any person of common
sense, who shal first acknowledg he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the opinion of the whole present Age
wherin he lives, against the undoubted testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of a thousand years before him, against
the known laws both spiritual and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
publikely renouncing all obedience to
all kinds of Magistrate, empower'd by God
and Man with just authority to conserve
those laws; that shal accuse all his kindred,
Ancestors, and whole Country of blindness
and ignorance, and pretend all the world is
bound to desert them and follow him: and
this in a matter, concerning no less an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
then Eternity: and after all this so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant
bawling and high demands, being
ask'd what evidence, what proof he can
bring to introduce so great a mutation in
the world, shal be forc'd to confess, he can
but play at cross and pile with them, to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47186:81"/>
know which of the two sentences is true,
which fals. For, setting aside real and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable
conviction, what is there left in
speculation, but meer contingency?</p>
               <p>Now this strange boldness, this incredible
presumption was undeniably <hi>Luthers</hi> case:
and if his, then certainly all his followers:
For, neither is the weight and authority of
so many ages become less pressing and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
against his adherents, nor their first
plea improved or amended, but rather
weaken'd: if by his and all his fellows la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
as yet no evidence is produced (an
infallible sign none is likely ever to be
made:) Nor is the change of temporal laws
and Princes any motive, to him that goes
upon pure reason, and seriously ayms at the
good of his soul.</p>
               <p>Again, he whose discours is not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
and yet wil be medling with truths of
highest importance, is either ignorant of
that defect, and then he deserves the name
of a rash temerarious fellow that dares, in a
matter of such consequence advance Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
(by passion or precipitation) whose
quality himself understands not: or else he
knows he does not convince; then let him
at the beginning of his Sermon express so
much, and tel his Auditors, he is come to
speak to them concerning their salvation,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47186:81"/>
and propose new Tenets about it; but, in
very deed, he can neither prove the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
are false, nor those which he shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to be true: Can any one think, if the
Auditory have either wit enough to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so grosse an Impostor, or never so little
honesty to care what becoms of their souls,
or love to Christianity; they wil not with
great indignation pull his <hi>jump</hi> o're his
eares, and tumble him out of his Pulpit?
Now what difference is there (so the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
be done) whether it be foretold the
people or no; saving that, to conceal the
wrong, is a more wicked and destructive
piece of cunning?</p>
               <p>Another consideration is, that <hi>in practical
things,</hi> more probability approaches to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and, by multiplication, contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
at last begets perfect Necessity; but, in
<hi>speculation,</hi> not so. For, as there is more
probability to throw seven upon two dice,
in forty trials then in foure: so, in five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
most certainly that cannot fail to be
the cast: the reason is, because the number
of casting so exceeds the variety of <hi>chances,</hi>
that it makes first a difficulty, and after
an impossibility of missing. Now, in <hi>specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
if no particular cause precisely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and determine the effect, variety can
prevail nothing; so that, rigorously spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47186:82"/>
a conclusion is no neerer being true,
for a hundred unconvincing Arguments,
then for one: whence it follows, where
there is no demonstration, neither Opinion
is securely the better. He therfore that
pretends the introduction of a change in a
speculative point, ought either to promise
evidence and conviction, or else content
himself with silence: for 'tis absurd to move
any one to change his <hi>assent</hi> (I speak not
here of a <hi>practicall resolution)</hi> without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
him some abetterment.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as far as I can penetrate, he that
has a changeable and uncertain Religion,
has none at all. For, I conceive a Religion
(as we now discourse of it) is the knowledge
by which we are to guide our selves in our
way and progress towards eternal felicity:
so that, if the Religion any one professes be
not the true, he cannot by its principles
perform what is requisite to the gaining of
that end: Neither is any knowledge which
such a <hi>Probablist</hi> has, the right and proper
means of cultivating his soul in order to
future happiness; and therfore it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble
an untrue Religion should lead to
Heaven, as a fals way, to London. Now, if
a Religion that is not true, be no Religion,
he that doubts whether he has the true, is in
doubt whether he has any Religion or none;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47186:82"/>
and he that pretends no farther then to
doubt about Religion, pretends not to
know he has any: but, the act of <hi>knowing</hi>
cannot be had, if he that has it, does not
know he has it; therfore he that pretends
not to know he has a Religion, confesses
himself to have none.</p>
               <p>The same is clear in practice. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
an Apothecary had compos'd a drug
for his Patient; but being incertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to administer it like a potion or a
glister, should sometimes give it one way,
sometimes the other: or a Guide, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to conduct a Stranger thorow some
untroden Wildernes, &amp; for want of assurance
which way to take, should lead him up and
down as in a Maze, first to the left hand,
then to the right: were not these excellent
Masters in their crafts, and worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
imployment; but with this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they practised their Arts upon
none but one another? Then, if Religion
be the knowledge of conducting our souls
to heaven; is not he like to make good
speed, that acknowledges himself incertain
of the way? who to day marches forwards,
and to morrow goes as much backward;
to day <hi>confesses</hi> and <hi>adores</hi> Christ in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi>
to morrow blasphemes him, and
damns all that adore him; to day <hi>prays to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47186:83"/>
Saints,</hi> bears respect to a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
to the <hi>dead,</hi> to morrow cries out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all, as Idolatry, Superstition, and meer
inventions of lucre?</p>
               <p>Still there remains with me one other
scruple about this point. Divers great
Brains have undertaken the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of things, which mankind, is so far
from delighting in, that very few can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
them; (this aversion rising out of a
judgement, not taken up by humour, but
taught by nature, which justly abhors all
that diminishes or destroys its being), as
<hi>Blindness, Folly, Sickness,</hi> and the like: and
contrived many perswasive forms and
witty inducements, to invegle their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
into an evident absurdity. Others we
find, who, by whole Sects, maintain'd that
all propositions were indifferent; and their
practice was, of every subject to speak co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously
and plausibly on both sides: and
this in good earnest, out of a setled belief
that they could make which side they pleasd
the more probable. I ask then, whether
the probability either of these two sorts of
wits bring for their paradoxes, be sufficient
to chuse a point in Religion? If you say, I;
What imports it in any point which part
you take, that is, whether you have any
Religion or none? If you say, no; what
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47186:83"/>
means do you prescribe us to know when a
probability is great enough; or, who's he
that is able to judge the degrees of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
when they are sufficient, and when not?</p>
               <p>Peradventure you may say, In the first
case, the evidence of nature shews their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
to be clearly absurd: and I could
answer, why may not Nature sometimes be
deceiv'd, as <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> would perswade
us, when he maintain'd Snow was black?
but I need not; 'Tis enough to remember,
The questions of Religion are concerning
actions whose effects appear not to us; and
yet, ordinarily the effects are the chief
means to frame arguments, and produce
certainty, in practice, that the cause is right.
'Tis enough to remember eternall blisse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the next world; and the Mysterys
we dispute, are such as the Son of God only
has seen and brought us tydings of. But,
what wil you say to the second sort of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters,
who equall all probabilities; and are
men, against whose eloquence, erudition, and
prudence in other things, you cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept?
To all this I can yet add one plain but
very confiderable reflexion; that certainly,
to prove any position, those wild capricious
Brains cannot find weaker <hi>places</hi> for their
arguments, then a mute, ambiguous, dead
writing, not quickned with reason and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47186:84"/>
which yet, is the boasted ground of
all that renounce the infallibility of the
Church, in matters of supernaturall belief.</p>

               <head>THE
SIXTEENTH ENCOUNTER. Examining five Texts brought for the
sufficiency of Scripture.</head>
               <p>THe case thus stated, we have won the
field: If I have err'd in framing the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
let them correct it, with these two
conditions, that they propose it so, as to
leave themselves a <hi>Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gion,</hi> and <hi>different</hi>
from ours: for unless both these subsist, the
quarrel betwixt us is at an end. But if I have
rightly exprest the point in controversie,
let them bring one place of Scripture that
comes home to the question, and carry the
Bays. Their position must include these
two branches: That Scripture is intended
for a ground to decide Controversies in
such a contentious way as I have set down:
and sufficient to perform this charge. For
the former I dare confidently affirm, there
is not in the whole Bible an expression so
much as glances towards it. And though
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47186:84"/>
the second includes the first, and can have
no verity nor subsistence without it; yet
since there are some who discovering not
the first, can perswade themselves they finde
the second, we wil try how solidly they
proceed.</p>
               <p>First then, they cite certain Texts in
which they say, <hi>the Scripture gives us salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
But there is a wide difference betwixt
giving salvation, and being the whol means
or adequat cause of it, which is the point
to be maintain'd, if they wil prove the
Scripture sufficient; else all Faith, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
good works, preaching, &amp;c. must be
absolutely excluded as unnecessary, since
of every one of them may be said, it gives
salvation. Whence in common already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
these arguments are so weak and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
they carry not half way home to
our question: Yet let's see at least how far
they reach.</p>
               <p>In the fifth of St. <hi>John,</hi> Christ bids the
Jews <hi>search the Scriptures, because you think</hi>
(saith he) <hi>you have eternal life in them.</hi> Our
Saviour was discoursing there of such as
bore witness to him: and having nam'd
his Father and St. <hi>John,</hi> at last he descends
to the Scripture and tells them to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<q>You think to have life in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
though you deceive your selvs in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47186:85"/>
that opinion; for you have only the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
letter, and not the verifying spirit:
Nevertheless search them, for they bear
witness that I am the true life, to whom
you will not through want of charity
and love of God have recours to seek it.
Therfore you refuse me, who come in the
name of my Father, a sign of Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I seek not mine own interest: But
you will receive Antichrist or some
other who shall come in his own name,
which is a mark of deceit and falshood,
so pervers are you.</q> This is our Saviours
discours: of all which to this argument
belong only these words, <q>
                     <hi>You think you have
life in the Scriptures;</hi>
                  </q> that is, (if I understand
the Text) you deceive your selvs, if you
think you have life in them; which surely
must needs be a very strong reason to prove,
Scriptures give salvation: though if the
question were not of the Text, I should
make no difficulty of the conclusion.</p>
               <p>And it may be noted that our Saviour
descends to the proof of Scripture, in the
last place: putting <hi>Miracles</hi> the first, as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
able to convert <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha:</hi>
in the second <hi>Preaching,</hi> specially they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some good affection to their Preacher
St. <hi>John:</hi> Lastly, the mute words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And as for St. <hi>John,</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47186:85"/>
says he cites him, in condescendence
to them, that they might be the rather mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to embrace the truth, by that esteem they
had already entertain'd of their Preacher.
Wheras for Scripture there was only their
own conceit, which our <hi>Saviour</hi> seems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
as an humoursom and froward obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
that they would not be convinc'd by
the palpable demonstration of his <hi>Miracles</hi>
(the easiest and surest way) nor rest upon
the preaching of his <hi>Precursor,</hi> whom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
confess to be a Prophet; nor lastly make
a diligent search without prejudice, into
<hi>Scripture,</hi> which, if interpreted with charity
and humility, might have led them to him
and salvation.</p>
               <p>The next place is <hi>John 20. These things
are written that you may belive that Jesus is the
Son of God, and believing may have life in his
name.</hi> Tis true both Scripture and Faith
give life; but not the least mention made
here of any such quality in either of them.
This only is declar'd that the end of St.
<hi>Johns</hi> writing the Gospel was not to make
a compleat History either of our <hi>Saviours</hi>
Acts or doctrin; but only to specify such
particulars as prove that Christ was the
true consubstantial Son of God: to keep
them out of the Heresy then beginning to
rise, that they might continue true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47186:86"/>
in the Church of God, live according
to its Rules and be saved by so living, that
is, by being true <hi>Christians</hi> or <hi>Jesuits;</hi> which
is certainly the sense of these words, <hi>in his
name,</hi> or, <hi>in the name of Jesus,</hi> as to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
in the name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> signify's to be
enroll'd among the company known to be
<hi>his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from this Text we may clearly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
that St. <hi>Johns</hi> Gospel was not written
by the Authors intention for any such end
as the argument urges: Nor, that it gives
life, more then this one Article does, that
<hi>Jesus is the true son of God;</hi> Nor yet that this
Article gives life, but that life is to be had in
the name of Christ, whatever these words
signify: Only it may be infer'd that life can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be had without this Article; but not
that this alone is able to give life, or that it
cannot be believ'd without St. <hi>Johns Gospel,</hi>
or that St. <hi>Johns Gospel</hi> of it self is sufficient
to give life without the concurrence of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
So that there is no appearance from
this proposition that life either can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by Scripture <hi>alone,</hi> or cannot be had
<hi>without</hi> it.</p>
               <p>The third Text is out of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> chap. 3.
That the <hi>Scriptures are able to make him wise
to salvation through the faith of Jesus Christ.</hi>
The paraphrase of the place, as I understand
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47186:86"/>
it, is, <hi>O Timothy!</hi> be constant in the doctrin
I have taught thee; and this for two reasons;
One common to all converted by me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou knowest who I am that deliver'd
it to thee; This is the first and principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>the authority of the Teacher:</hi> Another
peculiar to thee, because from thy infancy,
thou art vers'd in the holy Scriptures,
which are proper to make thee wise and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
in the law of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> or to
promote and improve thy salvation, which
is obtained by the faith of <hi>Jesus.</hi> So that,
he speaks not of <hi>Timothy's</hi> becomming a
Christian, but his becomming a through
furnisht (or extraordinary) Christian, a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
and Preacher.</p>
               <p>And the ground on which I build this
explication is derived from the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
where the Apostle expresses this
vertue of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> being <hi>profitable to
teach and reprove;</hi> as also from this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that the sequel, <hi>Be constant to my words
or Doctrin, because the Scripture can teach thee
the truth of Christs doctrin,</hi> is not very exact,
but rather opposite to the former, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inducing the contrary; as if one should
argue, Follow not my doctrin, because
mine, but because the Scripture teaches thee
it: which directly contradicts the intention
of the Apostle, as appears in the vers imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly

precedent, <hi>Be stedfast in those things
thou hast learnt, knowing by whom thou wert in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed;</hi>
wheras this other discourse is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
consequential, Stand to my doctrin
because the Scripture confirms and seconds
it, making thee able to defend and prove
by arguments, what I have simply taught
thee to be true, by the sole evidence of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
which beget Faith, not Science.</p>
               <p>But to grant our Adversary the less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
sense and consequence, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was to contribute to the salvation of
<hi>Timothy</hi> himself; still ther's an equivocation
in those words, <hi>through, or by the faith of Iesus
Christ:</hi> which may be refer'd to those, <hi>(to
make thee understanding)</hi> Either so, that the
sense be, <hi>The Scriptures (in which thou hast
been vers'd since thy infancy) will contribute to
thy salvation, so that thou understand them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Faith of Iesus Christ which I have
orally deliver'd to thee;</hi> and this is, in direct
terms, the Catholick Rule, that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of Scripture is to be govern'd by
Tradition or by the faith and doctrin so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
and formally depends from the first
words, <hi>Remain constant to my doctrin:</hi> Or,
by another explication, which is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
and flat and most incredible, That
the old Scripture (for of that only the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
speaks, no other being written while
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47186:87"/>
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> was a child) should be able, without
relation to the knowledg of Christ by other
means to make a man understanding enough
to be saved by the Faith of Him; as may be
seen by Sr. <hi>Peters</hi> being sent to <hi>Cornelius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, of these three senses, the first is
nothing to our adversaries purpose, and
nevertheless is the best; The second posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
and highly against him: the third
incoherent to the words precedent and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
and in it self, an incredible propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
But give it the greatest force the
words can, by any art, be heightned to,
they come nothing neer the state of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
proposed which concerns the decision
of all quarrels carried on by litigious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
Whereas this Text is content with any
sufficiency at large to bring men to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
a point not precisely now controverted
betwixt us. Besides <hi>Timothy</hi> being already a
Christian, 'tis a pure folly to think the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
sent him to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to chuse his
Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The words immediatly following the
place explicated are urged for a new Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
They are these:</hi> All Scripture is inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from God; and profitable to teach, to reprove,
to correct, to instruct in justice, <hi>(that is, good
life)</hi> that the man of God become perfect, being
furnisht to every good work. <hi>The paraphrase,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47186:88"/>
according to my skil is thus,</hi> The holy Writ I
spake of, is any Book inspir'd from God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to teach things unknown, reprehend what
is amiss, to set straight what is crooked, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
in good life; that the Church of God, or any
member therof, may become perfect, being, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
and reprehensions applyed out of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
by such preachers as <hi>Timothy,</hi> fitted to
any good work or all kinds of good works. <hi>This
I conceive the natural meaning and most
conformable to the Text, were we to seek
the interpretation of it indifferently, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any eye to our present controversy.
And in this sense, 'tis a cleer case, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
speaks of the benefit of Scripture,
when explicated and apply'd by a Preacher,
in order to the perfecting of those that hear
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if, by importunity the adversary will
needs have it, that the Scripture should give
the quality of being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the person
himself that reads it; to content him, I shall
not hinder him of his mind, but only
prove it nothing to his purpose: For still
this must be the sense, that it produces in the
reader the excellencies requir'd in a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
namely to make him do all those good
works which are expected of him; as tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
reprehending, &amp;c. so that one way
or other, still the Scripture is apply'd to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47186:88"/>
him with Precepts, Arguments, Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and such like instruments of perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
but of giving the first Catechism, or
binding ones self Apprentice to the <hi>Bible,</hi> to
learn the first rudiments of Christian profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
ther's not the least word or syllable
that colours for such a conceit: nor can it
indeed consist with the direct meaning of the
place; since the being already a Christian,
is plainly suppos'd in <hi>Timothy,</hi> by St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
institutions <hi>viva voce,</hi> before any exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to this use of Scripture. So that, here
is no question concerning the first choyce of
Faith, but of perfection after Faith: much
less any mention of convincing in <hi>foro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentioso,</hi>
about which is all our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.</p>
               <p>Another place is <hi>Acts</hi> 26. where St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
defending himself before <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Festus,</hi>
against the <hi>Jews</hi> accusation, who calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him that he spake in derogation of the
Law, and brought in a new doctrin to the
disturbance of the people; made only this
answer, that he preach'd nothing but what
the Prophets had foretold. His words are
these: <hi>The Iews for this</hi> (teaching Christs
doctrin) <hi>finding me in the Temple, would have
kill'd me: But I having obtain'd succonr from
God until this very day have persisted testifying</hi>
(or protesting) <hi>to great and little, that I spoke
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47186:89"/>
nothing but what the Prophets and Moses had
foretold should come to pass; as, that Christ was
to suffer, that he was to be the first should rise
from death to life, and preach light both to Iews
and Gentils.</hi> This is the true interpretation
of the Greek Text, as far as ly's in my power
to explicate it, according to the intention
of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> I deny not but the words sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken may be interpreted, <hi>I have persisted
testifying to great and little, and in my Sermons
saying nothing but what</hi> &amp;c. But this expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is neither so proper to his defence,
nor at all advances the Adversaries cause:
For since St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us directly what the
points are of which he spake; whatever can
be gathered out of them, only this is said,
that these three points were foretold by
<hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets: and on the other
side, the discours is imperfect, running thus,
<hi>I preach'd indeed many other things, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what was in Moses and the Prophets,
to wit, that Christ was to suffer,</hi> &amp;c. His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
therfore is, that since he was in hold,
his perpetual endeavours had been, to shew
that these things he was accused to have
preach'd against the law, were the very mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of the <hi>Law</hi> and foretold by <hi>Moses</hi> and
the Prophets: and that, wheras the <hi>Jews</hi>
expected Christ to be a temporal King, who
by force of Arms should restore the house
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47186:89"/>
of <hi>Israel,</hi> to a great and flourishing estate,
the truth was quite contrary; for, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the doctrin of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
He was to be a passible man, to suffer
death, afterwards to rise again triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as the first fruits of the Resurrection,
and to send his Disciples both to Jews and
Gentiles to spread the light of the Gospel
throughout the world.</p>
               <p>What advantage against the necessity of
<hi>Tradition,</hi> can be drawn out of this place of
Scripture, which doth not so much as talk
of the extent of Catholick doctrin, much
less come within kenning of our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy,
is beyond my reach: This I know, that,
to say all points of Catholick doctrin can
be sufficiently prov'd out of <hi>Moses</hi> and the
Prophets, is an assertion I believe our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
themselvs will deny; as being
both ridiculous in it self and absolutely
discrediting the necessity of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and yet clearly, without maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
so gross absurdities, they can make no
advantage of this Text.</p>

               <head>THE
SEVENTEENTH ENCOUNTER. Examining such places as are brought
against the admittance of any, but
Scriptural proof in Religion.</head>
               <p>WE are at last come to those places in
which they most glory, conceiting
themselvs able by them utterly to destroy
all <hi>Traditions:</hi> These are such as forbid to
add or detract from the holy <hi>Scriptures:</hi>
which, though commonly so explicated by
Protestants, yet certainly cannot but appear
to every child altogether impertinent to
our controversy. For, tis a far different
question, Whether we were bound to put no
new or <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books into the <hi>Canon</hi>
(which our adversaries charge us to have
done) or to take none out (which we charge
them to do?) from that now in debate,
Whether there be any other means of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
matters of Faith, beside the Bible? or
rather, Whether Scripture in an eristical and
contentious way, be a Rule sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
all controversies in Religion? Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
let us see the Texts they alledge for
their opinion: <hi>Deut. 4. 2. Iosh.</hi> 1. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:47186:90"/>
to the same effect.</p>
               <p>My first answer is; suppose these places
imported all the force our adversaries pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
we are not in the least degree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd:
since all that's said is clearly spoken
of a certain Book or Law, properly and
specially belonging to the Jews: and no
more obliging Christians then the Book of
<hi>Leviticus</hi> or the Law of Circumcision.</p>
               <p>Secondly: since it is held as a main di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
and opposition betwixt the Laws
of the <hi>Jew</hi> and of the <hi>Christian,</hi> that those
of the <hi>Iew</hi> were to be written in <hi>Stone</hi> and
<hi>Paper,</hi> and those of the <hi>Christian</hi> in the <hi>hearts
of men by Tradition:</hi> it would rather follow
(if such Analogy were to be made) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
nothing but Scripture is to be given
to the Jew, only <hi>Tradition</hi> is to be pressed
on the Christian.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to the end this place may have
the effect endeavoured by the arguer, all
the rest of the Bible, except <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> or
such other Book, to which the Texts cited
particularly relate, may be burnt, or at
least cast out of the <hi>Canon;</hi> and not have any
power to decide controversies, even in the
Jews law. I know 'tis answer'd, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
deny not such Books: Neither do
we accuse them of it; only we conceive we
may safely say, they contradict themselvs,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47186:91"/>
in pressing these places to that effect of
one side, and admitting the Books on the
other.</p>
               <p>My fourth Answer is, that the <hi>Law</hi> it self
enjoyns in certain cases, other precepts to
be added; remitting the people upon any
doubt, first to <hi>Iudges,</hi> and afterwards to the
<hi>High Priest,</hi> and commanding their decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
to be obey'd, and under greatest pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
punctually observ'd: So that, the
consequence drawn out of these places, is
both weak in it self and prejudicial to them
that use it.</p>
               <p>Nor is the inference our adversaries wrest
out of the last Chapter of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> less
unreasonable then the former: where, he
that adds or detracts any thing from that
Prophecy is accursed: whence pleasant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursers
will needs conclude; that Christian
doctrin is no otherwise to be proved but
by Scripture. Questionless, to speak more
pertinently to the Text, they should have
said, it was to be prov'd out of nothing but
the <hi>Apocalyps:</hi> but because that would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
too palpable and absurd, they inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the rest of the Scripture violently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the express letter and meaning of the
Text. This Argument seems to me, as if
the fam'd Astrologer Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> had obtain'd
a Protection from the State, that none
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47186:91"/>
should presume to abuse his <hi>Prognostications,</hi>
by foysting in counterfeit ones, or blotting
out any part of his; and thence, one should
boldly infer that all our Courts of Justice
were commanded to judg such cases as came
before them, only out of <hi>Lilly's Almanack:</hi>
with this sole difference, that the arguer
here unjustly cogs in the whole Scripture,
instead of the single Book of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi>
which makes his consequence far weaker
and more unexcusable then the other; as I
confess the similitude I use agreeable ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the impertinency of the objection,
then to the dignity of the subject.</p>
               <p>To these two may be parallel'd that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> so strongly urg'd by some.
The words, as I understand them, are these.
<hi>Seeing many have endeav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ured to compile ae
history of the things in great abundance acted
among us; according as they who were from the
beginning eye-witnesses and instruments of the
Gospel, have delivered to us: I also have
thought fit (excellent</hi> Theophilus) <hi>since I was
present at all, things almost from the beginning,
to set them down to thee in order, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
know the certainty of the Reports which thou
hast been taught.</hi> This is the Text, though
others interpret it otherwise; who (if they
will urge any thing out of their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication)
must first justify it against this.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47186:92"/>
But out of this, First St. <hi>Luke</hi> pretends no
more then to tell <hi>our Saviours life,</hi> like a
good Historian; however some of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
sayings cannot be deny'd their place in
his life, as is testifyed by the same St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
in the first of the <hi>Acts:</hi> and therfore we ought
not expect to know more from him, then
was fit for an Historian to report; that is,
the eminent deeds and sayings of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
Now, the end express'd in the Text
for the writing of this History may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
two ways: One, that <hi>Theophilus</hi>
might know which reports were true, which
fals: The other, that <hi>Theophilus</hi> out of the
recital of Christs miracles and heroical acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
might understand the greatness of his
person, and by consequence the certainty of
his holy doctrin, which depends from them;
But whether one or the other, however
there is not a word that this Book should
serve for a Catechism, to teach him and all
the world the entire body of Christian
doctrin, which must be our Adversaries
meaning.</p>
               <p>There are yet two passages I must not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
because our Adversaries make great
account of them: one is the fourth Chapter
of the first to the <hi>Corinthians, That you may
learn in us, not to be wise beyond what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi>
To understand this place, you must
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47186:92"/>
know there grew some emulations betwixt
the disciples of the Apostles, (if I may
guess) betwixt those of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
This St. <hi>Paul</hi> reprehends at large: but for
fear of making the breach wider, instead of
closing it, would not name St. <hi>Peter,</hi> chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
rather to put the case, as if it had pass'd
betwixt himself and <hi>Apollo:</hi> and first uses
this argument, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> are but
Ministers of Christ: therupon after some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
he comes to tel them, how all that
any man has, is from God and for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and concludes, to have all esteem'd as
the Ministers of Christ and dispensators of
his Mysteries: And after he has express'd
how little he concerns himself, whether he
be wel or ill reputed by them, concludes,
telling them he had taken those two names
of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> to teach them this point;
and then brings in the words alleadg'd,
which I may venture to paraphrase thus. <hi>I
have disguis'd my discours concerning the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
you ought to have of your Preachers, under
the names of</hi> Apollo <hi>and my self; that, by what
I teach you to be due to our persons, you may
learn not to be affected to your Preachers, above
what I have written to you about a dozen lines
before: to wit, that they are all ordain'd for you
Ministers of Christ and dispensers of his Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
to the end one of you do not swell with pride
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47186:93"/>
or choller against another in any mans behalf,
and so breed Schisms and contentions among your
selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the meaning of the Apostle; as
will appear to any judicious understanding,
that can be content to read and diligently
weigh the whole composition of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.
And here we are unwillingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to observe the desperate shifts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our adversaries, into which either the
rashness of their passions or necessity of their
caus engages them: for so, in the Text we
now treat, they presently snapt at a piece of
a sentence, where they found this charming
word <hi>(written;)</hi> and that was enough for
them, without ever troubling their heads to
consider or sense or connexion in order to
the framing a legitimate argument. For,
had they but taken the immediatly prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
line, <hi>These I have disguized into</hi> Apollo
<hi>and my self for you,</hi> and then brought in the
words cited, <hi>That you may learn in us, not to
be wise above what is written;</hi> the nonsense
would have declar'd it self, and stumbled the
Reader, who could not but presently have
check'd at the inconsequence. And the
verse following would be likewise incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
to these, <hi>that you be not sweld one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
another for any man:</hi> For, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
can either the words precedent, or
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47186:93"/>
subsequent have, with this, that, You are
to learn your Faith out of the Scripture?
and yet I have translated the Latin <hi>Sapere</hi> or
Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, against the true sense, for the
objectours advantage; wheras the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is not to esteem them higher, or bear
themselvs, as if their Masters were higher:
and thus the very English Translation
yeilds it.</p>
               <p>The latter place is out of the first to the
<hi>Galathians,</hi> where he warns them, that
<hi>whoever comes to preach any doctrin, besides that
which He had taught them, they should refuse
him communion, or account him execrable.</hi> This
passage I have always esteem'd very strong
and pregnant for <hi>Tradition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
call it a most illustrious proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. I confess at first I was at a loss to
imagine how they could frame an argument
out of so unfavourable a Text: but at last,
I perceiv'd it might perhaps be thus, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
(said they) preach'd nothing but what was
<hi>written,</hi> as he testify's to <hi>Agrippa;</hi> so then,
all he preach'd was <hi>Scripture:</hi> But he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
them to receive no other doctrin,
but what he deliver'd them: Therfore, he
enjoynd them to make Scripture the Rule of
their Faith. This is (as far as I can find)
the full epitome of their discourse upon this
Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:47186:94"/>
But, considering that what is in Scripture
may be deliver'd by preaching, without any
mention of Scripture; me thinks though
all St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught the <hi>Galathians</hi> had been
<hi>written,</hi> yet it follows not He commanded
the <hi>Galathians</hi> to hold the doctrin from
Scripture; For those two words, <hi>what we
Evangeliz'd to you,</hi> and <hi>what you have receiv'd,</hi>
signify so plainly <hi>preaching,</hi> that I can col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
nothing from this place, but that they
were to hold their Faith <hi>because He had
preach'd it;</hi> then which 'tis impossible to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
a more efficacious argument to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
<hi>Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, to this effect, he exaggerates his
own quality; that he was one who had not
receiv'd his doctrin <hi>from man</hi> nor by the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termise
of man,</hi> but immediatly by revelation
from Christ: and afterwards, (upbraiding
the <hi>Galathians</hi> for their inconstancy) asks
them, whether they had receiv'd their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
by the works of the Law, or <hi>ex audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu
fidei,</hi> by hearing of the <hi>Gospel?</hi> So that,
in effect, his command is to the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
to stand to his preaching, that is, to <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for their Faith: and this not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all men but even Angels, should they
come down from Heaven to preach any
thing contrary. For, that the word <hi>praeter</hi>
may signify <hi>contrary,</hi> is too well known to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47186:94"/>
be insisted on; But, that it signify's so here,
the particular occasion of this discourse
makes evident; St. <hi>Paul</hi> expressing that
<hi>some intruded themselves seeking to overturn the
Gospel of Christ:</hi> and charging upon them
that, wheras they had <hi>begun in spirit, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in flesh,</hi> and the like: Wherfore it is
plain, he spake of doctrin contrary to what
he had preach'd. But if <hi>praeter</hi> be taken for
<hi>besides,</hi> it will signify <hi>besides Tradition,</hi> not
<hi>besides Scripture:</hi> there being not the least
mention of Scripture: Now, how soundly
it is proved that St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught nothing
but what was <hi>written,</hi> is before examin'd;
which yet if admitted true, were nothing to
the purpose. For, 'tis not the Catholik po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that all its doctrins are not contain'd
in Scripture: but not held from thence nor
to be convinced out of the naked letter, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in a pertinacious dispute: A questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
certainly not so much as dream'd of in
this place of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to close this whole discourse, I
shall only add one short period: as a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
reflection upon the different fitness

EIGHTEENTH ENCOUNTER, Declaring the reasons of the Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding,
without proceeding to the
examination of the Fathers Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</head>
               <p>I Have omitted the petty quiblets of Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism
which our Adversaries use to press
in divers of the places I explicated: not
only because they are often fals, most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
strain'd, and always such pigmy bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rushes,
that they merit no admission into a
grave discours: but chiefly, because, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
largely the Antecedents and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
to the Texts alledged, I found the
substance of them wholly mistaken and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to our purpose: and that such argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are the abortive issue of immature
brains, not able to distinguish the force of
Canon shot, from a <hi>Faery's</hi> squib or a boys
pot-gun.</p>
               <p>And I dare (had I good conditions) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that, in all the differences betwixt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
and us Catholicks, they cannot
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47186:99"/>
produce one place of Scripture, in which
the words can bear a sense that comes home
to the state of the question. I know many
urge those of the Decalogue against Images:
To which I answer, with words analogical
to those of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Who (speaking to the
<hi>Galathians)</hi> protested that whoever circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
himself, as a thing necessary or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the old Commandment, was bound
to keep the whole Judaical law: So say I,
whoever condemns Images, upon this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of <hi>Moses,</hi> is bound to keep all the
law of the Jews: For, if these words be a
law to us, because they are written in theirs,
all that's written in their law must be so to
us; since he that made one, made all; and,
for whom he made one and deliver'd it to
them, for them he made and deliver'd all
the rest, as one entire body of law to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by them. He therfore that counts
himself bound by this Law, must (if he have
common sense) esteem himself equally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to all the rest.</p>
               <p>Upon the same reason hangs the <hi>keeping
of the Sabhath day;</hi> for, of all the <hi>Decalogue,</hi>
these are the only two points unrepeated in
the <hi>new Testament:</hi> so that, all the rest we
are bound to accept in vertue of that, but
these two we cannot. Wherfore, whoever
holds, <hi>The Sabbath day is commanded by God,</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:47186:99"/>
either does so because he finds it in the <hi>old
Law:</hi> and to him I protest he ought (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to this judgment) submit to all
that law and become a <hi>Jew:</hi> or els, because
he finds it in observation among Christians,
that is, in <hi>Tradition:</hi> and to him I protest,
he is bound to embrace all that comes
down by <hi>Tradition,</hi> namely, the whole Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick Faith: Therfore, every ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
observer of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> is bound in
common sense, either to be a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make an end, I know our adversaries
alledg many sentences of <hi>Fathers</hi> to prove
the sufficiency of Scripture: wherof the
most part I am sure are as far beside the state
of the question, as those places of Scripture
we come now from examining. However,
I finde my self, not concern'd to look into
them: pretending no farther at this present,
then to consider the ground upon which
those I oppose rely, for their assurance, that
Scripture is sufficient to decide controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
according to the state of the question, as
it is proposed. Now, because they reject
wholly the Authority of <hi>Fathers,</hi> from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitlve
sentence in matter of Faith: it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for them, (if they are not quite <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams)</hi>
to rely on their Authority for accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of Scripture; for what can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47186:100"/>
more palpably absurd then to receive
upon their credit the whole Rule of Faith,
and yet not take their words for any one
Article of Faith? and consequently what
can be imagin'd more vain and fruitless then
for me to lose my labour in striving to shew
that Protestants have no colour from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
to expect this al-deciding power in
Scripture, whilst themselvs aver the whole
multitude of <hi>Fathers</hi> is not capable of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a sufficient testimony for their relyance
on Scripture: since therfore there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like a ground in Scripture, and they
scorn all ground except Scripture, I must
leave them to the freedom of doing it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ground.</p>

which this consideration,
that, since <hi>Protestants</hi> disavow

to decline any farther search into those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
<hi>Witnesses</hi> of our <hi>ancient Faith;</hi> being
a task that would require some labour of
me to do, and yield no profit to them, when
done.</p>
               <p>Yet, I easily observ'd, that, as my excuse
(to indifferent Persons) will defend me from
the imputation of being troubled with the
Writing-Itch: so, it seems to engage my
clearing my self of a far more important
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47186:102"/>
charge, which otherwise might occasion
some passionate or captious spirits, to fix
this scandal upon me, that I acknowledge
not the judgment of Antiquity; an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
aspersion, which the French <hi>Daillè</hi>

               <p>And because that <hi>Monsieur's</hi> Book is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizon'd
among us, by the adoption of those
two great <hi>Secretaries</hi> (whose names forc'd
me into this imployment) and rais'd to the
esteem of being the source whence their
streams took their current; I cannot but
give my <hi>Reader</hi> a hint concerning it: for
no other reason, but only to make him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
what <hi>Great men</hi> are subject to,
when the luxuriousness of their wits carries
them beyond the bounds of those professions
they are skild in.</p>
               <p>With this Note therfore we wil begin our
discourse; that, Many great and nimble
wits, both ancient and modern, have (meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for their recretation) undertaken to plead
the cause of natural defects, and striven to
set them above the opposite perfections:
like <hi>Aesop's Woolf,</hi> who, having lost his tail,
would perswade other Wolvs to cut off
theirs too, as unnecessary burdens. But, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
contradicting this Art, and by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47186:102"/>
current of impressions, forcing us to
the contrary belief; such quaint discourses
gain no more credit then Prismatical glasses,
in which we are pleasd to know our selvs
delightfully cosen'd. Now, what in these
men, is only a Caprich of wit and gayness
of humor, were it applied to a business of
high concern, and which could not be
judg'd by our senses, but requir'd a deep
penetration to distinguish right from
wrong, would certainly be a most perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and insufferable wickedness: a trap
to ensnare and ruin all the weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn'd,
whom either the cunning of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
can deceive, or sweetnesse of Rhetorick
inveagle.</p>
               <p>But, being arriv'd already within sight
of my designed Port, I beg my Reader to
believe me of that discretion, as not easily
to lanch forth again into the main Ocean
of a new bottomless controversy: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall only essay to decipher the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Treatise in common; leaving its
strict perusal to them that are more at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and have their Noses better arm'd for
raking in a dunghil.</p>
               <p>To make then a neerer approach to the
work, I shal begin with the Author's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
which aims at no lesse then this
bold and desperate attempt, To disable the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47186:103"/>
                  <hi>Fathers</hi> from being Judges in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
of this present Age. Let us enquire
the true and genuine sense of this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
               <p>And first, who are signifi'd by the word
<hi>Fathers?</hi> For this he assigns us three Ages:
from <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Constantine;</hi> from <hi>Constantine</hi>
to <hi>Gregory</hi> the great; and from <hi>Him</hi> to <hi>Vs.</hi>
Now, this last part, (though it contains a
thousand yeeres,) he cuts off from the score
of Fathers, and much more, puls them out
of the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nch of <hi>Judges:</hi> the middle division
he grumbles at, as not being worthy of, or, at
most hardly admittable to that appellation:
the first Age alone he freely acknowledges.</p>
               <p>By what Criticism he does this, I am not
able to understand: For, when I learn'd
Latin, <hi>Pater</hi> signified the immediate proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitour
of the Son; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> was of that
opinion, telling his Converts, They had no
Father but himself, because he had in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
begotten them by the Gospel: and
though, by ampliation, this word has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
also the Parents of our Fathers, and
upwards even to <hi>Adam;</hi> yet how it comes
so to signifie the most remote, as to exclude
the neerest, is beyond my skil in Grammar.
Pray, let this good Definitor reflect upon
himself: if the first remembred of his race
had died without Issue, how could he have
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47186:103"/>
been one of his Forefathers? no more, had
there been no Preachers after the first three
hundred yeers till our time, should we
have accounted those Primitive Ones our
Fathers. That they are Fathers, then, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they begot Preachers, who continued
the propagation of the same doctrine to
our daies: which we profess they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us; and that therfore we are their
Spiritual Off-spring, they our Fathers.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Daillè</hi> and his Consorts fault is not,
that they contract the compass of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but that they acknowledge any. For
they are all Mushroms, sprung up as new
as the morning, not so much as one from
another, if they be true to their tenets: every
one of them is bound to say to <hi>Calvin,</hi> as
wel as to the Saints, I believe not for thy
word, but I have heard it from the Apostles
own mouths in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Though, indeed, I have no reason to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
much with Him upon this point: for, if
he acknowledges the word <hi>Fathers,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the <hi>Thing</hi> or Vertue of it in them; since,
to be a Father, is to propagate Christs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to posterity: which quality he must
of necessity deny them, whilst he thinks their
doctrine not to be that of Christ; and that it
ought, by every private man, be brought to
the test of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and so far accepted or
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47186:104"/>
refus'd, as, to the grave judgement of some
judicious Blue-apron, seems agreeable to the
sense of Scripture.</p>
               <p>This, then, is the pious design of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
To infinuate a belief, that, since the
<hi>Apostles</hi> daies, there has not been a sufficient
<hi>living Witnesse</hi> of what they taught the
world, or what <hi>Christ</hi> taught them. In which
there are two notorious propositions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded,
worthy to be look'd into. First,
that these good Christians, at one leap free
themselves from all the bands of <hi>Community</hi>
and <hi>Society</hi> of mankind, and from all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the Kingdom of Christ, which
they flatly deny. For, Nature teaches
us, there can be no Government without
Judges; I mean, <hi>living</hi> Definitors and Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of occasional debates: therefore, if
Christ has left no Judges upon Earth, he has
no kingdom here: such Judges I speak of,
as should administer His Law; for he came
not to plant temporal Kings, but a spiritual
Regiment, wherin, if he has had no Judges
since the Apostles decease, his Kingdom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd
with them.</p>
               <p>Now then, the whol drift of this Writer is,
to establish an absolute <hi>Anarchy;</hi> where every
one indifferently shall be Master without
control, in that great and principal My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of training up souls to eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47186:104"/>
which by how much more dark and
difficult the spiritual conduct to future bliss
is, then temporal government to present
wealth and security, so much more unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and unnatural must the position be,
that dissolvs all obedience to Ecclesiastical
Superiours, and abolishes all <hi>Order</hi> in the
Church: An assertion justly to be abhor'd
by any, who has the least spark of love to
that only great Good, the salvation of his
Soul.</p>
               <p>The other Proposition is, that since the
Apostles time, there has been no publik ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
true doctrine or good life, in that part
of the World which we call <hi>Christian.</hi> I do
not mean, there may not have appeared
some vertuous actions in private persons,
(though perhaps the consequence might be
driven so far;) but that, all visible Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
have had both their <hi>Doctrine</hi> spotted
with foul <hi>tenets,</hi> and their consequent <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises</hi>
polluted with Superstition and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
For, as this is one of the main grounds
for their rejecting the Fathers; so, the reason
<hi>à priori</hi> (which they alledge) being once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
evinces the truth of the Conclusion
<hi>I</hi> charge upon them: it being evident, that
if because <hi>man is fallible,</hi> the <hi>Fathers</hi> are
insufficient to propagate truth to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity;
and, out of the position of insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47186:105"/>
must of necessity follow the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of defect; certainly then, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
generations had not sufficient instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
either for belief or actions. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the <hi>Reformers</hi> themselvs acknowledg
as much; since they esteem the Fathers er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
so gross, that it was fit to leave the
communion of that Church, wherin they
are defended, rather then accept of such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations.
Now if this be not to deny
all good life, and the main and universal
fruit of Christs passion, even in those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
Ages, I have lost my little wits.</p>
               <p>This; therfore, I say, is the aym and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his Book; to prove, That since
Christs time, there has been no sufficient <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
testimony of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> no
command or <hi>government</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> as
<hi>Christians;</hi> and lastly, no <hi>holiness</hi> or good
life, nor any fitting direction among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
brought in and stated by our kind Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and wisest Law-giver <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
Now, how great an encouragement and
advance this may prove, either towards ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
or study of Religion, I understand not.
This I know, if any would purposely seek
to draw off our hearts from all hope of
heaven and practice of vertue, I cannot
imagin a more efficacious argument, then,
First, to tell how much pains our Saviour
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47186:105"/>
had taken to plant a right <hi>Faith</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<hi>life,</hi> in so many years of example and
Preaching, closing all with such strange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld
suffrings: Nay, that he had sent
the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> in so manifest and glorious
a manner from heaven, upon his <hi>Disciples,</hi>
to fire their hearts with <hi>zeal</hi> and impower
their hands to <hi>Miracles,</hi> giving them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to publish his <hi>new Law</hi> over all the
World, and solemnly engaging to assist them
for ever: And yet afterwards bring in
proofs, how, notwithstanding all this, soon
as these Apostles were dead, Idolatry and
corruption, both of doctrin and manners,
began presently to appear, in the greatest
and best Members of the Church, even the
immediate Disciples of the Apostles; and
in short time, so over-run the whole World,
that the means of Salvation was generally
lost, and the way to heaven obstructed with
an universal deluge of vice and superstition.
These proofs are the work of our excellent
<hi>Author:</hi> whence I think it no boldness to
conclude, this Treatise, of <hi>the right use of the
Fathers,</hi> is the perfectest piece that ever was
written, for the utter extermination of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
doctrin,</hi> and absolute ruin of all <hi>vertue.</hi>
For, when I turn o're the Book, I cannot but
acknowledg it full of as good Topicks, cast
into as neat a stile, and qualify'd with as
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47186:106"/>
seeming a fit temper conveniently to betray
unwary souls, as any modern I ever read:
but I fear not, these few animadversions I
have hastily collected, sufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to the sight of any that will but open
their eyes, how dangerous and damnable a
a poyson lies hidden under that guilded hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical
cover.</p>

material or weighty, can be said on this subject,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47186:106"/>
which his rare and piercing observation has not
anticipated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To understand his perswasions the better,
I entreat you, reflect upon two ways, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two parts of one way, ordinarily cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
by such jugling Orators, as we before
made mention of; who use to employ
their wits in contradicting open verities.</p>
               <p>The first is, to talk much of the common
notion, when the question is of a particular.
As if one would undertake to disswade a
man from travelling to <hi>Rome,</hi> because 'tis a
long journey; he will plead the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
which accompany long journeys,
and immediatly talk of Wildernesses, wild
Beasts, great Robberies, dangerous Rivers,
unpassable Mountains, want of Company,
and disfurnishment of all accommodations
by the way, &amp; a thousand such frightful nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
which occur in the misfortunes of
Shipwrack'd men, and the desperate voyages
of Romance-Lovers: But never descend to
consider, whether all these be found in the
way to <hi>Rome,</hi> or what remedies are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to correct such Symptomes; knowing
too wel, that equivocation is easily couch'd
and ambushed in common propositions, but
soon detected, if a descent be made to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>The other Fallacy is, To assign real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47186:107"/>
but not tell you how far they
annoy the Subject, alledging many sad
things, but concealing how great they are.
As a man may have the <hi>Gout</hi> or <hi>Stone</hi> in so
slight a measure, that they shall never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him: yet a third person, who hears
the melancholy relation, may conceit and
pitty his case as most deplorable; because
the Reporter, not expressing the violence of
these diseases, leavs an impression in our
minds of such a degree of pain and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as we ordinarily commiserate in those
that suffer the extreamest fury of such vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
tormentors.</p>
               <p>These two Fallacies run, in a manner,
through his whole Book; which he divides
into two parts, very methodically. In the
former, he pretends to shew 'tis an excessive
hard, if not impossible, task to know the
<hi>meaning</hi> of the <hi>Fathers:</hi> In the later, that,
supposing their <hi>sense</hi> were known, it impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
little to the dispatch of controversies;
they being not <hi>infallible,</hi> nor without all
danger of errour: grounding himself on
this maxim, that <hi>the understanding neither
can, nor indeed ought to believe any thing in
point of Religion, but what it knows to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which, had it come out of a <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
mouth, would have sounded glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47186:107"/>
and worthy the dignity of that Faith
which God and <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> being the Author
of, have compleatly furnisht with clear and
solid principles. He perhaps would have
offered you choice, either of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;</hi>
produced in order to <hi>this,</hi> as perfect
demonstrations as <hi>Aristotle</hi> is ador'd for; and
towards <hi>that,</hi> engaged you in the most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
directors of humane life, and cleerly
evidenc'd, by the principles of common
sense, that, if you refuse the Authority of
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> you renounce all the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties
on which you build every serious
action of your life; &amp; in a word constrain'd
you to deny or affirm somwhat that your
self, in another case, will confess a meer
madness to affirm or deny.</p>
               <p>But, in <hi>Monsieur Daille's</hi> mouth, who, in his
next words, will cast you upon the vanity
of a broken breath, which has been a boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and searsing these hundred years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any profit in the certainty of its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
I cannot pierce farther, then that this
glorious principle is assum'd, as the readiest
means to betray his Auditor into a despair
of Christianity, and then leave him in the
gulf of Atheism.</p>
               <p>However, let's see the nature of his proofs,
which for the first point, he has screwd up to
eleven. The three first are, that the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:47186:108"/>
works, especially in the three first <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies,</hi>
were very few, and of matters far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the present controversies; and
besides, many fals writings father'd upon
those <hi>Saints</hi> by unworthy persons; (of which
last imputation my third <hi>Survey</hi> gives you
a more exact particular.) Nor can I deny
any of this, but I find two exceptions,
which I believe would shrewdly trouble the
Minister to answer: One, that <hi>those</hi> of the
pretended <hi>Reformation,</hi> who have so much
modesty in them, as not to renounce utterly
the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>whole Church of Jesus
Christ</hi> at one blow, strive to shelter their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
in these three <hi>Centuries:</hi> wherof
these three arguments make me plainly see
the reason, Because by the <hi>paucity of Books,</hi>
the <hi>difference of Subject,</hi> and <hi>pretence of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,</hi>
they hope nothing can be made evident
for those Ages: and so, the purity for
which they cry up those days as only worth
our conformity, is in that sense the Poet
says, <hi>purae sunt plateae,</hi> that is, ther's no body
in the streets.</p>
               <p>My other unsatisfaction is, He does not
shew that even in these ages, and those very
works which he acknowledges for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
home-born Children, and to have
descended incorrupted to our daies, there
is not <hi>sufficient</hi> to convince all Hereticks.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47186:108"/>
For, though every particular point perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
cannot, in so few works and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
so accidentally to our purpose, be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demonstrated; yet, the generality of the
<hi>Rule</hi> we are to follow in Christian doctrin
is so manifestly set down, in those very
<hi>Fathers</hi> he admits, that, were their writings
made our judges, no man could possibly be
an Heretick: since, as the material points
the Fathers wrote against were different
from ours; so the <hi>formal</hi> ones, as the <hi>deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Catholick communion, the renouncing
the testimony of Apostolical Seas,</hi> and <hi>the hiding
themselves under the leaves of Scripture,</hi> were
common to all the ancient as well as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Hereticks. But however, if he cannot
maintain, that there is not enough left to
convince the truth; his proof is deficient,
and wholly useless to the end he brings it.</p>
               <p>One observation more I cannot chuse but
note: He quarrels with some Catholick
Doctors, who prefer the second <hi>Tricentury</hi>
before the first, as to the right understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the sense of the Fathers: Which he
says he takes for a confession of the want of
testimonies in the former Ages, and doubts
not but in equal cleerness, they would
prefer the first <hi>Tricentury,</hi> for point of purity
before the latter. But either his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
or mis-understanding our <hi>Tenets</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47186:109"/>
him: For, we do not imagin the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ages <hi>more pure</hi> then the later, since we
admit no errours in either, but make no
question that the universality of Fathers
in any two ages held the same doctrin; and
so, the Faith of the second <hi>Tricentury</hi> being
known, we account <hi>that</hi> of the former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted;
especially we all believing the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Fathers receiv'd their doctrin from the
former, not by reading their Books, which
belong'd to few, but by being instructed
from their mouths who had receiv'd it from
them. But he thinks his Reformers very
probably maintain that Christian Religion
has long been in a dangerous consumption,
declining still by little and little, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in every Age some certain degree of its
Primitive vigour and native complexion;
to which purpose he cites the words of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesippus</hi>
out of <hi>Eusebius, That this infirmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
as soon as the Apostles were dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This position sounds to me, as if the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
they cry out against for abominations
enter'd so early into the Church; and have
continued in it so long, that they can now
reckon fifteen <hi>Centuries:</hi> nor can I desire ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a more ingenuous confession or stronger
proof of the truth of those doctrines, which
the nature of Christianity has preserv'd with
such exact care, and constant tenderness that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47186:109"/>
in so many ages, not one of them has been
forgotten, not one of them ever oppos'd, by
those who, in all generations, have stil been
accounted the sound party of Christians.
Besides, I should expect, that so foul a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,
as these bold accusers lay upon the
Church; viz. that she has been an Idolatrous
and abominable Harlot, ever since the death
of the Apostles, ought not to be grounded
on bare probable conjectures, but evidently
convinced; under penalty that, otherwise,
the Calumniators should suffer, at least, as
heavy a Censure, as they attempt to pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Church.</p>
               <p>But, because, for the maintenance of this
odious slander, he chiefly rely's on <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gesip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus's</hi>
testimony, let the witness be fairly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd;
and that according to the Authors
own citation, which runs to this effect, <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Apostles death, the Masters of Seduction
began publickly and professedly, to vent their
falssy named Science, against the preaching of
the truth:</hi> which, in plain English signifies
no more, then that Hereticks rose up against
the Church: and is so far from arguing the
Churches corruption, that it strongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
her purity, since the doctrin, which
falshood contradicts, must necessarily be it
self true. Thus clearly it follows from
these words, that the wrong imputed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47186:110"/>
was <hi>out</hi> of the Church, and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Faith <hi>in</hi> her Communion.</p>
               <p>But, if we look into the Text exactly, the
meaning of that passage is this, <hi>After the
Apostles death, the consistence of Heresie took
its beginning,</hi> that is, <hi>Hereticks</hi> grew into a
body, daring to shew their heads, where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they lurk'd for fear of the <hi>Apostles:</hi>
which expression manifestly proves, They
began to make congregations, distinct from
the true Church. And, this being evident,
we cannot be troubled with those words
going before in <hi>Higesippus,</hi> which say, <hi>till
then the Church was a virgin and uncorrupted;</hi>
for it is a phrase natural enough, to call
the body corrupted, whose putrify'd parts
are cut off or rotted away, as those degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
members were from the Church of
God: And so this very <hi>Daillè</hi> could cite
(upon another occasion) these self-same
Innovators under the direct notion of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
when he thought it might better serve
his turn.</p>

               <head>THE
THIRD SURVEY. Of his 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapters, wherin he
objects forgery and corruption of the
Fathers works.</head>
               <p>AS to the third point, of <hi>Forgery,</hi> our
<hi>Monsieur</hi> dilates himself exceedingly;
but, how much to the purpose, some few
notes wil discover. First, he objects many
counterfeit Books, that are not now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
nor have been these many Ages: and
think you not there must necessarily arise a
strange obscurity in our Controversies, from
such forgeries? Then, he complains, that
Transcribers have put wrong names to
books, either for the better selling them,
or out of ignorance; and, in some of them,
the question is about Authors almost of the
same age: all which is likewise little to the
point; for, where the <hi>Ages opinion,</hi> and not
the particular credit of the Author's lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is requir'd; the authority of one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
writer ought generally to weigh
as much as anothers: and this is the case in
controversies; where the sense of the Church,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47186:111"/>
not that of private <hi>Doctors,</hi> is the subject of
our inquiry.</p>
               <p>Neither must I forget his defamation of
the ancient Christians, as counterfeiters of
the <hi>Sybils</hi> Prophesies, out of the calumny of
the wicked <hi>Celsey,</hi> which neverthelesse we see
<hi>Lactantius</hi> stands upon to the Heathens faces.
He omits not, for a notorious piece of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
that the Canons of the Council of
<hi>Sardica</hi> are cited as of the Council of <hi>Nice:</hi>
wherin nothing is more certain, then that
the Canons were true, though not admitted
by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who, being cal'd, would not
come to the <hi>Council.</hi> So the question stands
meerly upon this, whether they ought to be
cal'd the Canons of <hi>Nice,</hi> being made by a
Council gather'd afterwards to confirm the
former? which the <hi>Latines</hi> defend, and the
<hi>Greeks</hi> dislike. Doubtless a main forgery,
to be urg'd by this temperate man, whose
charity, no question, would have winkt at
small faults.</p>
               <p>Yet because no ordinary satisfaction will
content him, though those <hi>Popes</hi> were all
both commended by the Ages in which they
liv'd, and reputed Saints by the ensuing
<hi>Church,</hi> and One of them that great <hi>Saint
Leo,</hi> whose Oracles were so highly esteem'd
in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> I will briefly
set down the case. The <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47186:111"/>
                  <hi>Constantius</hi> (though yet, for fear not declar'd
such) summon'd a <hi>Generall Council</hi> of the
<hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western Churches,</hi> to a Town
cal'd <hi>Sardica.</hi> There assembled betwixt
3 and 4 hundred Bishops. The <hi>Arians,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselvs like to come to the worst, by
the number of the Orthodox party, upon
sought pretences, went to another place,
cald <hi>Philippopolis;</hi> where, making an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of their own, they term'd it, from the
Emperours Summons, <hi>the Council of Sardica:</hi>
And, partly by their diligence and sending
circular Letters thorow Christendom, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by joyning with a great faction of <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
but chiefly (as it may be justly believ'd)
by the power of the <hi>Emperours Officers,</hi> made
the name of the <hi>Council of Sardica</hi> passe for
the denomination of their Conventicle, both
in the East, and thorow such remote parts
as had not special intelligence of what
pass'd in <hi>Sardica.</hi> Hence, any <hi>Canons</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be order'd at <hi>Sardica,</hi> were blasted
before known: wherupon it fel out, that
the small party which knew the truth, was
forc'd, in their collections of <hi>Canons,</hi> to
place these next to the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> (as
their order requir'd) without a name, and
as an <hi>Appendix</hi> of the Council. In this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
these <hi>Popes</hi> found them about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeers after: and, whether it was that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:47186:112"/>
they were not sufficiently acquainted with
the Accident, or whether they thought the
action legitimate, and the ground of it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
they urg'd them as Canons of <hi>Nice;</hi>
and, after the matter was examin'd, bore
the Cause, in force of them, and continu'd
on to posterity still the same denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This is that solemn Forgery he decries
with so loud a clamor; and concluds his
vehemency with so notorious a falshood,
that every three-penny Controvertist can
spit in his face. For he says, that even now
a great part of Christendom holds, and 'tis
generally urg'd by all, that <hi>the Popes Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Appeals</hi> was first given him by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice:</hi> wheras, the most ordinary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is, that 'tis <hi>jure divino;</hi> and those that
look on <hi>jus positivum,</hi> are so cunning, as to
distinguish the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> from that of
<hi>Sardica;</hi> and in that of <hi>Nice,</hi> seek only a
<hi>Testimony</hi> of what was in use before the
Council, not a <hi>Guift</hi> of this Authority.</p>
               <p>His next accusation concerns certain <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>
that both the Catholiks and pretenders
to Reformation agree to be Counterfeit:
which, how little it imports our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
since neither party grounds
any doctrin upon them, needs not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:47186:112"/>
Another sort he counts for Forgery, when
Catholiks, among themselvs, question cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
pieces of ancient Authors; in which
case, he still joyns himself to that part of
Catholiks that refuses to admit such passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for legitimate, and then immediately
charges all the rest who receive them, with
downright forgery: which is the same as
to call all men Knaves, that are not of his
side; as if no real and just doubt could be
made of Authors by sober and vertuous
persons, but all must be imputed to malice;
so that, this exception is plainly a peevish
and shallow cavil: and besides, no waies
available to his purpose; since, that which
is in real doubt among Catholiks, can be
no argument against Heretiks.</p>
               <p>He that has patience enough to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of these qualities in his Chapter of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,</hi>
and see that, besides this, he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it but aiery discourses, in common,
how <hi>writings</hi> may be corrupted, cannot
chuse but say
<q>—Movet Cornicula risum,
Furtivis nudata coloribus.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And yet suppose all he endeavours were
true, in <hi>abstracto,</hi> there remains stil the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;
wherein if he miscarry, instead
of pulling down the <hi>Fathers,</hi> he lays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the dust: for, after never so many
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:47186:113"/>
Books never so much disabled, if we can
finde a Library full of unsuspected and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
acknowledg'd Authors, we suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
discover the impertinency and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of this manner of proceeding.</p>
               <p>Therfore, to prevent this inconvenience,
our quaint Discourser raises two suspicions
against the confest works of <hi>Fathers:</hi> One of
<hi>Corruption,</hi> the other of <hi>Obscurity.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
he begins from the escapes of <hi>Transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;</hi>
which, as we cannot deny to have
some force, if spoken <hi>in common,</hi> so, apply'd
<hi>to particulars,</hi> we shall find little important
to our purpose: For, if the question were
of some <hi>two or three</hi> Sentences spoken <hi>by the
by,</hi> such perhaps might be suspected, though
not justly, without better ground then a
bare surmise; because, where the error of
the Transcriber has its amplitude to happen
in one of ten thousand lines, to say it lights
just <hi>here,</hi> is a very weak conjecture, unless
there be more particular causes of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
alledg'd, (which may apply it to that
place,) then follow from this common
cours: But, when there are formall and set
discourses, or frequent and express passages,
to the same effect and purpose; then this
suspition has no weight at all: and such is
the case betwixt Catholiks, and the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to Reformation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:47186:113"/>
At the next turn, he would perswade us,
that St. <hi>Hierome, Ruffinus,</hi> and others, who
abridg'd certain Greek works in their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,
did therby falsify the Authors; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
that the collections of Canons
made either by Greeks or Latins are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
because they omitted such as they
dislik'd or had no use of: not understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or dissembling his knowledge, that
such Books are not intended for <hi>Histories,</hi> to
tell us what pass'd, but <hi>Rules</hi> for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so to be fitted to the particular
occasion; taking what conduces to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
purpose, and leaving out such passages
as are (though in themselvs good) yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to his designs. In the same rank
are <hi>Liturgies;</hi> which being the <hi>publik pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
are subject to be enlarg'd, contracted,
or changed, according to the devotion of
the people and prudence of the Pastors, as
we see daily practised: and so are better
testimonies for universality, in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricts,
then of antiquity. These, therfore,
neither are corruptions, nor make the sense
of the <hi>Fathers</hi> more difficult: for we can use
but so much as we find in them, and so far,
they are as authentical as any other; whilst
what is not there cannot be pressd out of
them.</p>
               <p>After these, he produces some debates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47186:114"/>
the Latines and Greeks, about falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
certain passages; whose quarrels it
concerns not me to take up: only I must
note, the brotherly correction he gives the
Fathers in these words, <hi>thus did they bandy
stifly one against the other; each of them, as it may
be easily perceiv'd, having much more appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of reason and truth in their accusation
of their Adversary, then in excusing or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselvs;</hi> which is no less then a plain
condemnation of all, how ever disputable
the case be in it self. Now, how many of
such passages mutually objected, justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
that calumniation, and were not, by
the fervour of disputation only term'd so
(being in themselvs but mistakes, and wrong
informations) is too long a business for
the brevity I propose to my self.</p>
               <p>Yet this also I may observe, not without
ground, from <hi>Daillè</hi> himself, that the true
controversie concerning such abuses has
been indeed between <hi>Catholiks</hi> and <hi>Heretiks,</hi>
but not <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> in common; for
the Catholik Greeks stil accus'd their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
of great corruption. And this is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
because Catholiks having alwaies
stood for, and rely'd on Antiquity, alwaies
upbraided and condemn'd <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of novelty; it necessarily follows, they
were without question fully perswaded their
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47186:114"/>
opinion was the same with the Fathers, and
had a real and true evidence of it: wheras
Heretiks, not esteeming Antiquity for it
self, but only for fear of scandalizing the
generality of Christians, who are stil
brought up in a high reverence of it, were
bound to seek those waies that might satisfy
as wel as deceive the people, without any
inward and hearty respect to the Fathers
themselvs: a charge this very Author justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
not to be uncharitably apply'd to such
Innovators; whilst his own chief endeavours
strive to make us think the <hi>Fathers</hi> are
like <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Gods, Fine things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs,
but hung so high, their sound cannot
reach us mortals here below upon Earth.
Neither indeed is the case of Ambition
much unlike that of Heresie: for, those who
encroach upon publik practices of former
Ages, are forc'd to use their utmost skil in
falsifying all they can, to obscure the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of what passed in the daies of their
Ancestors.</p>
               <p>One other particular wil challenge me, if
I go on without taking at least some little
notice of it: and 'tis the Grecians objection
about adding this word <hi>Filioque</hi> to the
Creed of <hi>Nicaea:</hi> which having insisted on
more largly in another place, I shall pacify
with this short answer; Since, 'tis confest
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47186:115"/>
by both parties, that the main Creed was
made in that Council, and received this
<hi>addition,</hi> from another, freely and openly
avow'd for <hi>such</hi> by the Roman Church: the
question could not be of <hi>corruption,</hi> (which
seems to imply a secret design of imposing
on the world) but of the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of the
Addition.</p>
               <p>Now, let us pass to his accusation of later
times; where, he complains there is far
more fals play. His first instance is, against
certain varieties in the ancient Fathers;
that some Manuscrips or Impressions agree
not with others: as if every one that sets
out a Book must have seen all Manuscripts,
or else he corrupts the Ancient Copy. But,
that which angers him is, the words omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or added are against his <hi>tenets;</hi> whence
he gathers it was no casual escape, but a
deliberate plot of voluntary corruption:
but he that wil lose so much time as to take
notice how weak and inconsiderable the
passages are, even in his own citations, wil
easily see this chief proof consists meerly in
a bold assertion.</p>
               <p>I shall therfore rely on my Readers inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
and only cite two or three examples
for a pattern of the rest: As, that the word
<hi>Petra</hi> is changed into <hi>Petrus,</hi> in that famous
sentence of St. <hi>Cyprian, Cathedra una super
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47186:115"/>
Petrum Domini voce fundata;</hi> That, in St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hrose,</hi>
some books are separated, which in
other Copies are joyn'd together; that, in
St. <hi>Peters</hi> life, is omitted a certain Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
advising his Successors to abstain from
secular cares: Pretences so slight in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
so impertinent to the main cause;
that, none but a petty <hi>Polititian</hi> would have
stoopt to such trivial corruptions, nor any
but a wrangling <hi>Sophister</hi> pretended such
childish exceptions.</p>
               <p>But, not content with what has been
done, he presses us with what would have
been done, if I know not whose counsail
had been follow'd: which is nothing but
the wild Chimera's of a sick brain. Next he
is offended that Heretical books have been
forbidden and abolish'd: as if any could
think it reasonable, sedicious Pamphlets
against Kings and States should passe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprehended
in their dominions; exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to Idolatry be permitted among the
Jews; or such blasphemies as pretend to
prove <hi>Christ</hi> an Impostor should be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among Christians. I wonder calumnies
so shallow, so impudent, and of so desperate
a consequence can finde patience enough in
any person of understanding to read them;
&amp; yet I see great wits strangly applaud them.</p>
               <p>The actions, therfore, cal'd by him cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47186:116"/>
consisting only in such, to the
very end of his <hi>fourth Chapter,</hi> you wil ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
perceive that this so wel bodied Chapter
also (if the impertinencies with which he
lards it were substracted) would prove as
lean and starv'd as <hi>Pharao's</hi> Oxen. Besides,
if we seek to direct his arrow towards the
intended scope, this last concerns not the
ancient Fathers; since now, Expurgations
are only for Moderns, as anciently they
were only against Hereticks. The other
objections reach no way to disable this safe
and principal answer, That, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all his cavils, there may stil remain a
sufficient number of the <hi>Fathers</hi> writings,
pure and incorrupted, to convince the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of the <hi>Catholik Church.</hi>

               <head>THE
FOURTH SURVEY. Of the fifth Chapter; wherin he objects the
Fathers Eloquence; and that, on set
purpose, they spake obscurely.</head>
               <p>I Shall pass now to the next Flourish, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then Argument: where, this bold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
man (offering to prove the <hi>Fathers</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:47186:116"/>
are hard to be understood) assigns those very
reasons, that make all other Authors more
easily understandable. For first, what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
more copious, more regular, and
wherein Schollers are more vers'd, then
<hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> which are the Fathers Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes?
Yes, says he, but few arrive to that
perfection in them, as is truly requisite for
the exact managing of Controversies. Be
it so: But then, let no others meddle with
this part of Controversies, like Masters,
but they; let such on both sides try the
quarrel, whilst others for this part rely on
them.</p>
               <p>But again he renews his first complaint:
how smal a number are they that are fitly
qualify'd to enter the lists in so difficult a
combate? I do not fear, if this Author were
ask'd of <hi>France, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> he
would readily undertake to find twenty of
his own side compleatly furnisht for such a
skirmish; and, since our Party is both more
extended, enjoys better commodity for
studying, and cleerly, by its numerous
works, shews it self far more laborious, He
may well allow us at least as many as he
promises to produce of his own: If then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
both, may be found at the same time,
forty sufficiently train'd for the encounter,
what need we ask any more? there will not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47186:117"/>
want enough besides, capable to prosit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
out of their Labours.</p>
               <p>He proceeds to help himself upon St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms</hi>
speech against <hi>nimium diserti,</hi> and some
faults of weak interpreters: And presumes,
the places he brings clear: though my sight
is not quick enough to perceive it of any,
but one of St. <hi>Austin cont. Adimant.</hi> which
he clears himself, by adding to the Fathers
Text <hi>cùm signum daret corporis sui,</hi> the word
<hi>only</hi> in his interpretation. Then he urges,
Men bring obscure places to interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but the unhappiness is, his instances
are of his own party.</p>
               <p>He presses, that the <hi>Fathers,</hi> before the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Heresies, spake ambiguously and
doubtfully, and that which seem'd to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their own certain sense and meaning;
as he exemplify's out of St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> and
St. <hi>Basil,</hi> concerning some Fathers before
the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresy. But this Wel-meaner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
that (at least in his examples) he brings
the salve with the stroak: for, confessing
'twas shew'd to be against the writers mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
he implicitly tels us, either there were
other precedent or subsequent expressions
in the same place, which made the doubtful
words plain; or, at least so evident passages
of the same Author, in other places, that
there could be no doubt of his meaning, in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47186:117"/>
the ambiguous ones. And, truly if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this gentle <hi>Sophisters</hi> discours, we shal
easily see, he imagines, that proofs from the
<hi>Fathers</hi> ought to be brought by the popping
out of half a Sentence, and never regard ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what goes before or follows after; as,
by the instances we have already examin'd,
you may perceive is the reform'd fashion of
citing <hi>Scriptures:</hi> Wheras, the Books of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
being large and ample, allow greater
Carreers to those who run matches in
them.</p>
               <p>He adds farther, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> deliver'd
some things on set purpose, obscurely. If his
meaning be, they exprest their thoughts in
certain occasions, shortly or not fully;
what danger is there in that? We know
wel all arguments drawn from them must
be made out of what <hi>they have,</hi> not what
<hi>they might have</hi> written: and so, the erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he spends, in proving this, had been
better employ'd to shew the height of those
Mysteries the <hi>Fathers</hi> saw just cause to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal,
then in cavilling at their compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
expressions, which suted best with their
circumstances. And certainly 'tis most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to reason, that the mind of such as
wrote before the Controversy began, should
be judged by those Fathers, who (for the
easier defence of truth and fuller confutation
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47186:118"/>
of the Innovators) were forc'd to break the
Seal of secrecy: and, who (being their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Disciples) without doubt must
necessarily best know their minds, and
consequently were most able to repeat the
lessons they had so lately learnt of their
Masters.</p>
               <p>He afterwards reckons up certain Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
weaknesses of some <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
of others, and, out of both, draws
venom to his comb: So that, whether a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
write down right natural construction,
or (by abilities of explicating himself) po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
his stile, all breeds darkness to this
great Illuminator (or Calumniator rather)
of the Fathers: Nay, the very vices they
cry out against in evil Preachers, must be
the faults of the Princes of antiquity, by this
Interpreters benevolence. But he knocks
all on the head, by the example of St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom;</hi>
who, having related what had passed
in him during his sleep, in another place
defends it was but a dream: And can you
believe, the Objector was awake, when he
fumbled out this piece of impertinency?
Yet he urges it for a convincing evidence:
and, bearing a special good wil to St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>
he very kindly perswades himself, that
the Stories of <hi>Malchus,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Eremit,</hi> and
St. <hi>Hillarion,</hi> were Romances; the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:47186:118"/>
his maligners calumniated it; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two, (though never question'd) because
he shew'd wit in them.</p>
               <p>It seems too, he would beget in his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this dutiful conceit of the Fathers, that
they were wont to deliver Romances for
Articles of Faith; concluding with this des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
and ungracious demand, <hi>Who shall
assure us, that they have not made use of these
same Arts, in their discourses concerning the
Eucharist?</hi> and afterwards renews again the
like impudent <hi>quaere,</hi> discovering too openly
the prophaness of his heart; as if he suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the <hi>Fathers</hi> might, perhaps, have cozen'd
the people, with some fals glasses, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<hi>the power of Prelates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, he objects, the <hi>Fathers</hi> often affirm
or deny obsolutely, what they mean only
comparatively: and, if you wil not believe
him, he produces examples out of St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>
St. <hi>Chrysostom, Amphilochius</hi> and <hi>Asterius.</hi>
But, St. <hi>Hierom</hi> is plainly, in the very words
comparative: The rest are both explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the same sense, by the bordering A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
who might easily know the practice of
their lives in that controversie, and in his
very citation, have nothing capable of being
urg'd against that explication; besides, the
phrase it self is favourable. What great
difficulty is there to pick out the English of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47186:119"/>
this sentence, <hi>Praemia pudicitiae nuptiae possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere
non possunt,</hi> &amp;c. with the rest, too trivial
to be repeated?</p>
               <p>He makes a second review of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
speeches, concerning some Heresy
not yet debated, upon another design; to
shew, that while they speak against one He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
they seem to fall into the contrary.
But there is no new difficulty brought, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be of those terms <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
both which this Author abuses
by a wrong interpretation: the first he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<hi>let fall in heat of disputation,</hi> instead
of giving it the true sense, which Englishes it
thus, <hi>suppos'd for disputation sake</hi> (for so 'tis
contradistinguish'd to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to which
St. <hi>Basil</hi> opposes it:) the later he explicates
done or said <hi>by dispensation,</hi> whereas the
proper signification is, <hi>by discretion;</hi> St. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>'s
meaning being that he deliverd what
was fittest in that occasion, and for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to whom, or in whose name he spake;
for his words give us some hints inclining
to either of those senses, that He intended
only to personate an objection against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or else to draw some answer out of
another, without engaging to declare his
own judgment.</p>
               <p>But 'tis worthy our pains to look into
the sweet interpretation he makes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:47186:119"/>
it with the Greek which himself puts
in the margin: he reads therfore thus,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; that is, men ought not malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to take (or understand) and draw it to
be his proper meaning, what one writes or
does (as now its cal'd) <hi>ad hominem;</hi> for,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies according to the art
and understanding to apply every thing to
the particular circumstances which offer
themselvs.</p>
               <p>Lastly, he tels us, <hi>the use of words is chang'd
since Antiquity;</hi> but specifies so simply, that
without question he hoped none but blind
men would look into his book: as if the
World now thought, that <hi>Papa</hi> signifies not
a <hi>spiritual Authority,</hi> but a temporal <hi>Garbo;</hi>
that <hi>Confessio</hi> signifies some outward ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;

FIFTH SURVEY. Of the six Chapters following; wherin
he objects wilful deceit to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</head>
               <p>HItherto our Oratour has opened those
Pleas, which, in a manner, of necessity
follow'd that multitude of books the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have written: and would, if we could
believe him, perswade us, Nothing is to be
learn'd or understood out of Books; but
every three words wil never fail to have
some reason or other to make them so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
that no light or satisfaction can be
derived out of them.</p>
               <p>Nor is all this enough, unless he gives
them a touch of wilfulness: which he does
upon three Heads. First, from their writing
Commentaries: where he notes, that many
times they recite others opinions, without
naming the parties; whence he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that, out of their Commentaries, nothing
can be gather'd concerning their own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the point they handle.</p>
               <p>I cannot deny, but such kind of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47186:120"/>
is sometimes used: nor do I understand
why it should be reprehensible, to propose to
the Reader choice judgments of divers emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
learned Persons, even of Hereticks
somtimes, at least in St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> days, when
there were not so many Catholick writers,
that all good explications might be found
in them, though this honest man (who, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
is no enemy of liberty in Authors,
and opinions) be, at present, for his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
offended with it. But, we can come to
no assurance of the Authors mind; what
then? If we do not see directly what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
to, (though ordinarily some liking
is shew'd more to one opinion then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;)
yet we may know, he proposes all
interpretations for the reader to chuse as he
pleases; which implys, that he saw no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
inconvenience in any.</p>
               <p>But, why is this manner of commenting
made a calumny against all the rest, being
a particular kind and not much used? why
brought for a prejudice against such places
where only one opinion is mentioned? why
is St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> indefinite doctrin (which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
no more then that such is the nature
of some Commentaries) turn'd to an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
as if none should do otherwise? Let
him reflect upon <hi>Beza's</hi> or other of his own
parties <hi>glosses;</hi> and see whether they do not
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47186:121"/>
somtimes explicate Scripture in a way e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
obnoxious to the same exceptions.
I deny not, but St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> (once surpriz'd
by St. <hi>Austin</hi> in a weak explication upon a
passage to the <hi>Galathians)</hi> excuses himself
by a confession, that his memory being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
he had in that place mingled his own
opinion with other mens, without distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But, is it not an excellent piece of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,
out of one only particular defect of
one Father, to draw an imputation, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him alone, but on the whole Senate of
Antiquity? And yet, this thread runs quite
thorow this captious Objectors Book; whose
labour is, out of a <hi>mole</hi> in her face, to prove
<hi>Venus</hi> was not fair.</p>
               <p>Then he procesds to tax St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and
St. <hi>Hillary,</hi> for borrowing doctrin of <hi>Origen,</hi>
without citing the original: as if <hi>Virgil</hi>
should have still named <hi>Homer,</hi> in all the
places wherin he imitated him; or <hi>Torquato
Tasso</hi> told his reader, which <hi>Stanza's</hi> were
his own invention, which translated out of
others.</p>
               <p>His second discontent is, that, when a
passage of Holy Scripture is acknowledg'd
by the <hi>Fathers</hi> to be capable of divers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations,
yet they will presume to use that
sense only which is convenient to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory,
omitting the others which, in those
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47186:121"/>
circumstances, make nothing to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
The like distaste he takes against
them, when speaking of a Mystery that has
two parts, they do not still make mention
of both: as, since <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> he
will by this rule be offended, that a Father
should stile him <hi>God,</hi> without expressing in
the same breath (though altogether unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to his Theam) that he was <hi>Man;</hi> as
if we could not, somtimes upon occasion,
omit what we never intend to deny, but
were still bound to clog our discours with
all the jealous cautions of a Lawyers Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
though indeed, he seems only trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
when this happens concerning the
blessed Sacrament: for then, it utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoints
the force of those Arguments he so
highly esteems.</p>
               <p>Nor does his peevishness stay at these smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<hi>Peccadillo</hi>'s; but, to fill up the measure of
his anger and farther enforce the accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he sees himself engag'd in, his bold hand
trembles not plainly to insinuate, that the
<hi>Fathers</hi> are in plain terms downright chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
contriving these omissions and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity's,
not by wisdom and pastoral pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
but by cunning and hypocritical po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
with a malicious intention to delude
their auditory. But these are little familiar
stroaks, and kind expressions of his devotion
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47186:122"/>
and respect to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> in
whose communion they liv'd, and <hi>Him</hi> in
whose precious death both They and It are
founded.</p>
               <p>His last crimination confists meerly in a
repetition of what we discuss'd in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Chapter,</hi> about the Fathers speeches <hi>ad
hominem:</hi> yet, because he has a little chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his temper, we must observe what he
says. First, being in a kind humour, he now
imputes it only to excess of passion in the
good old men, (as if the former had been
out of malice) which made them speak they
knew not what: wheras, the Ages after
them, explicating such passages of their
Predecessors, attribute it to deep wisdom
and solid learning. Secondly, he shews us,
out of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> how all Authors use two
ways of disputing; one direct and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
or demonstration like, another To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical
and tentative: but to what purpose,
more then to form an aery apprehension, in
the readers head, of some strange fallacy's
and abuses ordinarily practised by those
ancient Maintainers of Christianity, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not.</p>
               <p>Yet, there remains about two lines of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin;
which his jugling art has obscur'd into
a necessity of a short explication: and they
are, that <hi>interdum coguntur loqui non quod
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47186:122"/>
sentiunt, sed quod necesse est dicant contra ea
quae dicunt gentiles,</hi> which is as much as to
say, they are forc'd somtimes not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the Gentils propositions, that they
may impugn them with better advantage.
As when they seem to admit the truth of
some <hi>Oracles,</hi> and apply their discourse only
to shew how such extraordinary actions
might be perform'd by the Devil: wheras
perhaps, in their inward thoughts, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
there were really none true, or, if any,
that they were by Gods interposing his own
power, to the Gentils confusion, as he did in
the apparition of <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> the <hi>Witch</hi>
not being able to raise up souls by the single
force of her charms.</p>
               <p>One new demand he urges, which seems
and indeed is strangly impertinent, <hi>Whether
it be a part of our Faith, to visit the Holy Land:</hi>
as if those words of St. <hi>Hierom, adorâsse ubi
steterunt pedes Domini, pars fidei est,</hi> signify'd
truly, that to exercise adoration were an
Article of Faith; then which, what can be
spoken more sencelesly? wheras, the true
meaning is plain and obvious, that tis a
duty of Faith, or an action proceeding from
Faith, or conformable to Faith; in which
sense, 'tis impossible to make any rational
opposition against it.</p>
               <p>I must not end without taking notice of a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47186:123"/>
goodly piece of wit in mis-translating a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of St. <hi>Hierom;</hi> wh entreats his reader
to judg his meaning out of his whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours,
and <hi>non in uno atque eodem libro crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,
me diversas sententias protulisse, not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
me, that I am of divers minds in the self-same
Book,</hi> which this good natur'd Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
explicates, <hi>and not presently to accuse
any Author of blockishness, for having deliver'd
in one and the same Book two contrary opinions.</hi>
Nevertheless, himself has been, I will not
say, so blockish, (for of that ther's too little
cause to suspect him) but so slight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate,
as to put the very <hi>Latin</hi> words in
the Margin, which is, as neer as can be, to
contradict himself in the same breath.</p>
               <p>In four ensuing Chapters he delivers us
certain notes; which are in substance true,
but bring not much obscurity or other disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blement
to the way of proving Religion by
the writings of Fathers: and if they did,
he and his new party remembring they
wholly refuse the judgment of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
need not trouble themselvs; but
stand upon their exceptions, and leave the
Catholiks to make their arguments sound
and free from all legitimate repuls. For
this is the law of Logick and reasoning,
that the Actor should have liberty to
frame his opposition (so it be according
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47186:123"/>
to the rules of discourse) as himself thinks
best.</p>
               <p>With this <hi>caveat</hi> I might justly omit these
four Chapters; were it not that in his <hi>eighth</hi>
he has a note of remark out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as
requiring only that the Rule of Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in its proper form and order, <hi>Caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rùm,
manente formâ ejus in suo ordine, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
libet quaeras &amp; tractes, &amp; omnem libidinem
curiositatis effundas:</hi> to which he adds <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus</hi>
his Apology for <hi>Origen,</hi> as of the same
opinion; and seems to take it for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the present Church: And truly, I
think with great reason.</p>
               <p>For, as far as I understand Religion, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
makes an <hi>Heretick,</hi> but to recede from
the known doctrin of the <hi>present Church,</hi>
which she practises as deriv'd from Christ,
and wherof she knows no other beginning:
He that is not conscious to himself of this,
is no Heretick before God; and he that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that guilt in his breast is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
whatever seeming reasons he has for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
and whoever teaches any point contrary
to <hi>this tradition,</hi> not knowing such contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
teaches indeed <hi>Heresie,</hi> but is no <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick:</hi>
Let them agree in this chief Principle
or <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and the rest wil be only
material errours in them. But, the cause
they perversly defend is inconsistent with
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47186:124"/>
any such submission: their own Consciences
and the evidence of the fact stigmatising
their unlawful breach from the <hi>universal
doctrin of the Church,</hi> from which they rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liously
separated themselvs.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Fathers</hi> opinion, concerning the
necessity of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> for <hi>Infants,</hi> he must
give us leave to think the <hi>Council of Trent</hi>
was better informed then he; as is, in the
precedent <hi>Apologie</hi> briefly discussed. That,
St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> cals him a <hi>murderer of Christ who
fasts Saturdaies,</hi> signifies no more then that
he does an action which of its nature testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
our Saviour died twice, that is, upon
<hi>Saturday</hi> as wel as <hi>Friday:</hi> though this
man of truth in his first chapter vouchsafes
not to admit any writings of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>
for true. The aspersion laid upon St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>
St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> annd <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as using
Tragical expressions, without occasion, is
but a gap to Libertinage and vilifying of
vertue; their sayings being true, though
this Reformer dislike them.</p>
               <p>His urging, that the modern points of
Controversie are not resolv'd in former
<hi>Creeds</hi> or <hi>Councils,</hi> is of little importance:
for every one knows subsequent <hi>Councils</hi>
have alwaies been so far from thinking it
unlawful to add to the former, that such
additions are the very business and end of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47186:124"/>
their assembling: and yet (as the seventh
<hi>Council</hi> testify'd) they confirm'd all that
was either in Scripture or Tradition, by
binding us to these two pillars of truth.</p>
               <p>He is farther troubled, that divers Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
should out of St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s authority, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
the commands they finde have been
in use among their forefathers, to be institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
deriv'd from the Apostles: as if either
the Apostles might not have left divers cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
in divers places, for some practices
of less concernment; or that, in St. <hi>Hieroms</hi>
time, it was so hard to know when a custom
of importance started, if it began since the
Apostles, which could be scarce three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeers.</p>
               <p>In the last <hi>Chapter</hi> of his first Book he
thinks it impossible to know the belief of
the <hi>ancient Church,</hi> either universal or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
touching any point of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
now debated among us. And truly, as he
understands the question, he seems to have
some reason: for, he professes that all the
positive evidence out of Antiquity comes
short of satisfying him, unless we can make
good that no one did in those daies secretly
hold the contrary; a proof that certainly
none but a mad man would either expect of
another, or himself attempt.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, this he exacts of us, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47186:125"/>
therfore cites St. <hi>Hierom</hi> for the equality of
Priests and Bishops: though he writes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
against it, and the place he cites
clearly speaks of the confusion of the names
of <hi>Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Episcopus.</hi> Likewise, when
St. <hi>Hierom</hi> testify's some Bishops held with
<hi>Vigilantius,</hi> he thinks that sufficient to make
St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> side not universal: as if <hi>Bishops</hi>
could not be <hi>Hereticks.</hi> He adds, St. <hi>Hierom,</hi>
by his passionate speeches against <hi>Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
derogats from the authority of his
testimony. I believe him, if he speaks of
his own party, who are easily perswaded to
diminish the credit of Fathers: but not, if he
mean among Catholicks, who think the
modern Heretiks no better then <hi>Vigilantius</hi>
and his followers.</p>
               <p>Thus have we briefly pass'd over his first
Book.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="survey">
               <head>THE
SIXTH SURVEY. How the Authority of Fathers is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</head>
               <p>Yet these last five Chapters and the whole
next Book will put us to the pains of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47186:125"/>
explicating what Authority <hi>Catholiks</hi> give
the Fathers, towards decision of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies;
and how they are to argue out of them,
if they intend to conclude any opposite opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
an Heresy.</p>
               <p>To be as short and clear in this point as I
can; I shall begin with some propositions
wherin I believe, all sides agree. First, that
the Fathers, as particular Authors, might
erre; and no one's single testimony, how
eminent soever, is sufficient to make a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Verity,</hi> upon the sole account of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his judgment. Secondly, that seldom
or never, in any controversy, the <hi>Fathers,</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for one part, are so many, as to make
the doctrin deliver'd a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> out
of this precise reason that <hi>it is their opinion:</hi>
For, though their multitude should arrive to
the full sum of three hundred, yet it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not the number of <hi>Heretiks,</hi> nay, even
<hi>Heretik Bishops,</hi> who unanimously conspir'd
to oppose the Catholick Faith. If then, all
certainty of things contingent and fallible,
in their individuals, depend upon <hi>universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi>
and the number we discours of, though
great, yet consider'd in its own immediate
force, make but a particular: it cleerly
follows, No question can be evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
by the pure numerosity of produced
Fathers. Thus far I conceive both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47186:126"/>
are bound to consent.</p>
               <p>My third proposition therfore is, If a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
number of <hi>Fathers</hi> be sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the <hi>universality</hi> of an opinion in the
<hi>Church;</hi> how little soever that number be,
'tis strong enough to support an <hi>Article of
Faith:</hi> not because it is their opinion, but
the <hi>Churches;</hi> attested by them to be the
Faith of the Church, and by the Church to
be Christs. And thus remains declared
what Authority Catholiks attribute to the
<hi>Fathers</hi> in reference to deciding Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy's.</p>
               <p>The next point is, about the exercise of
this Authority: how a Catholick writer
may, by the testimony of <hi>Fathers,</hi> conclude
the general Faith of the Church, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
the <hi>infallibility</hi> of the point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted.
For which we must lay these
grounds. First, that it has always been the
nature of the <hi>Catholik Church,</hi> to decline
<hi>communion</hi> with those Churches she esteem'd
erroneons in any material point; as, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
Superstition, and the like, upon
which pretences, our modern presumers for
<hi>Reformation</hi> have separated themselvs from
the present Catholik Church: wherfore, if
there be convincing testimonies, that any
one particular Church (so known and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
that the neighbouring Provinces
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47186:126"/>
must needs take notice of its publick cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms)
embraces any doctrin or practice,
yet remains still peaceably in communion
with the <hi>Vniversal;</hi> 'tis therby convinc'd
the <hi>whole</hi> Catholick Church held the same
not to be Idolatrous, Superstitious, &amp;c. If
then the point be of such a nature, that one
part of the contradiction must necessarily
be receiv'd, and the other rejected, it unavoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
follows, the whole Church in that
Age was of the same judgment with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
one.</p>
               <p>Nor is the evidence of this proposition
built upon some scrap of an ancient Writer
mis-interpreted, as our Adversaries would
infer the contrary from three lines of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesippus;</hi>
but upon the essential notion of
the <hi>Church,</hi> which is to be the conserver
of Christs doctrin, upon the whole body
of Ecclesiastical History, which contains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but either the propagation of the faith
or the expulsion of those that would cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
it; And lastly, upon the universality
of Christian writers, whose profession and
businesse it has always been to instruct the
Church in the doctrin of Christ and oppose
all abuses that offer'd to insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
under the name of reformation, or
whatever other specious mask Heresy has
put on, to cover the ilfavordness of her face.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:47186:127"/>
And now we may safely proceed to the
second ground, that if the testimony of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
convince the quiet possession of any
doctrin in one age, it concludes the same of
all ages that are known to communicate
with it: which is, in effect, with all prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and subsequent Ages whom either that
acknowledges, or who acknowledg that for
their Teacher and Mistress. This conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
from the former principle is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that I may boldly, yet without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
infer, if we can prove one Age,
we prove all.</p>
               <p>But to make it plainer: let me borrow out
of our Adversaries ingenuity, that the same
doctrin has endur'd these thousand years;
which restrains our controversy only to the
first six hundred: and that common sense can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say Popery was rank in the sixth Age,
but it must have been well grown in the fifth;
which will still contract our strife, to the
compass of four hundred years: wherof,
three were undoubtedly acknowledg'd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and Mistresses of the fourth, and the
fourth of two or three following; one of
which is confest, to be universally over-run
with Popery. So that, we need no more
pains, but only to prove that some one Age
of the first six hundred years embrac'd any
doctrin (of a nature substantial and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47186:127"/>
as is above exprest) to convince all
the rest of the same belief: else the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
must shew the latter Age disavowing
the faith of their Ancestors, and anathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
it as heretical, and in the same or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
terms, as our late Reformers cry out
against the Catholik unity, or Catholicks
against their division. For, if the younger
Ages reverence and plead conformity with
the ancienter: 'tis impossible they should
have changed any doctrin of importance or
necessity.</p>
               <p>My third ground is, that when we speak
of the Faith of the <hi>Church,</hi> we intend not to
say, No single person may think otherwise
or be ignorant of it, and yet live bodily and
exteriourly in the communion of that
Church: but we speak of the professed and
publick belief of all, both Clergy and Laity
which meet at Gods service in such a
Church: As all that meet at <hi>Charanton</hi> are
supposed to agree in the Articles, which the
Kings Edicts permit to be held by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to Reformation; Yet I believe there
are few Englishmen who consent to all,
though they resort thither: So that, by this
position, it may stand with the general or
universal faith of one part of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
that some few maintain the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Judgment: By these three grounds,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47186:128"/>
you wil finde most of his doubts and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
difficulties, in the five last chapters,
taken away, and the possibility of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
a point out of the Fathers rendred
very apparent and practicable: wherfore
we have now a little leasure to shake out his
other bundle of Rags, and see whether we
can espy any thing, there, that may entangle
a weak Divine.</p>

            <div n="7" type="survey">
               <head>THE
SEVENTH SURVEY. Of the four first Chapters of his second
Book: wherin he pretends, The Fathers
gave wrong notions of the Faith of the
Church; and that they spake not like
Judges.</head>
               <p>THis Chapter he begins very modestly,
and says, the Fathers testimonies of the
Churches Faith are not alwaies true: His
first example is in that question, Whether
our soul comes by creation or from our
Parents; in which, St. <hi>Hierom</hi> brings the
verdict of the Churches against <hi>Ruffinus:</hi>
but 'tis evident, this objection fails, because
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47186:128"/>
we doubt not some one or few learned men
may hold against the <hi>tenet</hi> of the Church
they live in.</p>
               <p>His second exception he cites out of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes
Thessalon,</hi> whom he makes in his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,
say, the Church held Angels had
subtile and aery bodies; but in his margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Greek (a language few understand, and
so not many are like to discover his art)
there is no such thing: only this, that the
Church knows Angels to be <hi>intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
but not whither they are incorporeal
or have subtile bodies.</p>
               <p>His third instance is, where <hi>Petavius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> for saying, It was an
Apostolical Tradition to meet thrice a
week to communicate: I doubt wrongfully;
For what probability can there be, that
some Apostle should not have left such a
Custom in some <hi>Province,</hi> if it were on foot
in St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his time? besides, this <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius</hi>
is noted for an easie censurer of his
betters; nor does the matter deserve any
farther inspection.</p>
               <p>The next he borrows from the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
against <hi>Venerable Bede;</hi> and 'tis a
meer equivocation, upon the ambiguity of
this word <hi>fides:</hi> which may signifie an <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
perswasion,</hi> or a <hi>Traditional certitude;</hi>
in which last sense <hi>Petavius</hi> took it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47186:129"/>
                  <hi>Venerable Bede</hi> pronounced it in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>His second Chapter tels us, the <hi>Fathers</hi>
confess they are not to be believ'd upon
thsir own bare words. Where I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
my Reader, to observe, that, If
the Fathers he brings speak of one or
few, we acknowledge they are not to be
trusted on their word; and so, have no
controversie with him; But, if he would
make them speak of the whole Collection,
he cites nothing to the purpose; but all he
brings, reach no farther then the first sense;
and have no opposition with the saying of
others, who command us to follow the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
and even the words of our Ancestors.
He is offended with <hi>Sozomen,</hi> for saying,
None of the Ancients ever affirm'd, the
Son of God had any beginning of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
considering certain passages of
theirs, which yet himself has confessed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that St. <hi>Athanasius, Basil,</hi> and others
have cleared from any such sense.</p>
               <p>He calumniats an excellent place of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius
Lyrinensis,</hi> explicating what the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality
of Fathers means, and how their
sentence is of force. His first quarrel is, that
<hi>Lyrinensis</hi> requirs, they must have lived and
died both for doctrin and manners, in the
communion of the Catholik Church;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47186:129"/>
which, he says, cannot be known, unless
first we are sure their doctrin was sound:
Not seeing alas, that their living and dying
with reputation of Sanctity, gives them
this honourable prejudice, To be esteem'd,
both for life and doctrin, sincere and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suspected
Catholiks, til the contrary be
proved.</p>
               <p>His second quarrel is against the number
<hi>Lyrinensis</hi> assigns to be, al or the greatest part:
which certainly is meant of Authors then
extant, who had written in some age before
the controversie arose; wherof, such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
as may make us understand what was
the belief of that Age, is sufficient; all the
rest being <hi>ad abundantiam.</hi> For 'tis plain,
<hi>Lyrinensis</hi> held clearly the Catholik opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that <hi>the Church never perished;</hi> and
consequently, the Faith of one Age was,
with him, the faith of all. But, this good
guesser would perswade us no such evidence
can be had; and instead of proof, makes this
wild conjecture, that for ought he knows
the greatest part of the <hi>Fathers</hi> was of the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary
mind to those we have extant: which
is just such an argument, as if one should
suppose that were all the Roman Writers
extant, perhaps the greatest part would tel
us, <hi>Pompey</hi> overthrew <hi>Caesar,</hi> and that the
<hi>Roman Empire</hi> was alwaies after govern'd by
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47186:130"/>
a Senate and <hi>Tribuni plebis,</hi> til the <hi>Goths</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran
it.</p>
               <p>His third Exception is against those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
That the Fathers must have said or
testified such a truth clearly, often, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly;
which he thinks impossible to be
found: but let him leave that to the Actors.
He therfore rather chuses to fide with St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin:</hi>
but what says he? He tels <hi>Julian</hi> the
<hi>Pelagian, Puto tibi eam partem or bis sufficere
debere, in quâ primum Apostolorum suorum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit
Dominus gloriosissimo Martyrio coronari;</hi>
this, after he had cited the testimonies of
only Latin Fathers: But when he had cited
Fathers of both Churches, he argues thus:
<hi>Si Episcopalis Synodus ex toto orbe congregare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
mirum si tales possent illic facile tot sedere,
quia nec isti uno tempore fuerunt; sed fideles &amp;
multis excellentiores, paucos dispensatores suos
Deus per diversas aetates, temporum, locorumque
distantias, sicut ei placet atque expediri judicat,
ipse dispensat. Hos itaque de aliis atque aliis
temporibus atque Regionibus ob Oriente &amp; Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidente
congregatos vides, &amp;c.</hi> In which Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
St. <hi>Austin</hi> taking for a principle, that
the Writers in any age are ordinarily of the
most eminent for learning, and indeed of
so high a degree, that we cannot expect
many such at the same time, concludes the
consent of <hi>Fathers,</hi> which he had cited, more
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47186:130"/>
assured and satisfactory then a General
Council: Now, what apprehension he had
of a General Council, is wel known to
any, who has made a little acquaintance
with that Saints writings.</p>
               <p>Fain also would this pious man fix the
slander, upon <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis,</hi> of being
a <hi>Semi-Pelagian,</hi> out of far fetch'd surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
which I pardon him, because that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sits very hard upon his and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren-Separatists
skirts.</p>
               <p>In the ensuing chapter his pretence is to
shew the Fathers did not write like Judges
sitting upon a Bench to give sentence; a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
which neither any wil dispute with him,
nor is to his purpose: But, by the pursuit
it appears, he only rang'd about for an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to vilifie the Fathers, by citing or
publishing a catalogue of such weaknes as
he had espyd in them. The first he notes, is of
<hi>Hast</hi> they used in their works; the next some
mistakes in <hi>Chronology</hi> or <hi>History,</hi> wherof one
I cannot omit, because he lays it upon
them all generally, That <hi>Nilus</hi> was one of the
Rivers mention'd to water <hi>Paradise:</hi> against
which he cals for witnesse <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius;</hi>
the former of whom I cannot blame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
seeing he was not born to reverence the
<hi>Fathers;</hi> the other in this confirms the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
humour before spoken of in him:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:47186:131"/>
But, for the opinion it self, it is very true, as

Peripateticae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards he nibbles at their <hi>Philosophy</hi>
and <hi>Grammar;</hi> then, accuses their weak <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories;</hi>
lastly, quarrels with their <hi>Allegorical</hi>
explications. Surely, if he had found an
exact history of their lives, he would have
chid some of them for wanting good Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

not having learnt in the French Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

               <head>THE
EIGHTH SURVEY. Of the two last Chapters of his second
Book: wherein he says many Fathers
have agreed in the same Errours; and
objects certain vanities between the
Ancient and Modern Church.</head>
               <p>IN his <hi>fourth Chapter</hi> he proposes, that
the <hi>Fathers</hi> have not only err'd sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but whole Troops of them together:
which though it be nothing to the purpose,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47186:131"/>
as not touching the precise point controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
betwixt us, since the Fathers authority
is from their concurrence in <hi>attesting an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Belief as witnesses,</hi> and not in <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
their <hi>Judgment as Doctors;</hi> Yet has our
Gallant bestir'd himself notably in this
point, because his true intention was to
take all reverence from the Fathers, though
he cunningly with a smooth tongue profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the contrary. But he has another piece
of <hi>legier-de-main,</hi> very proper to abuse an
unwary Reader; For he neither distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
the quality of errours, whither in
Faith, Philosophy, or History, nor their
degree, and so makes the good silly people
of his Sect conceive, every mistake of any
Father an errour, and every errour a gross
one; knowing that, when he mentions the
word <hi>errour</hi> in relation to the Fathers, all
his <hi>Hugonots</hi> presently imagin it to be in
doctrin, and great enough to condemn and
forsake them. Besides, he never thinks of
explicating what <hi>many</hi> signify's in respect to
the number of the Fathers, so that, three or
four may pass with him for a multitude.</p>
               <p>Another jugling trick he has to cast any
shadow of words into such a posture, that
they seem clearly convinc'd of errour. As,
if a <hi>Father</hi> say, God governs the World by
Angels; he'l make it sound, as if God knew
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47186:132"/>
not what was done here below. Then, of
his own accord hee'l take for granted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
positions, as if they were confest er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
which are first to be proved such; as,
That some souls are kept in Receptacles till
the day of Judgment, &amp;c. The length of the
Chapter and its confusedness in not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
private errours from publick, and
the multitude of his mistakes, favourable to
his own side, deter me from spending my
time upon the fals proofs of a confessed, or
at least not controverted Conclusion:
For truly, if I would take the pains, I doubt
not to make appear, the greatest part of
them are as weak as malicious, towards the
scandalizing those great Persons he calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat's.</p>
               <p>But because St. <hi>Hierom</hi> is accounted by
the Sectaries their special friend, and one
that spares not to give them the truth home;
this grateful man in counterchange, spends
four whole leavs in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, as you
may understand by his general judgment
upon him: telling us that <hi>the cours he ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
uses in his disputations, is wresting the words
of his Adversarys quite besides the Authors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
and framing to himself such a sense as
is not at all to be found in them: and then fiercly
encountring this Gyant of his own making, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
withal base abusive Language and biting
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47186:133"/>
girds, and the like tart expressions borrow'd
from Prophane Authors, in which kind of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
he was indeed very excellent.</hi> Of this
modest censure he pretends no less then one
example for proof, and that far short of
justifying his bold imputation. The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
was that in a certain controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
St. <hi>Austin</hi> and him, he mistook at first
St. <hi>Austins</hi> meaning, from whence this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Interpreter suspects he never delt any
better with others; and after the sentence
so impudently pronounc'd, rely's upon this
bare suspition as a sufficient evidence.</p>
               <p>Then he proceeds to another game he
plays very much at, call'd calumny, and
charges the same <hi>Father</hi> first about Gods
knowing smal things: but it is apparent
out of the very citation that St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is not of speculative knowledg, but
particular providence, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>nunquid Deo cura est de bobus?</hi> His se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
instance contradicts his former; For
it is, that Saints are everywhere; which is
spoken of their knowledg, not corporal
presence: Christ, by whose company, they
are pretended to be everywhere, being so by
his sight and knowledg, not by his presence
corporally: Which this Friend saw was
contrary to the former, yet would not make
use of it to reconcile, but aggravate the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47186:134"/>
Thirdly he accuses him to say, that
the Souls of the blessed <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> are
subject to sin: but cites not a syllable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
for <hi>Angels,</hi> which so express'd, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable
truth, being no more then that
<hi>Angels</hi> by envy, became <hi>Divels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But his irreconcilable quarrel is against
<hi>marriage</hi> and what St. <hi>Hierom</hi> writes of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
respects to their families: that <hi>they did
not marry the second time,</hi> he interprets as
intended against <hi>marriage</hi> it self. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
as concerning the act of <hi>marriage</hi> or
appetite to it, he says more what is true,
then perhaps what is convenient to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
before Persons that should not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
from a thing so necessary in divers
cases, wherin the temperance, not use is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.
He goes on and now charges this
old severe Father with a scandalous doctrin
indeed, an intolerable heresy, wherin all true
Reform'd stomacks are fundamentally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd;
for he accuses him to say in express
terms that eating of flesh (a most wholsome
custome) was abolish'd by <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> but,
citing neither words nor place, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
drawing it in by a fals consequence,
makes me suspect it is an arrant forgery. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
he accuses him of saying oaths were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful:
but in truth the words of the very
<hi>Scripture</hi> are harder, then St. <hi>Hieroms.</hi> The
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47186:134"/>
next errour is, that he thought the validity
of consecration depended on the sanctity of
the Priest: but his words are so common
they easily receive explication. Again, he
is offended with him for denying faintly,
that the blessed eat in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Lastly, he accuses him of abusing St. <hi>Paul;</hi>
and first of contradicting him about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the <hi>Athenian Altar:</hi> because he
says there was more in the inscription, then
the <hi>Apostle</hi> mention'd; Secondly that he
said, he understood more then he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate.
Thirdly that to the <hi>Galathians</hi> he
spake ordinary discourses, because they
were not capable of higher. Of these three
the first had no harm in it, since all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists
do not cite the whole title of our
<hi>Saviours</hi> Cross, the two latter Dignify a
great commendation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> among wise
men and such as understand there is any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
learning besides well speaking.</p>
               <p>I must not pass without one word of <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus</hi>
too: because our Reformers account of
so fundamental a passage of his, in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the Canons of the Council of
<hi>Nice</hi> touching the Popes <hi>authority:</hi> And this
great Patron of theirs cals, him <hi>an arrant
wooden Statue; A pitiful thing; One that had
scarce any reaon</hi> in what he said, and yet
much less dexterity in defending himself.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47186:135"/>
Must not then what is grounded upon his
property and excellency of language, be a
perfect foundation for a point of faith? By
these you may guess how he has dealt with
others, which were too long to examin.</p>
               <p>Approaching to the end of his <hi>Chapter,</hi>
he specify's some errours unanimously held
by a just number of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> First, that
of the <hi>Chiliasts;</hi> an objection already ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered
in the former part of this discourse.
The second is, the reservation of souls from
heaven <hi>till the day of Judgment;</hi> which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
in a little Treatise entitled, <hi>De medio
animarum statu:</hi> The third concerns <hi>rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization
of Heteticks;</hi> which also is cleared
above: only I cannot forget how he would
insinuate that St. <hi>Basil</hi> held it, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
of the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> but his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the matter, by saying <hi>in a manner,</hi> shews
it is only a largess of his good will, and not
any evidence he brings. Next he urges
fiercly a point of <hi>Chronology;</hi> and then, the
<hi>Angels</hi> having <hi>bodies;</hi> and after that, the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
falling in love <hi>with women:</hi> three points
not very material. Then again, he repeats
the <hi>necessity</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> to <hi>Infants;</hi> but
brings in rather testimonies of the practice,
which is not in question, then of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
which is: And lastly, that all the
<hi>Greek Fathers</hi> and a great part of the Latins
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47186:135"/>
held Gods <hi>foresight</hi> of mens good and bad
<hi>works</hi> to be the cause of <hi>predestination;</hi> but his
authority depending only on modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
saying so, whose diligence in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their meanings is not known, it might
as wisely have been omitted.</p>
               <p>In this next <hi>Chapter,</hi> he intends to prove
that some <hi>Fathers</hi> have strongly maintain'd,
against others, some opinions in matters of
very great importance; which is but one
half of what follows from, or rather is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contain'd in, the conclusion of the
former Chapter, and therfore, not denyed
by us nor useful to him: which was the
cause why he would not there add (though
the place were very proper) that they defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
such opinions against the whole current
of others, and of the Church. But to make
a seeming new argument, he left out this,
and exprest himself generally, like a true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
that some defended against others:
and to give his discours the better relish, he
begins his antipast with calumniating <hi>Bessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi>
making him say that the Fathers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
never clash one against another, touching
the points of our Religion (for a Person so
learned could not be ignorant, that some er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
might be found in a <hi>Father</hi> against the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon consent of the rest:) But, his meaning
was, that not so many could dissent, as were
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47186:136"/>
able to make a party against the general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
judgment of the rest; neither does
our Informer seek to prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>In his first instance, if he had put in, that
<hi>Justin, Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> had held the
<hi>Millenary Heresy,</hi> against the communalty of
Christians of their Age, he had ruin'd his
own proof; which, nevertheless he might
have done out of <hi>Justinus,</hi> (as is declared)
and indeed was obliged to do, if he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to proceed pertinently. But what
should I pain my self in a question not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted?
Only I cannot omit a subtlety
he uses against St. <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Theodoret.</hi> St.
<hi>Cyril</hi> had said, <hi>The Holy Ghost was proper to
the Son. Theodoret</hi> distinguishes his words,
saying, if he means <hi>by proper proceeding as
well as the Son,</hi> or, <hi>of the same nature,</hi> so he
allows the saying: but, if he means that he
proceeded <hi>from or by the Son only</hi> (both which
terms were then in use; for this and nothing
els can be signify'd by <hi>proper</hi> added to <hi>from</hi>
or <hi>by)</hi> then he condemn'd St. <hi>Cyrils</hi> doctrin.
Now our sly Interpreter would make <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi>
condemn this saying, <hi>that the Holy
Ghost proceeded from the Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His last reason is one that makes all the
rest impertinent; and shews they were dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
only to vilify the <hi>Saints</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi>
whose Crown they are, and the <hi>Founder</hi> of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47186:136"/>
the Church, who glorify'd himself in Them
and Her: 'Tis, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and
Protestants agree in the position he seemed
to labour at so hard; what need or occasion
had he then to rave into the <hi>Fathers</hi> about a
point wherin there is not the least difference
among us?</p>
               <p>Next, he excepts at our Controvertists, for
alledging the <hi>Fathers</hi> against them; since we
know they receive not the Fathers. I ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
there is by nature planted in all honest
dispositions, such a respect to their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors;
that, though the malicious part of
their congregation, and this Sophister in
chief, cry down <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as loud as they
can, yet shal they never be able wholly to
root out of the hearts and consciences of the
generality of Christians, that esteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
which they naturally bear in their
Breasts towards the Fathers of Christianity;
So that our Controvertists cite writings of
those ancient and holy Doctors, not in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the ensoured and barbarous party
of Hereticks; but for their sakes, who yet
retain some spirits of goodness and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
humanity in them.</p>
               <p>Then he brings divers sayings of <hi>Moderns</hi>
to prove the Authorities of <hi>Fathers</hi> are not
irresistible, especially in the interpretation of
Scripture; among which one somthing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47186:137"/>
Afterwards, he reckons the varieties
betwixt the ancient and present Church;
some in Ceremonies, some in Disciplin, and
some, as he pretends, in Belief: these later
we have touch'd before; the two former,
for the most part, we make no difficulty to
acknowledge, since the prudential dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of such discretionary points fals cleerly
within the verge of the Churches juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>But here I particularly invite the Ey of
the serious Reader, to observe how malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
he corrupts the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in
two very considerable passages: one, where
he says, <hi>It anathematizes whoever shall deny
that Bishops are a higher Order then Priests:</hi>
wheras in the Latin (which himself has the
boldness to cite truly in the Margin) ther's
no such word to be found as <hi>Order;</hi> but
only that Bishops are <hi>superiores Presbyteris,</hi> a
phrase implying no necessiy at all of their
being several Orders; though in that word
consists the whole emphasis of his fals im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
               <p>His other abuse is yet more gross and
palpable, concerning our Ladies immaculate
Conception; for the Council expresly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their intention was not to meddle with
the Question, he says <hi>'tis impossible so to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
their words that they shall in plain terms
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47186:137"/>
give the ly to all the Fathers:</hi> and to render
this foul play the more plausible among
such as look not wel to his fingers, he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slates
<hi>in hoc decreto</hi> falsly and perversly <hi>in
this number,</hi> as if the Council had positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decreed the Blessed Virgin not to be in
the <hi>number</hi> of those who are born in origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sin; when their very words directly tel
him they on purpose resolv'd to prescind
from her particular Case, and not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
any thing concerning It in that <hi>Decree.</hi>
Certainly, had this man either face or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
an ordinary malice could never
have engag'd him into such a desperate ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity,
so notorious, that its practice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be unknown even to him, though he shut
his Eyes against the light; since all dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
upon this point unanimously agree,
that the Council intended wholy to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
from the question, and leave both sides
probable: nevertheless this shameless fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
dares, in such broad and unmannerly
language, not only slander a grave and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Council, but outface the whol Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
world. What trust can be given to
so bold a Jugler in matters either of less
moment or less evidence; when in a Case so
important, as the Decree of a Council, and
so palpably manifest, that all that can read
may easily discover the cheat, yet he blushes
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47186:138"/>
not to venter on't? can any thing be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in his defence, or any excuse made,
why he should not be accounted an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

NINTH SURVEY. In answer to two Questions, in his last
Chapter; One, the Fathers being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
to what Judg we ought to recur:
The other, what use is to be made of the
Fathers?</head>
               <p>ALl this while our new Edifyer of the
reform'd Temple has us'd only his
Sword-hand to keep off those dangerous
enemies the <hi>Fathers;</hi> now he begins to

antiquity with a little fine morter: Let's see
at least what work he makes; though we
have smal reason to expect any good buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from him that is not able so much as
to pull down.</p>
               <p>Thus, then, workman-like, he enters upon
his task; demanding of himself this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>the Fathers being rejected, where shall we
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47186:138"/>
now lay our foundation?</hi> to what Rule or
Judge must we have recourse? He answers,
<hi>To the Scripture;</hi> and if in any one place it
seem obscure, we must then seek out another
to clear it. Which first supposes, that for
all points necessary, there are some evident
and clearing Texts: But I must ask, on what
Authority he believes this? doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
declare it so plainly, that ther's no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
about it? He knows the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik
Church denys any such self-evident al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency
in Scripture. Did they, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
him and his Brethren the Bible, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it to them under this qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
No: for his party went out of the
Catholik Church, and receiv'd the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
from none but Her, who never taught
them any such lesson. Perhaps you'l say,
all other Christians testify'd the verity of
that book, and so upon their credit you are
the more induc'd to accept it. But those
Christians are such as your selvs generally
condemn: such as have been cast out, for
taking this very proposition, to justifie their
rebellion against <hi>Her,</hi> whom you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
then, to have been the true Owner and
Mistris of Christs Doctrin. Besides, any one
that has but half an Ey may see, no <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-disputation</hi>
with Heretiks was ever fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht,
without new reply's; but the <hi>Church</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:47186:139"/>
has alwaies been forc'd at last to condemn
them, upon the score of <hi>Tradition.</hi> Thus
you borrow'd this desperate device, from
those who in all ages were <hi>thrust out of the
same Church,</hi> for holding the very <hi>same prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But suppose there were some clear Texts
in our Controversies (as we think there are
in disfavour of you;) may they not be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
obscure by other places objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them; which we pretend you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to doe. If so, your remedy is worse
then the evil; and the comparing of divers
places is the very cause that makes all ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanceable,
indifferent and obscure. Are we
not now reduc'd to a hopeful condition of
living hereafter in a perpetual and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
unity of Religion: especially since
an hundred yeers experience sadly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
what we say to be true?</p>
               <p>Besides, why does not this good Orator
spend some time to shew us, that his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have not as much force against <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
as against the <hi>Fathers?</hi> I confess, he has
hinted it sometimes; like one that saw the
objection so obvious, it could not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten:
yet was unwilling to wade the
Ford, for fear he should find it too deep. To
supply therfore his omission, I shall observe
one considerable difference betwixt the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47186:139"/>
                  <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> as far as concerns
these objections. Which consists in this, that
the Fathers works are many and copious;
The Scriptures bulk every Maid can tell that
carry's her Mistresses Book to Church.
Whence it follows, that, as in a great Ocean
there may be many Shelvs and Rocks, and
Whirlpools, and whatever else is frightful
to Sea men, and yet nevertheless a fair and
large passage remain, either not at all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammaged
by these perillous adventures,
or only so, that they are easily avoyded by a
careful Pilot: wheras in a narrow Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
or Frith, if we meet but half the number,
there will be no sailing without manifest
danger; So I conceive between the <hi>Fathers</hi>
and the <hi>Scripture.</hi> Every exception this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viller
alledges (or at least provs) may be
true of their works, and yet more then suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
left to convince Hereticks: but if
Scripture be half as much disabled, it wil
utterly lose its Protestant, pretended power
of deciding controversys.</p>
               <p>A truth I believe <hi>Rushworth</hi> has abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demonstrated. For the <hi>variae lectiones</hi> are
so many that they trench upon every line;
the several <hi>Translations</hi> give some little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to every sentence; the many <hi>Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi>
leave nothing untouch'd; the <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons</hi>
of one place to another may be more
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:47186:140"/>
then there are words in the Text; the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
brought by one side and the other, so
short that <hi>Equivocation</hi> has force upon every
one; the <hi>Languages</hi> in which they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
either <hi>Hebrew,</hi> whose titles breed a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
or <hi>Greek</hi> written by strangers and full
of <hi>Improprieties;</hi> the <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Stile,</hi> the
many repetitions and occasionary discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
speak plainly the design of the Apostles
far different from intending their writings
should contain a full body of Religion,
much less to be the sole Judg to determin
all contentions about faith.</p>
               <p>Yes wil he say, but there are more objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against the Fathers then against the
Scripture. As that the writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for the first three Ages are few; I confess
it: but yet dare affirm, there is more of them
then the whole Scripture makes. That the
Fathers treat of matters different from our
controversy's; This is true, but so do the
Scriptures. That there are supposititious
works of the Fathers: Hereticks pretend the
same against our Scriptures. That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
speak according to others minds; But
the like is found in Scripture. And so go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on, it will easily appear, the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
or equivalent, might have bin made
against Scripture, if Mr. <hi>Rushworth</hi> had
thought them worthy the labour of setting
down.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:47186:140"/>
Now, when these Books are put into a
Vulgar language (as is necessary to them,
who pretend every one should be judge of
their belief out of Scripture, by being first
Judge of the sense of it, that is, of <hi>what is
Scripture,</hi> for the dead letter is nothing to
the purpose) can it be less then madnes, to
think of demonstrating a controverted po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
out of one or two places of Scripture?
And yet (as I have before noted) this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron</hi>
of <hi>Presbytery</hi> assures us, that we ought
to believe nothing in point of Religion,
but what we know to be certainly true;
which is evident, in his way, to be nothing
at all.</p>
               <p>At last his own good nature has perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to propose one profitable question,
What use is to be made of Fathers for deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Controversies? And his first resolution
is (in the design of his Book, conformable to
the fore-layd grounds) <hi>that we ought to read
them carefully and heedfully searching their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
for their opinions, and not for our own.</hi> A
wonderful wise conclusion; especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
he says, the Reader must endeavour
diligently to peruse them all. For my part,
I should advise my friend rather to take his
rest and sleep, then spend so much pains and
time to search out what others have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
which, when I have found, little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47186:141"/>
what twas, or whether I knew it or
no: this being the idlest and unworthiest sort
of study, to know what such or such books
say, without any farther end. Yet generally
this is the great learning these Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Divines glory in, not that they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
even at this, then their Adversaries, but
because they have no other: As if they had
forgotten there were any solid knowledg
to be sought after; but, being blown like a
thin empty glass into the windy substance
of words, hang in the air, not having
weight enough to settle upon firm ground.</p>
               <p>At least to maintain, the <hi>Fathers</hi> are not
altogether vain and useless, he will teach
us to argue <hi>negatively</hi> out of their writings;
as that such a position is not found in the
Fathers, <hi>Ergo</hi> not necessary to be believ'd:
and by this to reduce our Faith to that
number of Articles, which they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monsly
deliver. But he has forgot his own
arguments: for since we have so few of their
works, how can we tel the greater part
did not teach somwhat necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
which these have omitted? since cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
enter'd into the Church immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the Apostles decease; why may not
some considerable point be strangled in its
infancy? since the Fathers are so hard to be
understood; why may there not be many
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47186:141"/>
doctrins of importance, which we find not
for want of quickness of sight to discover
them? and since they oppose one another
in so many things, why may not, at least
some one of these be a fundamental Article
of Faith?</p>
               <p>I cannot give over this discours concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the testimony of the Fathers, without
first observing a notorious cheat of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary's,
and too great an easiness in our
own party: which once discover'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
understood, makes our cause so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that in my opinion there will be left
no possibility of disputing about Antiquity.
The business is this, Wheras their breach
from the old Religion is so apparent and
visible, ther's not the least colour to doubt
it; we let our selvs by their cunning be
drawn into dark and petty questions: and
so lose the face of Antiquity, by disputing
of some nice point. As for example; when
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> has ruin'd the whole fabrick
of the ancient Church by taking away Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Authority; instead of questioning
them for so palpable an innovation, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily
suffer our selvs to be engag'd into
the discussion of this partieular <hi>quaere; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishops be de jure divino?</hi> which cannot
be determin'd by the vast body of Antiquity
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47186:142"/>
(as the right and proper question may, to
wit, <hi>what is the true government of the Church?)</hi>
but by minute canvasing of private Texts,
which is a far more difficult and altogether
unnecessary method.</p>
               <p>Just so it happens in almost all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy's.
For no doubt but Decision of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith was anciently perform'd in
<hi>Councils,</hi> if the scandal grew so high as to
force such general meetings: These, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
absolutely renounce, preferring their
private conceits before the judgment of all
the Bishops in the world; and then, if you
press them with the palpable absurdity of so
insolent and destructive a tenet, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
cast a figure, and, instead of handling
the plain duty of obedience to the supream
Ecclesiastical Authority, transform the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
into a meer speculative subtlety as,
<hi>Wherin consists the infallibility of Councils?</hi>
For the <hi>Mass,</hi> our Reformers take it quite
away, everywhere breaking down the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
and abolishing the whole Glory of
Gods service, which is unquestionably an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;
so many Liturgy's to this day, and
the general practice of the Church stil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing:
This done, they wil dispute of the
antiquity of the word <hi>Missa</hi> or <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatio.</hi>
For the Popes authority, they at one
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47186:142"/>
stroak cut a pieces the ligue and common
bond of Christianity in the unity of one
head, and force us to wrangle, either about
his <hi>infallibility,</hi> or whether his power of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals</hi>
be from Church-Laws or Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
and the like. They blot out the
memories of <hi>Martyrs</hi> both in their solemn
Feasts and Tombs: things undisputable in
the glorious flourishing of the Church: and
quarrel about what honour is due to their
Lives, Reliques and Pictures. They dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the publick practice of <hi>praying for the
dead,</hi> everywhere frequented, they deny the
universal profession of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> in all ages
avow'd, and then turn their exception up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>How</hi> and <hi>When</hi> our prayers obtain their
effect. They pul down <hi>Monasteries</hi> and <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery's,</hi>
and abandon the extraordinary and
exemplary way of holy life, which no impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
can deny to have been practis'd all the
time the Church it self has bin publick; and
then dispute, whether St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> or the
<hi>Esseni</hi> were Religious men or no, or when
<hi>Vows</hi> came first in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hypocrits!</hi> if you reverence <hi>Antiquity,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the face of Antiquity. If you truly
honour <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> and his <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
life,</hi> and any thing but an Ear-itch to
be claw'd by the phrase of <hi>Scripture,</hi> embrace
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47186:143"/>
what has been Christian life from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
If not, fill up the measure of your <hi>first
Reformers</hi> till the Judgments of God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
you and make you pay the whol recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
for theirs and your own dissembling.</p>
               <p>I fear I have already wearied the patience
of my Reader, I am sure I have long since
quite tir'd my own: being unwillingly
drawn by the many turns and windings of
the subtle Fox I pursue, far beyond the cours
intended at the beginning. To conclude
then at last: I doubt not but he, who has not
perus'd Mr. <hi>Daille</hi>'s Book, will nevertheless,
out of what I say, see plainly those Noble
Lords, whose <hi>Elogies</hi> are posted before it,
had great reason highly to esteem him. For
truly his nimble <hi>Wit,</hi> his exact <hi>Method,</hi> his
polite <hi>Style,</hi> his interlarding all with poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and bitter Jeers, his knowledg in
<hi>Greek,</hi> his cunning in <hi>Topicks</hi> (of all which
those eminent Wits were perfect Judges,
being qualities themselvs were excellently
endow'd with) could not chuse but draw
extraordinary praises from those eloquent
Pens; whose Masters had not the leasure, by
tedious turning over Books and deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon the occasion of the cited pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to ponder the weight of the proofs, or
