         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </hi> Here present you with a Catalogue or Black Bill of the Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, and Practices of the Sectaries of this time, broached and acted within these four last years in <hi>England,</hi> and that in your Quarters, and in places under your Government and Power, for which I tremble to thinke lest the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom should be in Gods Black Bill: I much fear lest the subject matter of this Catalogue may prove unto <hi>England</hi> (unlesse some speedy and effectuall course be taken to prevent it) like the Bill of Divorce given to <hi>Israel; Jer. 3.8.</hi> like the Roll of the Book commanded from God to be written by <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> against <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah, Jer. 36.2.</hi> like the Roll of a Book sent by a hand to <hi>Ezekiel, Ezek. 2.9, 10.</hi> wherin was written, lamentations, mourning and wo; or like the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing upon the wall against <hi>Belshaz.

And I humbly pray your Honours to beare with me in my addresses this way, as having no other meanes but this, of acquainting You with the sad state of things in our Church: And yet 'tis necessary You should hear of these things, for as 'tis said in the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> concerning the making of that Roll, <hi>It may be the house of Judah will hear all the evill which I purpose to do to them, that they may turne every one from his evill way, it may be they will

And now, Noble and worthy Senatours, be graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to pardon the boldnesse I shall take in dealing plainly with you in this present Epistle, and not to impute it to any malignity and disaffection to your service, or to peremptory saucinesse, and disrespect of You, (for besides that some worthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament to whom I am known can testifie the contrary, all my Actions from the beginning of Your sitting, my Sermons, Prayers, Prayses, Discourses, Actings for You speak otherwise: I am one who out of choise and judgement have imbarked my self with Wife, Children, Estate, and all that's dear to me in the same ship with You, to sinke and perish, or to come safe to land with You, and that in the most doubtfull and difficult times, not only early in the first beginning of the war and troubles, in a malignant place among Courtiers, and those who were servants and had relations to the King, Queen and their Children, pleading Your Cause, justifying Your wars, satisfying many that scrupled: but when Your affairs were at lowest, and the chance of war against You, and some of the Grandees and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of these times were packing up, and ready to be gone, I was then highest and most zealous for You, preaching, praying, stirring up the people to stand for you by going out in person, lending of money, in the later going before them by example; And as I have been your Honours most devoted servant so am I still yours, and you cannot easily lose me; and I do humbly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

You have put down Saints dayes: and we have many make nothing at all of the Lords dayes, and Fast dayes. You have taken away the superfluous excessive maintenance of the Bishops, Deanes: and we have many take away and cry down the necessary maintenance of the Ministers. In the Bishops dayes we had singing of Psalmes taken away in some places, conceived prayer, preaching, and in their room, Anthems, stinted forms and reading brought in; and now we have singing of Psalms spoken against and cast out of some Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yea all publike prayer questioned, and all ministeriall preaching denyed.

will be found to be now in use in behalfe of the Sectaries against Presbyterians; and if you be but pleased to review your own Remonstrances, either in former, or in this present Parliament, or remember the maximes and grounds you proceeded upon in questioning many, and by what rules you judged of intentions to overthrow the Protestant Religion, and to advance Popery, Armianisme, and then look upon the Proceedings of some, you will finde the same steps trod in now, and the same course taken in favour of the sects: (But an Epistle is too narrow a compasse to particularize all things of this kinde, and a word is enough to the wise) And yet I do not say Your Honours have done these things; for there are matters of this nature you hear not of, and upon complaints of things that have come immediatly to Your Houses, there hath been some redresse; yet such things are done by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, or Persons under Your Power and Government, and no effectuall wayes taken to prevent, discover or remedy these things. Now I humbly submit to Your deep judgment, whether God account not men guilty of that which is committed by others under them, they having power to hinder it; as also, whether it will not be interpreted by men, that there is certainly great countenance and favour above, or else persons below dare not do as they do.

                  <p>The sects have been growing upon us ever since the first year of Your sitting, and have every year increased more and more; things have been bad a great while, but this last year they are grown intolerable; and if Schisme, Herosie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be let alone and rise proportionably for one year longer, we shall need no Cavaliers nor enemies from without to destroy us. Certainly God looks for other manner of fruit from you; the great Deliverances, Victories, Successes, the solemn Covenant, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, Remonstrances, Declarations made to God, this Kingdom, the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all the Reformed Churches, call and speak for other kinds of
<pb facs="tcp:99332:6"/>
things. The Reformed Churches abroad wonder at these things, and say, Why may not the King as lawfully tolerate Papists, one false Religion, as the Parliament suffer all sects to grow? Besides their love, zeal and prayers for you begins to languish and grow faint. Our dear Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> stand amazed and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and had they not seen these things, could not have beleeved them. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, godly considerable party, both Ministers and people in City and Country, by whose means under God, you are now so strong and lifted up above your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, are grieved, offended, and much discouraged; the common enemy scornes, blasphemes, and reproaches the Reformation, looking upon us as given up to a spirit of giddinesse and errour. The Malignants every where turne Sectaries and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, siding with them and pleading their cause; and they do wisely, there being no such way as that to save their purses, live quietly, and to undermine you and effect the enemies work. And what can think you will be issue of these things? It is high time therfore for your Honours to awake and be doing, to suffer no longer these Sects and Schismes, these disorders and confusions that are in the midst of us, but to fall upon some effectuall wayes, as you in your great wisdomes shall finde out, and to do something worthy a Parliament in this kinde also. Do this and God is on your right hand to helpe you, and you shall not be removed for ever, the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Reformed Churches, this great City with the Ministers to stand by you and to honour you: Do it not, but let things still run on thus, and all kinde of errours, confusions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> increase, and know God is a righteous God, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it at your hands, visit and be avenged for these things. And let no man flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you with your great prosperity and successe, that your mountain is now so strong that you shall never be moved; but remember that God is a God <hi>changing the times and seasons, that removes Kings and sets up Kings, Dan. 2.21.</hi> that can quickly bring down that part of the wheel below which was highest, that made a sudden change to <hi>Belshazzar</hi> in an hour, <hi>Dan. 5.3, 4, 5, 6.</hi> That God who is said to scatter Kings, can scatter you: <hi>Psal. 68.14.</hi> Look upon the Court party, the great Counsellours of state, and Prelates, whose height was like the height of the Cedars, and were strong as the Oaks, yet the Lord destroyed their fruit from above, and their root from beneath; and cannot he do so to you? I beseech you fear, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great dishonour of God and his name, and the sad estate of things under your Goverment, lest God bring some great afterclap upon you, and have an after reckoning, either giving you up at last to the hands of those that are now in armes against you, or sending an evill spirit of division among your selves and the two Nations, or making use of the Sects (that party when grown stronger, who have been so much suffered to grow under you,) to become thorns in your sides, and pricks in your eyes, to cast You out, and to teach you new Law and new Divinity, as they have done already in many of their Books (as <hi>Englands Birthright, A Letter
<pb facs="tcp:99332:7"/>
from an Utter Barrester,</hi> A Letter call'd <hi>Englands lamentable slavery, Lilburns</hi> Letters to <hi>Mr Prynn,</hi> to a Friend, <hi>Innocency and truth justified, cum multis alijs,</hi>) or by sending some other judgement, as the Pestilence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (all which I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly pray God to prevent.) And truly when I think of things by my self, and behold to what a height Errours, Heresies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are come, and withall reflect upon the great things God hath done for you, the many powerfull Sermons you have had preached before you about the Nationall Covenant, and against the Sects, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Petitions representing the evill and danger of these things, and yet how little is done, our evills of this kinde rising higher and higher, in the increase of false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and a greater multiplication of schismes every day then other; I tremble for fear, lest for the want of zeal in suffering so many dishonours of God, and his House to lie so long waste, the word be gone out of his mouth already which he spake against <hi>Eli; I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy Father should walke before me for ever: but now the Lord saith; Be it far from me, for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</hi> But to draw towards a conclusion, there is no other way to prevent all this wrath, but to be zealous and repent, to do something speedily and effectually against the Errours, Heresies, Schismes, Blasphemies and confusions of these times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But if any shall object, It cannot be done now, it will discontent and disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Sectaries who are a considerable party, and so may prove dangerous to the Parliament in this juncture of time, by causing many to fall off their Service.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Are we afraid of discontenting, disingaging and losing a few men, and not discontenting and losing God! shall God be displeased to please men! shall we fear the want of mans helpe whose breath is in his nostrils, and not fear God! O that we would once cease from man, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I Answer, This objection is taking counsell, but not of God; a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but not of Gods spirit; <hi>Isa. 30.1.</hi> this carnall policie of suffering corruptions in Religion for fear of losing a party, and strengthening Kingdoms, hath proved the ruin of families and Kingdoms; be pleased to remember <hi>Jeroboam, Jehu,</hi> &amp;c. who out of policie for fear of losing a party and strengthening the other side, set up and suffered the golden Calves and Priests of the lowest of people, and this very thing became a snare, and the losse of the Kingdom to them; and I might shew out of Ecclesiasticall Histories many examples of sad things befalling Princes, who out of policies or any carnall respects, have suffered all sorts of Sects and Heresies; but I will only instance in one out of<note n="*" place="margin">

Secondly, Notwithstanding all this, they have gon on in their work and way, with constancie and heroick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, triumphing and rejoycing in their sufferings, rather rising higher, and growing more bold, then being moved or discouraged: of both these I will give some instances: Christ the chief Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, for speaking

                  <p>Secondly, I do not undertake nor professe in this Catalogue and Discovery, to give a full Catalogue and perfect enumeration of all the erroneous Opinions, Blasphemies and Practises of the Sectaries within these four last yeers, so as no more can be added to them; I make no doubt, but many a Reader may say, this Catalogue wants such an opinion that he knows of, and such an opinion, but only speaks of many of them, and of some principall; and therefore in the Title of this Discourse, I call it a Catalogue of many Errours, (I do not say of all:) It cannot rationally be imagined, that one man residing constantly in one place, not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to the Armies, nor up and down from Country to Country, having his hands full of preaching, and writing Controversies, can come to the knowledge of all Errours broached in all places, or can have time to read over exactly all the Sectaries, to extr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, My intent in this work, is not to make a formall confutation of these Errours and Opinions; I designed not that when I first resolved the thing (that would be a long and great work, and not make good my present ends,) I hope the naming of them will be a sufficient confutation, especially with the Animadversions, Observations, and Corallaries hereunto adjoyned: I have been a faithfull gatherer together and storer up, Remembrancer and Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of these Errours and Practices for the good of the publike, that I might in a fit season bring out of my treasure these things, and discover these monsters and rocks, that so they might be of some use to godly people, to make them afraid of forsaking the publike Assemblies, and joyning to separated Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches where these monsters daily breed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I here give the Reader a Synopsis of Sectarisme, and have drawn as is were into one Table, and do present at one view, the Errours and strange opinions scattered up and down, and vented in many Books, Manuscripts, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, conferences, &amp;c. and have disposed them under certain heads, and put them into their proper places, in a methodicall way for memories sake, that the Reader may the more easily find them. The Reader cannot imagine I found them thus methodized and laid together, but confused and divided, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99332:14"/>
far asunder, one or two in one book, some in another; others in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript, others in that; this errour vented at such a private meeting, that errour in such a Sermon, this opinion at such a conference: For many of these opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the very same opinions and errours are maintained and held over and over in severall books and manuscripts, so that to have given them the Reader as I found them, would have been to have brought the Reader into a wildernesse, and to have presented to publick view a rude and undigested Chaos, with an heap of Tautologies, all which are carefully declined in this following discourse, by joyning in one things divided and scattered; by relating but once one and the same errour and practice, and by forbearing to lead the Reader thorow woods, and over the mountains; and in stead of that, carrying him directly and presently to the bird in the nest.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I lay down the opinions and errours <hi>in terminis,</hi> and in their owne words and phrases syllabically, as neer as possible can be, or I can remember them; and that as themselves have expressed them in books, manuscripts, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, conferences, which either are extant of their own setting forth, or set forth by other learned godly men in print, or as I have received them from credible sufficient witnesses. I doe not in this Catalogue and Discovery alter the phrases and words of the Sectaries, giving you their sense in other expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; nor set down a Relation of their opinions by consequences and dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, imputing that to them which by consequences may be drawn (for I hold that an unjust way of dealing with men, though in errours); <note n="a" place="margin">Sentent.

                  <p>Sixthly, For the proof and manifestation of the truth and reality of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, blasphemies and practices contained in this present Tractate, that the Reader may not rest upon my bare assertion and relation of them, but may have other grounds of satisfaction for their belief, and so be more affected with them, I propound these following particulars as grounds of proof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That for divers of the opinions, errours and practices related, there is such
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99332:14"/>
a notoriety of them, being so notoriously known to thousands, and maintained by thousands, every day and every place witnessing the truth of them; that to quote books written and sermons preached for them, or persons holding them, is to lose time; and when all is alledged that can be, 'tis far beneath the evidences that the mentioning of the things themselves give.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Many errours and blasphemies contained in this following Catalogue have been complained of, and particulars given in by sufficient persons to the Parliament, Committees of Parliament, Assembly of Divines, and others in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, of which errours I have had either perfect copies given me from Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters both of the Assembly and City, or relations from their mouths who have known particularly the story and truth of them, which copies I keep by mee to produce if need be, and out of which (amongst many other papers and books) I made up this Catalogue.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some of the errours, blasphemies and practices are proved and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in the narration of the Stories and Letters following the Catalogue: wherein the naming of some persons, places, occasions of writing, the persons writ unto, their writing in a publick way, and not in a private manner, the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse to have them published, with many other concurrent circumstances, do declare they are not feigned nor counterfeited, but reall and certain.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Of some of these errours and practices here related, I my self, and other persons of good note and quality, have at the same time together been ear-witnesses and eye-witnesses upon the places.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Other of these errours and opinions are in divers printed books, either of the Sectaries themselves, or of persons of note and worth for learning and piety, who either after conferences with them, or hearing them preach, upon certain knowledge have printed and attested them to the world; diverse of which printed books, especially those made by the Sectaries, I quote upon the margent by the errours.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For any of the errours, blasphemies put in this following Catalogue, which have come to my knowledge by none of the former five wayes above specified (which yet are not many) I have had the relation of them from godly Ministers, and understanding conscientious Christians, with many circumstances of names, places, conditions, time, and confident asseverations of the certainty of them, the relations coming to me by providence, and occasionally spoken of in the hearing of others as well as my selfe, and so delivered as there can be no reason in the world to think they should be false, but much every way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them true. And that the Reader may the more build upon the truth of all things delivered in this Book; besides that account I have given him alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in these six particulars, I shall acquaint the Reader with the course and way
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99332:15"/>
I have taken to come to the truth of things, and not to go upon hearsay. When any things of this nature have been related to me, though by persons of worth and conscience, I have used to enquire of them, whether they were ear-witnesses or no; if not ear-witnesses, who they had the reports from, and how they came to know them, and where, and by whom, and upon what occasion these points were delivered? if they said they were ear and eye witnesses, yet if there were but one single witnesse, I have used to question, who else was present? and to enquire after circumstances and occasions, and accordingly have gone to other persons named, from one to another, to find out the bottome and truth both of Opinions held, and practises used; where I could with wisdome and probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity go to finde out and know the truth, I have done it myself; and where my appearing might hinder the discovery, and cause persons to be shie and more reserved, I have set others to enquire, and directed them the way, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them to aske such and such questions, and after particular enquiry, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to concurrence of circumstances and witnesses, I have entertained such things for truth, or else received them as false, or suspended them as doubtfull, not to be asserted: and that I might be the more faithfull Relator of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and wayes of the Sectaries of this time, and know when and where to put more or lesse weight or credit upon informations and relations, I have a long time used to write down daily the same day, yea the same hour (when I could get opportunty of privacie) the occurrences both of opinions and practises that concern our Sectaries, and that in such manner and way, that looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my papers a yeer after, I can judge of what authority the relations are: and accordingly I have forborn to put into this Catalogue of Errours, some strange Opinions I have heard of from good hands (though they may be true) because I have not had the opportunity to meet with, and further to enquire of some persons concerning their truth; and because some whom I have enquired of, could give me no further satisfaction. I have taken this way, to satisfie the Reader, rather then all along in the severall Errours, Blasphemies and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to lay down the particular proofs; which I think the better way upon these following reasons. 1. Because in many of the Errours, even contained under one and the same head, the proofs to be given of the truth of the thing doth arise many wayes, from printed Books, from Manuscripts, from Sermons, from preaching in private houses, from Articles given in by witnesses, and from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers relations; now to quote all these, with all particular circumstances of time, place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby to make out a full proof, would be an endlesse work, and be so long and tedious, that it would crosse one of my ends in this work, which is to have this Discourse but short, a Manuall that might be for every ones reading. 2. Because some of these Errours and Opinions can be proved
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99332:15"/>
only from Manuscripts, and relations of honest persons, who were ear witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which Manuscripts are but in the hands of a few, unknown to most of the Readers; and to make references to them, by quoting them in the margent, the Reader were never the neerer, and then every man is not willing to be named in Print, neither may I lawfully do it without their knowledge and leave; besides, that were the way for the future, to deprive my self of the knowledge of many opinions and practises, if I should print the names of every one that hath impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted intelligence to me. 3. In this Catalogue of Errours, under one and the same Errour (which for number I make but one, that I might not seem needlesly to multiply Errours, and that I might contract things) yet under that one Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, teere are more branches, it may be two or three; now though one part or branch of such an Errour as the former part is expresly set down in Books that are in many hands, yet other branches are not, but only have been expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by word of mouth: Now in such a case to quote Books, speaking but to one part and not to the whole, might question my faithfulnesse in all other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: unto these I could adde more, but these may suffice.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Yet further to satisfie the Reader of the truth of things contained in this present Treatise, and to stop the mouths of Sectaries, who will be ready to put off all, by giving out, that this Book is full of lies and fables, I do here offer (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that some exemplary punishment may passe upon some of the prime Seducers and heads of these Sects, and some effectuall course taken for the future, to remedy and suppresse these Errours) to make a legall proof by witnesses, and other concurrent circumstances of the most notorious and grossest matters (which may of all others seem most questionable) whether Errours, Blasphemies or Practices set down in this following Catalogue.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, I premise this for the Christian Reader to remember, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting mistakes in this work, that though I set down and joyn together all the following opinions in one Catalogue, because they all agree in <hi>uno tertio</hi> in that common notion of Errour, yea all agree in Independency, and in forsaking the communion of the Reformed Churches: yet I am far from thinking them all alike. A Scholar that makes a Catalogue of Books, writes down <hi>Decimo sextos</hi> as well as <hi>Folios</hi> in it, because they be all Books, and yet puts a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the one and the other; so do I notwithstanding I put them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All the Errours reckoned up are not of the first magnitude, nor in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est form; some are fundamentall Errours, overthrowing the foundation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, many by consequence and deduction; others are superstructures, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the foundation hay, straw and stubble: I put a wide difference between a simple pure Independent, yea a simple Anabaptist, who only holds that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of denying Poedobaptisme, and between an Arian, Antitrinitarian, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripturist,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99332:16"/>
Perfectist: Again, I put a difference between erroneous persons that erre out of ignorance, weaknesse, and are seduced, following those opinions in simplicity of heart (as some people did <hi>Absolom</hi>) and are peaceable keeping their opinions also to themselves and such persons as are wilful seducers, the heads and leaders of Faction, who make it their work to disturb the peace of the Church, and to subvert souls. In all this discourse I desire to think of <hi>Iude</hi> 22.23. <hi>And of some have compassion, making a difference; and others save with fear, pulling them, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, I desire to forewarn the Christian Reader, and do earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him for his own good, that he be not offended, nor hindred from beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth, and laying to heart the particulars laid down in this ensuing Treatise, no not by all the clamours, reproaches that may be cast upon my Book and person: It cannot be expected, but that Satan and the Sectaries will make it their work, by all wayes possible to blast this Book, to keep from reading and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving it, as they used all wayes to reproach my last Book, and to keep Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans all they could from reading it: Blind and erroneous zeal is violent and what it wants in arguments, it will make up in clamours, lyes, and speaking all manner of evil falsly of them that discover &amp; lay it open, as <note n="a" place="margin">Mundus non potest fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ut sua damuentur: Igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ex omni parte odia, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidiae, calumniae, maledicta congeruntur ad opprimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam hanc doctrioam &amp; edoctores hos.</note> 
                     <hi>Luther</hi> speaks; the world cannot bear that the things of it should be condemned, therefore from every part hatreds, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, calumnies, evill speakings are heaped to oppresse that Doctrine, and those Teachers who oppose it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them speak evill as long as they will, and give out 'tis a railing lying peece; yet let me speak to the Reader, as the Apostle doth, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>That no man should be moved by these afflictions, for we told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we should suffer tribulation, even as its come to passe, and ye know</hi>: so now I tell you before, that when you hear of all kind of reproaches, ye may not be offended, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.1.</p>
                  <p>Now the second particular under this first generall head, is to remove two stumbling blocks out of the way, to give an answer to two objections that may be made against this present work.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Object.</hi> It may be some will object and say; It is not seasonable nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to discover our nakednesse and weaknesse so far to the common enemy, it were better concealed, the enemy will make an advantage of it: <hi>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</hi> 2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The prevailing of Heresies and Sects among us, is not now to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and published to the world: It hath not been all this time kept within our own walls, and known only to our selves, but hath been a long time known abroad, and at home, and hath been declared by divers others, both in writing

and preaching before now: so that I shall not divulge any secret to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy: all that I do is but to draw them into one, that we may see them as it were at once: our Errours and Schisms are spoken of far and near by ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and friends. How many Sermons have been preached before the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houses of Parliament, and in other publike places speaking of the Errours of the time, which have been also printed long since by command of Authority, and exposed to the view of all?

                  <p>Secondly supposing our errours to be known, which is fully proved in any first Answer, I then secondly say, 'tis so farre from being unseasonable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, that 'tis most necessary, that some Ministers, who are friends to the Reformation, and zealots for the Parliament, should lay them open to the full, by testifying against them and disclaiming them, that so our enemies may not say, wee favour and countenance them; and one of my great ends in this Tractate, is to take away occasion from the common enemy to blaspheme the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and speak ill of the Parliament, by our not owning them, but speaking as much against heresie, schisme and all errours as any of them can.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I answer, we should be so farre from being afraid to give the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy advantage, by speaking against heresies and errours, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary I may say, we have no such enemies, as those persons, that broach and spread their heresies and damnable opinions: these are our enemies which wee have cause to fear more then all the Cavaliers, these are the <hi>Achans,</hi> the accursed persons, and things which are most likely to undo us; and if ever the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and their party be ruined (which God prevent) it will not be so much by the Cavaliers, they could not have done it, but the heresies, blasphemies and schimes of some among our selves will cause it; and therefore the finding of these out, and labouring to have these removed, is a work of great importance to the saving of the Kingdom, and of great prejudice to the common enemy, whose hopes and confidence are much more placed in our heresies, prodigious opinions and schismes, then in their own strength.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 4. I may justifie the ranking and joyning of Independents with other sectaries, not only because all the sectaries though never so vild, are Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, agreeing in that opinion of Independencie; as also all the sectaries, the worst of them (even those who deny the Scriptures, the Divinity of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) do separate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> refusing communion with her in the Sacraments and other Ordinances as the Independents do, but because the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents do joyn themselves with the other sectaries adhering to them, and to this day have never stood as a divided party from them, but upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions have and do make one common body with them, to hold together against the Orthodox and Presbyterians: I am able to give many instances of many of the Independents, both Ministers and people, pleading for the Anabaptists, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians and other sectaries, that they might be tolerated as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and upon all occasions of complaints against severall sects, siding with them to bring them off; yea, their joyning together in choise of Burgesses for Parliament, and in divers other matters against the Presbyterians; as also in closing together in Church-fellowship, Independent Churches admitting of and continuing Anabaptists, Antinomians to be members; besides not censuring vild sectaries (as Seekers) who have fallen from their Churches: so that I do the Independents no wrong to put them in the same Catalogue with other sectaries, themselves having in so many particulars gone hand in hand with them: but that which is the fullest demonstration of all other, is this, The secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being now hot upon the getting of a Toleration, there were some meetings lately in the City, wherein some persons of the severall sects, some Seekers, some Anabaptists, some Antinomians, some Brownists, some Independents met; some Presbyterians also met with them, upon their desire the better to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what they would have; the intent of which meeting was, to consider how all these might have the liberty to their way and practice in this Kingdom, and to perswade the Presbyterians to be willing to it, and to helpe to effect it for them: now the result of these meetings was, that all these severall sects were agreed and held together for pretended liberty of conscience, the Independents as well as the others holding together with the rest of the sects, as buckle and thong; some professing at one of the meetings, it was the sin of this Kingdom that the Jewes were not allowed the open profession and exercise of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion amongst us; only the Presbyterians dissented and opposed it. And much about the same time that this meeting was in <hi>London,</hi> in another place some of the best of the Independents, were not ashamed to move for a Toleration, not only for themselves, but all other of the sects that agreed in fundamentals against Popery.</p>

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:99332:18"/>THe second part of this Tractate, and indeed the principall (to the better understanding whereof the first part tended, and upon which also the third and last is grounded) sets down the Catalogue it self, containing many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Blasphemies and Practises of the sectaries of this time, together with a Narrative of some remarkable Passages and stories; as also, some Letters, and an extract of Letters concerning the present Sects. Now the Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies in this Catalogue particularized, may be referred to sixteen heads or sorts of Sectaries, as namely, 1. Independents. 2. Brownists. 3. Chiliasts, or Millenaries. 4. Antinomians. 5. Anabaptists. 6. Manifestarians or Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. 7. Libertines. 8. Familists. 9. Enthusiasts. 10. Seekers and Waiters. 11. Perfectists. 12. Socinians. 13. Arians. 14. Antitrinitarians. 15. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripturists. 16. Scepticks and Questionists, who question every thing in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; namely, all the Articles of Faith, and first Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, holding nothing positively nor certainly, saving the doctrine of pretended liberty of conscience for all, and liberty of Prophesying. And in one or other of these sixteen formes, may all the Errours and Blasphemies reckoned up in the following Catalogue be well placed, and unto one of these heads ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily reduced; yea, for many of these errours, the very same are held not only by one sort of the forenamed sects, but by divers of them. And I desire to commend to the Readers serious and sad consideration, three particulars concerning the errours and sects of this time; and the rather, because they were not so common to the sects in the ages before, at least not the two first. 1. That among all these sorts of sects and sectaries, there are hardly now to be found in <hi>England</hi> (for to this Kingdom, and to these four last years do I confine my self all along in this discourse) any sect thats simple and pure, and not mixt and compounded, that is, any sect among them all) which holds only the opinions and principles of its own way, without enterfering and mingling with the errours of other sects; as for example, where can a man finde a Church of simple Anabaptists, or simple Antinomians, or simple pure Independents, each of them keeping to their own principles, as Anabaptists to Anabaptisme, Independents to Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and holding no other? but rather do we not see by experience, that both the severall kinds of sects, and most persons of each kinde, are compounded of many, yea, some of all: One and the same society of persons in our times, being both Anabaptisticall, Antinomian, Manifestarian, Libertine, Socinian, Millenary, Independent, Enthusiasticall? yea, among the Independents (who are of all the rest accounted best) where can any man shew me an Independent Church strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called, or a man of them hardly, who symbolizes not with the other sects, holding beside Independency, neither the opinions of the Chiliasts, nor of the Libertines, nor other strange opinions! The Army that is so much spoken of upon all occasions in the news Books, Pulpits, Conferences, to be Independent

(though I conceive upon good information, that upon a true muster of the whole, Commanders and common souldiers, there would not be found above one in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ix of that way) yet of that Army, cal'd by the sectaries, Independent, and of that part of it which truly is so, I do not think there are 50. pure Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, but higher flown, more Seraphicall (as a Chaplain, who knows well the state of that Army, expressed it) made up and compounded of Anabaptisme, Antinomianisme, Enthusiasme, Arminianisme, Familisme, all these errours and more too sometimes meeting in the same persons, strange monsters, having their heads of Enthusiasme, their bodies of Antinomianisme, their thighs of Familisme, their leggs and feet of Anabaptisme, their hands of Arminianisme, and Libertinisme as the great vein going thorow the whole; in one word, the great Religion of that sort of men in the Army, is liberty of conscience, and liberty of preaching. But heretofore, both in times more ancient and latter, and in other Countries, severall sects kept themselves more to their own proper tenets, without that generall con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>usion of each running into all, as the Arians, Novatians and others, in the first six hundred years, and the Antinomians in <hi>Luthers</hi> time. Secondly, That all these sorts of sects, how different soever, yea and contrary to one another in many principles and opinions, yet all agree in these times in separating from our Church, refusing comunion in our publike Assemblies, and in disallowing the authoritative power of Classes and Synods; all the sects, yea the worst of them, as the Antiscripturists, Arians, Antitrinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Perfectists, being Independents and Separatists (though all Independents and Separatists be not Arians, Antinomians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which deserves the more to be thought on, because in the Primitive times, some heriticks and sectaries would have been glad of communion in warship with the Orthodox; (<note n="a" place="margin">Theodoret.

                        <hi>May</hi> 25. 1645. An Independent Minister praying for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, prayed that God would keep the Parliament from greeving the Saints, or doing any acts that might make them sad; that they for whom so many prayers and praises had been put up by the Saints, might not now grieve them. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> 24 the same Independent Minister in his prayer after Sermon, prayed, That now God had delivered us both (namely, the Presbyterian and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent) from such bondage and oppression, we might not be guiltie of brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our brethren into bondage, left the Lord carrie us back again into <hi>Egypt</hi> for it.

About the beginning of <hi>September</hi> last, a Reverend Minister of the Assembly who was an ear-witnesse related it, and said he would acquaint the Commissioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> with it; that an Independent Minister, either in his prayer or Sermon, used words to his effect of the <hi>Scots,</hi>

The Arminians at first broached but small and few errours in comparison, but in some yeares time, came to vent all kind of errors almost, Socinian errors, and what not? so our Sectaries at first were more modest, but within these foure yeares, especially these two last, how they have growne, and what they are fallen into, the fore named Catalogue is sufficient proofe. 3.

The

Arminians could not be brought to speak out a long while, nor to give what they would have, but hid themselves in doubtfull phrases, and were feared <hi>monstri aliquid alere:</hi> when they stood for and desired a Toleration upon conferences and meetings they were put to it, to give in what they held, and all they held, they were proffered at the conference holden at <hi>Delph</hi> favour and Toleration, if they would give assurance they desired only forbearance in the five Points, but they could not be got to it; so our Sectaries have forborne to this day, notwithstanding all meanes used, to set down this we hold, this we will stick to. 5. The Arminians in those times in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> in some Cities and Towns where they had power, persecuted the Orthodox, troubled them much; so do our Sectaries in Towns or places where they have power, persecute godly Orthodox men, especially if zealous against the Sects: O how have some Sectaries vexed, plagued and troubled many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ministers and people severall waies! of which more under their particular policies, &amp; factious practices. 6. The Arminians, had well nigh undone the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and brought all to confusion, &amp; had not the old Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> been stout and wise, even doing something beyond the ordinarie way of his power; and upon the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> determining the Magistrate added the civill sanction, and used coercive power, that Countrey had been lost; so Sectaries have by their errours, divisions and factions they have made among us, hazarded all, and if God do not wonderfully put in, and be mercifull to us, their waies and courses will undo us all. 7. The <hi>Netherland</hi> Arminians would be Remonstrants, did write against, complaine of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> that they could not have their liberty, were not well dealt with, could not have so faire a hearing; how many books were written, how many aspersions were cast upon the Synod? And have not, and do not our Sectaries write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Assembly? complain by word of mouth? are not their mouthes full of such speeches? They cannot be heard, They have not had liberty to bring in their Questions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is it not remarkable, that the Pamphlet, or rather Libell against the Assembly, put forth by stealth, is entituled, <hi>A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance of the Dissenting Brethren</hi>? so that they are the English Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants. 8 The <hi>Netherland</hi> Arminians when once the Magistrate did effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally set to back the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and were against them, then they writ books in a far other stile, and that power which before they so liberally mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured out to them, they did not a little limit and contract, denying the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate had any power over private meetings; so our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries, if once the Magistrates come to suppresse their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and false Doctrines,<note place="margin">Vide Voet.

The Bishops and the Court party would bring off one way or other, by Letters written from great friends at Court, by appearing for them, by removing to some other place the businesse by finding out one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or another, deluding the parties who prosecuted and troubled them, all those of their party that were active and able; who by vertue of the Lawes, conscience, and courage, some men in place were questioned and indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for preaching some Doctrines of Poperie and Arminiansme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or for some practices not legall, of which many examples were in the former time, fetching them out of the hands of Orthodox men who had power; sending Warrants for discharge of Priests, Jesuites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and now all <hi>England</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver generally, the Sectaries for anie of their partie that are questioned, either for preaching false doctrines, or for speaking unjustifiable words, or for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther misdemeanours, do use all waies to bring them off; they will use meanes to remove them from one Committee to another, where they are stronger, they will get Letters writ on their behalfe, they will work things so, as by delayes one way or another the Sectaries shall escape, as much as ever the Jesuits, Priests, Arminians, Innovators did heretofore. 2. The Bishops and Court party would prefer none but their party, kept out all men from all places in Church and Common-wealth, though never so deserving, especially if zealous, or had anie great parts to stand for the truth, and they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their own partie though never so unworthy, though little to commend them; and so the Sectaries, in all places where they have power, bring in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries though otherwise unfit, into offices and places, though dishonest and scandalous, and set themselves with all the industry and cunning that may be to keep out godly conscientious men that are against the Sects, though the,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99332:34"/>
publike suffer never so much for the want of them. 3. The Bishops and Court-party did set themselves to worme out (that being the Archbishops phrase) all godly, zealous, able men out of places, and would by one means or device watching them, cast them out quite, or so hamper and vex them, that they were weary of their lives and places; so doe our Sectaries make it their study, to remove, worme by degrees out of places upon one pretence or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when they cannot doe it otherwise active Presbyterians, of which we have too manie instances, and set themselves to vex them, by over-rating in Townes where they have place, by bringing them into Haberdashers H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll, by putting in Articles against them which they cannot prove, and so putting them to chargeable journeyes and expences, with abundance of such. 4. The Bishops and the Court-party to bring about their ends, would bring mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to such a condition, and such a necessitie, and then would make those necessities, that condition of affaires, as a ground of such and such following actions, pleading the necessities and the condition of the times as their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; so our Sectaries doe in many cases, they have by their policies and wayes hindred the setling of Church-Government all this while, and they plead the long delay of setling it, as a ground to justifie their gathering Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, saying, how manie yeares would you have us to stay? when as in the Assembly, Citie, in all places, by all meanes where they have anie interest, they retard the work; and so if meanes be used by Petitioning the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to settle Church-Government, and to suppresse the great errours, then some of the Sectaries say and give out, The Army will be offended, when as many of the Sectaries have used all meanes, and do still, to bring things to that passe, that we might have an Armie under the commands, and in the hands of the Sectaries, though (blessed be God) we have a Noble Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall free from sectarisme and not above one in six in the Armie that way tainted. 4. The Prelaticall faction and that Court-partie were great Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatours, given to change, running from one opinion to another, being Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians as well as Popish, yea some of them Soci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99332:34"/>
taking away the old used in all Reformed Churches, and substituting new; taking away of singing of Psalms, and pleading for hymnes of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; bringing in anoynting with oyl, bringing in their laying on of hands to give the Holy Ghost, with severall other strange wayes and practices, which the Reader shall find in this following discourse, among the narrations of passages and stories. 5 The Prelaticall faction and that Court-Clergie were daring bold men, that durst venture almost upon any thing, upon counselling to prorogue and break up Parliaments in times of danger and distraction, upon putting men out of offices and places that were not for their turne, and to bring in others calculated for their Meridian, upon corrupting Religion and Lawes at once, breaking in both upon the Truth and the libertie of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at the same time, upon any thing or person that stood in their way: So our Sectaries, many of them are daring men, have attempted and been upon high businesses, about counselling and drawing up Petitions for adjourning (as they call it) the Assembly, in a time when the distractions of this Church are so infinite, and things so unsetled; as also have inserted strange passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into other Petitions, which yet have not been presented, others of the company opposing them; with severall other particulars, which would be too large now to relate; in one word, there is almost nothing which they have not and dare not venture on, that stands in their light, and in the way of their designes; and I may say of many of the Sectaries (for I do not mean all, as I have said before, so I say again, there are some good souls meerly seduced, who are not of the Faction) they have overpassed the deeds of the wicked, not only walked after their wayes, nor done after their abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but have corrupted themselves more than they; justified the Bishops and their Faction, by falling into those opinions, and doing those actions in an high, bold, and open way, which that Faction never durst do for feare of the people. Next, the present Malignants and the Sectaries agree in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thus, that thorowout the Kingdome, it is now notorious, that the greatest Malignants and Sectaries hold together, and vote together against the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians and the Reformation, in all places and upon all businesses, of which there are many examples in the choyce of Burgesses for Parliament, in the Petition presented in <hi>London,</hi> at the choyce of the new Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, the grandest Malignants and the Independents joyned together to oppose; and in some Committees, where men of both these sorts are, it is observed also: but to come to some particulars; The parallel between the present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants and our grand Sectaries, stands in these; 1 The Malignants have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the proceedings of Parliament, by preaching and writing books against them, reviling the Houses, especially the House of Commons, and many
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99332:35"/>
particular worthy Members by name, speaking against their Ordinances, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, as Covenant, Directorie, Ordination, against their Power and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; we know what <hi>Aulicus</hi> that grand Malignant hath done, and how manie books both from <hi>Oxford</hi> and here at <hi>London</hi> hath been by the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant partie printed and vented: so also have manie Sectaries, and here it would fill a great book, to bring into one all the speeches, with the passages in Petitions, Sermons, Prayers, printed books, that have been vented against the Parliament, and particular Worthy Members of both Houses, their Power and Power and Priviledges, with their Ordinances and Orders, in reference to matters of Religion, as the Nationall Covenant, Directorie, Ordinance against mens preaching out of Office, the Monethly Fast, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance for Tithes, the Orders and Directions about Classes, and chusing El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; in which Sermons, printed Books, Discourses, Petitions, and other carriages of the Sectaries, there have been more things vented distructive to the verie power and nature of Parliaments, undermining the verie root and foundation, and all their proceedings in reference to matters of Religion, yea of justice and civill matters, then ever have been by all the Malignants in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as ever I could heare of; witnesse <hi>Lilburnes</hi> booke, with that lately come forth, call'd <hi>Innocency and Truth justified,</hi> all the printed Letters and Papers that were printed upon occasion of his imprisonment; <hi>Englands Birthright, the Ordinance of Tithes Dismounted, the Arraignment of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and all his fellowes, as <hi>Martins Eccho,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Turners Heavenly con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

3. They agree in this, rather to have Episcopal Government and a Toleration, then a strict Presbyteriall and thorow Reformation; we all know this would please <hi>Aulicus</hi> and his fellowes, and I thinke I can prove from good hands (and if I should name them, the Sectaries would say so to) that some of the prime Ministers in the way of the Sects have said, That Episcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a Toleration of their way would give them content. The Malignants and Sectaries agree in Independency, the Malignants now turn Independents, and professe they are for Independency, and for this I could quote severall speeches, and name some malignant Ministers, and others of note who are for Independency against Presbytery; but this is now so commonly known, that <hi>Britanicus</hi> a man who hath done them many good offices, and cryed up several of them, confesses in one of his Pamphlets about a fortnight since, that the Malignants are turned Independents; hardly a Malignant Priest about town, but is for Independency against Presbyterie. Lastly, The Sectaries agree with <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata and some other enemies of Christians in these four things. 1. <hi>Iulian</hi> was a great scoffer at the Scriptures, Christ and Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as Eccles. stories mention; and manie of the Sectaries of our time, are fearfull scoffers and mockers at all things that are good, Scriptures, Trinitie, Christ, Ministery, Ordinances, what not? there was never a greater genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of scoffers at Religion then many of the Sectaries of our times, witnesse manie printed books, as <hi>Arraignment of Persecution,</hi> and his fellowes, the <hi>Ordinance of Tithes Dismounted,</hi> besides manie scoffing bookes against the Presbyteriall Government, as the two Brethrens MS. with others of that kinde. 2. <note n="a" place="margin">Theodoret.

And as their carriage hath been thus to the Parliament, so they have and do all kind of wayes within their power, wrong and abuse the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Orthodox Ministers and people, vilifying, sleighting, and scorning them, raising up all kinds of evill reports, and casting reproaches on them, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them for all their love and kindnesse, with preaching against them in their owne pulpits, stealing away their people from them, labouring by all means, in places where they have any power or interest, to keep good Ministers out of such Churches, and Presbyterians out of all offices and employments; yea, in many places where they have power, they study and watch to throw out by one wile or other, godly Ministers who are against their way, detaining their dues, vexing of them, and making their lives bitter unto them, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering and abusing the godly Orthodox partie, yea, using all policie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie to get themselves into all chiefe places of power and command, that so they may trample upon and crush them.

Would they in <hi>New-England</hi> endure one or more Presbyterians to live among them, and to go up and downe their Countrey, and in chiefe Towns and places to preach against, cry downe their Churches and Church-government, and to extoll and cry up a contrarie way, as Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> and others do here? For mine owne part I am confidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, and so I beleeve are all wise men that have observed the waies of the Sectaries, that if they had been in the place of the Presbyterians, having had their power, number, authoritie, and the Presbyterians had been a small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as they were, and should have offered to have done but the twentieth part of that in preaching, writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> against them, which the Sectaries have done against the Presbyterians, they would have trod them downe as mire in the street, casting them out with scorn before this time of day, not have suffered a Presbyterian to preach among us, or to have been in any place or office, mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie or civill, but all would have been shut up in prisons, banished, or else hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselves in holes and corners: many godly persons in some places ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving much ado now to hold up their heads, to live by them, to preach quietly, to go safely in the streets, and to be quiet in their houses. And for conclusion of the differerence in the carriage and behaviour of the Presbyterians and the Sectaries, the righteous Lord judge between them, and recompence to the Presbyterians according to their kindnesse, love, peaceablenesse, forbearance and righteousnesse; and the Lord forgive the Sectaries, and turn their hearts, and cause their folly, insolencies, unrighteousnesse, and unjust dealings with their brethren, to be so manifest to themselves and all men, as they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Practice.</hi> They use to ascribe and attribute all the successe of things, all that is done in field, at Leaguers, all victories, brave actions, to their partie, crying them up in Pulpits, News-books, conferences, calling them the saviours

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Practice.</hi> They do on purpose (having got Churches void) keepe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Churches without Ministers, seeke out for none, stop (all they can) Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Ministers from coming in, which they do for two reasons, 1. That so they may pay no Tithes: 2. That so they may have the liberty of the Pulpits for all kinde of Sectaries, and mechanick preachers, who come from <hi>London,</hi> the Armies, and other places to preach in and corrupt the people, and that the people being as sheep without a shepherd, may be more easily now drawne away to error and schisme; and of this practice there are many sad examples in <hi>Hartfordshire, Bucking, Essex,</hi> and that in some great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-townes, as <hi>Chesham,</hi> where thousands of souls are.</p>

Or second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if there must be any, yet to have a defective, imperfect loose Government and Reformation, that may not be able to do the worke, that so others may fall off to their way the more; and for proof of this, they have refused to joyn for a pure full Reformation in points according to their own principles, that so one good might not hinder a greater good (as was expressed) and have opposed to the utmost a thorow Presbyteriall Reformation. 3. They have laboured to get a Toleration granted before the Government be setled, to get an exception before the rule was made, and if once they had gotten that, let the Presbyterians get the Government then when they could, and this they stirred in, and sought to effect last winter. 4. Seeing they could not do this, but this policy was espied, they labour for a Toleration together with a Reformation, that the Church-Government and a Toleration might be borne and brought forth together as twins in one day, and so go hand in hand, and this they are labouring for now, the monster of Toleration concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the wombe of the Sectaries long ago, they having growne big with it ever since, are now in travell to bring it forth, and till they could be ready and get things fitted for a Toleration, they bestirred themselves so against the <hi>London</hi> Petitions, that of <hi>September,</hi> those of <hi>November,</hi> lest Government should be setled before a Toleration, and therefore one of them said to some Citizens, why should you bee so h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is my lot (so divine Providence is pleased to order it) that in my conflicts for Truth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Error, I should not enter the field and fight single combats, but encounter with many: My <hi>Antapologia</hi> was an Answer unto five men, esteemed Gyants by many of these times; who though they were five to one, yet by the good hand of God that was with mee in that work, I keep the field till this day, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor any for them (notwithstanding all the great threats given out) having yet engaged against mee in that cause. Now in this present booke, consisting partly of a Reply, I have to do with Three, a three-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cerberus,</hi> the three-bodied monster <hi>Geryon:</hi> The Apologists were fair smooth men in comparison of these, their voice was the voice of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> but these are hairy, rough, wilde red men, especially, <hi>Cretensis:</hi> These are grown higher, are gone farther, and are more daring then the former; and yet I doubt not but hee that then brought me off with safety and honour too, will also now stand by mee, and having delivered mee from the lion and the bear, these uncircumcised Philistims, especially <hi>Goliah Goodwin</hi> shall be as one of them. Whilest I was making this Reply, had even finished it, striking off this three-headed Cerberus, new heads of that monstrous Hydra of Sectarism sprung up, which the Reader shall also find have their deaths wound too in this present Book; and yet after all these heads cut off, I expect a great red Dragon having seven heads, and seven horne, and seven crowns upon his heads; but let as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                     <hi>John Boggis.</hi> Now that the Reader may the more profit by this work, and not stumble in the Entrance, I shall premise three things whereby to remove a few prejudices that may be in the minds of some men, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the matter and manner of this Book.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1</hi> Tis objected, The bringing upon the stage matters of fact, and the practices of some men against a way, is not a right course to convince a way to be naught, nor the followers of it of their errours: Arguments and Reasons are the way to satisfie men. <hi>Answ.</hi> I have spoken to this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the first part of <hi>Gangraena, pag. 76.</hi> and the Reader may find more said to it in this second part, <hi>pag. 79, 80.</hi> And therefore that which I shall say here is this. Such discoveries as these, are a more sensible pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall way of confutation of the Sectaries to the body of the people of the Kingdome, then so many syllogismes and arguments; they can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand these when they cannot perceive an argument; and Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in speaking against false prophets, saith, <hi>By their fruits you shall know them: Doe men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? &amp;c.</hi> And the Apostles in their speaking against the Hereticks and heresies
<pb facs="tcp:99332:47"/>
of their times, confuted them thus by their practices and wayes: Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>everdoes but observe the passages in the Epistles of <hi>Peter, Jude, Paul,</hi> shall finde this true.</p>
                  <p>And whereas tis said by some of them, if they would do so by the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, they could show as many Errours held by some Presbyterians, and as bad practises, &amp;c. and so recriminate. I answer, suppose they could, <hi>1.</hi> Yet there's not the same reason in divers respects; but I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give one instance, namely this difference: The Anabaptists, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, &amp;c. have their Church way and government up, they are in the practice and possession of it, they may use it, and do to the utmost, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Errours, Scandals, in the power of censures, in admitting of none but whom the body allowes, &amp;c. and yet in the free practise of it, and under it, all these Errours grow, and men fall from one thing to another, as all men see; but now those who are in their judgement for Presbyterian Government in this Kingdome, they enjoy it not, have not the benefit of it to censure scandalous persons, suppresse any Errors, or to do any Acts of Government at all, but all lies waste. <hi>2.</hi> I deny that the Sectaries can show men who are Presbyterians (though they want the benefit of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) that fall into those Errours, Blasphemies, Practises which the Sectaries doe, tis a meer flourish, they can show no such thing; nay, I am confident that among all the Presbyterian Ministers and cheife members who have appeared and acted for that way, since Presbyterians, the Sectaries cannot instance in one man like to hundreds and thousands of their Sectaries, either for Errours in judgement, or loosenesse in life.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Tis objected tis an unchristian way to bring mens names upon the stage, tis to much to speak against a way from the Practises of some of that way, but to name men in print, and publikly to brand them, this is worse. <hi>Ans.</hi> I could give many Answers to justifie this, and show the examples both of Fathers and the holiest, judiciousest moderne Writers who practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this, as <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Tractate against Libertines, naming <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> &amp;c. and giving reasons there by way of Answer to this very obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of naming men, but I cannot now insist upon it: all I will say is this, for my own part tis much against my genius and temper to do it, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb facs="tcp:99332:48"/>
I do not love to offend any, or to contend with any man, but to comply and please all; besides, I am sensible of the hatred, reproaches, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers I am liable to for doing it, but a necessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> Let no godly person be offended at my Book, if the stile of it be quick and smart, and if I speak sometimes a little sharply to <hi>Cretensis;</hi> but rather let them consider how unworthily (not onely unbecoming a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, but a man) hee hath dealt with mee and all Presbyterians in his Answer, discovering such unsufferable pride, arrogancie, scornful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of spirit towards all Presbyterians who fall not down to the golden calves of his opinions of Imputation of faith, Independency, &amp;c. as that there seems no way left to recover him but to deal a little roundly with him, and lay open his folly; besides, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the Cretians, <hi>who are alwayes lyars,</hi> saith, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith.</hi> In one word, <hi>Cretensis</hi> in all his Answers is too like those spoken of in <hi>2 Sam. 23.6.</hi> that must be thrust away as thorns, because they cannot be taken with hands: the man that must touch him had need be fenced with iron and the staffe of a spear: <hi>Cretensis</hi> is a man so foul-mouth'd in all kind of filthy language, that his maid had need seowr his mouth alwayes with a wisp when he goes to write any Book. But to hold the good Reader no longer in the porch, let we earnestly intreat thy prayers to God for his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious assistance, protection, supporting of him who is resolved to <hi>spend and be spent,</hi> and to run all hazzards for the truth of God and his Churches<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Among many godly orthodox Christians, who were at that time in <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> and opposed the Sectaries in their pleading thus for all Errours, and a generall Tolleration; there was one godly Citizen who told me this story of himsef, that he reasoning with severall of the Sectaries against their opinions, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Toleration, the next day being the eighteenth of <hi>March,</hi> an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Wollen Draper to whom he had workt almost twenty years, took away his work from him, and said he should have no more work of his, because the night before this Citizen had argued against Independency, saying it was a Schisme; whereupon this Citizen dealt plainly with this Wollen-Draper, and told him, Sir, will you put me by my work, which is my living, for my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? is not this Persecution? will you have your consciences, and shall not we enjoy ours? would you be tolerated, and will not you tolerate us?</p>

and her mother (who was widdow) to seek after him.</p>
                     <p>In a Book lately printed, call'd <hi>the Ordinance for Tyths Dismounted,</hi> (which book also was given into the hands of one Parliament man (as I can prove) by a great Sectary who may justly be thought the Author of it) there are such passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of reproach against the Parliament as are not to be paralled in any writings, except some of the Sectaries: In <hi>pag.</hi> 6.7, 8.40. this Sectarie speaking of a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in the Ordinance of Tyths made by the Lords and Commons, hath these following words, <hi>Had not such a passage gone under the Title of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons who are chosen for the weale of the people, I should not have judged it an act of humanity, but rather the result of an Hell-bred conspiracy by the Divell and his Angels to confound us with their unreasonable malice, &amp;c. and this was the first stone these Master-builders laid in their blessed Reformation.</hi>

One <hi>Overton</hi> that was to be the Moderatour on <hi>Battees</hi> side, stood up and said, Brother <hi>Lam,</hi> had <hi>Paul</hi> done well if he had desisted from preaching in the name of Jesus if he had been commanded by the High-Priests to forbear, had he done well or not? <hi>Lam</hi> answered no; whereupon <hi>Overton</hi> replied in a most scornfull proud man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99332:56"/>
nor ought we to obey Master Major; and thus did these men argue the power of my Lord Major for an houres space; but at the last they came to state the question, and fall to their dispute; the question was, That God made man, and every part of man of the dust of the earth; and therefore man, and every part of man must returne to the dust again, which <hi>Battee</hi> could not prove, nor could <hi>Lam</hi> well tell how to answer, but both of them ran off from Scripture to Scripture, never clearing any one thing to the people; and when they had rambled a long time, that they could neither of them tell what to say, then one or other stood up, and said, Brother <hi>Lam,</hi> or Brother <hi>Battee,</hi> leave this point to the consideration of the Brethren, and take up some other; after these two had spent foure or five houres in this confusion, they sat down and rested, and then stands up one <hi>Mellish</hi> a Cobler, and <hi>Lawson</hi> a Schoolmaster, both Anabaptists, and to work they went as their Brethren before: <hi>Lawson</hi> calls to <hi>Mellish,</hi> and saith to him, Brother <hi>Mellish,</hi> speak either Categorically or Hypothetically; <hi>Mellish</hi> answered <hi>Lawson,</hi> that he spake now to him in an unknown tongue, and prayed him to explain himself; <hi>Lawson</hi> told <hi>Mellish</hi> that he was nor fit to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute if he knew not the meaning of these words; <hi>Mellish</hi> replied that if hee should stand up and tell the people that the Moon was made of green Cheese, he did not question but some would be of his mind.</p>
                     <p>This Relation was given me under the hand of a godly honest Citizen, who was an eare and eye witnesse of all the said passages, who also named to me other persons that were present, and he delivered me this Relation in writing before two sufficient witnesses, and declared himself ready to make proof of this before Authority when ever he should be called.</p>
                     <p>This following Relation was sent to a godly and able Minister of this City, (one who hath a Pastorall charge in <hi>London</hi>) and this Minister delivered me the Originall writing, which to a tittle There set down.</p>

                           <p>There is a Sectary living neer the <hi>Spitle,</hi> a great follower of Master <hi>Randall,</hi> who did offer to sell his Bible, and being asked why he would sell it, and what he would do for a Bible, answered, he could make as good a Book himself.

                           <p>It hath been told me from good hands, that there are a company of persons about <hi>London,</hi> who meet weekly to reason and object against the Scriptures; their meetings were about the <hi>Spitle,</hi> and since in <hi>Hounsditch,</hi> and now they shift places for feare they should be discovered, and surprised; it were good that Authority would look into it, to finde them out; I shall be ready to name the men from whom I have had such information.</p>

For present I will only alledge two Testimonies (reserving others till my full Reply) which I beleeve will be full and speak home, and the parties who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, will be ready before any Committee, or Court of <hi>England,</hi> if called, to resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie as much: The first was given me in writing, <hi>March</hi> 30. 1646. subscribed by the hand of him who brought it to me, and delivered to me in the presence of two godly Citizens as his hand, and that which he would maintain to be truth, and produce other witnesses for the proof of it, when he should be call'd by Authority; and tis as followes.</p>

                                    <hi>Inprimis,</hi> That Mr <hi>Walwyn</hi> did say it was a sin to pray for the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it would lie as a sin upon the Preists so to delude the people; and that he did admire at our Preists that they should stand bauling and praying for the King, that God would turn his heart, and say of him that he was the anoynted of God. And he said they were glad to doe it (namely the Ministers) because if the King maintain them in their way, they would cry him up to the people:
And M. <hi>Walwyn</hi> being asked how we should performe the Covenant we had taken to maintain the Kings honour, he
said he remembred no such
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99332:60"/>
clause in the Covenant: And further he said, that he did much admire at the simplicity that was in the hearts of the people, that they should suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Governed by a King, and that under such a government the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome could not be safe: He being asked what he thought of Mr <hi>Marshall,</hi> M. <hi>Calamy,</hi> M. <hi>Sedgwick,</hi> and other godly Ministers; he answered and said they were a company of Mountebancks, and that they kept the people in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and blindnesse, and that they preached nothing but what we know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that he knew no Scriptures for them to be Preachers more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, as he named Shoemakers, Coblers, Weavers, or Sopeboylers, and the like; absolutely speaking against all Congregations and Ministers, and that if their Tyths were taken from them, they would soon leave their trade; and said that the Apostles were tradesmen, and were not chargeable to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; He further said that our Ministers might go and preach the Gospel to the Turks and Heathens, and not to stand prating here, for as he said before, we knew enough already.
I asked him who should preach to the people, and how they should be maintained, if they would have them have nothing?
he answered he knew no Ministers that ought to be maintained, but that every man that had gifts might be a Minister, and use the liberty of his Conscience; and he spake in the behalf of <hi>Paul Best</hi> for his Blasphemy; saying, that if we could not convince his Conscience, we ought not to punish his body. Touching the Rebellion in ☞<hi>Ireland,</hi>

I told him that it was a sad thing to see how we are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, some women would not pray with their husbands, and some not sit at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when they gave thanks for the creatures; and servants would not joyne in prayers with their Masters, nor heare them repeat the Sermons, and that many of them have cast off all duties in their families; he justified them all in what they did, and said, they could give a Reason for it, and that it was their Conscience that led them to it, and therefore they ought not to be blamed.</p>
                                 <p>All this I do averre to be truth, and will maintain it, and can bring others to witnesse the same, and have set to my hand.</p>

I suppose that beside his pride, and the show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his parts, it was to engratiate and endear himself to all the Sectaries, by appearing and writing against a man so hatefull to them as M. <hi>Edwards</hi> is, and specially at this time, writing <note n="*" place="margin">That's the main subject of both his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets: <hi>A Whisper in the ear,</hi> and, <hi>A word more to Mr.</hi> Edwards.</note> once and again for the cause of Liberty of Conscience, that so being taken notice of for <hi>a strong head,</hi> and true to the generall libertie of all Sects; some or other of the Independents might get him a Burgess place, and bring him in to be a Member of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: I am of the opinion he aimed at that, knowing that <hi>Cornwell</hi> was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and many places there wanted Burgesses; and do beleeve, if a man could see the List of those who are prickt for <hi>Cornwell</hi> by the Independent party, hee would find M. <hi>Walwyns</hi> name in; and I am of the mind, if M. <hi>Peters</hi> were asked, and would tell truly, it would be found M. <hi>Walwyn</hi> and Lieut.

But I conceive the Reasons why this Minister and many others, though they are willing to witnesse truth, and to communicate their Intelligence about the Sectaries, yet for the present do desire to have their names concealed. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they live among many Sectaries and Independents, some whereof being in place both in Towns and Countries may do them no good offices, but may much molest and trouble them; and therefore unlesse some great good might come by witnessing publikely, which might countervaile their hazard, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing ☞ the Conventicles of the Sectaries, the spreading of erroneous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninons, and punishing some of the Rabbies and Ring-leaders, they are unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to venture themselves by being brought upon the Stage in Print. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some live in places where part of our Armies lie, or may come: Now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny souldiers being Sectaries, and violent for their opinions, if they should meet with any Ministers named in print, giving me intelligence, it were as much as the spoiling of them and their families; and where are they that do or will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from such violence? there are too many examples of Ministers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in danger, as M. <hi>Andrews</hi> was; and therfore I deal plainly, I have been spoken to by word of mouth, and sent unto from some Ministers in the Country not to name them in my Books, because, if the Army, or some parts of it come that way, they shall be undone, which is a satisfying answer to all rationall men, for my concealing their names, especially to all those who understand the state of things, and observe how powerfull the faction of the Sectaries is.</p>

Should Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in writing any of his Books, or in this last have taken <hi>Cretensis</hi> slight course, there's no question but before this time Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> had heard after another manner, and in another way of his Books then he hath, especially of his <hi>Antapologie</hi> and <hi>Gangraena</hi>; but the <hi>poor weak thimblefull of dust, that knows not how to range his Parts of Speech in a sentence, &amp;c.</hi> hath more brains in this then the bushel full of dirt, who though <hi>Cretensis</hi> have more guts and garbage and be better bodied yet in the opinion of wise men will be thought to have lesse understanding, and fewer brains in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing himselfe so as he hath done.</p>

Just so do the Sectaries now by my Book; and many of them, that they might possesse the people the more against it, and make that imputation, <hi>That<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis full of Lyes,</hi> gain credit with the people, have invented many Lyes and Stories, which they formally tell up and down the City and Countrey for certain (and I can produce several witnesses to prove this, namely Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and others, who have come to me and to others to know the truth of them) as that some of the Independent Ministers have been with me, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and have convinced me of some Lyes in my Book, as that same of the Souldiers out of the Army, have been with me about the story of Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> and proved it false to me, as that one whom I name in my Book and speak of, as having some relation from the mans own mouth, coming to me about it, I confessed I knew him not, nor never saw him before, with some other such; all which are meer lyes and fictions of the Sectaries, (so wicked and cunning are they in their generation to uphold their tottering <hi>Babel</hi>) to prejudice Christians from reading and considering my Book. But good Reader, however falshood and slandering of men, is pretended the great cause of speaking so against me and my Book; the true cause of all the hatred is, because there is so much truth in it: Many men who answer nothing to it, and others who have appeared in writing to disprove the truth, know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others too guilty, and that in other passages where they are not

named, and know that I know and can prove it, and that vexes them to the heart; but were it indeed (as many of them against their consciences give out) a Book of Lyes, they would not be so mad at it, but I should before this time a day by some of my good Friends the Sectaries have heard of them after another manner, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Reply.</hi> However, Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> or the Printer for him, may possibly in some places of his Book print none of the truest English, yet I am sure <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis</hi> in this Page speaks none of the best sense nor Reason that ever I read in my life, but every line and sentence is so slight and weak, that a man may look through and through it; and the truth of it is, <hi>Cretensis</hi> all along hath a multitude of bom-basted, starched words, priding himself therein, but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never in all his answers hath he any thing else; witnesse his Answers to Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> and this present Passage: And first for that which <hi>Cretensis</hi> speaks here, the man makes good what he saith <hi>pag.</hi> 50. that he never read one quarter of my Book, and that he took things upon trust, as observed by others; for certainly had he read my Book over, he could never have writ thus, that in charging the Sectaries with these, <hi>I acquit them from all others crimes and imputations, and that I have represented them to the world, a better and far more deserving generation, then the far greatest part of the Presbyterians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because in divers pages of <hi>Gangraena</hi> I expresly declare I have many more to lay to their charge, stiling this Book but a praeludium and preparative to what's behinde; doth a man who accuses a guilty person at first but with two or three Articles, and yet formally declares he hath many more, and upon every Article pleads his liberty and power of Additionals, justifie and acquit him from all others?</p>

                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:99332:69"/>2. Had <hi>Cretensis</hi> but read over my Book, and considered what Errors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Practises, Blasphemies I speak of, to what a nature some of them amount, and of what a kinde they are, that there can hardly be worse, he would never have said I had dealt but faintly with the Sectaries, <hi>and that the Sectaries were a better and far more deserving generation then the Presbyterians</hi>; for if the far greatest part of Presbyterians be worse (or so bad) either for Doctrines, Practises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I have proved many of the Sectaries to be, then I must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse I will disclaim, and be the first that shall c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But supposing I had not declared my minde in this case, yet all that <hi>Cretensis</hi> saith is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent without all strength of reason; for therebe and are reserves when not thought of, and wise men always in all matters of accusations and reckonings will fear there's more behinde, and suspect somthing worse, though not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at first; and I would ask <hi>Cretensis,</hi> whether either in impeachments, or reckonings and accounts brought in to Courts of Justice against such and such men, though at first but part of the Accusation be alleaged, whether the accused can be secure, they are justified with an high hand from all other crimes and imputations of any worse resentment or import; and when one is impleaded and endicted upon the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, for matter of opinion, that he will discover and finde out as many Errors and Heresies, and those of every whit as dangerous an Import, to be at this day in a far lesse number of the Classique party; yea that he could make a discovery of as many Errors and Heresies in me alone; and that he doth not think the most Orthodox Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian under heaven, nor Independent neither, erres much beneath the like number of Errors.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> I accept these Challenges, and do take up the Glove both the first and second time, rechallenging and defying <hi>Cretensis</hi> to make them good; and by these ungodly Challenges made by him out of his great care and love of Errors, to strengthen the hands of Hereticks, least they should suffer losse, were he <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and his Glove <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunts</hi> Gantlet, I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99332:70"/>
would take it up, And first of all Reply to <hi>Cretensis,</hi> the man speaks he knows not what. <hi>Cretensis</hi> not having read one quarter of my Book, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self professes, knows not what crimes or miscarriages, Heresies and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with the way of making them good, I charge the Sectaries with: and yet he will at random, and blindefold undertake to finde as many in a far lesse number of my Classique Proselytes and party. O what will not this man say, so it may make for the Independent party: Surely he will startle at nothing who dares speak thus: Can you produce as many Blasphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ, the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and finde as many horrid Opinions in Presbyterians as I have proved to be in Sectaries? where will you finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Presbyterians, such as <hi>Hich, Wrighter, Web, Clarkson, Marshal, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chols, Den, Oats, Cretens. cum multis aliis</hi>; As for the condition <hi>Cretens.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, upon which he will make good his undertaking, and out at which he hopes to escape, to salve his lying, I do for my own part accept it, and am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy freely and candidly to declare my minde and judgement in all points of Religion, and shall perswade others also to do the like: But of this more in my full Reply, where I shall shew the fallacy and shift of <hi>Cretensis</hi> in this; only for the present the Reader may observe he puts in these conditions, that so he may provide a Sanctuary for all kinde of Hereticks and erroneous persons, a a place of retreat for himself one way or other to come off these Challenges, which in the plain open field he foresaw he could never do.</p>

                        <hi>Cretensis page</hi> 6. among other his Artifices and devices to weaken the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the truth of those matters laid down in <hi>Gangraena</hi> against the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian party, labors to possesse the Reader,
<q>That for saving of my own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and to prevent, as much as might be, the thorough examination of the greatest part of what <hi>Gangraena</hi> represents by way of disparagement to the Independent party, I printed so many Letters without the names of their Authors;</q> and upon this <hi>Cretensis</hi> goes on vaporing and forging in his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical brain, certain Reasons of my concealing the names of the Authors of the Letters, and in sum, would render me to the Reader, a man to be suspected of jugling and forgery, and the Letters to be void of all truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> As for that fallacy of <hi>Cretensis,</hi> whereby he labors to delude the Reader, infinuating that the Letters contain the greatest part of what <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graena</hi> represents by way of disparagement to the Independent party, and those Letters being without names, the names were concealed on purpose for fear of examination of the truth of the Letters, and so the Letters containing the greatest part of disparagement against the Sectaries, the Sectaries are as it were at once cleared from what <hi>Gangraena</hi> faith against them; I say only this. That <hi>Cretensis</hi> is a man of that impudence and large conscience, that he will say any thing, so it may make for the Sectaries, and against the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99332:70"/>
for the Letters are not neither in number of sheets the tenth part of <hi>Gangraena,</hi> neither contain they the tenth part of the Discovery of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Heresies, Practises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beside, some things in the Letters are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, and to one of the Letters is annexed a Confutation of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in it, consisting of two whole leaves of those few sheets, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few lines.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for that of jugling and forgery which <hi>Cretensis</hi> would put upon me, the man measures me by himself and his party, because that he and some of his party are used to juggle and possibly forge Letters and News, invent and give our many things which never were; have with the Jesuits their <hi>piae fraudes</hi> to advance their Catholike cause, therefore he thinks so of me; but I blesse God I am a plain man, hating equivocations, mental reservations, plots, underminings of men, playing under-board, carrying things in the clouds; I count honesty the best policy, and faithful plain dealing the greatest wisdom, and the Independents will finde it so in the end, however for a while they prosper by their shufling tricks, devices, policies, as <hi>Strafford, Canterbury,</hi> and others did before them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To come to the main charge of concealing the names of those who writ me Letters, and all the inferences drawn from thence: I answer, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given some Reasons for it, and do adde these unto them; most of the men who writ the Letters, writ them not for that end to be printed, knew not of, nor imagined no such matter, neither did I acquaint them with it, and for me without their leave obtained to print their Names to the world, I could not do it, keeping unviolated the rules of friendship, besides I well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that were a way to cut off correspondency and Intelligence for the future, if I should print mens Names publikely to the world, writing in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate way to me: Of all the Letters written to me, there were two only which I expressed to the Authors I would print them, and acquainted them with my purpose, whose Names notwithstanding (excepting the two first Letters sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed) I concealed with the rest for company: But now that I may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw <hi>Cretensis</hi> Proposition, and his Inferences, his Foundation, and his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructures, I shall name most of them who writ the Letters to me and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as also from whose hands I received those Letters which were printed by me, though not written to me. The first Letter was written me from Mr. <hi>Strong,</hi> a Member of the Assembly of Divines, who after he had told me by word of mouth the contents of this Letter, promised to send it me in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I acquainted him then what use it was for, and he said he would justifie what he writ, and named others in whose presence Master <hi>Denne</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained these Points. The second Letter was written from Master <hi>Simon Ford,</hi> to a Member of the Assembly Master <hi>Gower<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99332:71"/>
received it, and told Mr. <hi>Gowers</hi> I should print it, to which he was willing, and since <hi>Gangraena</hi> was printed, the Author writes to me about his Letter,
<q>That he will enlarge and confirm the particulars in that Letter, and send it to me.</q>
The third Letter was one Master <hi>Josiab Ricrasts,</hi> who owns it, and hath been with me since <hi>Cretensis</hi> came forth, and to my knowledge is drawing up an Answer to <hi>Cretensis,</hi> for so much as concerns that Letter. The fourth Letter was written by a Weaver in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> one <hi>Crab</hi> (if I mistake, not the name) and I received it from M. <hi>Rosewal</hi> a City Minister well known, who will own it, and make it good 'tis such a mans: And thus I have given an account of the Copies of all the whole Letters printed by me: Now for the Extract of certain Letters written to me &amp; some other Ministers, for seven of them, which are the greatest part of those Extracted Letters, namely all those which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>Colchester</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ellis,</hi> or some others there (of which Letters Mr. <hi>Ellis</hi> himself writes thus to a friend in <hi>London; The aspersions cast on me, and some others here by Mr.</hi> Edwards, <hi>are as false as foul; which because they are a great part of his Book and strength, those who are here concerned in it, will, if God please, shortly make Reply, Cretensis</hi> p. 44.) he who writ them is not afraid of his name, neither was his name concealed for fear of an Examination of the truth of the Letters, as <hi>Cretensis</hi> by reading this Letter lately sent to me from him may understand, which I here print to a tittle.</p>

<q>And for the second, Master <hi>Roborough</hi> (whom <hi>Cretensis</hi> scoffs at <hi>pag.</hi> 26. by the name of <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Clerk</hi>) takes up his Glove, and desire me in my Reply to signifie thus much unto him: For that jeer of Master <hi>Robor.</hi> holding his peace when Master <hi>Gataker</hi> hath spoken, his playing on servant and Master, Justice of Peace and Clerk, Master <hi>Robor.</hi> passeth it by as he hath much bad language from him in his Vindication of Master <hi>Walker</hi>; only he faith such gibing and jeering cost him nought; Its said it runs in the blood, that he had it by tradition, from which is seems he is not yet redeemed for all his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular profession; Master <hi>Roborough</hi> will not deal with him in that for shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buckles, <hi>Cretensis</hi> shall have the preheminence; yet doth he modestly desire an Answer to his <hi>Animadversions</hi> on M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Book, and is ready to make his writing good, against <hi>Cretensis</hi> and his complices in further writing, or by a dispute when and where <hi>Cretensis</hi> pleaseth.

                     <p>And as M. <hi>Roborough</hi> gave me the precedent words in writing, under his hand; so he added by word of mouth, that he challenges <hi>Cretensis</hi> to dispute this point, about <hi>Faith being imputed in a proper sense,</hi> where, when, before whom, and how he will, leaving him to nominate his own time, place, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, manner of dispute, either by writing or by word of mouth; by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures

                        <hi>Reply. Cretensis</hi> plays the Sophister here, making use of that fallacy <hi>non causa pro causa,</hi> giving the false cause of not Replying, and concealing the true; and that all these are false, is evident: 1. Because <hi>Cretensis</hi> hath had leasure to have attended the motions of my pen, and hath since the 18 moneths given an account to the world more then once, twice, thrice, and had leasure now, the priviledge of ease, to make an Answer to <hi>Gangraena,</hi> and could he not with the labour of all these have Replyed to <hi>Antapology?</hi> It should seem for all the weaknesse, contradictions, and such like, which <hi>Cretensis</hi> speaks of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapology,</hi> 'tis a hard piece that <hi>Cretensis</hi> can write and print five several Books, have time enough <hi>from his constant and standing labors with those who have committed themselves to him in the Lord,</hi> before he finde time to Reply to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapology</hi>: Besides, <hi>Cretensis</hi> had five great Champions the Apologists to assist him in it, some of which will be found to have or to take more priviledge of ease, and seldom Preaching then the Presbyterians use to take, and some of them have had leasure to Print other things since, wherein not so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; as also <hi>Cretensis</hi> hath a priviledge of ease and idlenesse when he pleases to help himself (which none of the Presbyterians have) <hi>viz.</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point some of his Prophets in his Church to Preach for him, which he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

practises upon all occasions, as I can prove, and hath upon pretence of answering my <hi>Antapology.</hi> 2. Some Independents have that shamelesnesse of forehead, to make the subject matter of their Sermons little else but loose, lying, frivolous reports and stories, or virusent invectives against the Saints, &amp;c. as Mr. <hi>Peters, the Vicar General and Metropolitane of the Independents, both in New and Old England</hi>: and I wonder how <hi>Cretensis</hi> forgot him: Name any Presbyterian, who is of any account in the Church of God, such a loose rambling Preacher as he: And for his invectives against the Saints, 'tis one of his common places in many of his Sermons to speak against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, the Reverend Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That I took not much lesse then eighteen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths in making the <hi>Antapology,</hi> when as the <hi>Apologetical Narration</hi> (I am sure of it) came forth in the Moneth of <hi>December,</hi> and to my best remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance towards the later end of it, and my <hi>Antapology</hi> was printed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad either the last week of <hi>Iune</hi> following, or the first of <hi>Iuly,</hi> which at the farthest was not full seven Moneths, and is far from eighteen Moneths: As for that insinuation of <hi>Cretensis</hi> joyned to the eighteen Moneths, <hi>the advantage of liberty, and freedom from other ingagements which Mr.</hi> Edwards <hi>had above other men,</hi> 'tis a false one; for from that time I began to Answer <hi>Apologet. Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> till it came forth, I never had lesse liberty or freedom in my life, nor more businesses and engagements of several sorts in reference to the Publike, Preaching in that time of writing my Book very often, three times a week constantly, and many times four, besides the tedious Journeys between <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Godalming,</hi> riding to Preach there; together with all the difficulties and fears of many Alarums from the Enemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in that time. But before I draw to a conclusion of this, I desire the Reader to observe what a proud arrogant speech this is of <hi>Cretensis</hi> to extoll himself and his party, with the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99332:74"/>
contempt and scorn of the Presbyterians, <hi>If Independent Ministers had either the priviledge of ease to preach to the bare walls and pews in their meeting places:</hi> Now for this in my large Reply I will acquaint the Reader what privileges Independent Ministers and Independent Saints have and take above the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, and what their priviledge of ease and idlenesse is above the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, as also shew the true Reasons why the world wanders after the Beast, many of the Independents are so stockt after before Presbyterians; as also by what a sort of people, and what little cause <hi>Cretensis</hi> and his Saints have to glory and boast of it; and when I have spoken to that at large, I believe I shall be out of <hi>Cretensis</hi> debt for these words.</p>
                     <p>Only for present I shall tell <hi>Cretensis</hi> these three things. 1. That there are Presbyterian Ministers who Preach no more to bare walls and pews then <hi>Cretensis</hi> and the Independent Ministers, Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sedgwick, cum multis aliis,</hi> both in City and Countrey. 2. There are many Independent Ministers who have Preached lately, and do so still as much to bare walls and pews as any Presbyterians, witnesse Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Davis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Freak,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ellis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Furman, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Presbyterians do not use however Independents may (as <hi>Cretensis</hi> in his speech implyes) to have ever the more priviledge of ease by Preaching to a few rather then to many, by Preaching to a hundred two or three, or Preaching to a thousand or two, for they Preach out of Conscience and discharge of duty, to do good to the souls of men, and not for applause to please a multitude, and therefore tis all one to them whether there be fewer or more, one hundred or many; but this is expressed according to the Independent humor, who have their Sermons of several sorts, those of greater pains and study when their pews and walls are full, and their Sermons of ease when their pews are empty, and their walls bare. Now to put a period to this fourteen Section, with an Animadversion upon that passage of <hi>Cretensis</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 16. his <hi>constant and standing labors with those who have committed themselves to him in the Lord.</hi> I ask of <hi>Cretensis</hi> where he findes this used of a people to commit themselves unto the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; we are commanded to commit our way to the Lord, and to commit our souls to him, and of God 'tis oft used; but in what place is it of people to Ministers, and then those who have committed themselves to you; why did you not say to the Church rather? what is <hi>Cretensis</hi> become the Church? And lastly, why was it not as well expressed, <hi>Those to whom I have committed my self unto in the Lord?</hi> for I believe upon better consideration, it will be found, that <hi>Cretensis</hi> hath as much committed himself to his people, as they to him; for they Preach and rule as well as <hi>Cretensis</hi>; and believe upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (the Church will be found to Preach oftner then <hi>Cretensis,</hi> for all his constant and standing labors) and his yong Prophets to exercise upon the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99332:75"/>
week and Lords day, and he bound to hear and obey them as well as they him: And now if <hi>How</hi> the Cobler were alive again, <hi>Cretensis</hi> and he would have no more Disputation and difference about humane learning ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the Interpreting of Scriptures, and Preaching of the Word, seeing <hi>Cretensis</hi> allows it now in his Church Members far inferior to <hi>How,</hi> and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis</hi> would crave pardon of him for abusing him, so as he did upon that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie; and for a recompence unto him, Mr. <hi>How</hi> should be preferred to be Teacher in <hi>Cretensis</hi> Church; Mr. <hi>Cretensis</hi> the Pastor, and Mr. <hi>How</hi> the Teacher; for belike humane learning is not now necessary to the Preaching of the Word; and sure we shall one day have a Book of <hi>Cretensis</hi> Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Confessions, and might have had it before this time, but that <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis</hi> knows not how his minde may change again, and what New Light he may yet have; and so he will stay till he dyes, that we may have it altogether, and without any more change.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Cretensis</hi> for all his wearinesse and indisposednesse to further labour of preaching, or hearing that day, yet was so eager upon his sports that he knew not how the time went away making a long half hour, reckoning half an hour for two hours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>Cretensis</hi> might easily mistake in this, and I shall excuse him, it being usual for men in their sports to think time short, and to judge they have not been an hour when they have been playing two or three; but I will spare <hi>Cretensis</hi> and animadvert no farther for present, neither on the story nor on his Animadversions upon it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as for that <hi>Cretensis</hi> brings by way of excuse, some Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians played with him, &amp;c. I Answer, it was their fault and sin, neither will I go about to plead for <hi>Baal,</hi> nor palliate excuse things that are evil in Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, as <hi>Cretensis</hi> doth all kind of horrid Blasphemies and Heresies in his Sectaries: however <hi>Cretensis</hi> is never the lesse in fault because of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and indeed <hi>Cretensis</hi> being a Minister, should have given them (being private Christians) better example, besides who knows but <hi>Cretensis</hi> example drew these Presbyterians to it, and further 'tis likely these Presbyterians had been in the afternoon at some Presbyterian Church, offered up to God both a morning and evening sacrifice of thanksgiving, came from home later then <hi>Cretensis</hi> and his Brethren, neither doth <hi>Cretensis</hi> say the Presbyterians came forth with him, but as he tels his own tale, he relates that after his walking about a quarter of a mile (which might be a mile, as well as his half hours bowling two hours) and after his coming into the Garden, and sitting about half an hour in an Arbour (which we may well reckon for an hour to) came in some <hi>of Master Edwards judgement</hi> of Church-Government; all which being considered, makes the matter not so bad in the Prebyterians as in <hi>Cretensis,</hi> but supposing all this, yet I will not excuse them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, as for that story of one of the Assembly with three more of his com—or sub<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Presbyters, rather four Ministers in all (expressed by <hi>Cretensis</hi> all a long in a scoffing, yea in a prophane manner; bringing in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Gods providence to make up his jefts and jeers) spending a whole afternoon upon a day of Thanksgiving in fishing. I greatly blame them, and if there was any such thing, they have cause to be ashamed of it as well as you for your bowling; and it had been fitter for them four Ministers to have been fishing for the souls of men, preaching somewhere in the afternoon, then a catching of Roaches; and thus you see <hi>Cretensis</hi> I am impartial, not (like the Independents) excusing all things in Presbyterians as they in Sectaries though never so vilde, and therefore your Proverb of <hi>Presbyterians having a priviledge to steal Horses</hi> holds not as you see, for I am against a <hi>Toleration of them to look on.</hi>

                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:99332:81"/>Fourthly, As for your threats of discovering Presbyterian mistakes in the night, and to leave the world to judge whether they be not worse then Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents bowling on dayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of the story of a Presbyterian Angel which you will clap to my mouth, and stop it for ever: I answer, do your worst, discover what <hi>Presbyterian mistakes in the night</hi> you can, and tell what stories you please of a <hi>Presbyterian Angel,</hi> I fear you not, it will not stop my month: I blesse God, he who <hi>keepeth the feet of his Saints,</hi> hath so preserved me, that I care not what all the Sectaries under Heaven can say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, I blesse God, I have whereof to rejoyce and glory before men (though before God I know my manifold weaknesses and transgressions, and have nothing to glory in but the free mercy of God, and the righteousnesse of Jesus Christ) and therefore <hi>Cretensis</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> you mean me, by <hi>mistakes in the night, and by Presbyterian Angel</hi> (as your words seem to infinuate, speaking unto me, and the Reader may be apt to take your meaning so) speak out, do your worst, I defie you and all your company to prove any such things, or but the suspition of them; for I must tell you <hi>Cretensis,</hi> I have ever since I came to be a Preacher of the Gospel walked by that rule of the Apostle, <hi>Providing honest things, not only in sight of the Lord, but in the sight of men</hi>: And as for other Presbyterian Ministers, if any of them have walked loosely and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously, let them look to it, I will be no Patron for them, neither will I have my mouth stopped from opening the Errors, Heresies, Practises of the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or laying open by name Impostors and Seducers, to gratifie the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of somthing soul in a Presbyterian, let them bear the shame of it for all me, and give God glory in confessing; only I would desire <hi>Cretensis</hi> and the Reader to observe the difference between my Discourse of Errors, Heresies, and Practises in Sectaries, and <hi>Cretensis</hi> discovery threatned.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Cretensis</hi> Discovery will be out of revenge, malice, because the Errors of the Sectaries are laid open, and which otherwise he implies should not have been discovered, and if I would cease laying open the Errors of the times, those stories should never have come to light; but now my Catalogue was and is purely out of conscience, not out of ill-will to any man, but to preserve many from falling, and to recover others before they are gone too far.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Errors, Practises, wayes which I lay down throughout my Book, are the very principles and wayes of the Sectaries as such Sectaries, either being their Opinions, or flowing necessarily from them, or are means made use of by them to increase their way, compasse their designs, whereas any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal miscarriages of the Presbyterians are far from falling under any such considerations; but the fruits of the flesh and Satan taking advantage upon them, of which things they have no fruit, but are ashamed and have repented.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:99332:82"/>3. These Errors and Practises in the Sectaries are now found in them, cleaving to them since, and not before they turn'd Sectaries, whereas these miscarriages of the Presbyterians, are not now upon them, nor never since they were Presbyterians, but may be many years before, when Episcopal and foolish.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Independents and Sectaries cry up themselves and their way as a purer, holier way then other mens, making themselves the only Saints, the Paradise of God, the tender conscienced men, thereupon separating from our Churches, and accounting the Presbyterians as a dunghil; which kinde of notions among the people, crying the Saints, the Saints, tender consciences hath gained them more then all their Arguments; and therefore to take off this Argument, 'tis necessary to shew they are not holier then others, neither have tenderer consciences, but are looser, and larger conscienced men: And I ask <hi>Cretensis,</hi> when as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other Papists bring against Protestants holin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to others, yea since <hi>Cretensis</hi> Book came forth that denies the truth of this story; I have asked Mr. <hi>Randal</hi> of it, and he affirms it to be undeniably true; and for to evince the truth of it, Mr. <hi>Randal</hi> told me these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, <hi>viz.</hi> who were present when <hi>Nichols</hi> did maintain these opinions to Mr. <hi>Greenhil,</hi> namely, besides himself one <hi>Oates</hi> a Carpenter, and divers women; as also Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> could not stay long with this <hi>Nichols,</hi> being to go forth to some place where he had appointed to come, and should be staid for; so that thus far the story is without all question true, and I am confident Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> upon new consideration and rubbing up his memory, will speak no more such words to Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> as to wonder to see such a thing as this in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> Book, and that he knows of no such meeting. Now for the second part of the story, namely that at a meeting where Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> was present, with divers others, Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> did relate unto his Brother <hi>Burroughs</hi> this sad story of <hi>Nichols</hi> venting these opinions fore-mentioned, and upon that, how all the Discourse following related by me in this story of <hi>Nichols, page</hi> 79. yea more passed between Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> is as certain as the first; and for proof of it one Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> of <hi>Stepny Parish,</hi> a godly understanding man who was upon the place, and heard all, related it to divers in Mr. <hi>Bellamies</hi> shop in my hearing, of whom after he had made an end of speaking to the company, I enquired more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly how he knew all this to be true, and whether he was an ear witnesse, and got him to name over the opinions again, and to repeat other passages to me for the help of my memory, and for fear lest I should mistake the relation, so soon as Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> had done, I went immediatly home, and writ down in my Diary the whole businesse from first to last, with the day of the moneth, the place, and persons, when, where, and to whom also besides my self it was told: And further then all this, since my Book came forth, and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis</hi> Answer to it, though this story is branded by <hi>Cretensis to have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar forgeries in it, numerous beyond measure,</hi> and all <hi>Nichols</hi> Opinions related by Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> to Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> with divers passages mentioned by me to come from Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> at that meeting, all affirmed to be false, yet Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> (before ever I spoke one word with him coming into Mr. <hi>Bellamies</hi> shop accidentally, where when he came in some company were speaking of <hi>Cretensis</hi> Answer to my Book, and of this very passage of Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> under his hand brought by <hi>Cretensis</hi> to disprove that story) of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord justified the story of <hi>Nichols</hi> coming to Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> and Mr. <hi>Greenhils</hi> relating it to Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> with all the discourse following upon it, saying I am the man that told it Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and that in this shop, and Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> dare not deny it; for the story (saith Mr. <hi>Allen</hi>) is most certainly true, and all the mistake is of those words <hi>a meeting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded

Now I desire the Reader to consider Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> relating to me the first meeting where Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> was without Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> with the opinions vented then, and telling me there was a second meeting presently after that, where, upon occasion of a former meeting and opinions then maintained, Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> related the opinions, and all that discourse above mentioned, passed, but not acquainting me with the nature of the second meeting, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was of course every week after Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> morning Sermon, whether I might not well conclude (and cannot easily conceive how I could understand it otherwise) the second meeting to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by the first, as well as the second Relation followed upon occasion of the first; and though it were not just so, <hi>viz.</hi> a set meeting to that end, where all I set down in <hi>Gangraena</hi> was spoken, but an ordinary meeting where M. <hi>Greenhil</hi> took the occasion to declare as abovesaid, whether this mistake be a matter to be so much made of as to be branded with forgery, falsenesse, or for me to be cryed out of for telling a story having particular forgeries in it,

But before I passe from this, I shall lay down four things. First discover and lay open the equivocations and mental reservations of Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> given in to <hi>Cretensis</hi> in writing. Secondly, Mr. <hi>Greenhils</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> plain untruths which cannot be salved, no not by equivocations. Thirdly inquire into what may be the reasons moving and inducing them thus to do. Fourthly, commend something to the Readers consideration and observation from all this Discourse.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Reader may here observe the fallacies and equivocations of Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi>; Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> gives a writing under his hand to <hi>Cretensis</hi> concerning the story Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath <hi>page</hi> 79. of one <hi>Nichols and a meeting concluded of, &amp;c.</hi> saying 'tis <hi>all false</hi>; Now who is there that reads these lines given under Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> his hand but conceives that Master <hi>Burroughs</hi> brands this whose story of <hi>Nichols</hi> of forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as if there never had been any such man, nor any such opinions maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, nor Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> and <hi>Nichols</hi> had never met, nor Mr. <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil</hi> had never at any meeting declared to Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> and others any such opinions, nor never any such discourse in reference to those opinions had passed between Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Greenhil,</hi> as is set down by me; This is the English and common construction which all people (who beleeve Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi>) make of this writing, crying out, O what a lyer is is Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and what a lying Book is <hi>Gangraena</hi>! yea we see <hi>Cretensis</hi> himself, the profound Oracle of the Sectaries takes Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> meaning thus, as the Reader may perceive by his commentary upon the writing, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring from thence this story of <hi>Nichols</hi> related by me, so to the world as if it were all forged, and a meer fained thing, going over most of the particulars in this story one after another in his scoffing way, damning each part of it as false, and then passing his sentence upon the whole together in these words: <hi>This story is long, and the particular forgeries in it numerous, beyond measure</hi>; and all <hi>Cretensis</hi> grounds upon, is Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> writing which he received from him; desiring <hi>the Reader to make the computation, which he may do with exactnesse enough if he shall please to compare Mr.</hi> Edwards <hi>Relation with these ensuing lines which he received from Mr.</hi> Burroughs
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99332:86"/>
                        <hi>himself in writing, anent this businesse.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> gives a writing under his hand so couched and drawn up, making use also of Mr. <hi>Greenhils</hi> testimony to strengthen it, that all may take it, and many do, as if the story related by me were false; but doth Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> think, or believe so of this story as his words carry it? no, he knows in his conscience the contrary, only he writes thus to <hi>Cretensis</hi> for the present, because it will serve his design, and if his fallacies shall happen to be discovered, he hath so placed his words that he will have a back door to come out at, he hath all along so framed and penned his writing, that though it carry in the face of it another meaning, yet upon two or three words placed artificially he thinks to come off, and salve his credit from being branded a lyer under his own hand, and that is from putting all he sayes upon those words <hi>a meeting concluded of</hi>; which words <hi>meeting</hi> and <hi>such</hi> are several times used by him, (each of them six times a peece) and brought in at every turn and corner to salve him, all the weight of his testimony still referring to the words, <hi>meeting, and such, such meeting, such a man, &amp;c.</hi> which the Reader may easily perceive: So that Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> equivocation lies thus, he puts all the story upon <hi>a meeting concluded of,</hi> and speaks of the whole story still as upon <hi>such a meeting.</hi> Now there being no set meeting on purpose for those Opinions, but the meeting where these Opinions were declared by Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> an ordinary usual meeting, he thereupon in those lines given to <hi>Cretensis,</hi> doth not only conceal what he knew, but denies the whole story all along, such a man, such opinions; such passages, related, &amp;c. carrying the matter so as if the whole story had been false, because one circumstance in the manner of the narration of it was mistaken, and this is his evasion fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with much art, and studied on purpose to deceive the Reader.</p>
                     <p>The second equivocation and evasion at which Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> thinks to come out at to salve himself, and yet impeach my story of falshood is this, <hi>that he never knew such a man as</hi> Nichols, <hi>nor ever was at any meeting with him, neither did he ever hear of his name, or that there was such a man in the world</hi>; which things have been alledged for him by some of his friends upon my affirming the truth of the story, and that I should prove it; Now granting all this to be true (though some part of it I much question) yet my story is not made false by this; <hi>Gangraena page</hi> 79. for I do not in my story of <hi>Nichols,</hi> charge Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> that he ever was at a meeting with <hi>Nichols,</hi> or ever saw his face, only I say Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> and he met (which is most true) and therefore Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> confounds meetings, jumbles two into one, which I make in my Relation distinct, on purpose for an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; neither of the second meeting (which I speak of) where Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> was with Mr. <hi>Greenhil,</hi> do I say <hi>Nichols</hi> was there, but rather the contrary, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

down that Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> related to Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> and others, what had been vented by <hi>Nichols</hi> a few dayes before; and now I appeal to the Reader whether this be ingenuous fair dealing to deceive the Reader thus, by casting the aspersion of falsenesse upon a true story, and yet to keep a reserve to come off with in case of being chalenged? or rather whether is not this Jesuitical equivocation, and whether any Jesuite could, or would have drawn up half a score line<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, for those two or three last lines of Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> namely Mr. <hi>Greenhils</hi> asking him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he knew of any such meeting with that <hi>Nichols</hi>; this being spoken of in reference to the story of <hi>Nichols</hi> set down by me in <hi>Gangraena,</hi> that for his part he wondred to see such a thing in my Book, for he knew of no such meeting, how durst Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> say thus, and Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> give it under his hand to be printed to abuse the world thus; for did not Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> know of a meeting with <hi>Nichols,</hi> which I spoke of in my Book in the former part of this story of <hi>Nichols,</hi> where <hi>Nichols</hi> justified to his face these opinions, and which was the ground and occasion of all the discourse related by me in the second meeting? and yet Mr. <hi>Greenhils</hi> question to Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> and his own answer to it here set down by <hi>Cretensis</hi> as from under Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> hand, are so set down that every Reader (who will believe them) believes and takes it for granted, that Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> no more then Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> ever knew such a man as this <hi>Nichols,</hi> nor never heard there was such a man in the world, till he read it in Mr. <hi>Edwrrds</hi> his Book, nor ever knew of any meeting about him, or any of his opinions; and so we see <hi>Cretensis</hi> (though an acute man) understands it so, and vapors exceedingly upon it.</p>

It may be demanded and asked what should be the cause, and what may be the reasons why Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> should thus conspire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to give such a testimony in writing as this against the story of <hi>Nichols,</hi> which cannot b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99332:88"/>
as being at that time in so good a temper as to be affected with the evil of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and wicked Opinions.</p>
                     <p>Now of this I conceive these three Reasons: First, Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Greenhils</hi> earnest and eager desire of taking all advantages, and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to blemish me, and to render me a Lyar to the world, which that they might do, conceiving they had taken me tripping in a mistake (though no material one, nor nothing to their prejudice, and so no slander nor calumny, but making for their honour) they prosecute it, and improve it so far, that to make something of it (poor men) their ill-will and hatred against me, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and befooling them, leads them into Equivocations, mental Reservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Untruths, even to the wounding of their own reputations amongst all unprejudiced men. Secondly, a Design thereby to blast my Book among the people, to render it odious, to cause the truth of all matters of fact in it to be suspected, and so to hinder the good intended by me in that Book: Now Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> having a great name among many people, being accounted for men of that way somewhat moderate and among the best of that party, they knowing that their testimony, and that in the mouth of two witnesses (both being joyned together in the writing printed by <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis</hi>) might wound my Book, and from thence many would take occasion to question all, therefore they catch at the least occasion to declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against my Book. Thirdly, they do it to free themselves from suspition and jealousie, which otherwise they might lye under from the other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as if they were against other Sects and Opinions, and for a Toleration of no other Sect but their own, and were for the Government of the Church to be setled in regard of these horrid Opinions and Heresies daily vented, and for the coercive power of the Magistrate against Sectaries, which these conferences upon occasion of <hi>Nichols</hi> Opinions seem to import, and might give some jealousie of, and therefore to clear themselves from these, and to ingratiate themselves to the Sectaries, and the Sectaries to them, to assure them they will stand by them against the Presbyterians; they greedily catch at the mistake of a circumstance, and thereupon Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> gives a writing under his hand, so couched and curiously drawn up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that all their fellow Sectaries cannot but take it as if they denyed the whole, and as if no such words had ever been spoken by them about Opinions, and the necessity of Government and power of the Magistrate. The Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents strictly so called, are a very few in comparison of the Anabaptists, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians, Libertines, &amp;c. a contemptible party as of themselves, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in Armies, Country, City, falling daily to Anabaptisme, &amp;c. and therfore Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> being afraid they might suffer by this story, take this occasion to clear themselves by sending this writing to <hi>Cretensis.</hi>

                        <hi>Reply.</hi> I have much exceeded the nature of a brief Reply to <hi>Cretensis,</hi> having already gone far beyond the number of sheets I intended in this Reply to <hi>Cretensis,</hi> and therefore that I may reserve matter for my large Reply, I shall not enlarge my self upon this, nor the following particulars in <hi>Cretensis</hi> Book as I have done upon some others, but shall passe by what I could say to <hi>Cretensis</hi> evasions of passages in other pages clearing his meaning, &amp;c. brought in defence of Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> as namely, that Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> uses to say and unsay, affirm and deny, as the vanity and weaknesse of that distinction (as 'tis here applyed) concerning matters of Religion, and matters of State, as if an erroneous conscience did not make things the Magistrates account, but matters of State, matters of Religion, and the Magistrates also reckon many things to be matters of State, which many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences account high matters in Religion; all I shall say (and justly) of of many things delivered by Master <hi>Burroughs</hi> about Toleration and the Magistrate, is, what <hi>Galen</hi> said wickedly of <hi>Moses</hi> writings, <hi>Multa dicit sed nihil probat</hi>; and therefore there will need no great abilities to confute <hi>Achilles, Troilus</hi> may try his valour with him, by putting him but to prove his own Positions and Assertions; only before I end my Reply to this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I must tell <hi>Cretensis</hi> he forgot when he writ thus, <hi>Troilus will needs be trying his valour with Achilles whatsoever it costs him,</hi> that Master <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> had already tryed the strength of <hi>Achilles</hi> and four more joyned to him, Master <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> Master <hi>Nye,</hi> &amp;c. in his <hi>Antapologie,</hi> or full Answer to the <hi>Apologetical Narration,</hi> which was never yet replyed to unto this day; and therefore certainly if the <hi>unhappy boy</hi> were able (as many learned men are pleased to think) to make his part good with

four besides <hi>Achilles,</hi> he may venture to try a fall with <hi>Achilles</hi> alone; and therefore if <hi>Cretensis</hi> will once more get a writing under Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> hand to this purpose, and print it, that <hi>Achilles</hi> will in writing openly maintain his and <hi>Cretensis</hi> Church way not to be a Schism, and that it ought to be tolerated by the Supreme Magistracy of this Kingdom, I do proffer to answer him, and to maintain the contrary, and then leave it to learned men to judge which of us hath the fall: only I premise this condition, that both of us may, as in the presence of God, make a solemn promise to call in no second, nor to have any help from others, or to communicate our writings to any man, that so what we do may be a trial of our valours, and not of other mens: And for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of my Reply to this Section, had not <hi>Cretensis</hi> come in at the close of this Section with his <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Achilles,</hi> his Forlorn-hope, and his great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of confutations, but staid his pen &amp; closed the period at <hi>an erroneous consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be such; he had wrought little less then a miracle,</hi> for he had written one whole Section among 35. without either giving me the lye, or jeering or scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing at me, or abusing some place of Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the evil <hi>spirit that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his pen envied him the crown of that glory,</hi> to write one sober Section, and therefore <hi>for uniformity sake</hi> he makes this like unto its fellows, ending with jeers and scoffs.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99332:91"/>
as well as playing at Cards, are Grapes growing on the same Thorn; only I cannot but wonder at one fetch of <hi>Cretensis</hi> (indeed far fetcht) to salve the credit of his Brother <hi>Lilburn,</hi> That my reporting of <hi>Lilburns</hi> playing at Cards <hi>either is a false report it self, or at least a report of a report which is false, and so little better,</hi> which is to make all reports false of which a man is not an Ear and Eye-witnesse, and so nothing to be believed, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by never such credible Ear and Eye-witnesses: Now after this rate to be sure the story of <hi>Cretensis Presbyterian Angel</hi> which another hath to tell (some Independent Angel) is false, the story of the Presbyterians fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a day of Thanksgiving is false, and little to be regarded; for <hi>Cretensis</hi> sure was none of the Com— or Sub-Presbyters (though I am confident he would have fished with them a whole Afternoon upon a Thanksgiving day, on condition to have been a Com— or Sub-Presbyter with the Doctorate of the Assembly) The Manuscript of my jugling between <hi>Godal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> and <hi>Dunmow,</hi> is either a false report it sell, or at least a report of a report which is false, and so all the stories which <hi>Cretensis</hi> threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens Presbyterians with to make their Names and Reputations so many dead corpses, will be but either false reports, or at least reports of reports which are false, and so little better, for I believe <hi>Cretensis</hi> comes little among Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, and so cannot speak much of his own knowledge.</p>
                     <p>As for that particular of one of <hi>Lilburns</hi> eyes put out by a Pike in the street, upon which <hi>Cretensis</hi> makes jests, as that <hi>Lilburn</hi> is able to see and read twenty untruths and ten in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> Book with the worst of them. I answer, this passage, as also that of two Children taken away at a time from <hi>Cretensis</hi> are not made any thing of by me, or insisted upon to upbraid them, but touched only to shew their own folly in rash censuring of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians from acts of Gods Providence in afflicting, by giving instances in themselves: However, for the truth of the thing, <hi>Lilburns</hi> eye was so run into by a Pike immediately upon his Letter coming forth against Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> and the Assembly, as that he could not see with it for a great while, and it was feared, and commonly reported, he would never see more with it; but for my part, I am glad to hear he can see again with it; and the recovery of his sight doth no whit infringe the truth of what I have written, I expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing not how long he could not see, speaking only of presently after his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came forth; but supposing his eye-sight to be as good as <hi>Cretensis</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it, yet I am sure he cannot read twenty and ten untruths in <hi>Gangraena,</hi> and I suppose by this time the Reader by my Reply is well satisfied, that this speech of <hi>Cretensis</hi> is an untruth; and as for that jeer of <hi>Cretensis, That if I had not a great beam in my own eye, I might easily have seen that neither of</hi> Lilburns <hi>eyes are put out:</hi> I Reply, that lately in <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall I
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99332:92"/>
walked by Leiut: Col: <hi>Lilburn,</hi> and eyed him well, and could easily see a great blemish in one of his eyes which was not in the other, and so visible, that many a one in whose eye lesse is seen, yet cannot see at all; and I am of the minde, if <hi>Cretensis</hi> do but put on his Spectacles, he may see a great blemish in the eye, upon occasion of the Pike running in; but for my part, the greatest hurt I wish to Lieut: Col: <hi>Lilburn</hi> is, that he may not lose the eye of his soul in the wayes of Error, Schism, contempt of the Ministery, dispi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Dominion, and speaking evil of Dignities, yes, my earnest prayer to God for him, <hi>Cretensis</hi> and other of their Brethren is, That God would anoint their eyes with eye-salve that they might see and be ashamed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Lastly, for <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> a great Sectary, and manifestarian that hath done much hurt in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> which <hi>Cretensis</hi> denies, by saying he doth not more believe there is any such man, then he does that there is any woman-Preacher at <hi>Brasteed</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> &amp;c. and he believes me to be the greatest Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festarian under Heaven, there being no man that hath manifested that weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of judgement, that strength of malice against the Saints that I have done. I Reply, first the Reader may do well to take special notice of the bold impudency of <hi>Cretensis,</hi> who dares deny any thing if it may make for the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and 'tis no wonder he denies many other things in <hi>Gangraena,</hi> calling them lies, forgeries, when as he will dare to write thus, and to deny that which is known to many hundreds, and to persons of all ranks, Ministers, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Citizens, Souldiers. This <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> does much hurt in Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, some parts of Norfolk, Cambridgeshire; he is famous at <hi>Boston, Lynne, Holland</hi>; followed and accompanied somtimes from place to place, with many attending him; and I cannot think but <hi>Cretensis</hi> hath heard of him, and that he hath some Equivocation in his words or evasions, as it may be upon the word Sectary, <hi>Cretensis</hi> not judging any of his Saints Sectaries; or upon great Sectary, as those words seem to imply, <hi>A Sectary of that magnitude which he imports</hi>; or else upon those words, That hath done much mischief, <hi>Cretensis</hi> not believing that any of his Saints can do much mischief; and truly <hi>Cretensis</hi> may with as much truth deny there is any such man as Master <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> as deny what I have written of <hi>Thomas Moor</hi>; and that there is such a one, I have seen, and have by me at this time writings of his to the quantity of almost twenty sheets, for his Opinions, written by <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> himself, subscribed with his Name, to a worthy and learned Member of the Assembly: As also this <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> since these Wars, was questioned and committed by the then Governor of <hi>Boston</hi> Colonel <hi>King,</hi> for keeping an unlawful Conventicle at an unseasonable time in the night in the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Town of <hi>Boston,</hi> and for abusing and mis-calling the Governor when he was brought before him about it. Secondly, as for that jeer, <hi>There is no
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99332:92"/>
more any such man then such a woman at</hi> Brasteed <hi>in</hi> Kent, let <hi>Cretensis</hi> know for all Master <hi>Saltmashes</hi> bold affirmation in his late Book, <hi>that the contrary is known to himself and all the Town,</hi> there is such a woman who Preaches often both at <hi>Brasteed</hi> and other Towns thereabouts; and besides what the Reader in justification of this may finde in this Book, <hi>p.</hi> 24, 25. I shall adde this as a farther proof related to me lately by two godly Ministers of <hi>Kent,</hi> which is as follows. Upon Mr. <hi>Saltmarshes</hi> Book call'd <hi>Groans for Liberty,</hi> coming forth, and denying there was any such woman, who Preached at <hi>Brasteed,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the godly Ministers of <hi>Kent</hi> in that part of <hi>Kent</hi> about Town <hi>Mauling</hi> at a meeting of theirs, took it in consideration to enquire and finde out the truth of that related in <hi>Gangraena,</hi> but denied by Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> and entreated particularly a Minister on Mr. <hi>T.</hi> born in those parts neer <hi>Brasteed,</hi> knowing the Town, and the people thereabouts, to make it his businesse so to search into it, as that the certain knowledge of it might be reported to them at their next meeting, that accordingly it might be communicated to me for the further clearing of the truth. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> willingly accepted of the Motion of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and accordingly did act in the businesse, and at the next meeting satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the rest of the Ministers, that he had found out there was such a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woman an Anabaptist, who somtimes at <hi>Brasteed,</hi> and other times at <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum,</hi> a Town neer <hi>Brasteed,</hi> doth meet other women, and after she hath Preached, she takes the Bible and chuses a Text, some Verses in a Chapter, or somtimes a whole Chapter, and expounds and applies to her Auditors; and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> the Minister, who returned this relation to the Minister, knows this woman, and knows this to be so. One of those two Ministers who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me with this, being entreated to give it me under his hand, hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand given it me, which I keep by me to produce upon any occasion; so that the Reader may see both the one and the other, <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary, and a woman Preacher at <hi>Brasteed,</hi> and both true, notwithstanding <hi>Cretensis</hi> will not believe them, but makes a jeer and scoff at these as he doth at all other things. Thirdly, to that bitter, uncharitable, unchristian expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Cretensis</hi> concerning me, that I am the greatest Manifestarian under Heaven; <hi>There is no man hath manifested that weaknesse of judgement, that strength of malice against the Saints which he hath done.</hi> I would have <hi>Creten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> know, if I would give leave to my pen, I could upon these words whip him so as to fetch blood in abundance from him, but I will not write a Satyr, all I will say (though this is a desperate provoking speech, and I have much ado to forbear) is this, I dare appeal to the indifferent Reader, Whether Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> or Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in their writings against Independents, and against Presbyterians, have manifested more weaknesse of judgement, and strength of malice against the Saints: And to satisfie the Reader and my self, I desire

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides also, a godly orthodox learned Presbyt. of the Church of Scot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, <hi>Cretensis</hi> shewes his impudencie and boldnesse in denying that which I prove by a Petition of the Honourable Court of Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, wherein they <hi>in terminis</hi> (as <hi>Cretensis</hi> cannot deny) affirm it; and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, all men will iudge, such an Honourable Court affirming it, and that to the High Court of Parliament, is to be beleeved before one <hi>Cretensis.</hi> And of this businesse I know something, for I particularly inquired of some of that Committee appointed to draw up the Petition, and to make proof of things, how this particular was proved; and they told me, it was made apparent to the Committee of Common Councell, whereupon they put it in: and no wise man can conceive, that such a representative Body as the Common Councell, in a businesse wherein they knew they had so many eyes upon them, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies, (all the Sectaries mortally hating them for this, and other Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) would represent such a thing to the Parliament, unlesse they could prove it. The Common Councell knowes very well, the Sectaries want not friends to possesse the Parliament against them, and who watch but for such an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as to take them tripping, thereby to render all they present in this kinde as false: and if <hi>Cretensis,</hi> or any of his fellow Sectaries could have disproved this, 'tis a wonder to me they did not: When a Committee was appointed to hear, and the Citie to make proof of some of the foulest things mentioned in the Petition, why did not <hi>Cretensis,</hi> or some of his Church then, for the weakning the credit of the Common Councell, and the better bringing their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99332:94"/>
preaching-sisters off, come in, and alledg this as a loud untruth? objecting, that by the same reason the story of the preaching women might be false. But how true soever 'tis, <hi>Cretensis</hi> hath a good faculty, in all things that are brought against the Sectaries, to beleeve nothing; but to be as confident as twice two makes four, that all is false. Well, though I will not be so uncharitable as <hi>Cretensis</hi> was, to wish Master <hi>Goodwin</hi> might neither eate nor drink till he had proved what he here writes: yet I heartily wish, that my Lord Major and the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court would not suffer <hi>Cretensis</hi> and his Church to meet any more in their Conventicle, till he had made good what he here writes; which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, they may the more lawfully and justly doe, because he doth not only give them the—, but calls them <hi>Brethren in iniquity</hi> with me,, scoffing at a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mine taken out of the City Petition, <hi>But this saying of his need not be melancholy for want of company; it hath brethren enough in the iniquity of it</hi>: and who are these brethren, but the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell? O what an insolent bold passage is this! The Reader need not wonder at his foul mouth, and railing Dialect against me and my Book, who cares no more for this Honourable Citie: I doe not see how the Honourable Court of Common Councell can let it passe without questioning him, to suffer a man, who lives in the Citie under their Government, to abuse them thus in print. I am confident, if the Presbyterians lived in a Citie under a Magistracie and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, where the Governers were Independent, and should have abused them thus, they would have made the Citie to hot for them. 3. As for that I say of <hi>Overton</hi> and <hi>Eaton,</hi> for all <hi>Cretensis</hi> mincing and shuffling, I shall free my self from uttering untruth; for <hi>Overton</hi> said, after a boasting manner, unto two sufficient witnesses, that <hi>now there was an answer to my Antapologie, and entred into the Hall-book</hi>; and they apprehend him so, especially one of them, as that he took order to send me word (I being then in the Country) that an answer was certainly printing; and for my greater assurance, he had searcht the book, and found it entred: so that I and many lookt every day for the coming of it forth; and I never knew before now, that books were entred into the Hall-book, but just when they were going to the Presse. For <hi>Eaton,</hi> an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Milliner, I do not affirm, that he spake the same words which <hi>Overton</hi> did, for his words were spoken many months before <hi>Overtons</hi>; only he is quoted in the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rgin as an instance to make good those words in the second page of my Preface, <hi>Their great words and threats of an Answer</hi>; which were these that he gave out, There was an Answer to my <hi>Antapologie,</hi> and he had seen it, and the Author of it had discovered me to be a poor weak man, and my Book a slight easie piece, neither good sense, nor good English, or words to that effect; which <hi>Eaton</hi> confessed he spake before witnesses, since my <hi>Gangraena</hi> came forth:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99332:94"/>
that's all I say of him, or meant, and, I suppose, these are great words and threats of an Answer. Only by the way, I desire <hi>Cretensis</hi> to resolve me these questions, and then I will give him a good account why I called <hi>Eaton</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent: namely, What was the true reason that <hi>Cretensis</hi> Reply to my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapologie,</hi> being entred in the Hall-Book in <hi>Iuly</hi> last, and given to the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller to print, was not printed, but stopped? And how it came to passe, that <hi>Eaton,</hi> if he be no Independent, had the Reply to my <hi>Antapologie</hi> communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him to read and peruse? And when <hi>Cretensis</hi> hath resolved these que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, it may be, by the next, if he answer not truly, I shall tell him the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the stop, and to whom else besides <hi>Eaton</hi> this Reply hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, as to Master <hi>Sympson,</hi> and, may be, tell him what Master <hi>Overton,</hi> or his man, or both, have told a friend of mine, about the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to my <hi>Antapologie</hi>; as namely, what the Licenser did upon perusing of it, and of the Title given to it about <hi>The Accuser of the Brethren cast, &amp;c.</hi> 4. As for the report of some of Master <hi>Iohn Goodwins</hi> Church, &amp;c. I observe <hi>Cretensis</hi> denyes it not, but puts it off with one of his usuall tricks, That he beleeves, I no more know it then declare it. And indeed, this is one of <hi>Cretensis</hi> jugling wayes which he makes often use of in this Book; when he knowes not what well to say, then he comes in with <hi>I beleeve, he no more knoweth, and I no more beleeve.</hi> (<hi>Cretens pag.</hi> 48, 49.) And truly, 'tis some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what strange to me, that he who is so hard of beliefe in divine things, that he will not beleeve the Scriptures without reason, and hath preached lately with much earnestnesse and violence, that Faith is not to guide Reason, but Reason Faith, will yet in humane things, beleeve any thing against all sense and reason. But to put <hi>Cretensis</hi> out of doubt, that I know, and can prove what I say, I offer <hi>Cretensis,</hi> upon promise made from him and his Church, that the honest men who told it out of their zeal to the cause, and their rejoycing in an Answer coming, and to perswade the Presbyterians to the truth of it (who have alwayes much doubted of an Answer to the <hi>Antapologie</hi>) shall not be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the Church, nor looked upon with an evill eye, nor hundred by this from being taken into the preferment of being a Prophet, and preaching for <hi>Cretensis,</hi> I will name the Minister to whom it was told, and the members by whom; and for encouragement to <hi>Cretensis</hi> and his Church to make this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, I will for present name the first letter of the godly Ministers name, well acquainted with some of the Church, namely Master <hi>B.</hi>

For the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Cretensis</hi> Answer, how unlike it is to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the Gospel, and how like to one brought up in an Alehouse, or in a Bowling-alley, not onely on a day of publick Thanksgiving, but every day in the week, having their terms of art at his fingers ends, <hi>Score up, Tallie on,</hi> and such foul-mouthd language, <hi>'Tis a lie, You lie, A loud lie,</hi> every impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Reader cannot but take notice, and many speak openly of it; and that which makes <hi>Cretensis</hi> folly and insolencie the greater, and more to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by every indifferent Reader, is this, that he gives me the lie so often, in such a disgracefull, scornfull way, making the relation all over forgery, and that there are so many lies well nigh as words in the story; speaking also most confidently, though falsly, against the worthy Minister who told me this sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>That hee Works stoutly at the forge, and feeds both himself and the world with all manner of scandals and falshoods against the Independents without fear,</hi> and in the close vapouring and triumphing at an excessive rate with inferences drawn from his own confutations, as if all hee had said in answer to me had been Gospel; when as all this high and great building is laid and raised solely upon the weak sandy foundation of <hi>Cosens</hi> his own relation; <hi>Cretensis</hi> dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the truth of my relation, and sealing the truth of his own Answer in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99332:95"/>
seven particulars by no other way, but <hi>The man professeth</hi> (that is <hi>Cosens</hi>) <hi>that hee knowes no such man,</hi> and <hi>this counter information I had from the mouth of the said</hi> Cosens <hi>himselfe, and have the particulars under his hand.</hi> Now I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all the world whether any wise man would ever have made such adoe as <hi>Cretensis</hi> doth here, giving the lye so oft, triumphing so confidently in a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse meerly upon the information of a man in his own case, and whether this be not worse then <hi>to ask my fellow whether I be a thief</hi>; (<hi>Cret. p.</hi> 11.) namely, to ask a mans selfe, and upon a mans owne testimony to call an honest man a thief, and to declare a thiefe an honest man; especially considering, besides <hi>Cosens</hi> being a party, and in his owne cause, hee is a man against whom there are many depositions, and complaints against him for other miscarriages and misdemeanours, a Copie whereof I am promised from a good hand, and shall insert in my large Reply: But supposing all that <hi>Cretensis</hi> saith <hi>Cosens</hi> told him should prove upon further inquiry to be true, and not false; (the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whereunto I shall presently make apparent) yet no wise man can excuse <hi>Cretensis</hi> of a great deal of weaknesse and folly, to put so much weight as hee doth upon such a testimony, and to declare so much to all the world: Certainly great <hi>Cretensis</hi> is the greatest Manifestarian that I have ever met with, and there is no man hath manifested that weaknesse of judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides strength of malice against the Presbyterian Ministers and Saints which hee hath done both in this, and in many other passages of his Book; as to make an Answer to a Book, and professe truely he never read one quarter of the Book, &amp;c. and in my opinion these acts manifest greater weaknesse of judgement, farre more injudiciousnesse, then the not knowing <hi>how to range parts of speech in a sentence, nor to put the Nominative case and Verb together regularly in English,</hi> &amp;c. And for a conclusion of what I have to reply against the manner of <hi>Cretensis</hi> confutation of this story, I referre it to the judicious Readers consideration whether Master <hi>Edwards,</hi> for relating a story as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, upon the information of a reverend godly Minister well known, living also upon the place, who could upon no reason be judged to do it out of partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or for sinister ends, be to be accounted a liar, and to have the <hi>lye</hi> often gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, or M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> for denying the whole story, and affirming the contrary upon the bare word and relation of a stranger, a great Sectary, and a party in the cause, who according to all reason cannot be thought but he will speak fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably for himself, especially being such a one, as a man may, without breach of charity, presume he will speak any thing for himselfe in his own cause, when as hee did to mee in the presence and hearing of three godly Citizens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in his owne behalfe to cleer himself from all fault in this matter, that one of the witnesses who deposed, said, he was hired to swear against him, and had
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99332:96"/>
five shillings given him by one of the Justices, or some about him, and had three or foure cups of sack given him before he swore, and was drunk when he took his oath; unto whom some of the <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>March</hi> 30. Three honest godly Citizens after supper comming to speak with me, as they were with me <hi>Cosens</hi> came to speak with me, and was brought into the room where these three Citizens were and I spake nothing to him nor he any thing to me, but in their hearing, who will testifie this and more.</note> Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens then present with me, replied, he had best take heed what he said to accuse the Justices of Peace, that they should make any witnesse drunck, or have any hand to give 5. s. to one to sweare against him, and that this was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> likely, nor to be beleeved by any wise man; and I suppose if I should reply never a word more to what <hi>Cretensis</hi> hath objected against this story of <hi>Cosens,</hi> I had said enough to satisfie rationall men, by declaring I had my information from a person of worth, and by <hi>Cretensis</hi> nothing is here brought to infringe it, but only the parties own testimony, who is a man also otherwayes obnoxious, as I have already declared. Now from the manner I shall come to the matter; and for the Relation which I have set down of <hi>Cosens</hi> in the last leaf of my Book save one, I received it from a Reverend Minister who is Preacher at <hi>Rochester</hi> (the place where <hi>Cosens</hi> lives) and a Member of the Assembly, who told it me, and a Common Counsell man of this City, and I writ it from this Ministers mouth that I might neither forget nor mistake it, and read it to him after I had done, and upon reading, he approved it as his sense, and that which he had related. But now supposing there should be any mistakes in the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation made to this godly and learned Minister, yet I reporting it just as I had it from his mouth (he being a man to be beleeved) and as an information only, not as a thing of my own knowledge, I conceive I cannot be taxed for a lyar, not according to any acception or definition of a lye; and if I be in this kinde to be blamed for lying, I desire to know of Master <hi>Goodwin</hi> by the next in case hee have reported from <hi>Cosens</hi> a Sectary, a loose person, a man speaking in his own cause, any thing that is untrue, (which that he hath done I shall infallibly prove) how he will free himself from the same crime, and not more justly incurre the title of great Master <hi>Cretensis,</hi> then I the brand of lying, which he so liberally bestowes upon me. But to come to the particulars, for the first words that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens</hi> should say, <hi>Iesus Christ was a Bastard</hi>: 'tis confessed by him who related it (though he had it from a very good hand) that those words are not found in the deposition againg him before two Justices) but these, <hi>Christ (alas) he was a child, and you must not beleeve all the words hee said</hi>; and for the fuller satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Reader, I do here set down the Information and Deposition to tittle as it was taken before the Major of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and another Justice of Peace.</p>

                     <p>Now I appeale to the Reader whether these words related in this Depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be not Blasphemy as well as the other, and whether a mistake might not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily arise from these words deposed, to report the other; but to put <hi>Cretensis</hi> out of doubt that 'tis no lye, nor forgery to report such words, yea and more of some Sectaries, <hi>Cretensis</hi> Saints, and therefore he needed not to have triumphed so much in it: I will give him two instances of Sectaries, who have blasphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after this manner. The first is one <hi>Coleburne</hi> of Watford in the liberty of Saint <hi>Albons,</hi> a great Anabaptist and Sectarie, who spake these words, that our Saviour Christ was a bastard, and the first time that he taught was in a tub up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sea. This was found by a Jury upon oath, and was returned into the Kings Bench by Certiorarie, in Michaelmas Terme last. The second is one in Midlesex, who is indited at the Kings Bench, for saying that our Saviour Christ was a bastard, and the Virgin Mary a — with many other blasphemous words, which (being so horrid and filthy) I think not fit to make publike: This is found by the grand Inquest in Candlemas Terme last, upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of one of the said grand Inquest; and to assure the Reader of what I write, I have by me the whole Processe and particulars at large, which I fetched out of the Crowne Office, subscribed with the Clarks hand, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are so large, and I have much exceeded the number of sheets I alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this Reply, I forbeare to Print them; but if <hi>Cretensis</hi> doubt of the truth of what I here write, he may if he will be at the charge, have the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99332:97"/>
out of the Crown Office attested under hand. And for <hi>Cosens</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these very words,
<hi>Cretensis</hi> a little after (thoug here he denies them) yet confesses these words were charged upon him; though upon examination wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; else what meanes that passage of <hi>Cretensis,</hi> 
                        <q>the witnesse upon whose single testimony (originally) both these and the former words were charged upon him:</q>
Now what those former words were, I desire <hi>Cretensis</hi> to resolve in his Rejoynder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>For the second, that if Jesus Christ were upon the Earth again, hee would be ashamed of many things he then did.</q>
This second part of the Relation of the Information <hi>Cretensis</hi> calls <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a lye, and the second in order, and thereupon enlarges himself after this manner.
<q>For neither did the man (namely <hi>Cosens</hi>) speak any such words as these, the witnesse upon whose single testimony (ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally) both these and the former words were charged upon him, upon rexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and that upon oath before the Committee of the County, waved both the one and the other, as appeares by the said examination under the hand of the Clark of the said Committee, which I saw and read; and is forth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming for any man to peruse for his further satisfaction.</q>
Now that the Reader may see what <hi>Cretensis</hi> confidence and impudencie is, and that <hi>Cosens</hi> spake such words as these, I desire him to read what followes to a word, taken out of the originalls, kept in the Majors Court of Rochester.</p>

<hi>as it appears by the said examination under the hand of the Clerk of the said Committee, which I saw and read;</hi>
and is forth-coming for any man to peruse for his satisfaction; and I am confident there are more untruths in these seven lines of <hi>Cretensis</hi> brought to disprove one clause of one story of mine, then in all my <hi>Gangraena</hi> (unlesse mistakes in the manner of a Relation, as in the order or mistake of a name, &amp;c.) consisting of thirty sheets; and upon condition that <hi>Cretensis</hi> will promise to submit to this fair condition, to be willing his Church should be put down, and to Petition with me that upon proof of things by me, <hi>his Saints</hi> may be punished, I am contented to referre the determination of it to Authority, and if I make it not good, to be willing to suffer what the Parliament shall think fit; but by the way,

saw and read, and is forth-coming for any man to peruse for his satisfaction, be of so dark and dismall a complexion, that there is scarce so much as one beam, or the least glimmering of the light of truth in the whole body of it; what shall we think of those that have no such image or superscription of confidence upon them, but be only loose informations from Anabaptists, Apprentices, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in their own cause &amp;c?
<hi>If Cretensis</hi> Chariots and horse-men fail, surely his Infantry will yeeld the field.

                     <p>Now I desire the Reader but to compare this Examination under the hand of the Clerk of the Committee with what <hi>Cretensis</hi> hath written anent his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and he will finde <hi>Cretensis</hi> lines brought to clear <hi>Cosens</hi> from speaking
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99332:98"/>
these words, to have forgeries in it, numerous beyond measure, the whole and every part of it being nothing but lies; and for the further conviction of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis,</hi> I will go over his words. 1. <hi>Cretensis</hi> saith, <hi>neither did the man speak any such words as these. Cretensis,</hi> how dare you say so, when as before three Justices of Peace upon oath these words were deposed against him? is your negative te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony without oath sufficient to disprove it? 2. <hi>Cretensis</hi> affirms for proof of his words, that <hi>Cosens</hi> never spake such words as these, that the witnesse upon whose single testimony (originally) both these and the former words were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon him upon re-examination, and that upon oath before the Committee of the County, waved both the one and the other, which is all stark staring false; and <hi>Cretensis</hi> proof failing him, what is <hi>Cretensis</hi> testimony worth? Now if the Reader do but read this Examination under the Clerk of the Committees hand, and compare with that the first Deposition of <hi>Francis Tillet</hi> before the Major of <hi>Rochester</hi> and two other Justices, he must presently see it smels above ground, and that here <hi>Cretensis</hi> words takes place in himself, <hi>quot verba, tot mendacia</hi>: I desire the Reader to tell the untruths, and that proved upon Record, and not untruths made upon my saying they are lies as <hi>Cretensis</hi> are upon his bare words.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Cretensis</hi> avoucheth confidently that it was one witnesse upon whose sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle testimony (originally) both these and the former words were charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: let this be the first lie in this Catalogue, for 'tis evident by the Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I have set down, that there were two witnesses, <hi>Iohn Cosens</hi> and <hi>Francis Tillet; Francis Tillet</hi> who swore <hi>Cosens</hi> spake these words, and <hi>Iohn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens</hi> who deposed the other words; so that there were two witnesses, and each witnesse deposed not the same, but different words.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Cretensis</hi> here affirms the former words, namely, <hi>that Iesus Christ was a Bastard,</hi> were charged upon him; which if they were, and that upon oath, that was a good ground for the report; but if they were not charged upon him, but other blasphemous words, then <hi>Cretensis</hi> tels another phib, which is the second in order.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Cretensis</hi> positively (without saying I was so informed, &amp;c.) asserts that these words spoken, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Cosens, If Christ were upon the earth again he would be ashamed, &amp;c.</hi> the witnesse upon re-examination, and that upon oath before the Committee of the County waved them: Now how false this is, let but the Reader compare the first and second Deposition of <hi>Francis Tillet,</hi> who deposed these words against <hi>Cosens,</hi> before three Justices, and upon re-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and that upon oath before the Committee of the County swore the same again the second time, and was far from waving it as appears by the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination under the Clerks hand of the Committee which I have set down; and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99332:99"/>
now I might say to the Reader, <hi>keep tale,</hi> this is the third down-right fall, more then a stumble, this is a big lye with others in the belly of it; for first the former words were not charged upon <hi>Cosens</hi> by <hi>Francis Tillet,</hi> but only these words; and therefore how could he be re-examined upon that of which he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, nor was formerly examined? Secondly, much lesse then could he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on oath wave them; and for the other words which he was re-examined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he stood to them before the Committee, and is ready to testifie them still whensoever he shall be called thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Cretensis</hi> affirms that he who deposed these words, <hi>viz. That if Christ were upon the earth again, &amp;c.</hi>) did upon re-examination before the Committee wave them, as appears by the said examination under the hand of the Clerk of the said Committee. Now I might here say, <hi>score up</hi>; this is the fourth word of folly in <hi>Cretensis</hi> confutation; for there is no such examination under the hand of the Clerk of the said Committee, but the contrary to it, as appears by that examination set down already taken upon oath before Sir <hi>Anthony Weldon, &amp;c.</hi> and subscribed by <hi>Andrew Lydall</hi> Clerk Committee. This untruth may well stand for two, or at least be printed in a Capitall Letter, because he affirms a grosse lye, and a thing quite contrary to truth, to be under the hand of the Clerk of the Committee.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Cretensis</hi> proceeds upon this examination, that he saw it, <hi>which I saw</hi>; I might here say, <hi>Tally on,</hi> this is a fifth phib in this relation; for how could <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis</hi> see that which never was; but if he saw any such thing that <hi>Francis Tillet</hi> should deny these words, he must needs see something that was forged by some of his Sectaries, to engage him to confute Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> Book.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Cretensis</hi> further asserts, that he read this under the hand of the Clerk of the Committee: I might here say <hi>Cretensis</hi> still advances in his <hi>Cretian</hi> way, and this is the sixth flaw; for how could he read that which never was? and I conceive <hi>Cretensis</hi> will upon a review of what he hath written, cry <hi>peccavi,</hi> and say, I was deluded and quite mistaken.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And lastly, the said Independent confutation and assertion, for uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sake, that it may end as it began, or rather end worse, by rising and ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in untruths, affirms in the close of it, that this examination is forth-coming for any man to peruse for his satisfaction. Now Reader remember the account, for this is the seventh and eighth time at least, yea the ninth and tenth that this confutation prevaricateth with the truth; for in these words, this examination is forth-coming, there are many lyes. First, there is no such examination. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conly, then it cannot be forth-coming. Thirdly, not for any one man to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use, much lesse for any man. And fourthly, it can be much lesse for satisfaction. And I much wonder <hi>Cretensis,</hi> if you had seen and read an examination under
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99332:99"/>
the hand of the Clerk of the Committee, proving what you here say, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing this part of the story related by me of <hi>Cosens,</hi> and that tending so much to the satisfaction of any man, why did you not cause it to be forth-coming, printing it here together with your Confutation? Certainly <hi>Cretensis,</hi> had you seen and read such an examination under the hand of the Clerk of the said Committee, there can be no reason given why you should not have printed that, as well as an Anabaptists Letter written to an Anabaptist, and a writing given you from Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi>; surely an examination under the Clerks hand of a Committee, would have been more authenticall with rationall men to have convicted my Book of untruths, then a Letter of an Anabaptisticall boy, &amp;c. and therefore for my part, I am confident, <hi>Cretensis</hi> saw that in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation brought him by <hi>Cosens,</hi> which being printed, would have disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged his foul-mouth'd Confutation of this story, either contradicting, or rendring the whole suspected; and therefore he suppressed it, being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to blast my Book for the present, while it was new come forth, and much sought after; making account, if after I should be able to disprove him, yet he could not play his after game, either by pleading mistakes, and that he was so informed, or else by his Rhetorick and words at will, wrusting either the examination brought him to these word in <hi>Cretensis,</hi> or else these words and phrases of his to the examination; however one way or other to shift for his credit, and to wrangle it out, in which <hi>Cretensis</hi> hath a wonderfull Art and faculty by his wit and largenesse of conscience, to call black white, and to make <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet</hi>; and however <hi>Cretensis,</hi> to work the Reader to a belief of him in the confutation of this part of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Cosens,</hi> speaks of an examination under the hand of the Clerk of the said Committee, which he saw and read; yet I am confident he knew it would not prove what he here saith, and my confidence is upon this ground, because from his own words I gather he had this counter-information from the mouth of the said <hi>Cosens,</hi> and the examination under the hand of the Clerk of the Committee (what ever it was) was brought him by <hi>Cosens</hi>:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oretens. pag.</hi> 40. This Counter-Information I had from the mouth of the said <hi>Cosens</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and have the particulars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand.</note> Now I conceive that examination under the hand of the Clerk of the Committee which <hi>Cosens</hi> shewed <hi>Cretensis,</hi> he also shewed me, which I carefully read, and that in the presence of three Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, in which there was nothing in the judgement of us four to weaken this testimony of <hi>Francis Tillet</hi>; but rather by that, and the confession of <hi>Cosens</hi> himself to us, much fell from him to confirm the truth of this, and other passages in this story, which I presently writ down as soon as <hi>Cosens</hi> was gone: and for a need, besides my own testimony, those Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99332:100"/>
will be ready to witnesse also the truth of what then passed; so that by all this the Reader may see more untruth in one peece of <hi>Cretensis</hi> confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the story of <hi>Cosens,</hi> then there are pretended untruths, made by all the art and malice of <hi>Cretensis</hi> against the whole story of <hi>Cosens</hi>; so that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this I aske of <hi>Cretensis</hi> who is the lyar now? and I suppose I may more truly apply <hi>Cretensis</hi> own words a little changed, spoken against me to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: doubtlesse the man hath sold himself to write all, and all manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, that hee can but scrapple together from what mouths, or tongues, or pens, he cares not so they be but Independent in their constitution, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry any antipathy in them to the honour and good of Presbytery; and in case they be but such, 'tis no matter if they be Anabaptists, Seekers, yea loose drunken persons and Blasphemers. <hi>Cretensis</hi> by this Answer hath proved many things I spake of in <hi>Gangraena,</hi> all the Sectaries and Blasphemers closing with Independents, and the Independents with them to make one common party against the godly Orthodox Ministers and people of these Kingdomes who are for truth and peace.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Cretensis</hi> proceeds to infringe the truth of my Relation of the story of <hi>Cosens</hi> in five other particulars; but by this part of the story which I have made good, and the many particulars wherein I have disproved <hi>Cretensis,</hi> especially considering 'tis all of the same complexion, <hi>Cosens</hi> information being the sole ground whereupon <hi>Cretensis</hi> goes, (as he confesses <hi>pag.</hi> 40.) the Reader may easily guesse at the rest, and my Authors <hi>I</hi> with the Records produced, are more authentick then <hi>Cosens</hi> bare <hi>no</hi>; therefore for present I shall not enlarge further upon the third, fourth, fifth heads of <hi>Cretensis,</hi> but reserve to my full Reply the whole Relation of <hi>Cosens</hi> being bound over by the Justices upon these blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies attested against him to the Sessions, and of his being imprisoned for speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words against a Member of the House of Commons, dwelling in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of the complaint for his blasphemies against Christ exhibited to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder of Rochester, and of the Recorders binding him to his good behaviour out of the pious sense he had of the wrong done to Christ, and the words he spake to him, and of his addresse to the Committee of Kent for a review of these Depositions, &amp;c. only there seems to be some interfering between the third and fourth branch of <hi>Cretensis</hi> confutation; <hi>Cretensis</hi> denying <hi>Cosens</hi> to be ever under any restraint, or needing any order from any in place, or to any in place to release <hi>Cosens,</hi> in reference to his blasphemies; and yet he saith presently after, upon the fight of the fore-mentioned examination taken upon oath before the Committee, by the Justices the man was discharged: Now I demand, What was he discharged from? and whether was not this discharging of the man a releasing of the man? <hi>Oportet</hi> Cretensem <hi>esse memorem.</hi>

                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:99332:100"/>4. As to <hi>Cretensis</hi> sixt branch, calling that part of the relation of <hi>Cosens</hi> a loud lying Information: I reply,
'Tis a mainifest truth, and will be witnessed by many, that <hi>Den, Lamm,</hi> and <hi>Woodman,</hi> all three of them have preached in <hi>Cosens</hi> house, which is so evident in Rochester, that as the dayes of the moneth when they preached are known, so are the names of many of the Auditours that were present: and for proof of it, 'tis given me under hand from Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, <q>that <hi>Woodman</hi> himself confest it the very same day he preached before a Justice of peace and other witnesses, being apprehended by the Officers, and brought before him, who being thus convented gave it under his hand, that he would never again preach within five miles of Rochester: and though <hi>Cosens</hi> saith he knowes no such man (which we think, upon good ground, is a lie,) yet can he deny that <hi>Woodman</hi> hath preached in his house? which is the thing asserted.</q>
                     </p>

                           <hi>Cosens</hi> going to heare Mr <hi>Clare</hi> preach.</note> I reply, that as the first part is confessed to be true, so is the last as true, though denyed; for Master <hi>Clare</hi> affirmes, he said he would complain of him; and let <hi>Cosens</hi> be think himself what he said of Master <hi>Clare,</hi> and he must confesse it.

Surely <hi>Cretensis,</hi> if you had read Histories of the Church, both ancient and modern, you would have sound Hereticks and Sectaries, as Arians, Donatists, Anabaptists, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Arminians professing as <hi>Cosens</hi> here does, who yet when they have had opportunities, proved great persecuters of the Orthodox godly Ministers; and wee well know by many shrewd signes and instances, that if <hi>Cretensis</hi> and his abettors, who have so much pleaded for a Toleration, shall come once to get power in their hands, they will as much tolerate Presbyterians, as now they will to come into any place, office, employment Ecclesiasticall, Civill, or Military, where 'tis in their power to hinder them.

What shall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto thee,</hi> or <hi>What shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?</hi> This passage against the godly Minister who told mee this story, fils up the measure of <hi>Cretensis</hi> rage, lying, and evill speaking; and hee could hardly have spoken more untrue words then these, whether hee consider the man himselfe, or the manner of his relating it. In one word, the Minister who related this story to me, is a reverend, learned, godly, humble, retired man, a man who hath been many yeers of good account in the Church of God, a Member al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the Assembly, and a man far from forging, or feeding himselfe and the world with all manner of scandals against the Independents, &amp;c. and this Minister did not make it his businesse or work to tell mee this story, coming to mee, or ever intending to come: but I, going in London upon my occasions, this Minister accidentally being in a shop with a friend of his, a Citizen whom I knew also, I spake to them as I was going by, and they to mee; and so in the shop exchanging a few words, the Citizen asked me if my Book were come forth, or when it would: whereupon this Minister and I had some words about the subject of it, and falling into discourse, hee related this story to mee and the Citizen; which when I had it from him, the last sheet of my Book being either printing off, or quite printed off, I put it in a Postscript, as the Reader sees: and therefore let all the world judg what untruths <hi>Cretensis</hi> hath belched out against this reverend and worthy Minister. But <hi>Cretensis</hi> is a man that in all his Writings and Sermons falls upon all that come in his way, having no respect of age, place, gifts, sufferings, &amp;c. if they be against his fond conceits and Sectaries.</p>
                     <p>And thus, good Reader, I have gone over all the particular materiall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions made against my Book entituled <hi>Gangraena,</hi> by Master <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> Master <hi>Walwyn,</hi> and <hi>Cretensis</hi>; and I doubt not, but by this time, even by this briefer Reply, every indifferent Reader is satisfied, how unjust and false those outcries and clamours of lyes lyes, are, and how in them that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb

is verified, <hi>A great cry, but a little wooll:</hi> little cause, but onely the rage and madnesse of the Sectaries to see themselves and their wayes so laid open in the sight of the Sun. And yet I have not done with my Antagonists, but shall more fully anatomize and rip them up, and further justifie and cleer all things excepted against in <hi>Gangraena,</hi> which being lighter, are now passed over, or though spoken unto, need further amplification and illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In a word, there is nothing behinde untoucht, that either glances upon mee, or speaks for themselves and their partie; but I intend to speak to it fully, and am resolved (God sparing me life and opportunity) not to die in their debt. And I could now play the Rhetorician, and spend some leaves in running over all the Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, Practices, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. laid down in <hi>Gangraena,</hi> not so much as once offered to be dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though they be of persons and things here living, and acted in London, and neer at hand, and which <hi>Cretensis,</hi> with all his gatherings, intelligences, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations and presentations from Sectaries of severall sorts, Anabaptists, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Seekers, &amp;c. and of severall parts in the Kingdome, Kent, Essex, London, &amp;c. hath been able to say nothing against; and might, going from one particular to another, triumph over <hi>Cretensis,</hi> stamping the superscription of <hi>Truth</hi> upon them, and ask him, What say you to the 84. and 85. Errours laid down in the Catalogue? Is it not true that such things were preached in London? Whether is not that which I have related of <hi>Paul Best</hi> true? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not Master <hi>Burroughs</hi> and Master <hi>Greenhill</hi> preach bitterly against the Petition of many well affected Citizens for the setling of Government?

Answer hee hath informed the world how many lyes and untruths there are in <hi>Gangraena</hi>; the truth is, that hee and his fellow-sectaries have done it but faintly, and with the extreme dammage of their own cause: for all wise and unprejudiced men will acquit all the other particulars from the crimes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of lies and falshood, and conclude them all true and certain; for surely, if there had been any hole to have been picked in them, either the malice, or the wit, or the industry, or one thing or other of <hi>Cretensis</hi> and his associates, would have found it out, and not have spared me: so that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enemies bear winesse to the truth of the body of my Book, the things that are found fault with by them being but a spot here and there, a few in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, (if spots) and I may say of all the exceptions taken by my three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonists, supposing them to be mistakes, (though I have shewed the contrary) What are these among so many not excepted against, being but as gleanings to the vintage?</p>

                        <hi>Reply.</hi> As for <hi>Cretensis</hi> saying, hee hath <hi>onely for present given a taste of Master</hi> Edwards <hi>grapes,</hi> implying, hee could feed the Reader with whole clusters, and intimating hee hath a great deal more to say to my Book, as other passages expresse besides this, <hi>viz. pag.</hi> 38. <hi>I presume that Mistris</hi> Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graena <hi>hath not as yet paid mee the tythe or tenth part of her forgeries,</hi> &amp;c. I answer, I beleeve <hi>Cretensis</hi> hath said all hee possibly could against <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graena</hi>; I doe not think hee left out any thing hee could object against it: Whosoever reads but his Answer, and observes his rage and heat, his playing at the smallest games, and picking of straws to finde matter against my Book to fill up six sheets with, railing and declaiming against it, will not think hee gave but a taste, or a tenth. But how could <hi>Cretensis</hi> say
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99332:102"/>
hee had given onely a taste for the present, and not the tenth part, when as hee professes truely hee <hi>had not read one quarter of the Book then, neither knew whether hee should ever care to read it thorow or no?</hi> Could hee divine of what hee had not read, nor knew not whether ever hee should reade, that there was ten times more behinde? And besides, How could <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis,</hi> out of what hee knew not whether hee should ever read, promise the Reader to give him not onely a taste, but abundance? Certainly <hi>Cretensis</hi> meant the far greatest part of his grapes promised the Reader, should be gathered by other hands, and be (as hee saith of the particulars detected already) observed by others, and presented to him: and after this rate of the farre greatest part of particulars observed by others, and presented to him, 'tis easie for <hi>Cretensis</hi> to give Answers; and I much wonder we have no more of them, but that he takes almost two yeers to give an Answer to the <hi>Antapologie.</hi> And no wonder, <hi>Cretensis</hi> going upon an implicite faith, making an Answer out of particulars observed by others, without reading one quarter of my Book, not seeing with his own eyes, but making use of a pair of Independent, Antinomian, Anabaptisticall, &amp;c. spectacles to write with, the man is so much mistaken, and sometimes takes that to be great which is little, and that which is great hee cannot see at all. As for that <hi>Cretensis</hi> saith, that hee presumes by the taste hee hath given, hee hath convinced the Reader that my vine is the vine of <hi>Sodom,</hi> my grapes grapes of gall, my clusters bitter, &amp;c. I beleeve every Reader who is not bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Independent Schismaticall way, is convinced, that <hi>Cretensis</hi> hath said enough to satisfie all men, that his vine is the vine of Sodom, that his grapes are grapes of gall, his wine the poyson of dragons, and the cruell venome of asps, and that generally all men say of his Answer, yea, some of his owne party cry out of it, that it is too bitter: But as for my <hi>Gangraena,</hi> though <hi>objectivè,</hi> the object about which the Book is exercised be the vine of Sodom, grapes of gall, poyson of Dragons, and the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell venome of Asps, treating of and laying open the Heresies, Blasphemies and Practices of the Sectaries, which indeed are poysonous and venemous; yet <hi>subjectivè,</hi> the Discourse it selfe, and the way of handling those things, is healing and medicinall to cure the Reader of those stings and poysons, which by eating of those sowr grapes of the Sectaries they have contracted; and my Book is farre from being like the vine of Sodom, the poyson of dragons, that in writing of it I have plaid the part of a Physician, made a precious treacle and soveraigne antidote to cure and expell poysons, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, qualifying, binding them, &amp;c. laying open the Errours, Heresies, &amp;c. their evill, danger, and discovering remedies and cures proper for them,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99332:103"/>
which, were they taken, and the prescriptions followed, I am confident would prove the healing of these Nations.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Cretensis</hi> profession <hi>that he hath not read one quarter of the Book as yet; nor knowes whether he shall ever care to read it through or no:</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that <hi>Cretensis</hi> at once, and in one breath discovers himself to be both weak and proud, he shows his folly and horrible pride. First, his folly; for what wise man that had reason and common sense, though he could not <hi>Cretensis pag.</hi> 10.24. have * <hi>construed a peece of Latin, write true English, nor framed the structure of a period according to the common rules of Grammar,</hi> would have writ so? and truly this and other passages in this Answer, confirms me much in that opinion which many understanding learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have had of <hi>Cretensis</hi> a great while, that he is no judicious rationall man (as his followers cry him up) but only a wordy Divine, a multitude of words, that's all; that being true of him which was said of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> that his writings were <hi>verba, non res</hi>; but of this folly of <hi>Cretensis,</hi> the Reader may remember what I have written <hi>page</hi> 39. of this Book; and let <hi>Cretensis</hi> ever take me so writing, and I will confesse my folly.

And therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>Gangraena</hi> being found a strumpet, <hi>Cretensis</hi> will be found a lyar, and <hi>Gangraena</hi> a chaste Lady, and true Virgin; and it will appear (I doubt not, before it be long) when the time of the reigne of the Sectaries shall be over, and they no more heard of, unlesse it bee by way of a proverb and reproach, that then Master <hi>Edwards Gangraena</hi> shall be looked upon by all as a witnesse of the truth, even against Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries in the ages to come, and as a discovery of the wickednesse and vilenesse of the Sectaries of this time.

                           <hi>I have received severall Letters from particular Ministers in Essex bearing witnesse; and so Letters out of Kent to the same purpose, and from other places.</hi>
                        </note> O wretched man, to carry things so, as if Errours would doe no harme to mens soules, but a Book written against them, that will hurt and hazzard mens soules; which is all one, as if a man should say Strong poyson would doe no hurt, nor kill, but a precious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote will destroy and ruine mens bodies. And now, good Reader, I desire thee impartially and without prejudice to weigh <hi>Cretensis</hi> objections and exceptions against my Book, and my Answers, and then judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have not wounded, and laid this great <hi>Goliah</hi> of the Sectaries (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in defiance against the Reformed Churches) upon his back; and whether God, who chuseth the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty; and things which are despised, to bring to nought things that are of esteeme, hath not made use of me, a man so vilified by the Sectaries, <hi>a poor weak thimble full of dust,</hi> by the wind strongly blowing this thimble full of dust into <hi>Cretensis</hi> eyes, to blinde him, and befool him. And yet I have not done with <hi>Cretensis,</hi> but let the Reader look for what's behind, <hi>viz.</hi> my fuller Reply; and what ever in this first is either omitted, or not so fully spoken unto, in that he may look to receive more satisfaction. And I no whit doubt, but that, as I have now (by Gods assistance) made a good beginning both defensive and offensive; so by the same good hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, I shall in the next give so good an account, that I shal deal with this daring enemy, as little <hi>David</hi> with <hi>Goliah,</hi> stand upon him, and triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99332:105"/>
him, and give you his head upon the top of my sword: And in my next I intend to dresse him up, and set him out in all his ornaments and flowers, in his practices, opinions, and wayes of promoting them; in all which I shall render him and his name an abhorring to this and the following gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                     <p>Since <hi>Cretensis</hi> answer, there is a Book come forth, written by one Mr. <hi>Bacon,</hi> which Book is answered by one Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> (the man whom in that Book hee so often speaks of) and it is abroad in print already: What I spake of him in <hi>Gangraena,</hi> hee in that Book confesses, as his being cast out of Glocester, and his coming to London, &amp;c. speaking particularly of that which I touched only, and but in generall (as the Lords house in which hee lives.) And besides that, I heare one <hi>Web</hi> hath an Answer in the Presse to what I relate of him <hi>pag.</hi> 106, 107. which Answer, before it went to the Presse, by a providence came to my hand without ever seeking it, or indeed imagining that ever <hi>Web</hi> (such an Heretike and Blasphemer) durst have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in print, or been taken notice of to be in London, for feare of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing questioned for those things I have written of him: But wee may see what sad times wee are fallen into, and that the Sectaries are grown fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, that they dare come abroad and plead their desperate cause, as Master <hi>Saltmarsh, Walwyn</hi>; so now Master <hi>Bacon,</hi> and <hi>Web</hi>; which symptome, among many others, makes mee feare the night and darknesse is at hand, when as the wolves and the wild beasts dare come thus out of their dens; whereas when the Sun arises they go to their dens. The Psalmist tels us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.20, 22. <hi>Thou makest darknesse, and it is night, when all the beasts of the forrest do creep forth. The Sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them downe in their dens.</hi> Hence the Scripture cals wolves <hi>the wolves of the evening, Zeph.</hi> 3.3. and look as the Frogs croaking and making a noyse use to be in the evening, so the croaking of false Teachers resembled to wolves, the beasts of the forrest, and Frogs, presages the going downe of the Sun, and night coming. But because I purpose not to trouble my selfe with giving any formall answer to it by it selfe, I shall now give these Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions upon it: First, That <hi>Web</hi> confesses most of the things I relate of him; only hee saith of some of them, hee had recanted and disclaimed them; and I should not have upbraided him, but rejoyced in his conversion. But unto that I reply; Had not this <hi>Web,</hi> since his Recantation and Release, both in Citie and Countrey, vented many desperate things, and gone on in his hereticall wayes, I should never have mentioned them. Secondly, That this <hi>Web</hi> rancks himselfe in his Answer among the Independents, speaking of mee as being so against him out of my ill will to Independents; and I
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99332:106"/>
finde <hi>Iohn Bachiler,</hi> an Independent, not onely (April 1. 1646.) setting his <hi>Imorimatur,</hi> but helping him in his Answer, mending severall things in the Answer: as for example, For those words I charge him with, that he should say, <hi>For him to say he was equal with Christ, was no robberie</hi>; in his Answer to that, <hi>Bachiler</hi> helps this Blasphemer, and takes part with him: as for instance, whereas <hi>Web</hi> justifies it, that
<q>Gods love is the same in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto the Saints as unto Christ, and therefore a Saint may say he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with Christ, and count it no robbery; [<hi>in every respect</hi>] is blotted out by <hi>Bachiler.</hi>
                        </q>
And <hi>VVeb</hi> further pleading he might say, The Saints were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to Christ; next following these words of <hi>Webs,</hi> [<hi>As I conceive, the word of God to be my rule,</hi>] there is interlined under <hi>Bachilers</hi> hand these words, [<hi>Provided I meet with a faire and candid interpretation of my Words.</hi>] And so I could instance in divers other alterations: so that we may see the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents will not lose any the most blasphemous, Atheisticall hereticall men, but further them, and joyne with them against the Presbyterians, licensing their Writings, helping them to conceale, and deliver more cautelously their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous opinions. Thirdly, for that which is related by me in <hi>Gangraena</hi> of <hi>Webs</hi> speaking so wickedly of the Scriptures, he denyes it not, but saith to this purpose, How could hee say so? for he should contradict himselfe in other things which he hath said and holds: But to that I answer, 'Tis no new thing for such men as he to say, and unsay, affirme and deny according to the companies they come in, and advantages they think they have. Fourthly, To that which I relate of him concerning those expressions of his, <hi>We might not say, God the Father, God the Sonne, God the holy Ghost,</hi> he makes some shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Answer; but I reply, he spake so, and I can produce good proof of that and all the rest. If a Committee of Parliament shall be pleased to take notice of it, and send for this <hi>Web,</hi> and proceed against him upon proof, I am ready to produce witnesses, and upon his owne confession and those witnesses to make proofe. Onely I desire the Reader to take good notice of one expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in his Answer to this head, which shewes the ignorance both of him and <hi>Bachiler</hi> in the very principles of Religion; and is not <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiler</hi> a fit man in such a Kingdome as this, to bee a Licenser of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie Bookes and Controversies, who besides that hee is no Minister, nor well studied man, is such an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> as this clearely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers him to bee? <hi>Web</hi> saying hee acknowledges the Trinitie, the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, hath these words, <hi>That hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the Father is the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost,</hi> and to that purpose; whereas wee are taught from the Scriptures by all Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that though everie Person be God, as the Father is God, the Son is God,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99332:106"/>
and the Holy Ghost is God; yet the Father is not the Son, nor the Father is not the Holy Ghost; nor the Son the Father, nor the Holy Ghost. Now <hi>Bachiler</hi> passes this, and though he mended many other passages in <hi>Webs</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer putting in words in some places, blotting out words, and changing some expressions for others, yet hee let this passe without any correction or note upon it; which no man can conceive to proceed from any thing else but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ignorance. And that the Reader may know I speak these things upon good ground, I perused this Answer after it was licensed with Master <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilers</hi> hand, and compared the hand of <hi>Imprimatur, Iohn Bachiler,</hi> with the hand where other words were put in, and found it the same hand, and writ out with my hand, severall amendments made by <hi>Iohn Bachiler,</hi> which I have by mee in writing, and then subscribed my hand under them, with the day of the month when I extracted them out of the Originall Copie; and one being with mee, who was a witnesse of all this, I also intreated his hand to attest it, which hee willingly did: all which I can produce to satisfie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man who desires it.</p>
                     <p>And for the winding up of all I have to say by way of Reply to Mr. <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marsh,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwine,</hi> &amp;c. in vindication of my <hi>Gangraena,</hi> by this time, the Reader may see what to thinke, if among so many hundred particulars which are laid downe by me of Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, Stories, &amp;c. with so much variety, such a venemous virulent man, picking and chusing, catching and snatching, having Intelligence, and great resort to him from Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries of all sorts, and out of severall parts, as Essex, Kent, &amp;c. could yet finde so few things to question in <hi>Gangraena,</hi> (which yet also are justified and made good;) what must the whole body of the Booke be, which is not so much as touched, either by <hi>Cretensis,</hi> or any of the rest? And that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may satisfie any rationall man that there is too much truth in <hi>Gangraena,</hi> is this, that I have never been called in question to make the things good. I have beene informed from good hands, that some of the Sectaries have had meetings, consultations, and severall debates about my Book, what to doe in it, whether to complaine, or what else; and I am confident if they were not afraid that things would bee found too true, and very foule, and upon the through examination might hazzard the danger of bringing an old house upon their heads, and the punishing of many, they would before this time have tried all their friends, and party, to see what they could have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mee:</p>
                     <p>Having finished my Reply to <hi>Cretensis,</hi> Master <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> and Master <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> as before it I gave the Reader a fresh, and farther Discoverie of Errours, Heresies, Practices of the Sectaries; So I shall finish this book with matters
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99332:107"/>
of that kind, laying downe more Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, Stories, Letters, concerning the Sectaries, concluding all with a few Corollaries drawne from the whole Book.

                     <p>In my last Book I gave the Reader an account of many of the practices of the Sectaries, both more generally and particularly: and I instanced in twentie eight practices: Now, though there are many more behind, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause my Book is both expected suddenly to come forth, and is enlarged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my first intention, I will only instance in two.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They do deny and professe to many that they are no Independents, no Antinomians, no Anabaptists, but they are thus and thus, and will be so and so; and these are but reproachfull names given out, and cast upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, godly, conscientious men by the Ministers and Presbyterians, as Puritan and such like, were in former times by the Bishops; and of this I could give the Reader many proofs in printed Books of the Anabaptists, Independents,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99332:108"/>
Antinomians, as such Churches falsly called Anabaptists, &amp;c. And now there is never an Independent in England, if you will but take what themselves say, though they be such who stickle, act, work, vote, and by all wayes, in all places, where they have any thing to do, promote, side with Independents, Anabaptists, &amp;c. yet they will confidently say they are no Independents, they are of no Church way, nor know not what it is; nay, some of them will say they are Presbyterians in their judgement, or at least do wait and stay to see what the Results of the Assembly and Parliament after them will be; and yet there is many of these men, that let any person or thing come in nomination and competitition, that concerns Presbyterie, and they will favour, promote, further Independencie (be it right or wrong) and on the contrarie discountenance, hinder, obstruct the Presbyterians, wherein they just walk in the steps of the Bishops and their creatures, who upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions dsclaimed Poperie, Arminianisme, and when Papists and Arminians were spoken of, they would be hot against them, and were against Poperie properly so called (as the expression was) and against <hi>Arminius</hi> (meaning those points <hi>Arminius</hi> held about the government of the Church) not those of Grace and Free-will, &amp;c. and yet these Bishops and their Chaplains pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Arminians and persons Popishly affected, licensed Books tending that way, brought them oft when in trouble, would remember those who prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched against Poperie and Arminianisme; and it was observed, and I have been told it by a man of place in those times, who disliked such wayes, that when the Arch-Bishop blustered and spoke most against any Priest or Papist, and for the Church of England, then the next newes they were sure to hear of, was a Release; and whether there be not too many such in these times, who will not be accounted Independents, Anabaptists, Antinomians, that yet countenance their Books, are familiar with such, being all in all with them, bringing them off when in question, sitting hard on the skirts (when there is any opportunitie) of all those who have complained, or been active against the Sectaries, I leave to all to judge.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some of the Sectaries when they have been questioned, and in trouble, or been by some Ministers convinced, that they had nothing to say for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their way, have and will do any thing for the present, as recant, confesse their Errours, say they are convinced and satisfied, promise never to go about preaching or dipping any more; and yet afterwards, when free, and come to their companions, go on in their wayes, both against their hands, promises, professions; and of this there are many examples and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances among us, as of a Sectarie an Emissarie sent into Northamptonshire, being for his Doctrines, separated meetings, affronting a Minister in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99332:108"/>
Pulpit, complained of by some Ministers, and questioned by the Magistrates, gave it under-his hand to forbeare his course, and return home; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards goes to other parts of the Countrey, and drawes the people into houses, preaching to them, &amp;c. So some Sectaries of <hi>Lams</hi> Church, or their great Associaces, coming into Essex, to corrupt the people; and some of the Ministers dealing with them upon some of their Tenets, convinced them so, as that they openly blessed God for that dayes work, and the light they had received, even weeping for joy; and yet presently afterwards going on their progresse to seduce at another Town in the same Countie (some hint or notice being given of their late conviction) they said they wept to think how nigh the Ministers were come to them; and so I might give instance in <hi>Clarkson</hi> professing against the dipping to get out of prison, and as soon as he was loose turning Seeker; and so in <hi>

                     <p>THere is an Independent Antinomian Libertine Preacher here in London, a man much followed and cried up by the Sectaries, who in Sermons hath delivered these passages, <hi>That a poore whoore-master, or a poore drunkard cannot look into your Churches</hi> (speaking of the Presbyterian Preachers) <hi>but hell fire must be flashed and throwne in their faces. That if a Saint should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a grosse sin, and upon the committing thereof should be startled at it, that were a great sin in him</hi>; And in obedience to this and other Doctrines of some of the Sectaries of our times, I will give the Reader some instances both of words and facts.</p>
                     <p>There is a godly understanding man, an old Disciple, who told me on April 28. 1646. That having a daughter, a young maid, religiously affected, shee was drawn in to affect the Independents, and to cry them much up, and to follow them, and shee procured her selfe to be servant in a family of some rank and place, where the Master and Mistresse are Independents: Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, she expected some great holinesse and extraordinarie strictnesse in the family; but she found matters thus. On the Lords day they were verie loose, in the fore-noon they would go to heare Mr. <hi>Sterry</hi> at White-Hall, (as not living far from thence) but in the after-noon stay at home, and some other Independents and Sectaries resorting thither on the Lords day in the after-noon, they spent it in common discourse, making no more of it than other dayes; a great part of their discourse on the Lords day being railing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99332:109"/>
against the Scots, and against some of our Ministers, and the books written against the Sectaries; and some men (whom a man could hardly have thought it of) would curse the Scots, saying, A pox upon the Scots, would they were gone, we would give them any thing to be rid of them, and pay them all their money in time: many persons of note of the Independent Faction did often resort to this house, and still they would speak most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly and basely of our Brethren of Scotland: The Master of the Family would be often attempting to kisse this young maid, watching her upon the staires and other places, as going up and down, and hath tempted her to be naught, insomuch that the young maid spake to him, Sir, You have a wife of your owne, why should you speak thus? how dare you offer to do this wickednesse, and sin against God? Vnto whom this Gentleman the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent (and an Antinomian too surely) replied, ☞ That God saw no sin in his children, that these were but sins in the flesh, which Christ had satisfied for, with other words to that purpose. One time this man tempting her, threw her all along, so that she was forced to cry out, and her Mistresse came in to her rescue, and said, Fie husband, will you never leave these tricks? whereupon the maid would not stay, but came away, and when her father heard it, he would not indure she should stay any longer, but had her away presently; and so this young maid is converted from being an Independent and Sectarie, by beholding their carriage and loosenesse, blessing God she is delivered from that way and those persons: she had thought the Sectaries had been such holy persons, that there had been none like them, till she saw both that family, and many who resorted thither of the same way, so loose. This godly Christian tells me, That his daughter is ready to take her oath of the truth of these things which she hath both seen and heard, and with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny circumstances hath declared to him, as the names of such that resorted thither, that she never knew nor heard of before, with other circumstances; and that he believes them to be so true, as that they are past all question.</p>
                     <p>There is a Sectary, an Independent Antinomian Taylor, who stealing a whole yard of Plush from a Gentleman, and some yards of Sattin from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and being found out in his sin, and convinced, so that he could not deny it; some speaking to him how sorrie they were that such a man as he should do these things; he replied, (as I had it from two honest men of good account) to this effect, that he was troubled for them to see them sorrie, but as for himselfe, he was not troubled.</p>
                     <p>One of the followers of Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> the Antinomian, said it in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and presence of divers (Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> being then also present) <hi>That if a child of God should commit murder, he ought not to repent of it,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi>

There was another woman also whom he baptized, as a godly Minister that came out of those parts, and had beene at <hi>Braintry</hi> related to me from a good hand, whom after he had baptized, he bid her gape, and she gaped, and he did blow three times into her mouth, saying words to this purpose, either <hi>receive the holy Ghost,</hi> or now <hi>thou hast received the holy Ghost.</hi> At last for his dipping one who died so presently after it, and other misdemeanors the man was questioned in the Countrey, and bound over to the Sessions at <hi>Chen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some passages also in his prayer were repeated, as that hee prayed the Parliament might not cart the Ark, nor meddle with making Lawes for the Saints, which Jesus Christ was to do alone. Since <hi>Oats</hi> commitment to Colchester Jaile, there hath been great and mightie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to him in the prison, many have come downe from London in Coaches to visit him, as a godly Minister who came out of Essex told me: And I have a Letter by me from a Minister in Colchester, sent last week to a friend of his in London, wherein he writes thus; Oats <hi>the Anabaptist hath had great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to him in the Castle, both of Town and Countrey; but the Committee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the contrarie last Saturday.</hi>

out of <hi>vers.</hi> 7. he observed, All the Saints dutie is to believed and be thankfull, (he enlarged) Where's the humiliations, repentings for sinne which your god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ministers (you say) have taught you? Out of <hi>ver.</hi> 14. hee observed, The hand-writing of ordinances, the ten precepts faire written by the finger of God, altogether taken away. On <hi>ver.</hi> 16. hee observed, New Moons, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, meats, drinks, empty things; Sabbaths not to be observed, shadowes, and since Christs coming taken away: he said, we had deceitfull Ministery, Sacraments, Ordinances, meats and drinks, though their learned godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters had told them, that when they had consecrated them with their sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed garments on, they were holy, and were to be given only to those to whom they pleased, yet empty, and shadowes too. Afterwards, being asked what he meant by these meats and drinks, whether the elements consecrated to bee signes and seales to us in the Sacrament: He said, he knew no seale but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and for those things, they were empty things, and of no effect. Out of <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. That (there being three things in Baptisme, a death, buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and resurrection) Christ was baptism to us, and the outward sign needlesse.</p>
                     <p>The same person in private, in the house of a Reverend godly Minister, Master <hi>R.</hi> in conference asserted, That there is no Sabbath to bee kept since Christs fulfilling the Law, since no command for it in the Gospell. He being urged with places out of the Old Testament and fourth Commandement: He and a Captain, and one Lievtenant <hi>I.</hi> affirmed, those belonged to the Jews, not to us. 2. Being urged in point of prayer for forgivnesse of sin with the Lords prayer: The Lievtenant said, that the Lords prayer, when Christ gave it to his Disciples, was spirituall to them, but it is not so to us. 3. The same Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant being urged with <hi>Davids</hi> practice of bewailing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>in, and craving pardon, answered, <hi>David</hi> was under a double covenant, of the Law, and of Grace; we only under that of Grace: and though a believer should commit as great sins as <hi>David,</hi> murther, adulterie, there was no need for him to repent, and that sin was no sin to him, but a failing. 4. The Surgeon and the rest being told by some parties present, that they would believe that which their godly Ministers had taught out of the word: he answered, he doubted whether yet the word had been taught or no. Then the Surgeon asking what the word was: being answered, The Old and new Testament; he replied, He doubted whether those were the word or no. Then being asked what was the word; he answered out of <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.1. and told us, he knew no word but that.</p>

And hearing from him of some of his opinions, they told him by way of encouragement, ☞ he said well, and was able to say more for his way, then all the Presbyterian Priests in Dorsetshire.

                     <p>The Sectaries have within this two years last past, especially this last yeere since the Victory at Naseby, abused (in the most insolent and unheard of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that all kind of wayes) all sorts and ranks of men even to the highest, both particular persons, and whole Societies that have but any way appeared against them, or they think will not be for them, as the King, Parliament, the Kingdome of Scotland, the City of London, the Assembly, all the reformed Churches, the City Ministers, particular Ministers, and other Christians, and as in their printed booke, Sermons, Speecches, so by affronts offered Ministers in Churches, Pulpits, and severall other wayes, and that in the highest unsuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable manner that (considering all things together) ever was in any age since the coming of Christ: and for the proofe of this, a man might make a large book to set downe the pregnant undenyable instances and particulars in this kinde; and a man would wonder what should be the mysterie of it, and no question many do (though for my part, I doe not) that this last yeare, since not only the Assembly, but the Honourable Houses of Parliament have voted the Presbyteriall Government, declared to the world they will settle it, made

                     <p>And lastly, The Sectaries are so violent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferably insolent, that though they abuse <hi>persons</hi> or <hi>things,</hi> or do the strangest actions either against Lawes or Ordinances, if they be but questioned by any in authoritie for these things, in stead of confessing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99332:114"/>
their offences, submitting, and carrying themselves peaceably and humbly, they will abuse and miscall Authority to their faces, yea, set out printed books a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, reproaching and reviling them to the open world; of which I might give many instances, as in the case of one <hi>Hawes</hi> committed lately by some Justices of Peace, upon two witnesses testifying words spoken by him derogatory to the second and third Persons in the Trinity; a book was printed, wherin they are reviled and clamoured against. So upon one <hi>Larner</hi>'s commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about a dangerous book entituled <hi>Londons last warning,</hi> there is a book put forth aspersing the L. Mayor of London, the Committee of Examination, and the Right Honourable the House of Peeres. And lastly upon Lievtenant-Colonell <hi>Lilburns</hi> commitment, many Pamphlets were printed, speaking bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly against the Committee of Examinations, and the honourable House of Comons; as <hi>Englands Birthright,</hi> severall printed Letters, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Sectaries have lately put forth two pamphlets with a picture drawne and affixed to them, greatly abusing all the Presbyterians: The first is called <hi>Dictated thoughts upon the Presbyterians late Petitions to the Parliament</hi>: the other is the book called, <hi>Tender Conscience religiously affected,</hi> propounding questions upon the Ordinances of Parliament. The maine of the picture is an heart pictured, over which is written, <hi>Tender Conscience religiously affected,</hi> with some verses over that: and under the heart, with daggers at it, stands the Pope, the Prelate, and the Presbyter in the midst of them two, with a book in his hand, where <hi>Directorie</hi> is written, Antichristian Presbyter written by him, and the Crown under his foot, he treading upon it, and a dagger in his hand, reaching at the heart of tender conscience, but a chaine with a weight hanging at his arm, whereby he is hindred and falls somwhat short of pricking tender conscience with his dagger.</p>
                     <p>Now I could write a book in giving observations, and making a confutation of this picture, and these mottoes, but I must studie brevitie, I will onely hint a few things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That I have been informed for certain, and it was spoken of by some Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants on the Exchange, that in <hi>Holland</hi> the picture of an Independent is drawn, and set out publikely, and he is pictured thus, with God written in his mouth, the Devill written just upon his heart, and the world written and pictured as he holding it in his armes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It may be this picture of a Presbyterian will cause the picture of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent to be drawne here in <hi>London,</hi> set out with Mottoes, as also what he hath under his feet, &amp;c. and if it prove so, 'tis but just and the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents may thank themselves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the Picture it selfe of a <hi>tender Conscience,</hi> which they make the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99332:114"/>
Presbyterian lifting up a dagger to stab; I am confident the Presbyterians are as truly tender-conscienced men as any in England, yea far above the Sectaries; and for the Sectaries (take them generally) they are far from being tender-conscienced men, as I shall shew at large in my Treatise against Toleration, under that head of answering that objection, <hi>that tender Consciences must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>orn with</hi>; where I shall prove by many instances they are men of large consciences, and have consciences, like to Ostrich stomachs, that can digest iron, that can digest a generall Toleration of all Religions, can beare with them that are evill, or any thing that is wicked, so it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Catholike Cause; and in truth, in stead of being a truly conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious people, and going upon religious principles, they are a meere politike Faction, driving on strange designes, and having ends of their own.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Whereas they place the Presbyter in the midst of the Pope and Prelat, how might they more truly have placed an Independent and other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Independents shaking hands, and complying more with Papists and Prelats than Prebyterians, as I could prove by many instances of familiar passages and speeches that have passed between some Sectaries and Papists and Prelats, and some speeches again of Papists and Prelats of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, some wherof the Reader may find in this Book, pag. 16, 126.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That of the Presbyterian trampling the Crown under his feet, is a most wicked lye, and confuted in the sight of the Sun, by the experience of thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Presbyterians may do well to take notice, that the Sequestration of their estates, and hanging at Tyburn, was designed and counted good enough for them, if some Independents and Sectaries might have had their will.

                              </note> your Letter coming to my hand, I take notice of an Information handed to you, wherein I wish there were not so much truth. For your better securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I have procured the Examinations out of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and have transcribed one of them, which here I send you inclosed. At our late Sessions, this cause was heard, Our Recorder professed, that had he had power, hee had a great minde to hang the man for his Blasphemies; but in conclusion, hee was bound over to the next Sessions: Touching the person of this blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous wretch, one <hi>Iohn Boggis,</hi> hee was an Apprentice to an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary in <hi>London,</hi> and came downe hither with (your good friend) Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Hobson,</hi> as his Chyrurgion. Soone after his coming into these parts hee turned Preacher; and so in a little time seducing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seduced, hee came from Antinomianisme and Anabaptisme, to this desperate height of Atheisme. Your great Rabbi <hi>Oats</hi> told mee before his face, that M. <hi>Boggis</hi> might be his Master, notwithstanding his youth; and so highly extolled him, as if hee had beene <hi>Adam Hamagnalah.</hi> One passage more I shall acquaint you with. About a yeer since or somewhat more, this <hi>Boggis</hi> with <hi>Oats,</hi> (then of <hi>Norwich</hi>) and one <hi>Lockier</hi> a Ring-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Anabaptists in this town came to my house, desiring some discourse with me for their pretended satisfaction. Providence so ordered it, that M. <hi>W.</hi> my fellow Minister, and one other, were with me at the present. Thus three to three we fell into debate (amongst other matters) about the power of the Magistrate in inflicting capital punishments, and taking away of life. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Oats</hi> (to whom the rest agreed) peremptorily affirmed, and stood to maintaine, That there was no such power in any Christian Magistrate over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Member of a Church, unlesse first he was cast out of the Church, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Secular power; no, whatever his offence was, though <hi>Murther or Treason.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>His Argument was, That all Church-Members were the Temple of God, <hi>and who so destroyeth the Temple of God, him shall God destroy.</hi> Being pressed with the Authority of that Text, <hi>He that sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed,</hi> hee and the rest cryed out, what had they to do with <hi>Moses?</hi> They were Christs Disciples, not <hi>Moses</hi> Disciples. Being minded of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of this Law before <hi>Moses</hi> his time, they replyed, it was all one being

part of the Old Testament. Withall <hi>Oats</hi> added, that that Law was fulfilled; demanding of him how, he answered, in and by Christ <hi>In as much</hi> (said hee) <hi>as Christ shed his blood, my blood is shed already; for</hi> (saith he) <hi>Christs blood is my blood, and my blood is Christs blood.</hi> At the same time <hi>Boggis</hi> being pressed by my selfe in some particulars, still his reply was, <hi>I have the Spirit.</hi> My selfe impatient of his arrogant boasting, told him. That certainly if he had that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he pretended to, hee would not so boast of it: Whereunto (clapping his hand upon his brest) he replyed, <hi>I thank God I have enough of the Spirit.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I having enough of him, told him, that the doores were open for him, and so parted with him. The Lord direct, and assist you in all your underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and make your endeavours successefull. With my prayers, and hearty salutations, I rest</p>

                           <p>As for <hi>Cretensis</hi> (so one of your adversaries stileth his Book) I finde him still a confident man, his Challenge of all the Presbyterians one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, assembled or not assembled in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, in that question of the imputation of faith in a proper sense, &amp;c. sheweth so much, and also that, that he may do it as well as you did <hi>Antapol.</hi> p. 117. To whom you may say from me, He cannot so well do it as you, because that as yet we see none hath accepted your challenge, whereas the strength of him is tried (in what he did against M. <hi>Walker,</hi> and his other two Treatises of that subject) and is found weaknesse; so that untill he vindicate himselfe, we have but the words <hi>militis gloriosi,</hi> the vent of spleen against Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and the Assembly, say, I could tell him Presbyterians and Independents assembled, have weighed that controversie, and found his opposition therein too too light. Tell him that (though the servant is not greater then his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, nor the authority of the Clark equall to that of the Iustice of Peace; and that when M. <hi>Gataker</hi> speaketh, M. <hi>Robrough</hi> may hold his peace, as he speaketh, pag. 26. <hi>Cret.</hi>) M. <hi>Robrough</hi> may say so much unto him in behalfe of some of those he thus challengeth, and tell him that he do no more with challenges, trouble those Masters, being in serious employments. It sufficeth a servant hath routed his forces, and is in readinesse (with Gods helpe) if M. <hi>Iohn Goodwin</hi> can but recruit, to meet him in that controversie in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever field. Blessed be God, he is much more inabled and imboldened to that by his attendance; so farre is he from being ashamed of that which he objecteth as a jeer: he is strong at that (as in his <hi>Recipe</hi> to M. <hi>Walker</hi>

                           <p>As for that opinion of <hi>Calvins,</hi> That <hi>Iustification consisteth in remission of sins,</hi> tell him hee needed not to call in witnesses, it is confest: The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is about the word <hi>onely</hi>; neither is that word denyed to bee in <hi>Calvin:</hi> but the qustion is, whether <hi>onely</hi> excludeth in his sense imputation of Christs righteousnesse (the tenet of Protestants;) or that of inherent righteousnesse (the Doctrine of Papists:) I deny the former, and assert onely the later against the Papists; and I appeale to his witnesses, let them give their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. Yet tell him, that in mine <hi>Animadversions,</hi> in answer to this very head, he may read it determined by many witnesses against him; by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> his adversarie, an accuser of <hi>Calvin</hi> (as he is for this,) by his own witnesse, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,</hi> by D. <hi>Downham,</hi> D. <hi>Davenant</hi> and <hi>Polanus,</hi> though he will not see it: <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 76, 77, 78, 79.

Surely, had hee thought of these Answers given him <hi>against</hi> his opinions <hi>for</hi> mine, that they are to bee seene in the world, hee would never have made so loud a challenge, neither yet have spent time in repetition of these testimonies; for the determining of which between us, I appeal to all the world,

                           <head>A copie of a Letter lately written to me from a godly Minister in the West of England.</head>
                           <p>WOrthy Sir, whom (though unknown to me by sight) I love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for your love to truth, and for your zeale against the spreading infectious Errours of these times, wherein we once hoped for better things. I wrote to Master <hi>F.</hi> of some discoveries that were made to me by some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from Anabaptisme, concerning the workings of Satan to and in that way, being much affected with the relations they first gave me by word of mouth: I desired them to commit their experiences to paper while the remembrance of them was fresh with them, that they might be able here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after as well as at present, to tell what the Lord had done for their soules, in breaking such a dangerous snare as Satan with so much art and subtilty had laid for them: This upon perswasion they did, and at last gave me in about two sheets of paper close written, wherein they discover not only how the snare was laid for them, and how they were first caught and intangled with a liking of the novelty of Anabaptisme, but being caught, how they were carried on to it with the strongest violence and impulse of spirit that is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable: they also discover the sad effects and influence which that way had upon their spirits while they lay but under a liking and good opinion of it, and how it pleased the Lord to rescue and bring them off, before they were actually ingaged, and duckt into that seduced society. Sir, all these things were so fully and largely expressed in the manuscrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> I had from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that others as well as my selfe held them very fit to be published for the publike good; and supposing they should be, I was preparing some considerations upon the passages to come forth with them. Since their coming of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99332:119"/>
Anabaptists, they have found their spirits in a much better frame then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and out of pitie to others ingaged in that way, have endeavoured to reclaime them. And now Sir, for my own part I must needs say, it is much that I have suffered from Opinionists of all sorts in these times, and meerly because I could not be false to my Covenant (nor I trust never shall) by a sinfull silence, when heresie and schisme do lift up themselves against truth and unity. I praise the Lord this happinesse I have, though the unkind deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these men hath somtimes occasioned much griefe of heart, and weaknesse of body to me, yet they have not prevailed in the least wise to weaken my resolutions in contending for the truth; yea the more the truth is opposed, the more earnestly I hope I shall contend for it, though it be to the utter exhausting of that small strength of body which I have: I cannot sacrifice my selfe in a better way. I know it is not necessary that I should live, but necessary it is, that truth should live and be maintained to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of our power. Me thought it was somwhat harsh to me at first (till God accustomed me to the yoke) to suffer frowns, reproaches, imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all manner of hard speeches for the discharging of my conscience, and that from those whose professed principle it is that all should have the liberty of their consciences: It seems they would take liberty, but will not give it. If my conscience bids me to oppose some of their tenets and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and I can have no peace without so doing, how can they in reason de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me this liberty by their own principle? ☜ Surely it would be a sad day to all Orthodox Christians if they should be brought to stand to the mercy the Sectaries liberty. Some of them have partly well used their liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me in speaking, writing, printing against me, in the most scurrilous, rancorous, injurious manner that could be, and onely for preaching that, which if I had not, my conscience I feare would have preached against me while I had lived, for holding the truth in unrighteousnesse. Sir, I will not hold you with particulars, this place hath been a troublesome place to me, for which I know whom I have to thank. I wish it may be quieter to the next Minister that succeeds me, for God is pleased by a cleare providence to open me a way to some other place. Sir, being lately at Dorchester, the Town I heard was somewhat disturbed the week before by a wandring Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary, who had gathered a company about him, and preached in the Shire Hall (as I think they call it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) chusing that of the Apostle for his Text, <hi>But we have the mind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99332:120"/>
Opinionist was foyled by that worthy Minister (fitter to grapple with that Punies Instructors) was easily perceived by all understanding hearers. The godly people of those parts have been so well catechized and grounded heretofore, that the Opinionists complain they can make no work with them. Certainly the good old English Puritan (which Mr. <hi>Geere</hi> doth so well characterize) is the Novellists greatest enemy, or rather the Novellist his. ☞ Alas, how sad is the destiny of Orthodox Christians, that no times will favour them? We have not yet lost the sense of what we suffered heretofore by those wicked Prelats, whom God hath therefore cast out as an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Branch; and surely if all the Orthodox in the Land should bring in their severall complaints of what they have suffered since by turbulent Opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, it would fill the world with wonder, and the Reformed Churches abroad, who cannot but sympathize with us, with much heavinesse of spirit in our behalfe. Heretofore it was counted a crime to preach against pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenesse, as sporting on the Lords day, and the like; and now as great a crime to preach against Heresies. Only let me acquaint you with one thing I have observed, This veine of persecution for the most parts runs along in the same persons; they who most countenanced profanenesse and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heretofore against Orthodox Ministers, are the same men who under a forme of godlinesse, without the power, do now countenance Heresie and Schisme against it; but Sir, let nothing discourage.

At which this young man was so offended and troubled in his spirit, that hee (upon the place, and to his face) spake much against him for his blasphemy: This fellow still maintained it stiffely, and told this young man hee would powre out his judgements on him, and damne him for opposing and speaking thus against him.

                     <p>Many Sectaries have distrubed godly conscientious Ministers in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,

standing up in the verie face of the Congregation, and speaking to them, giving them the lye, charging them with false Doctrine, calling them Antichristian Ministers, and such like: Of some of these I have given instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in my late Book, pag. 102, 103, 104. And to add a few more, Mr. <hi>Andrews</hi> of Wellingborough had the lye given him whilst hee was preaching; and many Ministers have been put by preaching, and kept out of their own Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits by force of Arms, Captains and Troopers coming up into the Ministers Pulpits with their swords by their sides, and against the mind of Ministers and people: Thus <hi>Paul Hobson</hi> hath done in Northampton-shire, Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-shire; and thus at Ravensden in Bedford-shire a Souldier went up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the mind of the Minister; and here in London, the face of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, at Christ-Church there have been many affronts offered, as jeering and scoffing in the midst of the Sermons, speaking loud against things deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, to the disturbance of those who have sate neer: and now lately at Christ-Church, on Tuesday the 20. of April, just upon concluding my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and going to my last Prayer, up stands one Colonell <hi>Washington</hi> of Hartford-shire, (so his name and place is related to be) and spake openly against what I had preached, that I had not rightly given the sense of that Parable of the Tares, and that I was a false Prophet, or <hi>Beware of false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Now if the Sectaries will do thus to the Presbyterians whilst they are in their minoritie, and underlings, what will they do when they come to be in their Kingdome, to be encreased in number and power above the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians? But now on the other hand, let Independents and Sectaries give any one instance that the Presbyterians, when they have come to hear them preach, (though they have preached their erroneous opinions, and for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of conscience, and against Presbyterians, and all this in the Presbyterians Pulpits and Churches) that ever the Presbyterians have stood up and made disturbance in the publike Assemblies, or carried themselves uncivilly and scoffingly in Sermon time towards them.</p>
                     <p>There is one <hi>Gorton,</hi> who was a great Sectarie in New-England, holding many desperate opinions there; a copie of which, given by Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of New-England (that writ the Book called <hi>The bloudy Tenet</hi>) unto a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Minister now at London, I have seen and perused.

                     <p>There is one <hi>Iohn Durance</hi> an Independent, (whom I mentioned a little before) who preaches a Lecture on the week day at Sandwich in Kent, and hath a Lecture at Canterbury too, and would have had a Lecture also at Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for the farther spreading of Independency: but by the godly Ministers of Dover opposing it, and writing up to London against him, such meanes were used, as he was put by, and kept from coming thither: Now among many other of his pranks,<note place="margin">

                        </note> the Reader may take notice of these; He hath at Sandwich in the Church publikely prayed to God two or three severall times, that the King might be brought up in chains to the Parliament: upon which prayer, one or two of Sandwich went to M. <hi>Durance,</hi> to know what his meaning was in that prayer: upon putting the question, M. <hi>Symonds,</hi> an Independent Minister in the same towne, and his great friend (but more politick) being with him, answered, M. <hi>Durance</hi> meaning was that the King might bee brought up in chaines of gold: whereupon M. <hi>Durance</hi> replyed, that was none of his meaning; but he meant, he might be brought in chains of Iron. In a Sermon one time this <hi>Durance</hi> told the people hee was sorrie he had spent so much time, or lost so much time in reading or turning over the Fathers: and yet he said he honoured the Fathers as much as anie man. This man after his preaching at Canterburie, hath the use of a great roome neare the Cathedrall, where manie resort to him; and he takes occasion to build them up in Independency. Not long since M. <hi>Durance,</hi> on his Lecture-day, just before the last day of publike Thanksgiving in the Countrey, preaching in one of the Churches in Sandwich, told the people he would finish the Text he was then preaching upon on the Thanksgiving day, and that in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, in a private house: whereupon, when he had done, M. <hi>Sherwood</hi> a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99332:121"/>
godly Minister in whose Church he preached, turned himselfe to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, saying, Mr. <hi>Durance,</hi> you shall not need to do so, you shall have the libertie of my Pulpit, I here offer it you; and if you may have libertie of the publike Church, I hope you will not go into corners. VVhereunto Master <hi>Durance</hi> publikely replyed, hee would not preach in the Church, but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved of his way; and accordingly in the afternoon, when the people went to the publike exercises to Church, Mr. <hi>Durance</hi> went to a private house, and two or three hundred people after him, to heare him preach in private.</p>

much crossed and troubled to to see things as they are; The <hi>Scots</hi> have beene sorely visited with Sword, Pestilence in their own Land, obstructed, reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, evill intreated by many in this Land: the Assembly, the godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and people of the Kingdome, despised, scorned and abused severall wayes, yea, deserted, and looked upon with an evill eye, as if the troublers of <hi>Israel,</hi> and worse then Malignants, so that they have beene forced manie a time to cry out to God, Heare O our God, for we are reproached; Now great prosperitie, successe in a bad way, and in the use of bad meanes, as lyes, scandalous reports, under-minings, plottings, false-dealings, &amp;c. is a great Symptome of destruction both to particular persons, and to a partie: whom God intends certainely to destroy, he fattens before, and lets them bee verie happie, thereby to prepare them for the day of slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: whom hee meanes to doe good unto in the latter end and deliver, he afflicts and laies them low before, laies the Foundation deep that he may build high, and for this let the Reader consult with these foure places of Scripture, <hi>Ier.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.7, <hi>and</hi> 10.35, 36. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.3, 4, 5. <hi>and</hi> 18, 19, 20. <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 7. the sum of all which places is to teach us, that the more men prosper in a bad way, and flourish more then ordinarie, having what their hearts can wish, bringing all their devices to passe, the more sure they are of being puld out as sheep for the slaughter, and prepared for the day of slaughter, and that within a little while, they shall not bee, nor their place found, but brought to desolation as in a moment, and utterly consumed; and then when they are at their height of flourishing, then is it that they shall be destroyed for ever; great prosperitie is but a lightening before death, and as a great calm which presages the more dreadfull storme and tempest.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The great plotting of the Sectaries, laying their counsells deep, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and working continually night and day by all kinde of waies and means, and all kind of instruments to effect their worke, and to carrie on their way; I do not think this manie hundred yeares there hath been a more cunning, plotting, undermining generation in the Church of God then our Sectaries, or more plots and devices of all sorts on foot, more irons in the fire within so few years, as hath been, and is among them: there's nothing they doe but they have a design in it, they conceive many plots at once to effect it, they have plot upon plot, and lay snare upon snare: <hi>Machiavel</hi> and the Jesuits are but punies and fresh men to them. I am confident they had so laid their plots, cut out their way, removed the rubs, prepared all things, so as that they had set their time, by which they should effect their ends, and speak out what they would have: Now God delights to bring to naught plots, to disappoint the devices of mens hearts, to blast and blow upon tricks and under-boord

workings, to take the wise in their own craftinesse, and wherein men deale proudly to be above them: the ripening, growing big of plots, is commonly the fore-runner of the downfall of the plotters, and the miscarriage of their plots: for the further clearing of which the Reader shall doe well to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what God speakes in <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.12, 13, 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.12, 13, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.15.16. <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.1, 2. and indeed God is such an enemy to plots, devices, tricks, that he will crosse and disappoint his owne children in their workings, devisings, and contrivances even for good, when they are too plotting, anxious, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and please themselves too much in them; and this he does often, lest they should attribute the events of things to their counsell, care, &amp;c. and that the worke may appeare to be of himselfe, and not of men, that God may be knowne to be <hi>Deiu activus &amp; non passivus,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> expresses it upon a like occasion, and that God doth not use to call <hi>Martin Luther</hi> or anie of his Saints to be his councellor, but that he doth all things according to his own counsell; hence we are commanded to be carefull for nothing, or thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but in everie thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let our requests be made knowne to God: Now if God will go quite crosse and contrary, to the counsells, workings, of his servants for the maintaining his Church and truth, and bring about all quite another way, then he will much more carrie the counsells of the froward headlong and make them meet with darknesse in the day time, and grope in the noone day, as in the night.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Sympt.</hi> of the certaine destruction of the Sectaries is this, That Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie and Sectarisme in <hi>England</hi> is a meer Faction, a partie grown to this height upon particular interests, nourished and favoured all upon politike grounds and ends: Independencie now is no religious conscientious businesse, but a politike State Faction, severing and dividing it selfe upon other private interests from the publike interests of this Church and State, and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of both Kingdoms, united by Covenant: In a word 'tis just such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>another Faction as the Arminians was in the Netherlands. I believe that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight years ago Independencie and the Church way had somwhat of Religion and conscience in it, manie then falling to it much upon those grounds (though even then there were other ends in it also,<note place="margin">Antapol p. 21, 28.</note> as I have showne in my <hi>Antapologie.</hi>) But now since these times of troubles and difference betwixt King and Parliament, these foure years last past, wherein men have seen some probabilitie and possibilitie, in these times of warre and unsettlement of things, to bring about and effect those things they could not hope for before, it hath been and is matter of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, particular aimes and ends, and not of conscience and pietie, as all wise men may see, and is apparent by these particulars:</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="152" facs="tcp:99332:125"/>First 'tis not carried on as a way of God, as a matter of Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in Gods way, and with Gods means; but carried on altogether with policie, art, plots, trickes, equivocations, mentall reservations, lies, falsenesle, doing anie thing though never so unjust and unrighteous, if it will further and advantage, that way, and hinder its opposite, <hi>viz.</hi> Presbyterie, and the settlement of the Church; yea, declining and forsaking the profest principles that way, and going contrary threunto, in razing the verie fundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Independencie, and the Church way.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, There are multitudes of persons in all places, who doe not so much as know or understand anie of the principles of Independency and thé Church way; yea that hate most of those principles if they were tied to live according to them, that yet are great sticklers for Independencie, and the Sectaries, yea, are the heads and patrons of it in all places, and upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this is observed by manie wise men, that take those who now are friends for it, and stand for it upon all occasions, among them all there is not one in ten that conscientiously and in his judgement holds that way to bee of God, or is an Independent, which cleerly showes 'tis a Faction.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, All other errours and opinions, Sectaries of all sorts (as well as Independents) are encouraged, nourished, favoured, and the worst of them though being so abominable, 'tis not anie policie to appeare for them; yet one way or other, under one notion or other, are pleaded for, dealt gently with, either delayed and put off, or brought off by one meanes or other, and are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffered to grow and increase, and no way taken to suppresse or discourage them, which cleerly showes Independency is a Faction, and hath other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes then that of Conscience, in furthering the growth of all sorts of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, holding tenets against their principles as well as ours, by Licensing their Books, &amp;c. and upon all occasions, shelters and protects all sorts of them.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly that Independencie is a Faction, and not matter of Conscience, appeares because all these following sorts and ranks of men come in unto it; 1. Needie, broken, decaied men, who know not how to live, and hope to get somthing, turn Independents and sticklers for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, and in feare and danger of being questioned, or have bin questioned, they turn Independents to escape que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning, or if questioned, that so they may come off the better, Independency being a Sanctuarie and the horns of the Altar where many obnoxious persons fly and are safe; and many of these guilty persons that they may merit the more prove fiercer Independents and Sectaries then manie others. 3. Some who have businesses, causes, and matters depending, strike in with the Independent Sectaries, pleading for them, that so they may finde Friends, be sooner dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99332:125"/>
fare better in their causes, &amp;c. 4. Ambitious, proud, covetous men, who have a mind to Offices, places of profit, about the Army, Excise, &amp;c. turn about to the Independents, and are great zealots for them. 5. Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines and loose persons, who have a desire to live in pleasures, and enjoy their lusts, and to be under no government, they are fierce and earnest for Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, and against Presbytery. 6. All wanton-witted, unstable, errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spirits of all sorts, all Hereticks and Sectaries strike in with Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and plead they are Independents. 7. Such who have no minde to peace, nor to the settlement of things, either out of hope, whilest things remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled, Bishops and former times may come in again; or that love to fish in troubled waters, or are afraid to lose Offices and Places that may fall with the ending of these troubles, these persons strike in with Independents, and side with them. 8. Many who in our Churches are discontented at the faithfull preaching of their Ministers close to their consciences, at their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and Suspensions from the Sacrament, because loose, scandalous, or because of some difference upon their Tithes, or such like, forsake our Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and betake themselves so Independents and Sectaries, of which I could give divers instances; all which showes the Church-way and Independency to be nothing else but a Faction: Now Factions and Parties in Kingdomes and Commonwealths, though they may prevaile to a great height, and grow for a time, especially in troublous unsetled States, in the Springs and Falls of Kingdoms and Commonwealths; yet when they come to be discovered, laid open, and come to some head and ripenesse, they use to fall and be cast out: If we consult with the Scriptures, or with the Histories and Chronicles of Kingdomes, as the French and English, &amp;c. wee shall finde the strongest, powerfullest Factions and Parties both in Churches and States, who have had divided interests from the Publike, have come downe and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perished: and we may see this fully made good in the Anabaptists of Germany, the Arminian Faction in the Netherlands, and our late Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Faction, who though they were all growne so high, as they hazzar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ruine of the Countreyes and Commonwealths wherein they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose, yet they all fell and were brought downe, and so shall it be with this Sectarian Faction; can they think that either God, or these Kingdoms will suffer these men long, or that the people will be alwaies bewitched with them? no, the eyes of men will be open, and they will be discovered every day more, and we shall see them falling down like lightning.</p>

The punishment upon the Heathen, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21.24 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>when they knew God, for not glorifying him as God, and for their idolatry, is giving them up to uncleanenesse and vile affections, to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient, suffering them to be fild with all unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wickednesse, covetousnesse, malitiousnesse, deceit, malignity, debate, to be proud, inventers of evill things, without naturall affection, Covenant-breakers, implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp;c.</hi> (2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.11.) The judgement of God upon the Antichristian world as a fruit of their sin in not receiving the truth in love, is Gods <hi>sending them strong delusions that they should beleeve a lye</hi>; 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 13. and the punishment of God upon Seducers is, <hi>that they shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they who are filthy shall be filthy still; Revel.</hi> 22 11. Now the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon the Heathen Idolaters, upon the Antichristian Faction, upon Seducers and filthy persons, are upon the Schismaticks and Separatists of our times: God hath given them up to feareful Opinions, to damnable Heresies, blasphemies, God hath sent strong delusions to beleeve lyes, strange conceits, and God hath left them to all kind of filthynesse, unrighteousnesse, uncleannesse, unnaturalnesse, &amp;c.

am afraid are the most generall of any other, there being too many Sleepers in all places, and among all ranks, in Citie, Countrey, among the Magistrates, Ministers, and private Christians; and would to God this were the worst in this Kingdome, that many both in Magistracy and Ministery were onely slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and heavie, and that they were not in a dead sleep, in a lethargie that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can awake them: but 'tis too apparent that God hath powred out upon many the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed their eyes, even Rulers and Seers hath hee covered, and all the Sermons, Books, Speeches (which one would think would awaken men) are <hi>as the word of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one, saying, Read this; and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed:</hi> nay, not onely so, but this is the condition of this Church and State, that many who are dead asleep as in reference to prevent or suppresse the sowing of Heresies and Schisms, are awake and alive, yea, watchfull at midnight, and waiting upon all opportunities to promote and further Heresie, Schism, and to hinder, crosse all means for the suppressing of them; witnesse the many Emissaries sent forth into most parts of this Kingdome, witnesse the many books written, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preached for them; witnesse those who stand up for, and use all means to bring off Sectaries when in question, &amp;c. witnesse many (who professe to be against Independency, and for Presbytery, to be with us) that upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, even before the Parliament, and in other places, heal the hurt of this Kingdome slightly, and dawb with untempered morter, preaching that our errours are not so many, that there are them who make them to be more then they are, and call Truths of God Errours; and they say, that in other times, as in the Primitive Church, &amp;c. there were greater errours, and therefore wee need not be so troubled. But (for my part) I look upon this luke-warm tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, remissenesse in reference to <hi>the faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> which hath possessed so many in this Kingdome, Magistrates, Ministers and people, as that which may hazzard all, and may once more provoke God to spue out of his mouth the luke-warm Angel that is neither cold nor hot.

                        <p n="1">1. Stay no longer in the way of Schisme and Separation wherein thou art, but upon all these discoveries of the Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, &amp;c. of the Sectaries leave them left God be provoked to leave thee to go a great way further, then yet thou art, from Independency and Anabaptisme, to a See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, to Arrianisme, Antiscripturisme, yea, Blasphemy, and Atheisme.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Independent Church-way, is a way of errour, confusion, division, a way that God never shined upon nor blessed spiritually with the blessing of edification, onenesse of heart, and peace in their Churches, but hath been a bitter root of division, contentions, errours in all places of the world where ever such Churches have been set up, as in New-England, Holland, Iland of Providence, the Summer Ilands, Old England.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Come out from these Sectaries, this Babell, lest being partakers of their sins, you be partakers of their plagues also; for these Sects (as I have shewed you in the second Corallary) must be destroyed and cast out: and not onely out of this Church, but out of all the Christian world, and that either as the lesser Antichrists, the fore-runners of the great Antichrist, or together with him as a part of Antichrist, the tail of the Beast; and then all the friends and lovers of Sectaries, the merchants who were made rich, and traded in the commodities of the Sectaries, shall cast dust upon their heads, and weep and waile when they see all that is come upon them. And for a conclusion of this Corallary, I shall wind it up with that sad and patheticall exhortation of M. <hi>Brightman</hi> to the Separatists of his time, applying it to our Sectaries now:
<q>There is in the Church of England a twofold great good, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word, and the administration of the Sacraments, in either of which Christ imparts himselfe celebrating a mutuall feast with them; hee is first received of us by the hearing of the Word, then he doth againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us in the Supper of his body. O we most base and unworthy as often as we fly away from hearing the Word I for we refuse Christ our Ghuest.

Is it a shame for them to sit downe there where they see Christ is not ashamed? Are they holyer and purer than hee? But wherefore do they not convince themselves by their owne experience? They cannot deny but they first beleeved in Christ, before they made this separation from us: was not this from preaching in our Church? But can any man preach unlesse he be sent</hi> Rom. 10.13? <hi>Why do they therefore so perversly refuse the Word for some blemish of the externall calling, whose divine vertue they feele in their hearts?

I challenge any man in all this nine or ten yeares of their troubles, to charge them justly with falsnesse or breach of Covenant in pretending one thing, and intending another, in forsaking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Principles, and falling upon new, according to any advantages offered them; but now the Independents and Sectaries have been inconstant, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and unstable in all their wayes, crying up and extolling our Brethren of Scotland to the heavens, and afterwards as much casting them downe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a regard to some branches of the Covenant, as extirpating Popery and Prelacy, but not minding others, as maintaining the Kings Honour, his just power and greatnesse, the extirpating of heresie, schism, the endeavouring the nearest conjunction and uniformity between the three Kingdoms in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Discipline, &amp;c. not certain to any principles or ends they have propounded, except those of Anarchie, and pretended new light; not well knowing what they would have, but changing their minds, and framing their wayes according as they have seen their opportunities and advantages; And because I observe it hath been one great part of the designe of the Sectaries, yea and as the maine <hi>medium</hi> to effect their ends by, the aspersing and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Scots (the Sectaries looking upon them <hi>as that which letteth, and will let untill it be taken out of the way</hi>) which hath been therefore with all industry, artifice and vigour prosecuted ever since the battell at Marston

Moore, and more especially since the moulding or new modell of the Army: I shall therefore (to undeceive the people) as in the sight of God, out of pure conscience, speak a few things of our Brethren of Scotland, and show particularly some differences between them and the Sectaries.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Scots still upon all occasions have improved and made use of all victories, successes, and advantages put into their hands (as the coming in of the King now to them) for the good of both Kingdomes, and for effecting the ends declared in the Covenant, not for anie particular ends, as to get pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of Newarke, or to be revenged for affronts offered them, or injuries done them by the Independent party, or to increase divisions, jealousies, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents between the Nations: But now the Sectaries have made use of all advantages, and of all successes they have had, and of all events that are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out for the increase of their own partie, and effecting their particular ends divided from the interests of both Kingdomes, and the ends expressed in the Covenant; yea to increase and further jealousies, discontents, differences between the two Kingdomes, by blowing up and aggravating upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions all things against the Scots, by railing against and speaking evill of the Scots in all companies and places, by aspersing them in manie printed bookes, (carefully spread and dispersed abroad by the Sectaries) and by many false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and other dangerous insinuations against the Scots vented in weekely newes bookes (the Pensioners of the Independent party) and particularly since the Kings coming to the Scottish army, many things have beene rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and spoken of by the weekly Pamphleters, which reflect upon our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of Scotland, and some upon the Kings Majestie (which must needs seeme strange and be verie offensive to all good and wise men) and so much the more, the King being come in, and in the Parliaments Quarters.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99332:136"/>
neither the Commissioners for Scotland, nor anie particular person of their Nation having put forth intemperate books against those whom they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Authours and chief Engines in these matters, but have borne to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration (considering they left their peace, and incurred the displeasure of their native King to come in to our help, and lay under such great sufferings in their owne Countrey) all the evill surmisings, scandalls, reports, jealousies raised of them, disgraces and scorns, without anie breaking forth. But now the Sectaries, upon everie little occasion of being crossed in their way, as by Ordinances coming forth against anie of their principles and practices, (though God knowes they have been little put in execution) by calling in question any of their partie, though most deservedly and justly, by petitions put up against the Sectaries, how proud, how impatient have they beene? what strange words have they given out? what meetings have they had? and what railing Pamphlets have been written one upon another, against Parliament, Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, Citie.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Scots upon all occasions and opportunities have beene forward for peace, moving for peace and the settlement of the Church, desirous of Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to be sent to his Majestie: But now manie Sectaries could not endure to heare of peace, not of the Kings coming in, nor of the settlement of the Church, they have looked so much to their particular ends of profit, increase of their party while things were unsetled, that they have alwaies expressed themselves to the contrary, fearing their way could not thrive nor stand, if once things should come to be setled, and the Government and the peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded of. Manie more differences might be showne between them; but I must draw to an end, and the understanding Reader may by these easily hint at more, and it concernes the whole Kingdom now at this time wisely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and lay things together concerning the different carriage of our Brethren of Scotland and the Sectaries, that so a good understanding may be between the two Nations for the putting a speedy end to our troubles and distractions in Church and State, and that we may not by mis-understanding of things, nourishing jealousies, beleeving false reports, serve the designes of some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men, to put us into a new warre, and occasion new differences now that (blessed be God) our worke is even done, and the ship richly laden come into the haven. And to stop the mouths of Sectaries and Malignants forever, and to possesse us of the reality, honesty, faithfulnesse of our Brethren of Scotland, consider but what we have found them all along experimentally from first to last, and let any man instance (if he can) in any one action, from the beginning of our troubles, wherein the State of Scotland hath broken with us, or beene unfaithfull: Their going out of this Kingdome to their own Countrey when

Newark as the substance, as that the Kings partie should repaire to him, yea, that the Newark Army was joyned to the Scots, as that they would protect Delinquents and Malignants against the Parliament, that they would keep the King, and require a ransome for him, and make use of him for their own designes, and such like; whereas we see they would not meddle with New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark, but professed, if it were given into their hands one houre, the next hour they would surrender it to the English for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;<note place="margin">

                              </p>
                           </note> they have not suffered any who have been in Arms, or ill affected against the Parliament, to come to his Majestie, have taken order to discourage all Malignants, have commanded obedience to all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Parliament, even at Newcastle where the Kings person is, and have made use of the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, to perswade w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> him for a speedy setling of Religion and Peace in both Kingdoms. God in his wonderfull providence gave the King to them for this end among others to shame their adversaries, and to stop the mouths of all gain-sayers, that he might bring forth their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse as the light, and their judgement as the noon-day, and might ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them before all the world: So that I may say of them in the words of Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> pag. 29. of his speech at Guild-Hall, upon the coming in of our Brethren of Scotland. <hi>A Nation that God hath honoured, by giving as glorious successe unto, as ever he did unto any; whose low and mean beginnings he hath raised to as great a bright as ever low beginnings in any Countrey were.</hi>
                           <q>How hath God dissipated and blasted the counsels of their Adversaries? How hath he discovered all their treacheries? although they be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (comparatively at least) a poore people and of little strength (as the Church of Philadelphia was) yet they have kept the word of Gods pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and God hath kept them in the houre of temptation; God therfore is with them.</q>
Well, I say it is happie for England, that we are joyned with them in Covenant, for we needed them as much now as ever before, and we are as much beholding to them in regard of our divisions, many of us not knowing what we would have; and in regard of the many Sectaries among us, and the height they have risen unto, as ever we were before, for their help against the Popish, Prelaticall, and Malignant partie; and therefore happie England, both for the present and for the future, that now wee are coming to a Peace, we are so joyned and wrapped up in Covenant with Scotland, that the Peace and Vnion is not of England alone, but of both Kingdoms;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99332:137"/>
and that this is our advantage I shall commend to the Readers consideration some particulars out of the Speeches of Mr. Solicitor, a prime able Member of the House of Commons, and Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> a chiefe man among the dissenting Brethren Mr. Solicitor speaking of the benefits that will redound to this Kingdome, and the advantage we shall have by a nearer Association with the Scots, and by their coming in to this purpose for our assistance, showeth that certainly they are many.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The third is this, that whosoever we doe come to a Peace, whom Gods time is come, that we shall have one, yet their coming in, in all probability it will cause us to have a better, a surer, and a better grounded Peace, then if they doe not come in. And likewise what peace soever we have, that it will be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated, and be the securer for us and our posterity to reap the benefit of it. But how is it like to be, when there shall not onely be our owne Kingdome, but a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdome, an entire Kingdome, one of the same Religion with us, one that loves their liberties as well as we, when they shall bee ingaged in point of interest with us, when the same Law, the same Acts of Parliament that shall compose the differences, when if it be broken on our parts in any thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes us, they cannot conceive but that it may be their case the next day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it all depends upon one Law, one and the same title, and their interests is the same; So that if there were nothing else in it, but that we were like to have the better peace and on better termes, and whatever it be 'tis likely to bee kept the better to us and our posteritie, if nothing else were in it, that were much to our advantage: surely if by some considerable summe of money, wee might have brought in, and have them at the end of this Peace, and intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in it as well us our selves. Master</hi> Burroughs <hi>saith, how happy should wee be, if wee might have them in a neere union with us? And a people that have carried themselves with as great honour and faithfulnesse, with as great wisdome and order in the most difficult worke that ever a people did undertake in those by and intricate paths that were before untrodden. Certainely, that they undertooke at the beginning of their worke, but a few years since, it could not but bee looked upon with the eye of reason, as the most unlikely worke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have proceeded, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

better Peace, and have it the better kept, by having them at the end of it, and interested in it as well as our selves; let's hearken to no Sectaries nor Independents false surmisings, evill reports, and scandalls, cast upon our Brethren of Scotland, but pray and seek by all means a more near union and communion betweene that Kingdome and this, for there is a blessing in them; and for my part I had a great deale rather fall and perish (if the will of God were so) with the Kingdome of Scotland, and the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian party in England, standing for the Covenant and the truth professed in all the Reformed Churches, then to grow and flourish for a while with the Sectaries standing for a Toleration of all Sects and Opinions, yea, then to be a King among them, as <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> was at Munster.</p>
