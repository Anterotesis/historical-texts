            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Jeſuite in the Pound: OR, <hi>Father Peters in Diſguiſe,</hi> Taken by Vice Admiral Herbert</head>
            <p>HALLOO! Halloo! my Dogg too! my Dogg too! There <hi>Jowler,</hi> at him <hi>Ringwood.</hi> There, there, there, you have him on the Scent! He's our own. Now Jolly Hunrſman, wind the Horn. He's Taken! he's Taken! he's Taken! The Old Fox, that lately broke away from the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Court, is now taken in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Nooſe. I Gad; <hi>Herbert,</hi> and his Water-Spaniels, are plaguy Mouth'd Currs, they neither ſpare <hi>Fox</hi> nor <hi>Geeſe.</hi> What a Murrain croſs-grain'd Wind blew the Holy Father this way, when his Reverence with full Sail was bound for <hi>Paris,</hi> an Hundred Thouſand Pounds ſtrong, bidding 2 long Farewel to <hi>England</hi> for ever?</p>
            <p>But Fate, that flew faſter than the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> ſoon overtook him, when the Vice-Admiral having notice of his Eſcape, and (more Tempted with the Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge than the Thouſand Pounds Reward) lay in cloſe wait for him. He had had a copious and ample Deſcription of his Diſguiſe, who was now dreſt up like a double Hypocrite, <hi>viz.</hi> That inſtead of a <hi>Canonical Gown,</hi> he had got on him a Red Cloak, reſembling the Bloody Robes of the <hi>Scarlet Whore.</hi> That this Cloak was cut out of a ſpick and ſpan new piece of Jeſuitical Equivocation, Lin'd with Mental Reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was the Appurtenances of the outward Garment: Underneath he had a Veſt of the ſame Colour, cut out of the Petticoat of the ſaid <hi>Whore</hi>; Lin'd with <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and Faced with <hi>Infallibility,</hi> being within-ſide all <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> and <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſlimulation.</hi> But to the Matter.</p>
            <p>In this Diſguiſe (its ſaid)he paſt down theRiver to <hi>Rocheſter</hi>; where, after a plentiful Repaſt, being receiv'd on Board a ſmall Yatch, prepared for his Reception, they ſoon put off to Sea, the Wind and Tide ſeeming to favour his Eſcape. But ſee the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of the Flattering Fates; ſcarce were they out of ſight of Land, when a thick Miſt diſperſing, they diſcover'd a Ship; which (the better to Cloak the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign) bore the <hi>French</hi> Colours, which put the Dejected Jeſuit into new Heart, hoping now to ſecure his Flight in a larger Bottom. He hauls them in with the Chaſe Gun; They ſtrike Sail, and lie by. The Admiral, with Forty Men, boards 'em, yet find no Oppoſition: The Jeſuit, with all his Ship Crew, retires into the great Cabbin, ſinging <hi>Te Deum</hi> for their happy Deliverance. But <hi>Herbert,</hi> who knew Father <hi>Peters</hi> too well to be miſtaken in that Diſguiſe, ſeiz'd him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying him (inſtead of going to <hi>Callis</hi>) to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet; from whence, it's ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believ'd, his 100000. Pounds will hardly Pay his Ranſom.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, that norwithſtanding all the Secret Policies, Contrivances, and Diſguiſes of theſe Impoſtures, nothing can for ever preſerve them, but they muſt at laſt fall into the Hands of Juſtice.</p>
