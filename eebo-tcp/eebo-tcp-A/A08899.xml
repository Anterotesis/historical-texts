            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20808:9"/>
his person. Let vs therfore resort to the holy Scriptures, and by them examine Peters aucthority. S. Paule calles him as he doth also Iames and Iohn, a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Church. And as for the rest of his felowe Apostles, they ascribe vnto him no maner of specyall name or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue aboue the rest. Yea, but (saye they) our Lorde Iesus Christ vsed hym very louingly and familiarly. I graunt that, but so as he did the like to Iames, and much more to Iohn. And in plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Churche (whiche point the Romish Doctours take to be their chief holde) Peter is for no other cause speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and by name spoken to, but for that he alone in the name of his felowes had made answere to that our Sauiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of all the rest of thapostles as wel as of him. And as for the rest of our Sauiours talke concerning the Rocke, where against the gates of hell should not preuaile, it prooueth no special pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emynence to be in Peter more then in the rest, but betokeneth the publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our faith that should be in the Church of Christ. Which opinion and interpretacyon the auncyent Fathers haue left to vs in writinge. And if so be it were not true, our most louing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<pb facs="tcp:20808:9"/>
would not in the selfe same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, haue so sharplye rebuked Peter calling him Sathan, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his ignoraunce in the Scriptures. But why do we argue in a matter that is out of all doubte? howe ofte is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in holye wrytte, that God hath no respecte of persons? but if thys oppinion of the Romishe Deuynes be allowed, not onelye Peter shoulde be highly aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced aboue al his felowes, but also he alone should haue a celestial prerogatiue of goddes power, an inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible faith and an aucthoritie not to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against. Peters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions neuer acknowledged this great authoritie.</p>
               <p>Peter hym selfe, neuer chalenged so strange a dignitye. Paule commending vnto our prayers, Christian magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, placeth first Kinges, and then Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Peter framing our life with hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some doctrine, willeth vs firste, to feare god, &amp; next him honour the king. Why nameth not he hym selfe who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready vested in his dignity? Why spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not he of his successours, the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of Roome? For if he shoulde so haue done, it could haue semed no pride in him, for so much as he might do it, by the institucion and ordinaunce of oure
<pb facs="tcp:20808:10"/>
sauiour. But of this extraordinary iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, was no mention made in the beginninge of the primatiue Churche. Likewise, not a word spoken of it a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time after. For at those daies y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Roome shrewdly persecuted the church of Christ, &amp; also some of the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Roome they slue, who were in that time chief spectacles of godlines, &amp; occupied in all holy exercises, &amp; besides valiaunt witnesses of the death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of our sauiour Iesus Christ. For the churche of Roome had not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che an hard hap as to haue no commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Bishoppes in it, amonge whom we confesse some of theym in deede, of auntient tyme, were excellente, and singuler fathers. And as long as that simple and innocent age endured with out pride, and ambition, so longe was that Popish gouernement vnknowen, so longe the Byshoppe of Roome coueted no especiall dignity aboue the rest, except perhaps because he was an example of the flocke, he sought to win the crowne of Martirdome from them. Wherof Gregory may be a very good witnes, who pronounceth that Bishop of Roome accursed, who wil take vpon him to be called the vniuersal prelate of
<pb facs="tcp:20808:10"/>
the whole church. Such was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> modestie of men in those daies. Mary by proces of time vice grew, &amp; when as by the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperors of Rome were now quiet &amp; wel pacified, there was not only peace planted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, but also it was endowed with manye goodly &amp; large possessions. Since that time the bishops of Roome (as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe,) corrupted with idlenes, &amp; aboundance of all thinges, forgat by litle and little, the discipline and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitye of their former life, &amp; at last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into this monstrous tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. By meane wherof they do not only make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world to quake for feare of them, but also sel heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; hel at their owne pleasure &amp; disposition. And nowe when their po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe &amp; excesse grewe to the highest degree it could come to, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose a number of feed men, &amp; flatterers, who hauing tasted of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> streames that issued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> precious sea of Roome, being dronken therwith, built this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish kingdome for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> false successours of Peter.

Awake my brethren, and consult all of ye together against this Romish foxe. He hath layde snares and baytes to hurte and harme youre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales: He seeketh all the corners he may, to entre into you: He thyrsteth after youre bloude, and woulde (if he wist howe) roote quite out of the earth, both your name, &amp; al maner of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce

of you. Whereunto he hath many assistauntes, and also great aides and succoures of vyle and naughtye men. And as for your selfes, nexte vnto God, ye haue this one onlye refuge left you, or elles none at all. Which is, that ye loue together, agree together, holde and take parte together. Ech of youre Nations seuered one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Romishe force maye easilye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe, but ioyned all surelye toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it can neuer hurt. Our life bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, thoughe it be an hundred yeare longe, is in dede but a short and a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, as Iacob witnesseth of him selfe, and this same being so vncertaine and so quickly run out, to howe manye perilles of fortune besides, is it subiect? with how manye daungerous diseases also is it wasted? Let vs therefore take bolde and stout stomackes vnto vs, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncynge oure selues, and lyftynge vppe oure heartes vnto heauen. In a good quarrell it is better to dye man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye, then to yeld cowardlye. And as for the goodnesse of the quarrell, what eyther is, or can be a better quarrell, then that that is for the defence of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, truth, &amp; the Gospel?

or yelding, then when the truth shal yeld to lyes, the light to darkenes: and the eternall wisedome of God to mens traditions.</p>
