            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAister <hi>Peter Fabell,</hi> otherwise called the merry Deuill of <hi>Edmunton</hi> (for the many excellent ieasts he did) was a man of good discent: and a man, either for his gifts externall, or internall, inferior to few. For his person he was absolute. <hi>Nature</hi> had neuer showne the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of her skill, more in any then in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the other, I meane his great learning (including many misteries) hee was as amply blest as any.</p>
            <p>Uery pleasant, kinde, &amp; frée-harted was hée, to, or with his familiars: very affable, and curteous to strangers, and very liberall, full of Commisseration and pittie to the poore and néedy: both abroad from his purse, and at home from his Table. In his time very well knowne to him, and sometime (in pastime) very familiar with him, were these men: <hi>Oliuer Smug,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> the merry Parson, <hi>Bancks</hi> the Miller, and mine Host of the <hi>George</hi>: in whose companies many times for recreation, he would spend some houres. In <hi>Edmonton</hi> he was borne, liued and died in the raigne of King <hi>H. the</hi> 7.</p>

               <head>How Maister Peter deceiued the Diuell with a Candles end.</head>
               <p>AT the first entrance of M. <hi>Peter</hi> into the Art of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> by charmes, spells, and incantations, he raised a spirit, and with the spirit concluded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if he would be obedient to him, serue, helpe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Then the spirit beganne to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and terrifie him to make him set a time of payment for his pleasure: and so affrighted him, that hée knew not what or how to answere him. Come (quoth the Deuill) be bréefe, for Lucifer euery minute, lookes for that soule of thine.

Oh! sir (said the Fryer) all places are alike to me for this businesse, &amp; all times, for I pray when the pricke of conscience commes vpon me, in what place, or at what time soeuer. I commend thée much (quoth <hi>Maister Peter</hi>) thou art an honest fellow, and so for that time they parted.</p>
               <p>The next morning <hi>Maister Peter</hi> went againe: &amp; againe found this Fryer in the place where he left him, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning before so deuoutly praying, but not at that holy excercise, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit did not mooue him, vnlesse the euil spirit mooued him, for instead of his booke and beads, he had got a wench, and sat colling her so close, and kissing her so thicke, kisse vpon kisse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she could hardly fetch her wind for him. A good while stood M. <hi>Peter</hi> behind a hollow trée vnséene, seeing them ticke and toy together, at last to fright them from their venery, he went into the trée and with a heauy hollow voice, cried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut to the Fryer in this manner: Frier, Frier, Frier, the Frier hearing a voice, presently started vp, and looked round a bout him to sée if he could finde the <hi>Maister</hi> of that tongue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> called him: but in vaine he stood looking for he stood farre enough from his eye, though he were close to his eare. When the Fryer had stood a good while looking about him, first on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one side, then on the other, and could spy no body, like a kind letcherous bald-pate, very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely, or rather very knauishly, he went to his wench a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

At this second call the Fryer halfe affrighted, started vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and lookt about him (a tiptoe) to see if he could finde a body to that voice: but hee found none.</p>
               <p>Now our Lady defend vs (quoth the Frier to his wench) what voice is this that calls on me so oft? Didst not thou heare it? yes faith swéeting (quoth she) I heard some body call to thee: canst thou not see him?</p>
               <p>No faith chucke (quoth the Fryer) I can see no man: and yet surely this voice, is the voice of a man.

Then the Fryers face beganne to bewray his feare: he had no more colour in his face, at that time, (though at all other times he had coloure enough) then one of these fine whay fac'd oate-meale eaters, or a wench troubled with the greene sickenesse.</p>
               <p>Fryer, frier, frier, (said <hi>Maister Peter</hi>) (still kéeping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe close in the hollow trée) hée that sées thée now, vnséene of thée, sees at all times, in all places, and all these thy actions.</p>
               <p>Heere yesterday I saw thee at thy prayers verie deuot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with thy booke and beades is this the booke thou brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest to pray on now? doth the pricke of conscience mooue thee to doe this? speake thou blacke sinner.

Therefore presently, both of you, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect more the good of your soules, then of your bodyes, by the pennance I shall appoynt you, purge your selues: when the Fryer and his wench heard these wordes, they wore verilie perswaded in their mindes that it was the voice of an Angell they both kneeled downe, very reuerently toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and sayd, thy will be done: appoynt our pennance,

               <p>When they had sitten a pretty while together drinking and singing very merrily, one being a mad wag amongst them (aboue all the rest) suspecting <hi>Smug</hi> to bee (as hee was indeede) a Smith, looked very earnestly vpon him, and about him, to finde something about him that might truely tell him whether hee was as he sayde he was, yea or no.</p>

                  <hi>SMug</hi> in his time had plaid many mad pranks by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and one day it was his chaunce to light into the company of thrée or foure mad consorts, that plaied the knaue as well with him, as euer he had plaid the knaue with any.</p>
