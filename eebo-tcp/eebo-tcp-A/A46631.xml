         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Judicious READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I consented to the Publication of the Narrative, of that remarkable Reproof from the Lord, against the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Error, which moved <hi>Richardson</hi> against the way of Righteousness, and to attempt the propagation of the Principles of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> by denouncing a Curse upon me in the name of the Lord, onely because of that testimony, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on just occasion I was ready to bear against their Errors; I could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine, that any man should doubt of the truth of it, being so fully evidenced in the presence of so many witnesses, by the party himself that was most eminently concerned in it. And what Man of Reason will believe, that any Man should voluntarily accuse himself to be a false Prophet, without some powerful conviction. And why should any Man complain of the Hand of the Lord being upon him, and his, in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when there is no such thing. And what could <hi>Richard Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> propose to himself, in bringing his wife three or four miles purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God might be intreated to remove his stroke from her, and her children, if indeed there had be no cause? Or, why should they both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, they were disquieted with restless pain, and their child with sores, &amp;c. and that upon his so prophaning the Name of the Lord, if all was well with them? Surely in vain do Men go about to out-face a thing so manifest.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that in all the <hi>Quakers</hi> say, they take no notice of <hi>Richard Andersons</hi> iniquity, in taking on him that office of a false Prophet, but rather seem to favor his doings in that behalf, by suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if the judgment by him pronounced, was upon me to this day, (<hi>see their</hi> Lying Wonder, p. <hi>7</hi>) though it is neither witnessed by any, nor confessed by me (as, Blessed be God, there is no cause) and yet they will in no wise believe any judgment fell on <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> or his family, though so much verified! Surely, should half so much have been testified of the accomplishment of <hi>Richard Andersons</hi> prophesie on me or mine, as hath been on the contrary, the truth thereof had been out of dispute with them ere this day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:34769:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Seeing then, that it cannot be denied, but <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> was led by the Spirit of Falshood, and prophesied falsly in the Name of the Lord; it is far more reasonable to believe, that the Lord did rebuke his folly, upon the evidence offered, then to believe he did escape unpunished under such iniquity, without, and against evidence, notwithstanding all the shifts of the <hi>Quakers</hi> to help him.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Reader,</hi> perufe (if thou pleasest) what I have here offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to observation, <hi>With much further confirmation of the Narrative.</hi> And believe me in this (for it is truth) that I have not in all that I have said, wronged my Conscience, nor designed any evil against the persons of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but onely to make discovery (so far as this providence might tend to it) of the false ways they have chosen, that so they might escape from thence, and be saved.</p>
            <p>Nor do I hereby proclaim my own glory (as they suggest) and we know (for all their noise) that it is lawful for the servants of the Lord to report what God doth by them, <hi>Acts 15. 12.</hi> And yet I do not pretend to work Miracles; for the truth is, it was not expected by me, that God should after that manner rebuke the vanity of the false Prophet, who came to pronounce me a Leper. But seeing it hath pleased him to do it thus beyond my expectation, I know I sin not in declaring it: I have more cause to think I should have sinned in concealing it. And for the removal of the affliction, it was an answer of the Prayer of the Congregation, and not of mine onely.</p>
            <p>Indeed for Printing I had no resolution, till moved by such as heard of the business, knowing my own incapacity, for a work of that nature, and (as I said  I was not without fears of the consequence: But this I willingly put upon the account of my infirmities, not being conscious of any Hypocrisie in the business, though boldly charged by the <hi>Quakers</hi> in that kind; but they have a faculty to accuse beyond their ability to prove. I commit all that which concerns the matter, to his wise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, that knows our hearts, and will render to every one as his work shall be.</p>

                              <hi>RIchard Anderson</hi> of <hi>Panton,</hi> about Ten miles from <hi>Lincoln,</hi> came to our Meeting at <hi>Northwillingham,</hi> to hear the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Preached; who when he had been a hearer for some time,

was convinced, and said, He did believe the Baptism in Water was an Ordinance of God, and that both Men and Women ought to be baptised in Water, as taking Jesus Christ for our Leader and Example; so he went away for that time: But before he came again, he met with the People called Quakers, who told him, (as himself confessed) That he must not look upon these outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, for they were low, [<hi>But the Way of Life above to the Wise,</hi> Prov. 15. 24.

In answer to which, I said, That I believed that the Scriptures were to try the Spirits, and not the Spirits to try the Scriptures (Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as before is said, That the holy Spirit, as he speaketh in the Scripture, is to try and judge the spirits of Men, and particularly the Quakers spirit, which they call the <hi>Light within</hi>) he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly made Light of it, and said, That now we must mind the <hi>Light within.</hi> In answer to which, I said I was afraid that the Quakers were deceived, and guided by a spirit of delusion; and, that it was my judgment, That all the Sons and Daughters of Men ought to be guided by the Scriptures, as being the Oracles of God, and the rule for us to walk by; and he for the <hi>Light within,</hi> to be the rule for the Sons and Daughters of Men to be guided by. But as for every particular of our discourse, it is out of my remembrance; so he went away for that time. And the Light which the Quakers did tell him (as he said, he must be guided by, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him within a short time after, so that he came very early one Morning to my House and inquired for me; so I went to him, and he told me, That he was commanded of God to come and reprove me for speaking against the People of God (as he said) called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and to exhort me to turn to the <hi>Light within,</hi> [<hi>Here he speaks the very language and spirit of the Quakers,</hi>] or

else he was (as he said) to pronounce a judgment against me. I told him, That I thought him to be a false prophet, and possessed with a spirit of delusion; then he said, He was commanded of God to pronounce me a <hi>Leper,</hi> from the crown of the head, to the sole of the foot. In answer to these words, I said to him, Through the goodness of God, I am not discouraged at what thou sayest; but do believe thou art a false prophet, and possessed with a spirit of delusion; and that I am not to take any notice of what thou sayest: But I do desire, withal my heart, that the Lord would be pleased to let thee see thy evil, and the error of thy way, that thou mayest report and confess thy error, that the Name of God may be honored, his ways and appointments exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and so his people may be better established, and confirmed in his ways and appointments. So we parted, and he went a little way from me, but returned again, and said unto me. Thou say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, that I am a false prophet, deceived, and possessed with a spirit of delusion; but it will be known by me or mine, or thee, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I be a true prophet, or false one</hi>; and so he went home. But within a short time after he came home, the Lord was pleased to smite one of his children (as he said) spotted all over, himself and wife, and his other children were taken with a restless pain in their bodies also; so that he was forced (as he said) to come again and <hi>confess</hi> he was deceived, and that he was a false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and <hi>the same judgment</hi> [<hi>Lo here is the true interpretation of the judgment intended by the false prophet, and not that which the Quakers fictitiously give out in their</hi> Lying Wonder, p. 7.] <hi>he had pronounced against me, was faln upon one of his children, and that himself and wife, and other children were taken with a restless pain in their bodies:</hi> And he said, That he and his wife did believe, that if I would pray to God for them, they might all be restored again to their former healths. In answer to his words, I told him I could not at present give an him answer, but if he and his wife would please to meet me at <hi>Donnington,</hi> where I am to be by promise, the next Lords day, it may please God that your desire may be answered. He being very sad at that time, I fell a speaking to him, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him some questions about the <hi>Light within,</hi> which the Quakers bad him mind, and be guided by: And he told me, That that Light many times would, when he had sat down to eat his meat,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34769:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and had drawn his knife to cut it, have commanded him to put it up again; and so (he said) he had done several times, and gone without his meat: And that Light also (as he said) perswaded him to fast, and told him, That he should cure the sick. In obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to which perswasion, he did fast, and came to our Town of <hi>Northwillingham,</hi> to the house of one <hi>Iohn Lamin,</hi> whose child was then sick and weak; and he told me, he went to cure that child, but that Light and perswasion did deceive him, for he now saw he could not cure the sick. So according to my promise, I went to <hi>Donnington,</hi> and he and his wife met me there amongst our Friends, and did both confess what is here before mentioned, who also desired our Prayers to God for them, and so I with the Congregation there met together, did seek unto God for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving that distemper and affliction, which he there with his wife confessed, that they and their children were under: And the Lord was mercifully pleased to hear our poor Prayers for them, and to restore them all to their former health again, which he himself confessed when he came to our Meeting afterwards; to the praise of God alone, for ever be it spoken.

            <p>As it is hence evident, this act of Gods Providence was not brought to maintain any falshood, so neither to oppose any Truth of God, but onely to oppose the falshood of that spirit which moved the deluded Quaker <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> to prophesie falsly in the Name of the Lord; and though the evil he pronounced against me, fell on himself, and that so sensibly, as to convince him of his folly; yet notwithstanding this, the Quakers in their <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wonder,</hi> will needs insinuate the fulfilling of that vain prophesie upon me, as if their prophet <hi>meant it not of outward diseases</hi> — And <hi>that for ought appears,</hi> they say (<hi>in effect</hi>) <hi>That I am as Leper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as</hi> Miriam <hi>was to this day.</hi> After this manner they may shift off the most manifest eviction of their falshood, and so delude their unweary Readers: But surely, he that uttered the vain prophesie against me, must in reason know his own meaning better then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.

And sith he was convict by the Hand of Heaven, in smiting him with bodily diseases, and by sparing me in that kind, I shall take this Authors interpretation to be impertinent, and as false as the prophesie it self. [<hi>A false prophesie as he designed it against me, a true prophesie against himself and the Quakers.</hi>] Thus it appears, what befel <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> the Quaker, was no <hi>Lying Wonder</hi>; and therefore the Title of the Quakers Book is not true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That</hi> Richard Anderson <hi>was a Quaker in Principles, and own'd that People above all others, and was acted by their spirit</hi>; Is palpable enough from what is said in the <hi>Narrative.</hi> First, In that he contributes his testimony to that which they call the <hi>Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> at as high a rate, as the most of that way, which (if they have any principles at all) is the cheis of their Principles; for he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth it above the holy Scriptures, and prefers its dictates in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Ordinances of Christ. Secondly, In that he took upon him to appear as a Prophet for the Quakers, condemning such as opposed them, and proclaiming them to be the People of God. Thirdly, By his acting after the manner of divers Quakers in these days, going on unsent errands, onely moved by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of their own hearts, which they call the Light in them. But since the Quakers in their <hi>Lying Wonder,</hi> do so boldly deny that he was a Quaker, here therefore what is attested in that case [<hi>Iune</hi> 17. 1672] since the publication of the Quakers <hi>Lying Wonder,</hi> in the presence of credible Witnesses hereafter named, who (as they write,)
<q>Having a desire to be fully satisfied concerning that which passed between <hi>Ralph Iames</hi> and <hi>Richard Anderson,</hi> and having seen the <hi>Narrative</hi> and the <hi>Lying Wonder,</hi> it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Richard Anderson,</hi> Whether he ever heard the Quakers? He answered, Yes, he heard them at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> within the Prison, about the space of an hour [<hi>And it is known by sad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that many in as little time, as that is, have been so levened with their Principles, as they have not been cleansed from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof to the day of their death.</hi>]</q>
            </p>
            <p>And being further shewed, that the Quakers in their <hi>Lying Wonder,</hi> do say,
<q>That he had no further acquaintance or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Principles then, by the hearing them a quarter of an hour. <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> affirmed, That before he was at the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34769:9"/>
Meeting at <hi>Lincoln</hi>; and after also, He had discourse with the People called Quakers forty times, touching their Principles, Saying moreover, That after he had been with the Quakers, he went to the Meeting at <hi>Northwillingham</hi> many times, to contend against the Baptists, more then for any thing else.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover he declared (without any inquiry,)
<q>That the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why he went to pronounce <hi>Richard Iames</hi> a Leper, arose from the consideration of a passage, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. And that he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the People called Quakers, to be as eminently owned of God, as <hi>Moses</hi>; so he was perswaded, God would send the same judgment on <hi>Ralph Iames</hi> for contending against the Quakers, as he sent on <hi>Mirriam,</hi> for contending with <hi>Moses.</hi> All this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is attested by <hi>Christopher Foster, William Skin, Iohn Wales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, Robert Trigg,</hi> and <hi>Richard Horton.</hi>

This last passage the said <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> did again relate almost word for word, in the presence of <hi>Christopher Foster</hi> aforesaid, and three strangers which came out of <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> to have satisfaction concerning the <hi>Narrative</hi>; at which time also, being asked by these strangers concerning the truth of the <hi>Narrative,</hi> he said,

            <p>Thus it appears, That <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> was a Quaker, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor can we have a better testimony, then a Mans own confession in this case; for he must needs know his own opinions better then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34769:10"/>
another Man: Nor is it possible for us to prove, what conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (in all respects) he had with them, because remote from him, and not concerned in the Quakers Congregations. And whether a Mans own confession for matter of opinion, being attended with those demonstrations of the Matters of Fact hereby observed, be not a cogent proof to satisfie indifferent Men, I must leave the sober Reader to judge for his own satisfaction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That he the said</hi> Richard Anderson, <hi>and his family, was afflicted by the Hand of God upon him, as is said in the</hi> Narrative.</p>
            <p>Here the Quakers make a very strange out-cry against me for evidence, as if <hi>Richard Anderson,</hi> and his wives testimony, were nothing in this case? Surely, since the World was, there could never be a more cogent evidence against any Man (ordinarily) then himself; and its a Maxim, <hi>Where there is open confession, there needs no evidence.</hi> And one would think the Father and Mother of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, knows best the state of their Children; and let the serious Reader consider, how unreasonable it would have been for me, to doubt of the truth of what <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> and his wife, both testified of their own pains, and of the sores of their child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that with great sorrow of heart, especially seeing him come the second time, and bring his wife with him three or four miles (a person not wont to come to our Assemblies) to attest, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest the same things, which he himself did; and sith I had no ground to doubt, I had no necessity to go (being not requested, nor any way related to any one of them, in point of Religion) yet had I foreseen this peevishness in the incredulous Quakers, I might perhaps have deprived them of this their foolish advantage. But what shall I say, did our Blessed Saviour go to visit all, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 13.) for whose health he prayed, I trow not. Neither did <hi>Paul,</hi> that chosen vessel, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 12. visit all whom he was instrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to heal; for this they sent to him, and so had from his body again, their Aprons and Kercheifs, and by Faith received healing, yet we read not of his going to the places of their abode. [<hi>But what am I! O Lord, I confess unto thee, I am not worthy to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here; nor was I an instrument of good to the afflicted, any more then the rest of thy servants met together to make their Prayers unto thee.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:34769:11"/>But now let us hear what <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> himself hath testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before many witnesses in this case, since the publishing of the <hi>Narrative,</hi> and the Quakers <hi>Lying Wonder. Iune</hi> 10. 1672. The witnesses hereafter named write thus. We asked him (meaning <hi>Richard Anderson</hi>) when he had told us, that he did pronounce the judgment of <hi>Leprosie</hi> against <hi>Ralph Iames,</hi> Whether he himself had not a child presently after that, was Leprous; and he said, he had a child then that did break out into sores; and he did also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that he went to <hi>Ralph Iames</hi> to desire his Prayers for the reparation of himself and his family.

            <p>And for the Eye and Ear-witnesses which the Quakers call for, upon the occasion of that passage in the Title Page of the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and the wonderment they make that no Neighbor or Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can be brought to testifie their knowledge of this judgment. To this I answer, first, That there are of the Neighborhood that say, They do remember about the time to which the <hi>Narrative</hi> hath Relation (which is about nine years since) the said <hi>Richard Andersons</hi> family was afflicted, but being unwilling to have their names brought in question, and there being no necessity for it, because we have that which is above the evidence of a Neighbor, even the testimony of the Parents concerning themselves, and their own children. I shall therefore forbear to mention their names. Secondly, For the Title Page of the <hi>Narrative,</hi> I say, it was not of my composing, and yet even that passage (or any like to it) is not without truth (being candidly interpreted) for there was as much evidenced both to the Eye and Ear of the Witnesses, in respect of the affliction of the Parents of the family, as was subject to such observation, <hi>viz.</hi> A sorrowful countenance, their complaint, and humble confession.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That</hi> Richard Anderson <hi>and his family were delivered from their afflictions, as it is declared in the Narrative.</hi> Although the Quakers are pleased in their <hi>Lying Wonder</hi> to deny this, and do bear their unmindful Readers in hand, as if none of the Witnesses
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34769:12"/>
to the <hi>Narrative,</hi> do evidence any thing in this case; yet several of them do clearly attest the whole Relation in the <hi>Narrative</hi> to be true; one Branch whereof is this, — <hi>The Lord was mercifully pleased to hear our poor prayers for them, and to restore them all to their former health again; which he himself</hi> (<hi>that is,</hi> Richard Anderson) <hi>confessed when he came to our Meeting afterwards.</hi> True it is, they did not see the child, nor perhaps the Woman after their recovery; yet they saw the Father of the family, whose testimony for himself, and for his family in this case, is considerable, notwithstanding all the cavillations in the Quakers <hi>Lying Wonder.</hi> Hear also what he the said <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> hath testified since the publication of the <hi>Narrative, &amp;c. Iune</hi> 10. 1672.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> being asked in the presence of divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whether he did not go to <hi>Ralph Iames</hi> and desire his Prayers to God for him and his Family? He answered, Yes, he did so, and that <hi>Ralph Iames</hi> did appoint him and his wife, to meet him at <hi>Donnington,</hi> where prayer was put up to God for them by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation there met together.</p>
               <p>And being asked, if he thought any person could be sadder for the loss of any relation or dear friend, then he was at that time when the hand of the Lord was upon him; he answered, no, for he was sad enough. In answer to this question, whether he did not come the next Lords day, after the Congregation at <hi>Donnington</hi> had prayed for them; and there confess, that he and his family was all recovered, and in health again. He answered, Yes, he did so; and said moreover, That what he said then, he would own it at any time, for he could not deny it.</p>

They say (and onely say) that <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> is a Member of the Independant and Baptist people, and yet it appears not, that he ever heard the Independants at all; and it is certain,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34769:15"/>
he was never Baptised, and so not a Member of any Baptised Church in <hi>Lincolnshire</hi>; nor are the Independants concerned for ought that appears; in the publication of the <hi>Narrative,</hi> there are onely two or three places where they are mentioned, but no way as Confederates with the Baptists, onely <hi>Peter Stacy</hi> is brought in as an evidence, that <hi>Richard Anderson</hi> owned the Relation given by <hi>Ralph Iames,</hi> to be true. True it is, they were joyntly concerned in a dispute against the Quakers, but it was not at all about this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie; nor can their being named in <hi>I.

And though the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist is charged with the same crimes, yet most unjustly, as hath already been evinced. And very unjust is that which is said in the Quakers <hi>Lying Wonder, pag.</hi> 1. That this story was found upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, made of <hi>Ralph Iames</hi> and <hi>Richard Anderson,</hi> to be a feigned imagination six years ago; then which, nothing can be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly spoken; for I have constantly affirmed, what now I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the <hi>Narrative,</hi> and see no cause to this day to recal it.</p>
            <p>If the Independants in <hi>New England</hi> be no further culpable of the fault charged on them, then those our Neighbors in this case, the Quakers are very injurious in what they have reported, <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. of this their <hi>Lying Wonder.</hi> And thus have we seen an end of this pretended Juggle.</p>

I might fill much Paper, should I recapitulate what of this kind I have met with from them, it shall suffice therefore, that we view how this small Book of theirs is furnished; that by a taste from thence, we may know the Fountain whence they draw that which they so freely fill out to others.

            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>They call their Book,</hi> The Anabaptists Lying Wonder, <hi>which is a title as far from modesty, as it is from truth.</hi>

But sure this is the way to make the very Apostles, &amp;c. Hipocrites too; for though many of those things which God did by them, be set down, and that long after they were done too, yet the time is seldom mentioned. And what would it have signified, if the time had been precisely set down (for that the business was more ancient, then of yesterday, was sufficiently intimated in the Letters Printed) seeing the Men concerned, are both living, the places of their abode known, and easie to be found by any that would know further concerning that matter.</item>

            <p n="8">8. <hi>An Exhortation to all Christians to beware of the delusions of the people called Quakers.</hi> Nor can I do less (having this occasion put into my hand) then to admonish and exhort all Christians to look well to their goings; for, let us know assuredly, that the days are perillous, because the time is come, wherein that doctrine which is according to Godliness (even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ) and, that form of sound words delivered to the Churches by the holy Apostles; that form of Doctrine once obeyed from the Heart;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34769:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Faith once delivered to the Saints; is now in every place turned from, or lightly regarded, by many pretending to the high Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christianity; and they are therefore, and shall be more and more turned into Fables, according as is foreshewn in the Word of Truth.</p>
            <p>Wherefore seeing we know these things before, Let us beware, least at any time we be led away with the Errors of these days, and fall from that stedfastness in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship; to which, through the grace of God, we have attained.</p>
            <p>And above all, Let us beware of those; who either directly or indirectly, deny the onely Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ, whiles they believe not his Death, Resurrection, and Ascension, and second coming according to the Scriptures: But in stead of those necessary points of the Christian Faith, labor to refer (by obscure ways, and a fair shew of words) all these things, to the work of mortification, and what they (pretend) to experience in themselves.</p>
            <p>Labor therefore to distinguish between the work of Christ in redeeming Man, and the Work of his Spirit and Word, in sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his people. Hold fast the first by Faith, and labor to live in the latter by blessed experience: Waiting for the Redemption of your Bodies, in the glorious Resurrection of the Just; according to the working, whereby our Lord Jesus is able to subdue all things to himself.</p>
            <p>And be not deceived by any means, by the empty boasts of some in those days, as if they had already obtained to the Resurrection of the Dead, saying, That they even now do witness mortality to be swallowed up of life, with divers other such great swelling words of vanity. But ever remember, that <hi>Paul</hi> in his greatest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, wherein he heard things too high to be uttered to the Churches; yet had he not then no, nor to this day, attained to the Resurrection of the Dead, but labored, if by any means he might attain it.</p>
            <p>And follow not those who indirectly (or by consequence) deny Jesus Christ, I mean those that deny his Commandments; for, as one hath well said, Such as deny those things which Christ hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to declare and keep in memory, his coming in the flesh, his dying, rising, ascension, and second coming, do (at the best, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34769:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by consequence deny him to be come in the Flesh. By these things which are ordained to declare Christ come in the flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I mean all Gospel Institutions; for whether it be Preaching, and Praying, according to the Word, Sacred Baptism, or the Table of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they serve to this end specially, to hold forth Christ, and him crucified, to come again and receive his servants into his Everlasting Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And thus the holy Gospel being duly observed in all its parts, with a constant waiting for the Son of God from Heaven, even Jesus who was raised from the dead, you shall be found unto praise and honor, for keeping the Ordinances, here, as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Churches, and to the glory of God hereafter; for if any Man will serve Christ, him will the Father honor.</p>

            <p>Upon these particulars I Quere.</p>

               <item>1. Whether he be fitly called a Laborer in the Gospel, who holds that the Gospel was never Preached in <hi>England,</hi> till <hi>George Fox</hi> preached it? (Not yet forty years ago.) And whether thou did not assert this? And being admonished of the consequence of that saying, <hi>viz.</hi> That then the Gospel preached by <hi>Fox,</hi> could not be the Gospel of Christ, because Christs Gospel was preached in <hi>England</hi> many hundreds of years before <hi>Fox</hi> was born, Whether thou did not still persist in thy assertion with this emendation, That the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was not preached in <hi>England,</hi> as it is preached by the People of God called Quakers, till <hi>George Fox</hi> preached it? And whether this do not make the Matter worse? And is it not hence evident? That thou Laborest not in the Gospel of Christ, but the Gospel of <hi>George Fox,</hi> which being no Gospel, it follows thou art no Laborer in the Gospel.</item>
               <item>2. Whether he that holds that nothing which was Mortal, was called Christ, doth not thereby deny the death of Christ? And
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34769:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whether thy conscience do not tell thee, thou asserted this; and being shewed the sequel of thy words, (<hi>viz.</hi> That then Christ died not,) and an offer made by thy opposite, to recal that saying, if thou thought thou wast mistaken? whether then did not thou refuse to recal it; and chose rather to persist in thy error. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that holds this dangerous position, can truly Preach the dying of the Lord Jesus for sin? And how then can he Preach the Gospel.</item>
               <item>3. Whether he that shall assert. That Christ hath no Body of Flesh, beside his Church, can Preach truly the Resurrection, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension, and second coming of the Body of our Lord Christ, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture. And whether thou did not assert this before many witnesses! and if thou still art of the same opinion, how canst thou truly Labor in the Gospel?</item>
               <item>4. Whether by the words (<hi>People of God</hi>) thou means the Church of Christ, in visible Profession of the Gospel, according to the pattern of the Churches in the Apostles days?</item>
               <item>5. Whether the people called Quakers, are gathered, consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and governed, in a Church capacity, according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ and his Apostles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. to 43. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 47,48. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. 12, 13,14, 15,16,17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.4, 5,6,11,12,13,14,15,16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4.</item>

               <item>7. Whether it be not sufficient for any to judge him to be a Quaker, that having conversed with them, receives their doctrine, opposes the Truths by them opposed, and upon the same pretences; and owned not onely their doctrine, but their persons as the onely people of God, acts by their spirit, and prophesies or preaches in their behalf, and hath frequent conversation with them? (And whether the Quakers have any constant and visible order, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Members into their Congregations? and if they have, then shew what it is?)

                  <item>
                     <hi>1.</hi> It is certain (and not denied by the Baptised Churches) that God Almighty hath endowed mankind with a Principle of Light, Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or Iudgment, to lead him to the consideration and observation of things good and honest among themselves, and to contemplate the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodness it self from the consideration of his wonderful Works, and to render to him the honor of his Mercies, &amp;c. For as there is a certain relation between the Creator, and a Rational Creature, even thence arises a necessity of obedience on the Creatures part. Whereupon it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveth, that he know him, and in general, what is his Will, whom he is to serve: And this is the great work of the Law written in the Heart of Man, <hi>Rom. 2.</hi>

                  <item>
                     <hi>2.</hi> But it is in the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Creator to give further, what particular discoveries of himself, and of his will he pleases, beyond the extent of this common principle of <hi>Light.</hi> And this he did to <hi>Adam,</hi> in forbidding by a Positive Law the Fruit of one Tree, which without that prohibition had brought no inconvenience to eat thereof, seeing it was good for Food; and therefore not sin, as some do vainly interpret this place.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>3.</hi> That there is in the Godhead the distinction of Father, Son, and Spirit; and that Mans salvation must depend on the death of the Son; that he, to that end, should be born of a Woman (even the Blessed Virgin, <hi>Mary</hi> by Name) that he should rise from Death, and ascend the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, come to raise the dead, and judge the World; are things wholly beyond the reach of the common principle of <hi>Light</hi> in Man, and onely known by particular Revelation from the Omnificient God, who revealed these things to the Prophets, confirmed them by his Son, and hath wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed the same by the Apostles.</item>

                     <hi>6.</hi> That the Saviour of the World should come to be Baptised of <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and that it should become all his Disciples to follow him in that act of Obedience: That <hi>Israel</hi> must commemorate their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the Paschal observation; and Christians their deliverance from Sin and Satan, by the Bread and Cup at the Lords Table, &amp;c.

                     <hi>7.</hi> The sum of all, is this, The general principle of Vnderstanding, Light, or Iudgment in Man, is capable of improvements, and it is onely improved, by how much it is subordinate to the Will of God, as well in the lesser, as in the greater things of his appointment. And therefore the Quakers undeniably opposing themselves against many things required by the Positive Laws, and made known by the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Almighty, concerning Mans redemption; and the Order of the Church of Christ, are not obedient to, nor sincere favorers of the Light within, but are under the guidance of the Spirit of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Error, in such their opposition.</item>
