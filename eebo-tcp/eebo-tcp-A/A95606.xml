            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the People of ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>OYe people of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe iniquities are broken forth like the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sea, whoſe mire and filth appears in every place; O what an evil ſavour is come up in every place; The Land ſtinks before the Lord becauſe of the abominations that makes deſolate in every place. Oh! the filthy <hi>May-Poles</hi> that Heatheniſh thing, how they ſtand up in every place, ſome Naked, ſome Painted, and deckt with Flowers, Garlands, Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans and ſuch fooliſh things, after the cuſtom of the Heathen of old that knew not God; And Oh! with what Shoutings, abominable Drinkings, fooliſh Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings and Noiſes have they been brought in and ſet up in thy Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, Oh! poor naked <hi>England,</hi> as if thou hadſt loſt all taſte and ſavour of Chriſtian Religion; And what will the Heathens and Papiſts ſay when they hear the report of thee and thy Children? Old and young even mad after their Idols, and none ſcarce any courage left to help in theſe things, the hands of all even as it were fallen down in thee, and few but a company of hidden mourners layes the things to heart that are ready to overwhelm thee. Oh! the cry, the cry of thy ſins O <hi>England</hi> is grown great, &amp; thou haſt been often warned by the Lord God, but thou haſt not repented, but even hardned thy heart, and fitted thy ſelf for deſtruction; And what ſhall the Lord now do unto thee, but even open the Flood-gates of his vengeance, and cauſe his wrath to come upon thee, judgement upon judgement, miſery upon miſery, till thou be brought low and be made very ſmall, and in the duſt it may be thou wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Lord, and cry unto him.</p>
            <p>But Oh! what Lamentation ſhall be taken up for thee and for thy Teachers in the midſt of thee O wretched <hi>England;</hi> for thy Teachers have alſo manifeſted themſelves to every eye to be a company of ſelf-ſeeking men, ſtriving one with another about the Fleece, but none helping or healing the diſeaſes and wounds of the poor torn ſcattered flock, but every one cryes give, give, they all look to their own way, their gain from their quarter, and fear not me ſaith the Lord God; the beſt of them is as a bryar, and the moſt upright among them as a Thorn-hedge; And now is the Lord ariſing, and he that hath overcome is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in his mighty Power to daſh the Potſheards of the earth together and break them one againſt another, and <hi>Babylon</hi> the Great ſhall fall and be a place for Dragons, and be no more inhabited by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any ſon of man, as the Lord hath ſaid, for ever.</p>
            <p>So howl ye Wilderneſſes, and rejoice ye fruitful Fields, for the Lord hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited <hi>Sion</hi> and comforted his afflicted, and the Kingdom ſhall be the Lords, and the haughtineſs of the world ſhall be humbled, and the loftineſs of their looks ſhall be brought low, that the Lord God alone may be exalted for he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; And this is our holy Hope, and living Confidence, and faithful Witneſs, who are counted worthy of God to bear his reproach amongſt you O people under the name of <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So people ceaſe ſtriving againſt the Lord and his witneſs in you, and deviſe not evil againſt the innocent, but fear the Lord and in time repent, leaſt his fury break in upon you, and his fiery Judgements be multiplyed upon you, which none can ſtop or quench, for yet the day of your viſitation is not wholly paſt.</p>
