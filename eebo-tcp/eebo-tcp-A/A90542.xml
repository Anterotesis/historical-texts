         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the Lord had appeared
for our Army at Torrington,
and had written his name in
ſuch viſible characters before
the faces of many, counſell
was taken to purſue the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
into Cornwall, and the
rather becauſe the ſcattering
of that body of Horſe would
after an eſpeciall manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
our future deſignes, not onely in order to Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but alſo to our Eaſterne imployment, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
give you an accompt, firſt of the ſteps we made
into Cornwall; ſecondly, of the ſtate of the Country;
thirdly, the condition of the Enemy; fourthly of our
owne Army.</p>
            <p>Upon our advance, the Generall gave me a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to apply my ſelf to all means and expedients
I could think of, for the ſtopping of the Eaſt parts of
Cornwall from riſing and joyning with the Enemies
Horſe, Foot being that which the Enemy (onely)
wanted, and thoſe they brought to Torrington blown
into ſeverall parts, and ſcattered, with a purpoſe not
to appeare againe. Accordingly I rid to Plymouth,
(though not without much difficulty) riding forty
miles very neer the Enemies Guards; I dealt at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111042:3"/>
with the Governour and the Committee there,
who offered me all their furtherances, had Paſſes of
them for any I ſhould imploy into Cornwall, and was
much engaged to Mr. <hi>Raw,</hi> of that place, (a diſcreete
able man, and induſtrious) who undertooke to agitate
my deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nes with the Enemy, and deſerves exceeding
well for his faithfulneſſe and wiſdome therein.</p>
            <p>When I was thus thoughtfull how to ingage the
Corniſh Foot from riſing in the Eaſt, (whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would have had a preſent influence on all the
County) it pleaſed the Lord to ſend in one out of
Cornwall, of very good quality, (and much intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
who came diſguized into Plymouth, having the
ſame deſigne with my ſelf, for ſtrong affections to the
Parliament and their Cauſe, aſſuring me, that 3000.
men ſtood ready to joine with the Enemies Horſe, yet
that there were good hopes, that the leaders being
rightly informed, might not onely prevent it, but
conditionally cloſe with us.</p>
            <p>Their chiefes were old Maſter <hi>Colliton,</hi> Colonell
<hi>Edgcomb</hi> of <hi>Mount Edgcomb,</hi> Maſter <hi>Thomas Lowre,</hi> and
Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Scawen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe I applyed my ſelf (by writing) and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
what I had in Commiſſion from the Generall, and
ſent it by the party by me imployed, who returned
again, and gave me hopes, and yet profeſſed much jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
on their part for the true performance on
what I promiſed; and therefore to ſhorten my worke
I offered my ſelfe an Hoſtage to them, till the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſhould make good what I promiſed.</p>
            <p>By the next return they invited me into Cornwall,
where foure of them ſhould be ready, in the behalfe
of themſelves and others, to treate with me, and as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111042:3"/>
they ſaw cauſe, to accompany me to the Generall.</p>
            <p>I adventured over to them, and there found Maſter
<hi>Corriton,</hi> M. <hi>Thomas Lowre,</hi> M. <hi>Glanvill,</hi> the eldeſt Son of
Serjeant <hi>Glanvill,</hi> and Major <hi>Treviſe;</hi> who being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
of the truth of what I had engaged my ſelf for,
were perſwaded to go to the Generall with me, and
truly I found them very ingenuous, who had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
diſtaſted the Court way, and abhorred the practiſes
of many of the Kings party.</p>
            <p>By this time the Generall had entred Cornwall, and
(at Stratton) our men beate up a Guard of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and took 300. Horſe: theſe Corniſh Gentlemen,
finding my words made good unto them, were much
convinced and affected, receiving from the Generall
Protections for themſelves and that ſide of the Country
againſt the violence of our Souldiers, as alſo Letters
of recommendation to the Parliament, for this their
ſervice, which tooke ſuch effect, that not onely theſe
3000. men, ready for their march, retired to their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
but alſo the whole County where we came, either
came in to us, or ſate ſtill; and truly theſe Eaſterne
Gentlemen are very conſiderable, and I am perſwaded
the old Maſter <hi>Coriton,</hi> (who ſuffered for <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
with Sir <hi>John Elliot,)</hi> will returne to his intereſt againe,
with many more of them.</p>
            <p>Upon our advance the Enemy retreated, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
lay at Bodman to refreſh our men, and to undeceive
the County, if by any means we might, which the Lord
himſelf was pleaſed to help us in, even to wonder, by
an Iriſh Frigot, coming into Padſtow, and bringing
Letters to <hi>Hopton</hi> and others, from the Earl of <hi>Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi>
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Theſe Letters the Generall commanded me to read,
at a great meeting of the Country men, in a field neere
Bodman, which had ſuch ſucceſſe, that the arguments
I uſed unto them, and what I read was received with
divers acclamations.</p>
            <p>Upon this day fortnight a ſtrong Party of ours was
ſent out to fall upon their maine Guard, under the
command of that honeſt and worthy Gentleman Col.
<hi>Rich,</hi> who accordingly met with one thouſand of the
Enemies Horſe, routed them, and put them to flight,
and tooke two hundred Horſes, and one hundred Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
amongſt whom Maſter Generall <hi>Perts,</hi> who is
ſince dead of his wounds, in whoſe pocket a copy of a
Letter to the Princes Counſell about him, was found
to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>That the Kings condition is ſo low is not our fault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we
are not able to breake through the Enemy, nor ſtrong
enough to fight them; therefore are reſolved to compound
for our ſelves, and leave you to doe what you pleaſe. <hi>Sir,
it came from the Military part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divers ſmall skirmiſhes we had with them, Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> himſelfe, with ſome of his
horſes are ſetting out Parties and Guards, and attending
their motions, adventured himſelfe according to his
wonted manner; and now the Enemies head Quarter
being at Truro, and their chiefe ſtrength not above five
or ſixe miles from us, the Generall reſolving to fight
them, or drive them to the Sea, ſent them ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
with a Summons, as he did conceive would
take off much of their Forces, and bring them all to a
ſudden agreement; and upon the ſending of theſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
ſtill forward, and in our advance they met us
with a deſire of a Treaty, which accordingly was yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111042:4"/>
unto, and held ſixe daies, there being matters not
a few to be conſidered of, as appears by the Articles.</p>
            <p>Upon the laſt Lords Day, upon a Downe a mile
from Truro, after I had Preached to our men, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Enemies, they began to deliver up their
Armes and Horſes.</p>
            <p>The firſt Regiment was a <hi>French</hi> Regiment, under
the command of Mounſier <hi>Laplane</hi> on Sunday laſt,
yet I muſt much commend the civility of our Souldiers
herein, that they let them paſſe without mocking, or
jeering, or offering any affronts to them.</p>
            <p>On Munday there were three Brigades more disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and on Tueſday the reſt according to the Articles;
If it ſhall be objected, That the Generall dealt too gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the County, or the Souldiery part there, I
anſwer.</p>
            <p>1 That the conſtitution of both the one and the
other required it, the Souldiers being a ſtrong Party, and
in the Enemies Country.</p>
            <p>2 The people needed it, and the ſame weapon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their cure that made their wound, <hi>Hoptons</hi> mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
civility that firſt deceived them, and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
now joyned with faithfulneſſe tooke the ſcales from
their eyes.</p>
            <p>3 That we have all this year found it our advantage;</p>
            <p>4 Meekneſſe, ſweetneſſe and courage have been
alwaies ſtirring in our Generall for digniority; we
know that <hi>Caeſar dando, ſublenando, ignoſcendo gloriam
adeptus eſt,</hi> but of the Generall we may ſay by the
like meanes, <hi>Patriam bene adeptus eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 We beleeve, that the Conduct of this Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
not to drinke blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:111042:5"/>
6 The Parliaments aimes are not deſtructive, but
reductive.</p>
            <p>7 We look upon it as the Spirit of Chriſt in theſe
latter times, and of the New Teſtament, to ſave, and
not to ruine; and the Heathen could ſay:
<q>
                  <l>Magnanimo ſatis eſt praedam proſtraſſe leoni,</l>
                  <l>Pugna ſuum finem, cum jacet hoſtis habet.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And this I am bold to adde, That ſuch is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, that if we had fought and beaten
them, we ſhould not have ſcattered them as now
they are; God hath reſtrained from the Enemies
themſelves this acknowledgement, that their Gods is
not like ours; their men not like ours, their Actions
not like ours: the very words of one of their chiefe
Commanders were theſe:</p>
            <q>That their men counſelled with drinke in their
heads, ours with wit in their heads; our men ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proſecuted and effected their worke, their men va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poured
and did nothing: we had a Conduct and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
they acted without both; <hi>yea,</hi> that this Army was
not to be fought againſt.</q>
            <p>And all the Enemy are engaged never to take up
Armes againſt the Parliament, except ſome very few
onely.</p>
            <p>For the Country, the Gentry came almoſt all in
unto us, the Corniſh Souldiers brought us and laid
downe their Armes at the Generalls foot, many of
them profeſſing they would but goe home and
attend him.</p>

preaching to them in their publike Aſſemblies were;</p>
