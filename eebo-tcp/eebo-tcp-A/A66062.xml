            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Easily foresee that in this censorious and inquisitive Age <hi>two</hi> Questions will be asked concerning the publishing of these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>Why no sooner?</hi> or, <hi>Why at all?</hi> since so many come abroad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap> the Age is almost oppress'd with them. To the <hi>first</hi> I answer, because I was not at leisure before to review them, and to get them transcribed out of a hand not legible enough for the Press: To the <hi>other,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55636:3"/>
because though there be many Sermons, yet not many such; whether we consider in them, the usefulness and weight of the matters treated of; or the suitable manner of handling them, in a style of so much clearness and closeness and strength, as was fitted (as he himself was wont to wish) <hi>to the capacity of the weakest and the conviction of the strongest;</hi> or the solid and well-poized judgment of the Author in points of difficulty; or lastly, the admirable candour and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his temper in matters of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and dispute.</p>
            <p>And I purposely mention his <hi>modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and likewise adventure to commend him for it; notwithstanding that this <hi>Virtue,</hi> so much esteemed and magnified by wise men in all Ages, hath of late been declaimed against with so much zeal and fierceness, and yet with that good grace and confidence, as if it were not only no <hi>Virtue</hi> but even the sum and abridgment of all <hi>Vices.</hi> I say, notwithstanding all this, I am still of the old <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pinion that <hi>moderation</hi> is a <hi>Virtue,</hi> and one of the peculiar ornaments and advantages of the excellent constitution of our Church, and must at last be the temper of her Members, especially the <hi>Clergy,</hi> if ever
<pb facs="tcp:55636:3"/>
we seriously intend the firm establishment of this Church, and do not industriously design by cherishing heats and divisions among our selves to let in Popery at these breaches.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Author</hi> himself, I cannot forbear out of a generous indignation to see the ashes of so worthy a Man trampled upon, to take notice of a very slight, and, I think, unjust Character given of him in a late Book entituled <hi>Historia &amp; Antiquitates Universitatis Oxonien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis;</hi> whether by the Author of that Book, or by some other Hand, is variously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and I am not curious to know. The former part of the Character is chiefly made up of invidious reflections upon his carriage, and the circumstances of his condition in the late Times; in all which, because I did not then know him, I leave him to be vindicated or censur'd by those who were witnesses of his whole behaviour and temper in that time. The latter part of it consists of flat and ill-favour'd commendations, as, <hi>That he was Philosophiae &amp; Mathematicae ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictissimus, a great well-willer to Philosophy and the Mathematicks;</hi> the exact Character of an <hi>Empirick</hi> and an <hi>Almanack-maker,</hi> when these two
<pb facs="tcp:55636:4"/>
excellencies happen to be in conjunction: And then, that <hi>to the study of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he added eloquentiam incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionando non contemnendam, an eloquence in Preaching not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised;</hi> which though it be but a very cold and slender commendation both of his Divinity and his Eloquence, yet I must own something of kindness in it, because there is in good earnest a sort of Eloquence in Preaching that is to be despised. To finish the kindness, and that nothing might be omitted that might any ways cast an <hi>odium</hi> upon him, as he is placed next before Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> so I cannot but observe in comparing their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, that there is apparently far less of envy and detraction in that of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s, than in this of the Reverend <hi>Bishop;</hi> for which I can imagin no other reason but this; that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> was then alive to speak for himself, but <hi>the dead bite not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it hath often been no small matter of wonder to me, whence it should come to pass that so great a Man, and so great a lover of Mankind, who had the inclination, the skill, and the opportunity to oblige so very many, and was so highly valued and reverenced
<pb facs="tcp:55636:4"/>
by all that knew him, should yet have the hard fate to fall under the heavy displeasure and censure of those who knew him not: And that he who never did any thing to make himself one personal enemie, should have the ill fortune to have so many. I think I may truly say, that there are, or have been, very few in this Age and Nation, so well known, and so greatly esteemed and favoured, first by a judicious Prince, and then by so many Persons of high rank and quality, and of singular worth and eminency in all the learned Prefessions, as our <hi>Author</hi> was.</p>
            <p>And this surely cannot be denied him, it is so well known to many worthy Persons yet living, and hath been so often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged even by his enemies, that in the late times of confusion, almost all that was preserved and kept up of Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and Learning, of good Order and Government in the <hi>University</hi> of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> was chiefly owing to his prudent conduct and encouragement. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration alone, had there been no other, might have prevailed with some there to have treated his memory with at least common kindness and respect. Not to do this to the dead, and in Character
<pb facs="tcp:55636:5"/>
of him that was intended to live to posterity, seems very hard; and yet I shall only make this soft reflection upon it, That there is no readier way for any man to bring his own worth into question, than by endeavouring to detract from the universally acknowledged worth of other men.</p>
            <p>Having said this out of justice as well as friendship to the <hi>Author,</hi> and by way of necessary vindication of him from the envie endeavoured to be raised against him by some in this present Age, I leave these <hi>Discourses</hi> of his to justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and him to Posterity.</p>

            <p>AMongst the many doubts and scruples which are apt to disquiet the hearts of good Men, there are none more frequent than those occasioned by their own mistake, concerning the scope and ends they aim at. For when upon an impartial enquiry into their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they find, that which has the chief influence upon them in any temptation or difficult service is not so much the deformity of sin, or the beauty of holiness, as the fear of Hell and the hopes of Salvation; this is apt to deject them with sad doubts and fears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their own sincerity, as if they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55636:10"/>
were yet only in a mercenary slavish state of <hi>Unregeneracy,</hi> and had not in any measure attained to those filial affections which belong to the state of <hi>Adoption.</hi> And by this means it comes to pass, that they do often needlesly disquiet themselves and discourage others.</p>
            <p>My design therefore from the <hi>Text,</hi> is so to clear up and state the Truth in this case, as may prevent those mistakes and the ill consequences of them.</p>
            <p>The chief scope of this <hi>Chapter</hi> is to set forth the nature and the power of <hi>Faith.</hi> The Nature of it is described <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to be <hi>the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen.</hi> The Power of it is afterwards exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by diverse instances out of the Old Testament, concerning many strange Difficulties and Trials, which those holy men of Antient times were enabled to undergo, being strengthened chiefly by this Grace of <hi>Faith.</hi> In the relation of which, there is an observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mixture of Examples, some of lesser note, with others of remarkable eminency, least weak Christians might be discouraged at those great Examples of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55636:10"/>
               <hi>Moses</hi>; as being unable ever to imitate such patterns.</p>
            <p>Amongst the rest of these Examples, this of <hi>Moses</hi> is one of the most remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, and it may justly be set upon Record as a strange thing, that one in the heat of Youth, as he was, who had always been brought up amid'st the delights and favour of the Court, and so by his Age and manner of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inclined to Pleasures and Ambition; that such an one should notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preferr the troubles of a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness before the Pleasures of a Court, exchange all his honours for the present, and his hopes for the future, for certain reproach and troubles; <hi>refusing to be called the Son of</hi> Pharoah<hi>'s Daughter, and chusing rather to suffer affliction with the People of God.</hi> And because it might be wondered at, upon what reason and motive he did this; the <hi>Text</hi> gives us an account of it, <hi>he had respect unto the recompence of reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words will not need much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. They give us an account what it was that did chiefly encourage <hi>Moses</hi> to so strange a choice; and that was, his belief that he should be a gainer by it, his expectation of a reward for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55636:11"/>
it. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>For he hath respect to the recompence of reward.</hi> There are but two principal <hi>terms</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> the one denoting the <hi>Act</hi> and the other the <hi>Object.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Act,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which we Translate, <hi>he had respect to.</hi> The <hi>word</hi> signifies properly the fixing of his Eye with intention, as men usually do at the mark which they aim at.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Object, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward.</hi> The word <hi>Reward</hi> doth not necessarily imply Merit, as is evident from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. where 'tis supposed that it may be <hi>of Grace</hi>; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it referrs to the happiness of our future state in Heaven; which can never be strictly deserved by any work that we can do. But it signifies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the bestowing of any good thing before promised, whether out of free Grace and Bounty, or by way of Hire or Wages.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> I shall insist upon from these words, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prop.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>That it is not only permissively lawful, or an indulgence allowed unto the infirmity of weak believers, but 'tis likewise necessary for the most eminent Saints, to strengthen and support themselves in their difficulties
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55636:11"/>
by a special and particular regard to the recompence of reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Point,</hi> which in many respects will deserve your attention, not being so commonly treated of, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men being very apt to mistake about it; and yet a mistake in this may prove of very dangerous consequence, especially to one that lies under any fear or dejection of mind, by putting him into an incapacity of receiving any comfortable evidence concerning his own sincerity.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that this inference may seem unto many a bold Paradox and mistake, as being directly against what hath so commonly been asserted and taught by many others. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall endeavour to be the more wary and considerate in the explication and proof of it.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Explication</hi> of it: 'Tis requisite that the chief terms be cleared and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reward</hi> is of two kinds: 1. <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,</hi> consisting in a freedom from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evils, and the enjoyment of all those blessings which concern our well being in this Life: Or 2. <hi>Eternal,</hi> which includes our deliverance from Hell, our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55636:12"/>
enjoyment of God, and all those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable joys, which we hope for in the Life to come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Man may propose a thing to himself as his <hi>End,</hi> or aim two manner of ways, <hi>Subordinately,</hi> or <hi>Principally:</hi> 1. That is a <hi>Subordinate</hi> end, which we desire, not for it self, but as a means for the helping of us to something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it: 2. That is a <hi>Principal</hi> or <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate</hi> end, unto which all our other prosecutions and endeavours are but subservient means.</p>
            <p>Now to apply these distinctions to our present purpose:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Temporal rewards may be the subordinate end in our Obedience; and therefore are they so often proposed to us in Scripture; and for this reason, <hi>Goodness hath the promises of this Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Temporal reward may at first be the chief occasion of mens being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and following Christ. The first reason which made the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> give ear to him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob.</hi> 4.15.</note> was her hopes to be eased of the trouble of coming so often to draw water at the Well. And there is no reason to doubt but that amongst those Multitudes which at first followed our Saviour out of by-ends,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55636:12"/>
some out of curiosity to see his Miracles, others out of want and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to feed upon his Loaves, others for their health that he might cure them, there were many that proved true Converts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We must not propose Temporal rewards as our chief end; for then we shall venture upon any means whereby they may be procured, and consequently shall be put upon many unlawful cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which may seem more likely to advantage our aims in this kind.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The chief and ultimate end of all our Actions should be the glory of God. Since all things are <hi>of Him,</hi> and <hi>through Him,</hi> 'tis but reason they should be <hi>to Him</hi> likewise. As the <hi>Apostle</hi> joyns them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. And thus far I suppose men do generally agree about this point. But they do not commonly apprehend or consider, that we do then make the glory of God our principal end, when we place our chiefest hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in the enjoyment of him. So that we are not to look upon his glory as any thing abstracted from, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our own good, but that wherein it consists; God himself (in the phrase of the <hi>Schools</hi>) being our <hi>objective</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55636:13"/>
happiness: <hi>I am thy exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> Gen. 15.1. And our own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or our enjoyment of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>formal</hi> happiness. So that <hi>that</hi> Man who doth principally aim at his own Salvation or the enjoyment of God, may properly be said to make the glory of God his chief and ultimate end: It being a vain imagination for us to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any other or better way for the promoting of his glory, than by our own happiness, which he principally designs.</p>
            <p>As for those Cases which some Men put, wherein these two are separated and opposed, as if a Man should be content to be damn'd for the promoting of God's glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It were easy to prove that they are inconsiderate, presumptuous suppositions, not without such wild inconsistences as are not to be supposed, necessarily implying one of these two absurdities: Either that the chief end of every Man ought not to be his own happiness, or that his happiness doth not chiefly consist in the enjoyment of God; both which are fundamental Principles. For the glory of God is a Relative term, and signifies nothing else but that excellency of his which results from all his other attributes, his mercy,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55636:13"/>
justice, power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now which of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes is like to be advanced by suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Creature that loves him in the highest degree should be made eternally miserable? So then the substance of this last conclusion thus explained, is this: That as Temporal rewards maybe a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate end, so our Eternal reward must be the principal end of all our Actions.</p>
            <p>And so much briefly for the stating or explication of the <hi>Point.</hi> As for the proof of it from <hi>Scripture,</hi> it seems very clear from the <hi>Text,</hi> wherein we have an account of that which enabled <hi>Moses</hi> for this difficult service, his looking to the reward, now if there had been any other aim, which had a greater influence and efficacy upon this Action of his, it would not seem agreeable to the Rules of reason, that a less encouragement should be set down, as the cause of it, when there was somewhat else upon which that effect had a nearer depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>We have another like instance to the same purpose, in this very <hi>Chapter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Abraham.</hi> It was questionless a hard duty for him to leave his Country and his Fathers house, to be a Sojourner in a strange Land; but that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55636:14"/>
him to obey God in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, was a <hi>double</hi> reward which he expected: 1. <hi>Temporal,</hi> that he should <hi>receive</hi> that place <hi>for his inheritance,</hi> v. 8. 2. <hi>Eternal, a City that hath Foundations whose Builder and Maker is God,</hi> v. 10.</p>
            <p>So in the <hi>Chapter</hi> immediately before this, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaking of some who were inabled <hi>to take joyfully the spoyling of their goods,</hi> he renders this as their chief reason that encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to it, because <hi>they knew in themselves that they had in Heaven a far better and a more enduring Substance.</hi> That which made St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself to esteem those <hi>temporal afflictions to be but light and momentany,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</note> was the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory</hi> in the Heavens. Upon this ground it is, that our Christian Progress is so often in Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto a <hi>Race,</hi> where men put forth themselves to the utmost,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.25.</note> and all for the hopes of obtaining a <hi>Crown.</hi> And in reference to this doth the <hi>Apostle</hi> profess of himself, that he did <hi>follow after, and reach forth, and press forward to the mark,</hi> that is, he did strein him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with his utmost diligence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, and all <hi>for a price</hi> (so it follows)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55636:14"/>
               <hi>for the price of the high calling of God in Christ,</hi> Philip. 3.12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>It were easy to cite abundance of other Scriptures to this purpose,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17. 1 <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10.22, 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19.</note> but I hasten to the Reasons of the point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From that Prime and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Law of Nature, whereby every created thing is by its most powerful and immediate instincts carried out to its own conservation. Nothing is more essential, not only to <hi>rational,</hi> but even to <hi>sensitive</hi> Nature, than that it should principally seek its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and well-being, and all other things only in order to this: So that it may justly be questioned, whether it be in it self possible, or consistent with this Principle of Nature, for a Man to love any thing more than himself, or not for himself upon some account or other? It is granted on all hands, that our <hi>chief end,</hi> our <hi>summum bonum,</hi> is our own <hi>happiness:</hi> All the difference is, wherein this happiness doth consist, some placing it in the <hi>present enjoyments</hi> of this Life, others in the future good things of another World; one Man is for the Court of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>to be called the Son of</hi> Pharoahs <hi>Daughter,</hi> another will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>chuse Affliction</hi> and reproach for the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55636:15"/>
present in expectation of some better reward afterwards. And though both do vastly differ about the several ways and means which they propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet they do and must agree in the same general scope and end of <hi>happiness.</hi> So that according to this <hi>Principle,</hi> to aim chiefly at our own well-being, is not only permissively lawful (as I said before) a thing which we may do; nor is it necessary only by way of precept, being, that which a Man ought to do as his duty; but 'tis likewise essentially necessary to our very nature; so that every Man must do it, nor can he do otherwise.</p>
            <p>For the clearer explication of this, I shall crave leave to remember you of that distinction which I have elsewhere had occasion to insist upon, betwixt <hi>Natural Principles</hi> and <hi>Moral Duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By natural Principles,</hi> I mean such kind of impressions, as are originally stamped upon the nature of things, whereby they are fitted for those ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, to which they are designed in their Creation: The Acts of which are necessary, and under no kind of liberty of being suspended. Herein did the Wisdom of the Creation consist, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55636:15"/>
God was pleased to endue the kinds of things, with such natures and principles, as might accommodate them for those works to which they were appointed. And he Governs all things by such Laws, as are suited to those several natures, which he had at first implanted in them. The most universal principle belonging to all kinds of things is self-preservation, which in Man (being a rational Agent) is somewhat further advanced to strong propensions and desires of the Soul, after a state of happiness, which hath the predominancy over all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, as being the supreme and ultimate end, to which all particular designs and actions must be subservient.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>Moral Duties</hi> I mean, such Habits or Actions as are the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means for the attaining of this end. About these we have a liberty of Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to which we are to be induced in a moral way, by such kind of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Motives, as are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sufficient to convince the Reason.</p>
            <p>So that self-love and the proposing of happiness as our chief end, though it be the Foundation of Duty, that <hi>basis</hi> or <hi>substratum</hi> upon which the Law is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55636:16"/>
yet it is not properly a moral duty; because every Man must do it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, nor can he do otherwise.</p>
            <p>Now to suppose that the Holy and Wise God should impose any thing as a duty upon his Creatures, which is inconsistent with those principles that he himself hath implanted in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in their first Creation, is an apprehension as absurd in it self as it is unworthy of God.</p>
            <p>This natural Principle of endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after happiness, is the Foundation of all <hi>Moral Duties:</hi> For the highest moral inducement or motive to persw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de men to any thing, is to represent such a thing as necessary to their happiness; so that our Obligation to Duty, is from the Law of God, but the great motive to it is Love to our selves and a natural desire of happiness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the chief scope of all those promises and threats so frequent in Scripture, which are certainly intended for this very purpose to excite and quicken us in our Obedience. Now it cannot be denyed, but that 'tis our duty to make that the aim and end of our actions, which the Scripture it self proposes to be so; <hi>namely,</hi> to avoid the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55636:16"/>
evil and obtain the good therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.19, 20. After that large Catalogue of Mercies and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before recited, <hi>Moses</hi> puts them in mind, that he had <hi>set before them that day, life and death, blessing and cursing, therefore chuse life, that thou and thy seed mayest live,</hi> &amp;c. Upon this account it is that several precepts in Scripture are press'd upon us with so many affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate insinuations taken from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of our own good: <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.29. <hi>Oh that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep my Commandments always, that it might be well with them, and their Children after them.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. v. 24. <hi>The Lord Commanded us to do all these things for our good always, that he might preserve us alive,</hi> &amp;c. Now I say, it is not only lawful, but 'tis our duty to serve God upon his own motives and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to make that a principal reason and end of our obedience, which he himself proposes to us under those Considerations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the nature of that Principle, which hath the chief influence upon the very life and actions of every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Man, and that is <hi>Faith. The
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55636:17"/>
just shall live by Faith.</hi> As <hi>Reason</hi> is the Foundation of all humane actions, so is <hi>Faith</hi> of Religious dutys. And every one under the notion of just or <hi>Religious,</hi> is acted by this principle of <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>brutes</hi> are by <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> by <hi>Reason.</hi> Now <hi>Faith,</hi> v. 1. <hi>Is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen.</hi> Where among the things hoped for, and not seen, are clearly meant, the happiness and salvation which we expect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, the rewards of a better life, which Faith doth as realy discern in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, as if they were actually present to the Sense. Hence it is, that <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is said to be <hi>the end of our Faith, receiving the end of your Faith even the Salvation of your Souls,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.9. So then if all Religious actions be derived from <hi>Faith,</hi> as the main root and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of them, and if Faith doth chiefly refer to the rewards hoped for and not seen, then it must needs follow, that it is as necessary for a believer to have a principal aime at the rewards, as it is for him to live by Faith: And that he may as well pretend to be above the life of Faith, as to be above the help of those encouragements of the rewards
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55636:17"/>
and promises proposed in Scripture; and so far as Faith hath an influence upon our Religious actions, so far must we respect the recompence of reward.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From the nature of our <hi>Love,</hi> which is another Principle; whereby the Soul is acted and carried on, in all its attempts and prosecutions. Now the proper object of Love, is not so much that which is <hi>absolutely</hi> good in it self, as that which is <hi>relatively</hi> so to us. And this being rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood will give very much light unto the chief difficulties about the Point in hand: 'Tis true indeed, there are in the <hi>Deity,</hi> attributes of such a superlative goodness, that of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they do deserve infinitely more than the best of our affections; but yet they prove effectual to the winning over of our love and desires so far only, as they are apprehended to be convenient for us. And therefore the exactest <hi>Schoolman,</hi> who spends most of his time and endeavours in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of those transcendent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies which are to be found in the Deity, after all his Studies may find his heart as cold and stupid, as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55636:18"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55636:18"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55636:19"/>
the most ignorant man. These things may raise his <hi>wonder,</hi> but not his <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> or in the phrase of a good <hi>Divine, they may dazle his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a more distempered ignorance, but will never be able to ravish his Soul with those angelical flames of love, which sanctified men do feel on Earth, and the glorified Saints do fully enjoy in Heaven.</hi> Hence is it, that though the Devil doth understand those absolute perfections in the divine nature better than any man in the World, as that God is most wise, most holy, most glorious; yet he doth not love him, because he himself cannot receive any benefit by him. And upon the same ground is it, that though a man should be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently perswaded, that his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hath more grace than himself, and so is absolutely more lovely, yet he is not bound to love his neighbour better than himself; because it is not absolute, but relative good, that is the surest ground of love. And therefore the beloved Disciple who had most skill in the nature of this grace, tells us that <hi>we loved God because he loved us first,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.19. Implying some kind of necessity of apprehending God
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55636:19"/>
under the notion of a Friend or a Saviour, before we shall love him. <hi>He that comes to God must</hi> look upon him as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a Rewarder,</hi> v. 6. Now, I say, if God's love to us, must be the chief reason of our love to him, then is it necessary for us in our best services to have a principal respect unto the reward, and those things which to us may be most advantageous. To which I shall add, That the phrase of <hi>loving God with all our hearts, with all our souls, and with all our might</hi> (so frequent in Scripture) doth signifie no more, than loving him as our chief end. We are allowed to love other things in such a measure and proportion as they are conducible to our real hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and as they are subordinate ends: But our chief and ultimate end is said to have all, because it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends under it all the intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Unto these I might add a <hi>fifth</hi> Reason, from those eminent examples in Scripture to this purpose. That of <hi>Adam,</hi> who whilst he was in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect state of innocence, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could not have any such reluctancy or weakness in his nature, which might

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:55636:20"/>I shall need to say no more for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Point. There are many Objections against it, as being beside the common road and opinion; some of the chief of these, I shall endeavour briefly to examine and answer, and then proceed to appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>Objection</hi> may be from that common notion of mercenary love and servile fear,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> which are usually thus described, when we do good out of love to the reward that belongs to it, and avoid evil out of fear of those judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that may follow upon it. And these are frequently condemned as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affections, belonging to the Devil and wicked men, and no way agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one that has the nature of a Child. To which purpose are those common sayings, <hi>Oderunt peccare mali formidine poenae:</hi> And that of St. <hi>Augustin, Qui Gehennas metuit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep.</hi> 4.4.</note> 
               <hi>non peccare metuit sed ardere; ille autem peccare metuit, qui peccatum ipsum sicut gehennas odit. He that is restrained from sinning by the fear of Hell, is not so much afraid to sin as to be damned; he only doth truly fear sin who hates it as he does Hell</hi>; with divers the like speeches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:55636:21"/>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note>For <hi>Answer</hi> to this: 1. As to the authority of such usual opinions or sayings, 'tis considerable that the Assertion here maintained, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be a <hi>Paradox,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore in reason be expected, that bare humane Testimony should be looked upon as of any special force against it. And to speak as the truth is, 'tis too common a fault amongst good <hi>Divines</hi> to take up general no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon trust, without applying them to the rule by a particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the reason of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I humbly conceive with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, that the proper nature of servile fear, is to drive us from God in rebellion and disloyalty, rather than to him in obedience and submission. And therefore the metaphor is taken from a slave, in whom the fear of his master makes him run away from him, and desire that he may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him again, as it was with the <hi>Amalekites</hi> servant, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.15. When men are afraid of God and fly from him as an enemy, whose ruine they wish, according to that common saying: <hi>Quem quisque metuit, periisse
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55636:21"/>
expetit:</hi> So that a man cannot do good out of a servile fear, this doth not put him upon the performance of his duty, but of his lusts; such was that fear in <hi>Adam,</hi> which made him fly from and endeavour to hide himself and his faults from God,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.4.</note> such was that in <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> which made one of them run upon his sword, and the other to strangle himself. The disposition of a child is fear mixed with love: The fear of the rod may bring a child to his father in filial obedience, tho it drive the servant from his master in a slavish disloyalty. And so likewise for mercenary love; which is when reward can hire us to any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any consideration of the good or evil of it, as in those two examples of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> one of whom would disobey God to win the spoils of his enemies, and the other betray his master for <hi>thirty pieces of silver.</hi> Such was that also in <hi>Balaam,</hi> of whom the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15.</note> that <hi>he loved the wages of unrighteousness,</hi> because of his strong inclinations to curse <hi>Israel,</hi> that he might obtain <hi>Balaac</hi>'s reward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:55636:22"/>'Tis true indeed, if there be in a man's heart any secret desire of liberty to sin, and a grief because there is punishment annexed to it, such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the soul is unquestionably evil; and of such alone it may be truly said, that he does not fear to sin, but to be punished, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks. And yet it does not follow but that sin ought to be avoided for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment denounced against it. And he who out of consideration of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is afraid to offend God (supposing that he doth not in his heart, actually desire any thing against the Law and Justice of God) such an one doth as he ought; for punishments are truly to be feared, and they are therefore proposed in Scripture to deterr us from sinning.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> 2. Another <hi>Objection</hi> is this: If in our obedience we may chiefly aim at our own private benefit, then it seems that we may love our selves better than God; nay then we set up our selves in his room. For that which we propose as our chief end, that we make our God: And this (says one) is the highest impiety imaginable; why, a man had better pull the Sun out
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55636:22"/>
of Heaven than pull God thence, which he doth whilst he makes a Deity of himself. 'Tis not better than the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> Idolatry, who adore the Devil; nor less absurd than the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, who worship the Onyons and Leeks. God is to be loved for himself, and to love him for any thing else, were to place somewhat above him.</p>
            <p>For answer to this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note> you may please to remember what was said before, that we do then make God our chief end, and give him that supreme honour which he expects, when we place all our happiness in the enjoyment of him. He doth not propose himself to us in Scripture as abstracted from our good, but as comprehending it. So he tells <hi>Abraham, I am thy exceeding great reward:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1.</note> So that the loving of God for himself and his own excellency, so much talked of in <hi>Mystical</hi> Divinity, is but another name, 'tis not another thing, from Heaven and Salvation: For the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God is Heaven. And as a man's love is to any thing, so must his desire be of enjoying it. Nor can it otherwise be, but that if God be our <hi>objective</hi> happiness, our enjoyment of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55636:23"/>
him must be our <hi>formal</hi> happiness. The force of this Argument supposes those things to be separated and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which do necessarily involve one the other.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note>3. A third <hi>Objection</hi> may be from those two great examples of <hi>Moses,</hi> the instance of the <hi>Text</hi>; and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as some think, the Pen-man of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for <hi>Moses,</hi> we read of him that he was so desirous of his brethren's pardon, that rather than his request for them should be denied, he would have his own <hi>name blotted out of the Book of Life.</hi> Exod. 32.32.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the <hi>Iews,</hi> professes that he wished <hi>himself to be an Anathema from Christ; for his brethren and kinsmen according to the flesh,</hi> Rom. 9.3. From whence it may seem that these holy men had so fully cast of all respects of their own, that they could wish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves damned, for the salvation of their brethren. So far were they from aiming principally at the recompence of reward.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note>To that of <hi>Moses,</hi> I answer, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the context, that 'tis to be understood of temporal death, not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55636:23"/>
Eternal. In the 10th. <hi>Verse</hi> of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> God had told <hi>Moses</hi> that if <hi>he would let him alone,</hi> to destroy that People for their Idolatry, <hi>he would make of him a great Nation: ver.</hi> 32. <hi>Moses</hi> rather desires that God would spare the People; and destroy him; rather than not forgive their sin, <hi>blot me I pray thee out of the Book which thou hast written.</hi> The phrase of a written Book, being a metaphorical expression, and signifying no more than the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God, which he hath decreed within himself in reference to future events, so that to be cut off by an untimely death, is to be blotted out of this Book. Now to die for a man's Country is no more than what every wise and valiant man is ingaged to by the Rules of Morality. There being a happiness beyond and above a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral life which may be purchased by such sufferings.</p>
            <p>As to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> wish of being an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema from Christ:</hi> such a desire if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in the strictest sence of it, cannot be lawful upon any condition; the reason is, because a man cannot properly be an <hi>Anathema from Christ,</hi> unless he be in a state of sin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55636:24"/>
an enemy to God, as well as in a state of misery. And there is no imaginable condition that can make it lawful for a man to wish himself in a state of sin: Besides that it implies a gross contradiction, as if a man out of the zeal of his love to God, should wish himself to be an enemy to him, and to be eternally separated from him.</p>
            <p>Or if any shall suppose the meaning of his wish to be, that he might be only separated from the enjoyment of Christ, without being an enemy to him: Besides that this is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Divine goodness, that those who love him in the highest degree, should be debarred from the enjoyment of him: It hath in it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a plain contradiction to the nature of love and zeal.</p>
            <p>The proper notion of loving any thing with all our might, is so to esteem and desire it, as to place our chief happiness in the enjoyment of it. And zeal is nothing else but a warm anger against any thing which may hinder us in this fruition. So that for a man out of the Zeal of his love to God, to be content not to enjoy him,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55636:24"/>
must needs be a plain contradiction.</p>
            <p>And as for such a degree of love to to our brethren as the strictest sense of these words doth imply, it is neither lawful, nor possible: 1. Not lawful, because God hath proposed the love of our selves as the pattern of our love to others, and it is not fit that in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the portraicture, we should spoil the pattern. That order in Charity to which we are obliged doth not permit this. 2. Not possible, because such a love would be in some sense greater than that which Christ shewed unto the World, and <hi>greater than that hath no man,</hi> Joh. 15.13. So that this phrase is not to be understood in the strictest literal sense, or if it should, 'tis by no means lawful, and therefore not to be drawn into example.</p>
            <p>What the most proper and genuine sense of that Scripture may be, is not so easy to determin, St. <hi>Hierom</hi> understands it <hi>de occisione corporali</hi>; so making it equivalent with that other saying of the same <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.8. <hi>We were willing to have imparted unto you, nor the Gospel of God only, but also our Souls</hi> (or lives) <hi>because ye were dear unto us. So Christ is said
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55636:25"/>
to be made a curse for us,</hi> by reason of that ignominious death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </note>Some others would have the sense of it thus interpreted. I could wish you were made partakers of the true faith, though I were as yet alienated from it.</p>
            <p>Others by this phrase of <hi>Anathema from Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</note> suppose to be meant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication from the Church, which is the body of Christ, with those consequences, which did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ensue upon it; <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>the destruction of the flesh, i. e.</hi> seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diseases and temporal afflictions, which the Apostle was content to undergo for his brethrens sake.</p>
            <p>'Tis observed by some, that amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> (unto whose customs and practice the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth here allude) there were two sorts of <hi>Anathema's,</hi> the one styled <hi>Niddui,</hi> by which men were debarred the external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church for the space of 30 days: The other <hi>Cherem,</hi> which did extend to a perpetual exclusion from the Church by execrations and curses. The <hi>Apostle</hi> he styles it <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema Maranatha.</hi> 'Tis thought that his wish in this place, doth allude only
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55636:25"/>
to the first of these, and doth import only his being content to undergo some temporary, short separation from the Church privileges and from the consolations of Christ, but not an eternal separation from the Spirit and Grace of Christ.</p>
            <p>Others would have this to be the sense of the words, as if he should have said, I could be content for my brethrens sake, not only to want the honour of my Apostleship, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of my outward condition, to be the most contemptible amongst Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as those are, who are Anathematized or Excommunicated.</p>
            <p>That which to me seems the most rational solution of this difficult Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is to look upon it as an Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical expression (of which we have several other instances in Scripture) which are not to be interpreted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the strict literal sense of the words, but according to the drift of the speaker, St. <hi>Paul</hi> being under great prejudices amongst his Country-men as an enemy to them, for his defection from them, and adhering to the Christian assemblies, doth endeavour to vindicate himself from those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55636:26"/>
by a most solemn protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there was nothing imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and possible for him to do or suffer, for their benefit, but what he was most ready and willing unto. So far was he from deserving to be thought their enemy: Which sense seems like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be favoured by the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>optarim,</hi> the potential, I could wish, answerable to that other place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. <hi>I bear you record that if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own Eyes and have given them to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is easy to collect what we are to judge of those expressions like to this, ascribed to divers others. That of one of the Popish Saints, who wished that she her self might be cast into Hell, upon that condition that she might stop the mouth of it, so that none might ever enter afterwards. That of <hi>Anselme:</hi> That if Hell and Sin were set before him, he would rather chuse Hell, than Sin: That he had rather be in Hell without Sin, than in Heaven with it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Loyola.</hi>
               </note> That of <hi>another,</hi> that he did not so much fear and hate the torments as the blasphemies of the damned; with divers the like expressions frequent in the Popish <hi>Legend,</hi> and <hi>Mystical</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:55636:26"/>Now I say though 'tis possible that such kind of speeches may proceed from those that are good, in some special zeal and heat of their affections, yet they are not from a serious considerate judgment, but being compared with the rule will be found to be unwary, boasting expressions, pretending to a higher degree of sanctity than men are capable of, or than is required from them.</p>
            <p>I fear I have been too long in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this Point: I shall be but very brief in the Application of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This may serve to confute that common and uncomfortable error, so frequently vented both from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and the <hi>Press, namely,</hi> that 'tis not enough to prove our sincerity, that we are able to do good out of love to the reward, and so to avoid evil for fear of punishment; wicked men may go so far; every one that is sanctifyed, must be able to hate sin chiefly for its own deformity, and to love goodness for its own comeliness and beauty, and so far make the glory of God his chief aim (not any respect of his own) that if his damnation might conduce more
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55636:27"/>
to Gods glory, he were bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that, rather than to be saved: Unto those that talk at this rate, I might suggest that advice of the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Be not righteous over much, neither make thy self over wise, why shouldst thou destroy thy self?</hi> That is, do not pretend to such holiness, as thou art not capable of, <hi>this is to be over-righteous</hi>; do not invent such precepts as the Scripture doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, this is <hi>to be over-wise</hi>; by limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting salvation unto such rules as thou art not able to conform unto, thou mayest be said <hi>to destroy thy self.</hi> It would be a sufficient confutation of such men, if they could impartially examine their own hearts, what that motive is which hath the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon them in all their difficult services, whether or no it be not, or should not be, the promises of the Gospel apprehended by faith, and if so, it may be a sufficient shame and check to them for the venting of such doctrines, according to which they themselves must needs remain in a comfortless condition: St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons upon it as being a good degree of grace,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55636:27"/>
that he was able to look more <hi>at the things which are not seen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18.</note> 
               <hi>than upon the things which are seen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the folly and peevishness of our natures to run into extremities of all kinds: As, the generality of men on the one hand to licentiousness and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaness, so some on the other, to frame unto themselves such rules of holiness as God doth not require, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>wise above that which is written.</hi> Some of the <hi>School-men</hi> and <hi>Mystical Divines</hi> have been so rigid in this kind,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>It cannot be denied but that there is a vast difference amongst men, in reference to their performance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as for an unregenerate person, he cannot set about any good duty without much pain and disquietness; spiritual services are utterly against the bent of his inclinations; when he is engag'd in them he is out of his element, like a fish in the air.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55636:28"/>
Whereas on the contrary, the more any one grows in grace, the more his nature is spiritualized, the more amiableness does he see in the ways of God, and he can walk in them with a kind of complacency and naturalness, as better agreeing with his sanctified desires; and sometimes perhaps the thought of Gods excellencies, may in respect of sense be actually more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent and pressing upon his Spirit, than the consideration of reward; but that which in a mans general course, is the root and principal encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against all difficulties must be this recompence of reward.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us be exhorted to imitate this Example in the Text: In all our temptations and difficulties to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose unto our selves those great and precious promises which are offered in the Scriptures.</p>

shame and folly for men that profess Christianity, so to be immersed in these present sensual things as to neglect their future hopes. 'Tis observable how the Scripture doth in several places set forth this recompence of reward, under such kind of descriptions as might render it most desireable to all sorts of men: Sometimes 'tis styled <hi>Riches, hid Treasure,</hi> a <hi>Pearl,</hi> or <hi>Iewel of inestimable value:</hi> Sometimes <hi>Honour,</hi> the <hi>sitting upon a Throne,</hi> the <hi>inheritance of a Kingdom,</hi> a <hi>Crown of Life and Glory</hi>: Sometimes <hi>delight, fulness of joy, Rivers of pleasures</hi>; that men might not be tempted by any thing else, to a neglect of this.

            <p>The true reason why men are so easily overcome by these present world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hopes and fears, is because they do not labour to strengthen and to stir up their Faith, in respect of those future things which are not seen. It

could not be, if men did really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and consider what they profess, that they should be so foolish <hi>as to run upon mischief, and forsake their own mercies.</hi> It was a considerable advantage to <hi>Moses</hi> to be looked upon as <hi>the son of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>daughter,</hi> and yet he esteemed this as nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the inheritance of a far better Kingdom; and therefore he despised all other things that came in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with <hi>that.</hi> We have none of us perhaps so great temptations, but yet we have as great encouragements as he, having a share in the same promises, and being partakers of the like hopes; and therefore we ought to be very much ashamed, upon every slight occasion to walk so unanswerably to them. Though some men may have greater temptations than others, yet this is our privilege, that no man can have so great temptation to sin as he has to his duty.</p>
            <p>Do but consider the advice of the <hi>Apostle</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. Speaking of a Christians future happiness. <hi>Wherefore beloved since you look for such things, be diligent that ye be found in peace without

                  <p>For the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy Ghost.</p>

            <p>THere is nothing of greater importance towards the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the minds of men, than to have a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of those Principles, by which they profess to be guided in their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. Now tho it should be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that some of the <hi>Leaders</hi> amongst all Parties, are chiefly swayed by their particular interests and desires of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, yet because they have done,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55636:32"/>
and will always, pretend at least, to found their differences upon grounds of Religion, whereby those that are <hi>Followers</hi> amongst them are heated to a zeal and eagerness in opposition of one another: Therefore it is of very great consequence that men should be rightly informed, what Religion is? Wherein it chiefly consists? What are the main things to be contended for about it? How men should demean themselves in matters of lesser mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? In what method the obligation of things is to be stated? And in brief, how they should so order their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations, as to be both <hi>accepted of God, and approved of men?</hi> Than which nothing can more effectually conduce to that general peace and settlement, which these Nations are now in expectation of: To which purpose I have made choice of this <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The occasion and dependance of the Words is this:</p>
            <p>There being in those Primitive times many converts, as well amongst the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as <hi>Iews,</hi> that different way, wherein they had been severally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, did by accident prove a great impediment, to their joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55636:32"/>
for promoting the work of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gentiles</hi> having been before gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to a most irrational way of Worship of dumb Idols, which had no tolerable plea for the reason or insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it, were upon their receiving of Christianity, wholly won over to the simplicity of the Gospel. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Iews</hi> having been educated in another way of Worship, injoyned by God himself, confirmed with many miracles, by the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> whose Doctrine and Laws, for a long time together had been preached amongst them, in every City, being <hi>read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day,</hi> Act. 15.21. They could not so easily be won over to embrace the Gospel, so as wholly to renounce all their legal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, but were apt to think that some of them might very well consist together with Christianity.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>two</hi> instances which the Apostle doth particularly insist upon, in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> that of <hi>meats,</hi> and <hi>days.</hi> Nothing was more detestable among the <hi>Iews,</hi> than to eat of their <hi>forbidden meats,</hi> and there was no kind of torment but they would undergo,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Maccab. Chap.</hi> 7.</note>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:55636:33"/>
rather than be induced to offend in this kind; as having radicated in them a general abhorrency from such things, grounded upon Religion.</p>
            <p>And as for the observation of <hi>Days,</hi> wherein the solemnity of Worship did consist, It could not be expected but that the Religious <hi>Iews,</hi> must needs be much prejudiced against any such way, as did pretend to an abolition of them.</p>
            <p>Now in this case, there were but <hi>two</hi> ways of obviating this difference: 1. Either the <hi>Apostles</hi> must insist upon their Apostolical Authority, and by some <hi>Canon</hi> or decree condemn these superstitious scruples; they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves having been the chief Preachers of the Gospel, and confirmed it by many signs and miracles, might with reason expect, that they should be owned as infallible judges, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy of this nature, in whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination others ought to acquiesce. And there are but few men in the World, ingaged in Parties, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such an advantage would not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have enclined to this course. Or else, 2. They must find out some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for this difference, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55636:33"/>
matters unto the present state of things, and to moderate the rigor on either hand. And it seemed good to the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> and to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> rather to take this way, which is the main scope of this Chapter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Apostle</hi> lays down several rules to regulate mens carriage in cases of this nature.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To forbear offensive disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these things, <hi>vers.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To avoid despising and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another upon this account. He that hath a clearer light concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own just liberty, must not despise another who comes short in this persuasion; and the other must not judge him, as being loose and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious in doing more than he ought, <hi>v.</hi> 3. This he confirms by these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You have no commission and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to <hi>judge another mans servant,</hi> vers. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho you both differ about these controverted Points, yet you both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in these other Rules, that no Man ought <hi>to put a stumbling block, or occasion to fall, in his brothers way,</hi> vers. 13. And that every one ought <hi>to walk
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55636:34"/>
charitably,</hi> v. 15. And to take care <hi>that their good be not evil spoken of,</hi> v. 16. And the Rules in which both sides do agree, ought not to be violated in the prosecution of those things about which they differ: And then in the words of the <hi>Text,</hi> he pitches upon another cogent reason to the same purpose, because <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> consists not in such things as were of the same and the like nature with the controverted Points; such things are no indication of a mans good or bad state, and therefore you ought not to judge of mens conditions by them: but in those more weighty and substantial duties of <hi>righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost</hi>; whosoever lays out his strength and zeal in things of this nature, shall be sure (though he do mistake in other matters) to be both <hi>accepted of God, and approved of men.</hi> That's the connexion of the words:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Text</hi> contains a description of those chief things wherein Religion consists.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>thing described.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The <hi>description</hi> it self.</item>
            </list>
            <p>By that phrase, <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:55636:34"/>
is meant, Christianity, or the state of Religion under the Government of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which was by the <hi>Iews</hi> commonly styled the <hi>Age of the</hi> Messiah, <hi>or the Kingdom of God,</hi> according to that famous Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> c. 2. v. 44. That <hi>the God of Heaven should set up a Kingdom which should never be destroyed, but should stand for ever.</hi> Conformably whereunto the <hi>Apostle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> c. 12. v. 28. calls the state and dispensation of the Gospel <hi>a Kingdom which cannot be moved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is <hi>described</hi> both by the <hi>Matter, Principle,</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of it:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Object matter,</hi> wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, and that both <hi>Negatively</hi> and <hi>Positively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively, 'Tis not meat and drink,</hi> that is, it consists not in, or is not to be judged of by those more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial parts of Religion, referring to external observances; which as to the acts of them may be performed by all kind of persons, whether good or bad; and do not necessarily suppose or require any habitual goodness to the doing of them. Not but that 'twas a sin to neglect these under the law, and 'twas a duty to be rightly persuaded concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55636:35"/>
our liberty from them under the Gospel; but yet not of such moment or consequence, that a man might hereby judge of his own or anothers state.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Positively,</hi> but in <hi>righteousness and peace and joy in the holy Ghost.</hi> That is, in such internal habits and dispositions of the soul, whereby the mind is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and changed, and made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the image of God, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Righteousness,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this is twofold: 1. <hi>Imputed,</hi> styled the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Faith: Of which the <hi>Apostle</hi> had treated at large in the eleven first Chapters of this <hi>Epistle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Inherent,</hi> that is such a sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the nature, whereby a man is carried on to a universal conformity unto the moral Law, both in respect of the first and second Table. Which latter seems to be more immediately intended in this place, because it may more properly be considered under the notion of a duty, and is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the most obvious and natural sign, whereby a man may judge of his estate: And is elsewhere called <hi>grace,</hi> in opposition to <hi>meats,</hi> Heb. 13.9.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55636:35"/>
               <hi>It is a good thing that the heart be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished with grace, not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Peace,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this Word also is capable of a twofold sense. 1. It may signifie a quiet state of mind, arising from an assurance of our reconciliation with God. In which sense it is to be understood <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being justified by Faith, we have peace with God.</hi> This is sometimes stiyed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a privilege than a duty. Or else 2. It may signify the grace of <hi>Peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> the desire and study of promoting peace amongst one another, a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and willingness of mind to agree with such in affection from whom we differ in judgment. And this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly our duty, being sometimes styled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which tho it be but a branch of that general righteousness signified in the former Word, yet the <hi>Apostle</hi> thought fit to specify this in particular, because of its suitableness to the business in hand. And that this is the proper sense of the Word in this place may appear by <hi>v.</hi> 19. where he returns again to a further enforcing of this duty, <hi>Let
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55636:36"/>
us therefore follow after the things which make for peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Ioy in the holy Ghost:</hi> This phrase likewise is capable of a <hi>twofold</hi> sense. 1. It may signify a <hi>blessing</hi> or <hi>privilege,</hi> consisting in the enlargement of the Soul, by the shining in of the light of Gods Countenance, when he is pleased to shed abroad a sense of his love in our hearts, and by that means to fill us <hi>with joy unspeakable and glorious.</hi> Or 2. A <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>duty,</hi> which Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are bound to labour after, and to attain: And that is, quiet submission to every dispensation of providence, an ability of rejoycing in an afflicted estate, as being acted by principles above these sensible things. This is elsewhere styled, <hi>rejoycing in hope,</hi> Rom. 5.2. — 12.12. And in another place, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.6. the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth particularly explain what he means by this <hi>joy in the holy Ghost,</hi> namely the bearing of affliction with joy; <hi>ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word in much affliction, with joy in the holy Ghost.</hi> 'Tis styled by this name for its opposition to the joy of the World, which is grounded only upon external prosperity; whereas that which must support a man under
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55636:36"/>
an afflicted estate, is something of an higher nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Religion is here described by its <hi>principle</hi> or <hi>end, whosoever in these things serveth Christ.</hi> There must be a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Christ in these things, that is, 'tis not the mere performance of such moral duties as are of natural obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unless they be done in obedience to him as our Lord and Lawgiver, and in reliance upon him, for his pardon and acceptance as our Priest and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that can make us <hi>acceptable to Christ,</hi> or entitle us to the name of <hi>Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. From the <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of it. It renders a man <hi>acceptable to God and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of men.</hi> 1. <hi>Accepted of God</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, well-pleasing to God. 'Tis the same with that Word, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.35. <hi>In every Nation he that feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted with him.</hi> 2. <hi>Approved of men,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 'tis an expression frequently applied to gold, to signify its purity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; and to money in general to express its currantness. So the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint,</hi> Gen. 23.16. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, currant money. And from thence 'tis translated to signifie the integrity

of persons, such as pass for currant and approved amongst all sorts of men.</p>
            <p>The Words thus explained may very properly afford these <hi>three Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That there are some things in Religion, wherein a man may be very forward and zealous, and yet fall short of the Kingdom of God, <hi>'Tis not meat and drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There are other things in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wherein if a man be faithful and sincere, he shall be accepted by God, tho he should mistake and fall short of his duty in other things, <hi>But righteousness and peace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Reason why Christians of several persuasions are less approved to one another, is because they lay out more of their zeal and strength in those lesser things, <hi>meat and drink,</hi> than in those of greater consequence.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> I.</note>I. <hi>There are some things in Religion wherein a Man may be very forward and zealous, and yet fall short of the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not as if these things were to be despised or neglected; they are matters of Religion, and therefore must be of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55636:38"/>
consequence. And 'tis a mans duty to labour after a right persuasion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the just bounds of his liberty. And 'tis no less than a sin and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition for a man to be needlesly scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous in such things. But yet these things are not so essential to a state of grace, but that, as on the one hand a mistake in them shall not prove so pernicious as to make a man (who is otherwise sincere) incapable of the Kingdom of God: So neither is a right persuasion or a zeal in them, so essentially good as to entitle a man to it.</p>
            <p>To the same purpose is that <hi>Text,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.8. <hi>Meat commendeth not a Man to God, for neither if we eat are we the better, neither if we eat not are we the worse.</hi> Heb. 13.9. <hi>'Tis good that the heart be established with grace, not with meats, which have not profited them that have been busied therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gal. 6.5. <hi>In Christ Iesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision, but faith which worketh by love.</hi> And elsewhere 'tis said, <hi>bodily exercise profiteth little</hi>; with several other the like Scriptures, which I cannot stand to enumerate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:55636:39"/>I shall briefly suggest these two <hi>Reasons</hi> of the <hi>Point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Because these things <hi>do not make us the better,</hi> as was said in that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8. And therefore cannot entitle us to the Kingdom of God. <hi>They profit not,</hi> Heb. 13.9. That is, they are not effectual to the things of greatest consequence. They do not improve a man as to his state of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, his real intrinsical worth. There is not any natural moral good in them, but they are so denominated, because we do hereby exercise our moral righteousness and obedience, which is good in it self: These things are mere <hi>externals,</hi> whereas the <hi>kingdom of God</hi> is chiefly <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Because these kind of Services do not necessarily require or suppose that which is the very life and power of Religion, but are things of another kind and sphere, and might be observed upon other by-ends. A <hi>Iew</hi> might have nothing at all of inward grace in his heart, and yet be very scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous in the observance of <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>days.</hi> And usually men think to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensate their want of the substance
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55636:39"/>
of Religion, by their zeal in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials: And besides, any external act of Religion, suppose dying for it, may be performed upon such natural principles, as are wholly heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to it. So that these things do neither make us holy, nor suppose us to be so; and therefore can be no good evidence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Use</hi> and application of this should be to enquire, what things there are now in controversy amongst us in these times, answerable to these differences about <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> and to proportion our demeanour towards one another in reference to such things, according to the Rules here prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
            <p>It is not very easy nor perhaps would it be prudent, to enumerate any particular list of such things as are now under debate amongst us in these times: But you may know them by these three general Notes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are such things as are not against natural light, otherwise they would have a moral vitiousness in them, and be opposite to that righteousness mentioned in the other clause.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:55636:40"/>2. They are such things as good men, true believers, may and do differ about.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are such things as wicked men and hypocrites, may be very zealous for, or against, on both sides. Whatever the thing be, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Practice or Opinion, which comes under all these notes (not any one of them) it may be safely brought under the same Rules, that are here given concerning the differences about <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>drinks:</hi> Namely these <hi>three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. First not to think our selves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men than others, for our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in things of this nature. The <hi>Apostle</hi> saith <hi>they do not commend us to God,</hi> and therefore should not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to our selves. He saith they do not make us better, and therefore we should not think our selves better for them. And besides they are common to hypocrites and wicked men, and upon that account cannot be any special arguments of our goodness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are not to think the worse of others for their differences of this nature, so as to despise them, or censure them. It cannot be, but that we must needs think the worse of their actions
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55636:40"/>
or opinions; because whoever judges himself to be in the right, must needs conclude those of an opposite persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or practice to be in the wrong: But we are not upon this account to censure such persons as to their estates and conditions, as if they were not sincerely Religious, nor in favour with God. For though they should be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and mistaken in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in such things, yet if their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation be more just and righteous than ours, if more humble and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they are thereupon to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted better than we are; both more <hi>acceptable of God,</hi> and more <hi>approved of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We are not to prosecute any Truth or Duty of this nature, to the prejudice of such things as are of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moment. There are several <hi>Truths</hi> which are not of so great consequence as <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>unity,</hi> and <hi>charity.</hi> And therefore in such things, there ought to be a mutual forbearance towards one another; and men should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by all means of amity and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to joyn together, for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of those more substantial Truths and Duties, wherein they agree accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55636:41"/>
to that Rule of the <hi>Apostle.</hi> Philip. 3.15, 16. <hi>And if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you: Nevertheless whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>two</hi> things by which men are usually provoked to heat and eagerness, in their differences of this kind. 1. A false apprehension of the weight and necessity of their opinions, by reason of those consequences which they fasten to them, and will have to stand or fall with them. And 2. An apprehension of their great clearness and perspicuity, upon which account they conceive no man ought to oppose them. Now this case in the <hi>Text</hi> wants not pretences of either kind: 'Twere not difficult to infer very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous consequences from the joyning together of <hi>Mosaical</hi> observances, with Christian Religion; and then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any mans persuasion may be, as to the certainty and perspicuity of his particular opinion, I am sure he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have greater, better grounds of confidence, than there were for this case in the Text about <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>drinks.</hi> Where besides the evidence from the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55636:41"/>
nature of the thing, there was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise most express <hi>Apostolical</hi> authority, for the stating the question, that the legal institutions about meats and drinks were abolished. And yet, out of tender respect to those who had contrary prejudices, they were not to trouble them with unnecessary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, but to <hi>bear their infirmities,</hi> and <hi>every one to study how to please his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for his good to edification,</hi> Chap. 15. ver. 1.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where shews much zeal and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, about these very points of <hi>Mosaical</hi> observances, as where he calls the great sticklers for them <hi>Dogs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi> wishes them <hi>cut off,</hi> &amp;c. To this it may be answered:</p>
            <p n="1">1. This vehemence of his is directed against false brethren, such conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious persons as were not sincere, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.16. And <hi>Pareus</hi> thinks this was after that solemn determination of this case in an <hi>Apostolical Council, Act.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was for want of this candor and moderation which here he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses unto. Because they laid so great weight upon their Opinions as to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55636:42"/>
make them necessary to salvation; and would not indulge or shew forbearance towards one another for these kind of differences.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the scandal hereby accasioned, which is a moral evil; and upon this account he is sometimes pretty quick and warm, even against such as were sincere and good men. This was the ground of that contest betwixt him and <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 2.11. The case was this: St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the Apostle of the Circumcision, having a more peculiar relation to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Converts; yet when he resided at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where there lived multitudes of converted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it was his usual practice most freely to converse and eat with them, as owning them for brethren: But afterwards, when some <hi>Iews</hi> were sent thither from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> out of fear to offend them, he wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew and separated himself from all conversation with the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; and by his example, the other believing <hi>Iews</hi> were likewise carried a way to the same practice, as if they had so great a zeal for <hi>Mosaical</hi> observances, that they could not own such as did not observe them. Now this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55636:42"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> styles <hi>dissembling,</hi> v. 13. <hi>Not walking uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel,</hi> v. 14. In which respect there was a moral evil in it, towards which we are not bound to shew the same tenderness. And it was a thing of so dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in respect of discouragement and scandal to all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that upon this occasion St. <hi>Paul withstood him to the face.</hi> Which carriage of his, was not opposite, but most suitable unto that advice of tenderness and forbearance, which is here prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
            <p>To shut up all in a word; it would exceedingly conduce to our common peace and settlement, in times of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and controversy, if those Rules of Christianity so often inculcated in Scripture, were more regarded and observed amongst the Professors of it.</p>
            <p>That men would <hi>be wise unto sobriety,</hi> and <hi>not above what is written.</hi> Not <hi>thinking more highly of themselves</hi> and their abilities <hi>than they ought,</hi> Rom. 12.3. But be ready <hi>to condescend to men of lower parts,</hi> v. 16. And to demean our selves towards every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55636:43"/>
to the <hi>different measure of gifts,</hi> which God hath been pleased to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense to them; <hi>speaking the truth in love,</hi> Ephes. 4.15. Endeavouring to heal differences in the most placid gentle manner, without <hi>envyings, strifes, backbitings, whisperings,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.20. <hi>Doing nothing through strife or vainglory, but in lowliness of mind, every one esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others better than himself,</hi> Phil. 2.3. They that exceed others in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, should exceed them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the study of peace. The best of us do now <hi>know but in part, darkly</hi>; that time is to come, when all these differences shall be cleared up, and we shall have a full vision of the true state of things. In the mean space it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to forbear one another, in those lesser things about which we differ: And to be very zealous about those great matters in which we agree, namely, <hi>Righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.</hi>

            <p>There are several expressions in Scripture, whereby these more essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and necessary parts of Religion, are distinguished from those of lesser consequence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9.

            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:55636:45"/>I shall mention only one Scripture for proof of the Point: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11, 12. If a man hold to the foundation <hi>which is Iesus Christ,</hi> though <hi>he build</hi> upon this foundation, <hi>Gold and Silver, pretious Stones,</hi> or <hi>wood, hay, stubble, the fire shall try it, if it be burnt he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Gold, Silver</hi> and <hi>pretious stones,</hi> is meant pure and solid Doctrine, by the other, <hi>wood, hay,</hi> and <hi>stubble</hi> is signified such vain erroneous Doctrine, as cannot endure the test of fire, the fire of Affliction and Temptation, the fire of the Spirit which searcheth and proveth hidden things, or the fire of the last day, but will be discovered and consumed by them, to the loss of all that pains and cost, which men have laid out in such superstructions: But not to the ruine of the builder, for <hi>he himself shall be saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I were to give Instances and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for the confirmation of this truth, there is no holy man, mere man, that ever was in the world, but may serve as a witness to it. Not to mention the antient <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, who were none of them
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55636:45"/>
without their mistakes and failings at some time or other; it were not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to produce a very large Catalogue of errors, out of the Writings of the ancient Fathers: Who tho they were the great Master-builders of their times, and by their holiness, zeal, learning, sufferings, did in their generations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly promote the work of the Gospel, yet they were not without their <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>stubble</hi>; every one of them being obnoxious to errors, and some of them to none of the least: Both <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Iustin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Origen, Hierom,</hi> and <hi>Augustin</hi> more than ever he retracted: But that it would in many respects be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to uncover their nakedness. And those amongst us in these days, who either really are, or are esteemed to be, the great Luminaries of Religion, they are not greater than the <hi>Fathers</hi> were in their times. Many of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, which they lay out so much care and cost upon, will prove but mere <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>stubble,</hi> when they come to a trial <hi>by fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall but mention these two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Point.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:55636:46"/>1. From the nature of <hi>Man,</hi> to which nothing is more incident than frailty and error. He was a good man that said, <hi>Who can understand his errors?</hi> not only of his practice, but his judgment too. And he who in another place, <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi> If any one should say he hath no error, That man hath not the truth in him. Now if mens integrity in the more substantial parts of Religion did not secure them notwithstanding these errors and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, no man living could be saved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the nature of Religion, which comprehends under it things of several natures and degrees. There are some things <hi>essential, substantial, fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi>; other things <hi>circumstantial, accidental.</hi> Religion is compared to a building, it is not a covering of the roof with thatch, or leaving a flaw in the wall, but only a failing or breach in the Foundation, that will cause the fall or ruine of it. Again 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a new life and nature. Now it is not a blackness of the visage, or deformity of the members, nor every hurt or wound of the body, that shall prove mortal, so long as the vital parts remain sound and intire: And on the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55636:46"/>
other side a hurt in the vitals would prove mortal, tho the countenance were never so beautiful. But 'tis a principle this, so very obvious and plain and without any dispute, that it will be needless to insist any longer upon the confirmation of it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Application</hi> of this Point I shall insist only upon two <hi>Uses,</hi> of <hi>Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Ehxortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. For <hi>Examination:</hi> If it be so that some things are of such absolute necessity to our happiness, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us then to examine and judge our selves by these things. Nothing is more desireable, than for a man to know upon good grounds the truth of his own estate and condition, in respect of his interest in the kingdom of God, and nothing can better discover this than our <hi>serving of Christ</hi> in <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, peace</hi> and <hi>joy in the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>Righteousness,</hi> by this I told you before we are to understand an universal conformity to the moral Law, both first and second Table, with subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the grace of faith. Now this, as it concerns the duties of the first Table, is properly called <hi>Holiness</hi>; and as it refers to the second Table, <hi>Iustice</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:55636:47"/>
or <hi>righteousness</hi>; who even allows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in a neglect or violation of either of these, whatever he may think of himself, is not <hi>accepted of God:</hi> 1. As for <hi>Holiness,</hi> we are told expresly that <hi>without it no man shall see the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8.</note> And elsewhere 'tis said, <hi>the pure in heart shall see God.</hi> He that doth either generally omit or neglect the duties of Gods worship, and hath not an holy awe and dread upon his mind towards matters of Religion, but can deal with sacred things with the same slight and common affection, wherewith he manages other ordinary matters, hath just reason to suspect himself as <hi>coming short of the kingdom of God:</hi> 2. And so likewise for that other righteousness of the second Table, referring unto <hi>Iustice</hi> in our dealings with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Tho the having of this be not enough to entitle us to the Kingdom of God, yet the want of it, is enough to barr us from it. 'Tis so sutable to the light of nature, so necessary to humane society, that there is not any one kind of failing that doth more scandalize the profession of Religion, or render it less approved amongst men, than offences of this kind, especially
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55636:47"/>
such as are done upon pretence of Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for <hi>Peace:</hi> Our Saviour tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.9. <hi>The peace makers' shall be called the children of God. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.35</note> 
               <hi>if ye love one another. Where as there is envying, and strife, and division amongst you, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. The <hi>Apostle</hi> makes it his business, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. to set down such marks whereby men may judge of their conditions, both in respect of the fruits of the flesh and of the spirit. And amongst the fruits of the flesh, he hath no less than seven several ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions to this purpose; <hi>Hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, strife, sedition, envyings.</hi> And then he subjoyns, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>They who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> And in the next <hi>verse,</hi> when he comes to reckon up the <hi>fruits of the spirit,</hi> he mentions but nine particulars, and of them there are six that refer to this grace, <hi>The fruit of the spirit is love, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, meekness, against such there is no law.</hi> The <hi>New Testament</hi> is so frequent and so express in this point, that a man of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55636:48"/>
contentious spirit must very grosly delude himself to build his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence upon his zeal in lesser matters with the neglect of this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And so in the <hi>third</hi> place, for <hi>joy in the holy Ghost,</hi> that is, a cheerful and sedate temper of mind, under all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dispensations, though cross to our particular hopes and desires; as being secure of our interest in him who hath the management of all times and events at his own disposal, and hath engaged himself by promise to order them so, as that they shall prove for the best to those that love him. This is a duty frequently insisted upon in Scripture, and 'tis one main branch of that life of faith, which is proper to believers. And therefore those fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peevish professors, who are never contented with any estate, but are always complaining, apt to interpret every thing for an injury and unworthy dealing towards them, have upon this ground just cause to suspect themselves, of much impotence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, pride, want of that lowliness and meekness of spirit, which the Gospel doth require. If upon a strict enquiry we find our selves, willfully,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55636:48"/>
grosly negligent in these more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial things, we have just cause to suspect our conditions.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I have but one <hi>Use</hi> more, for <hi>Exhortation,</hi> with which I shall conclude this Point. To quicken and stir us up to lay out our strength and zeal for the promoting of these things both in our selves and others. There cannot be any more effectual motive, as to our selves, than what I have already insisted upon, that nothing else can secure us without these, and that these will secure us without other things.</p>
            <p>But besides, these things, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our doing good unto others, will be more effectual than any other abilities whatsoever. They are singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar advantages for a man in his dealing with others, to have the gift of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, an ability of discerning spirits, of clearing and opening deep myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things, a mighty power of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading and convincing. But to all these, if a man were able in a case of doubt, and difficulty, to confirm what he preaches by a miracle, one would think, that were a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible way of subduing any opposition,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55636:49"/>
and carrying all before him. And yet all these advantages would signify nothing, without these moral foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; and a keeping close to these, might in some measure be effectual without miracles. 'Tis a saying of a Reverend <hi>Divine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Garbott Resurrect. of Christ.</hi>
               </note> that if the Gospel were now to be planted again, all the miracles in the world, would not be sufficient to make it take, whilst our morals are no better than they are. A miracle may strike a little wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at first, but good morality soaks and sinks to the heart. And therefore it were a most rational thing in a man to mistrust the truth of any Miracle which did tend to the prejudice of things morally good. And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in several places doth encourage to it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.13.</note> 
               <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it may be asserted that the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness of the doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, unto purest, highest <hi>Morality,</hi> did as much conduce to the spreading of it, as the <hi>Miracles</hi> whereby it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. And therefore when many of the Pharisees did pretend those won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful acts of our Saviour to be done by Magical arts and the help of the Devil, they were presently confuted
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55636:49"/>
by the holiness of his doctrine; <hi>These are not the words of him that hath a Devil,</hi> Joh. 10.21. And what can be said higher in the commendation of any thing, than that it is a test whereby to try even Miracles themselves, and doth in some sense give authority to them.</p>
            <p>And therefore there is very good reason why we should be excited to a great zeal in the promoting <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.</hi> 'Tis true, subtle notions and questions, are more the fashion of the times than these moral duties, but they are withal the disease of the times, and Professors now if ever may be said to be <hi>sick of Questions,</hi> as the phrase is: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4. Whereas these other things were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion before any of these fashions came into request, and will be so when they are laid aside and vanished. As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded upon that universal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Law, written in every mans heart, which can never be either aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, or diminisht, or abrogated. <hi>Nec per senatum aut populum solvi hac lege possumus.</hi> No power can dispense with this Law: Nor doth it need any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter to explain it. <hi>Non erat alia
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55636:50"/>
Romae, alia Athenis, alia nunc, alia posthac, sed &amp; omnes gentes, omni tempore, una lex &amp; sempiterna &amp; immutabilis continebit,</hi> saith the <hi>Roman Orator. 'Tis the same in all places and in all times</hi>; as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Supreme Lawgiver, <hi>towards whom he that will not yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, must deny his own essence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence</hi>; as he goes on very sublimely and elegantly upon that subject.</p>
            <p>I know many other things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, as to our religious state, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these <hi>moral</hi> Duties. But yet these are the primary foundations. And nothing else will be effectual without these.</p>

               <hi>THE true reason why Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of several persuasions stand less approved towards one another, is for want of a right proportioning their zeal about matters of Religion, and because they lay out more of their strength in these lesser things, than on those of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no reason to expect that the minds of men should ever be united
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55636:51"/>
to a mutual liking and approving of one another, till they can come to be more truly zealous, and more heartily concerned for those <hi>substantial</hi> matters of <hi>righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost,</hi> than for those <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials</hi> of <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>drinks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we consult the state of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, as 'tis represented in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles and the <hi>Epistles,</hi> we shall find that this was the occasion both of raising and keeping up the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences amongst the Christians then, <hi>namely,</hi> the insisting more upon forms and parties, meats and days, some being for <hi>Paul,</hi> others for <hi>Apollos,</hi> others for <hi>Cephas,</hi> than upon the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of duties. And the same like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise might be made evident from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant testimony out of Ecclesiastical Writers, concerning the following Ages. And what hath been the state of things in our own times is sufficiently obvious to any easy observation.</p>
            <p>There are two heads of Reasons or Argument, that I shall mention for proof of the Point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the nature and usual conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of that zeal whereby men are engaged to these lesser things.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:55636:51"/>2. From the nature and necessary fruits of mens being devoted to the more substantial things of Religion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Zeal about these lesser matters is not only consistent with strifes and divisions, but is many times the very occasion and fewel whereby they are begotten and continued amongst men. What the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith concerning those <hi>questions</hi> which he calls <hi>foolish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.9.</note> is in some proportion true concerning such other disputes as are managed with greater vehemence than they ought; that from hence cometh <hi>envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.4. Let a man but look indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, round about him, amongst all the kinds of Parties in our times, even those whom in his own judgment he esteems the best, and then say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both our common peace and the power of Religion hath not suffered exceedingly upon this account. When men have once given up themselves to controversies of this nature, tho they should perhaps be on the right side, yet these consequences do ordinarily follow upon it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:55636:52"/>1. Such men are narrowed in their judgments, liable to strong prejudices upon very weak grounds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Soured in their spirits, becoming more censorious and rugged in their dispositions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Vitiated in their morals, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the duties of moral honesty, neglecting the tyes of Relations, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, gratitude, and such other things, as should secure and sweeten humane society.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Cooled in their zeal and fervor towards the more substantial parts of religion, whilst they are wholly taken up with the prosecution of lesser mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. That man hath conversed but a little in the world, or at least made but slender observation, who hath not in these times met with abundance of examples to this purpose.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>second</hi> Reason is from the nature of these more weighty and substantial matters of Religion, whose property, it is to unite the minds of men and heal their differences. There is a <hi>twofold</hi> notion under which the strifes and contentions amongst men, may be considered either as their <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:55636:52"/>Now this laying out our selves, upon the more substantial matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, will free a man from contention in both these respects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As 'tis a <hi>Sin:</hi> By freeing us from, and strengthening us against many of those temptations to this sin that others are exposed unto. He that makes it his principal care to deal righteously in his conversation with others, will be sure thereby to minister less occasion of raising strife, and hath the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of avoiding and composing those heats that others would raise against him. If a man design this as his great business, to <hi>follow the things that make for peace,</hi> he will not be apt to be immersed in Parties, or transported with particular interests, or misled by the affectation of singularity; but he will be always ready to put the best construction upon things, to pity the infirmities, and forgive the injuries of others. He that is able to rejoyce in an afflicted condition, is thereby in a good measure freed from those temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of hopes and fears whereby others are engaged. And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will be less concerned in the designes of men, or the issue of things: Such
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55636:53"/>
an one knows how to be content with his present state, and to be patient under sufferings; and if he should not prevail for those things, which others will needs contend with him about, yet he can be happy without them. In brief, Religion doth mortify those inward lusts, which are the first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of contentions and divisions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us. It makes a man meek and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>blameless and harmless,</hi> teaches him not to <hi>revenge himself,</hi> but <hi>to overcome evil with good</hi>; to <hi>speak evil of no man,</hi> to be <hi>no brawler,</hi> not <hi>to strive,</hi> but to be gentle and humble, <hi>shewing all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes contentions and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are inflicted as a <hi>judgment,</hi> when the Lord is pleased to mix a perverse spirit amongst men, filling them with confusion and disorder, making them dash one against another, till they are broken to pieces. Now this minding the <hi>main</hi> things of Religion, doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise conduce to the freeing of us from this. The <hi>Text</hi> tells us these things make us <hi>acceptable to God:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Prov. 16.7. <hi>When a mans ways please the Lord, he will make his enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> As God doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55636:53"/>
punish disobedience, by making a mans friends to become his enemies, so is he pleased to reward obedience by making a mans enemies to become his friends. He <hi>hath the hearts of all men in his hands,</hi> and can bend them as he pleaseth; and he hath by promise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himself, either so to change their affections, that they shall be friends to us, or at least so to restrain their hostility that they shall not hurt us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?</hi> If a man be truly religious and holy, and give himself up to such courses, as are even to the light of nature unquestionably good, it cannot be but that he must hereby acquire a reverence and esteem even in the hearts of wicked men.</p>
            <p>I know there is an Objection against this, which is obvious to every one, to which something must be said by way of answer. Did not our <hi>Saviour</hi> tell his disciples that they should <hi>be hated of all men for his sake,</hi> Matth. 10.22. And doth not <hi>David</hi> complain of some that were enemies to him, for this very reason, <hi>because he was a follower of that which was good,</hi> Psal. 38.20. <hi>All
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55636:54"/>
that will live godly in Christ Iesus must suffer persecution,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.12. <hi>Because ye are not of the world, therefore doth the world hate you,</hi> Joh. 15.19. with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other scriptures; besides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant experience of all Ages to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>To this it may be answered, that 'tis true, there is in Nature, a necessary unavoidable enmity, betwixt light and darkness, good and evil, <hi>the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent.</hi> And 'tis not the meaning of these promises to abolish or reconcile that enmity or opposition, which is founded in the nature of things, but only to suspend the Acts of it. The more righteous any man is, by so much the greater opposition must there be betwixt him and sinners. But yet he is hereby after a more especial manner intitled to Gods protection, to preserve him from any real hurt, or damage by them. And they are for the most part, the imperfections and failings of good men, that do expose them to sufferings of this nature. And then besides, tho some men have such a <hi>superfluity of malitiousness,</hi> as the phrase is <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.21 being hardened against
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55636:54"/>
the common principles of morality, as to express a hatred and enmity against others, for their goodness, yet it is not so with all, nor perhaps with any at all times. But the worst of men, must in their secret judgments and most retired thoughts, bear an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reverence towards those that are good. As there is in vice a natural deformity, whereby it doth appear odious, even to the consciences of those who are guilty of it; so is there a beauty in holiness and virtue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears lovely even to those mens hearts, whose mouths are apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it. It cannot be but that some men will be apt to speak against us for well-doing. And yet <hi>well-doing</hi> is the best way to <hi>put to silence the ignorance of foolish men,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. Or if it do not wholly silence them, but that they will be speaking <hi>against us as evil doers,</hi> yet 'tis not without some secret shame, and guilt of being false accusers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>And so much may serve for the <hi>proof</hi> of the Point. I come now to the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of it: Wherein it may serve for these two <hi>Uses, Instruction</hi> and <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:55636:55"/>I. <hi>Information:</hi> If it be so, that the minding of the main things of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, more than lesser differences, be that which must render us <hi>acceptable to God, and approved of men,</hi> then these things will follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have reason to suspect that our ways upon this account may not be acceptable unto God, when we find that we do not stand approved to men, especially to good men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis a preposterous course to seek the approbation of men by any such way, as will render us unacceptable to God; these two being linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both in their own natures, and by particular promises. 'Tis true, a man may get into the favour of a Party, by appearing vehement and zealous in some particular contest, but this will render him less approved to other good men, less useful in his generation, and consequently less acceptable to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis a vain thing to expect any peace and settlement amongst men, till they come to be more concerned for those great things of Religion, than for others of lesser moment. There may be a change of Forms and Parties
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55636:55"/>
and the external state of things, but their minds will still abide at the same distance, till they come to be united in these great things of <hi>righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.</hi> 'Tis not the pouring of a liquor from one vessel to another that takes off its sourness and acrimony, without such a mixture as may enter into it, and alter the nature of it. If men would make this to be their great design and business to strive who should be most righteous, and peaceable, and patient, other contentions amongst them would quickly vanish.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A man may insist so much in the vindication of some truths and duties, as thereby to bring a prejudice upon Religion. He may do the Devils work by his endeavours to promote such things, as are in themselves right and true. I mean such contests, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern points of the same or the like nature, with those of <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>drinks</hi> in the Text.</p>
            <p>But what then may some say, should we be of no opinion in such things? Must we all turn <hi>Scepticks,</hi> and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to every thing, as if there could be no certainty?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:55636:56"/>I answer, by no means, nothing less; every man should endeavour to have a full persuasion in his own mind concerning the things in difference: And when he doth well understand them, he should be ready to assert and maintain them, as occasion may be offered, and so far as the nature of the things will bear.</p>
            <p>Only herein lies the great difficulty which will require much Christian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and consideration to the stating of it, namely, how to proportion our zeal aright, in reference to several truths, which I shall particularly speak to in the next <hi>Use.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Use</hi> of <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To be cautious and considerate in the right managing of our differences about these lesser things. There was never any Age, wherein contests of this nature have not been in fashion; tho perhaps never so much as in ours. And therefore it will the more concern us to regulate our prosecutions and demeanour about them. In order to which these <hi>two</hi> things are to be well weighed and considered, namely, the <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Importance</hi> of the things in question.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:55636:56"/>1. For their <hi>Evidence:</hi> Every truth, whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>revealed,</hi> is not alike evident; some are more obscure and doubtful than others. And because the evidence of things is the ground and formal reason of our assent to them, therefore 'tis our duty to proportion the degrees of our assent, to those of our evidence. Not to be doubtful in things that are clear, nor to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in things that are doubtful; but with an equal disposition of mind, to submit to every thing according to its clearness and perspicuity: In op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to this there are <hi>two</hi> extreams, which are exceedingly prejudicial to Religion (especially in times when controversies and disputes about it do so much abound) namely, <hi>Scepticalness</hi> and <hi>Dogmaticalness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>Scepticalness,</hi> I mean, a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and inclination of mind, rather to comply with doubts and objections, than with proofs and evidences; an aptness to pick quarrels with every thing, tho never so manifest, as if we were not willing that any thing should be certain and established. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the insolence and pride which is the ground of this disposition, there
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55636:57"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:55636:57"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:55636:58"/>
is likewise much of folly and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in it, whereby such men do become obnoxious unto that other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream of <hi>Dogmaticalness,</hi> which they affect most to avoid. For to look upon every thing as doubtful, is to deny the clear evidence of some things; and 'tis as well <hi>dogmaticalness</hi> to deny clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence where it is, as to assert it where it is not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>Dogmaticalness,</hi> I mean, a readines to be over confident of the things we are well inclined to; an aptness to own every thing for equally true and certain, which is professed by that Company or Party of men, amongst whom our names are listed; when a man receives a whole <hi>System</hi> of doctrine by the bulk, as if every thing in it, were undoubtedly true, and alike evident, without a particular enquiry into the grounds and reasons of things. An unwillingness to listen unto any objection, which may seem to make against them, or to shake their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. This is a blameable partiality on the other hand; and hath in it the like inconsistency and contradiction with the other extream. Such Persons
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55636:58"/>
hereby exposing the most clear and manifest truths to the suspicion of error, by putting more obscure and doubtful matters in the same rank with them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Second</hi> thing to be considered is the <hi>Importance</hi> of the matters in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As every truth is not of the same evidence, so neither is it of the same necessity. But there are in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect likewise several degrees amongst them: Some things are essential to Religion, belonging to the foundation, and are therefore necessary to the very being of a Christian. As <hi>Righteousness</hi> in the Text, that is, <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>holiness,</hi> and <hi>justice,</hi> or as it is elsewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, <hi>faith which worketh by love:</hi> Other things are only superstructions, and belong only to the well-being of a Christian, amongst which some are as <hi>gold, and silver, and pretious stones,</hi> things of the greatest value amongst men, next to life and being; others are of a lighter consequence and more remote from the foundation. Now herein much Christian prudence will be required to distinguish aright, concerning the importance of several truths and duties, and accordingly to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55636:59"/>
proportion our zeal for them, and our contention about them.</p>
            <p>Not by our remisness to bring down <hi>foundation</hi> Truths to the same rate with <hi>superstructions</hi>; nor by our forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness on the other hand, to raise up <hi>superstructions</hi> unto the same value with <hi>fundamentals</hi>; which are the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams referring to the importance of the things, by which truth it self will be very much prejudiced.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Too great carelesness and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness about necessary truths, a kind of indifferency about all matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as if they were all alike, and did so far only oblige, as the Civil Laws of several Countries did inforce them. I cannot say of this extream, that it doth encrease Controversies in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but it doth that which is much worse, it takes away the subject of the question, I mean Religion it self.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On the other side, a man may lay too great a weight on some things, which are truths and duties. And there is nothing more ordinary than for good men, when they are once well persuaded of some particular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to think they do God good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55636:59"/>
by prosecuting it with their utmost zeal, or by laying greater weight upon it than the nature of the thing requires, or will admit. But this must needs be of very dangerous consequence: For if this course be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, where shall it end? Why may not falshood be obtruded upon us on the same account? If we once trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress those bounds which are fixed by the nature of things in respect of their evidence and importance, there can be no security against the wildest er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the world.</p>
            <p>These <hi>two</hi> things that I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, being soberly considered and impartially applyed, to some of our late and present controversies, would very much conduce to the healing of the minds of men, and taking them off from many of those contentions and animosities which now abound.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We should hence be persuaded to lay out our selves with our utmost zeal and intention of mind upon those great things of <hi>righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.</hi> It were easie to mention abundance of Arguments, to excite and quicken men to a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency about these things, would the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55636:60"/>
time permit it. I shall very briefly sum up what remains under these two heads, the <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Seasonableness</hi> of these things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From their <hi>Excellency:</hi> There are but two kind of things that any men aim at or endeavour after, to get into the favour of <hi>Men,</hi> and of <hi>God,</hi> to be safe here and happy hereafter. Why now these things do entitle us to both, they make us <hi>to be accepted of God, and approved of men.</hi> They are not only duties but privileges, the chief part of that salvation and glory, which we are capable of on this side of Heaven. That which makes men zealous in other points, is their apprehension of the importance and clearness of the things they insist upon: Why, there can be nothing of greater importance than these things, wherein the power and substance of Religion doth consist. And as for their evidence, let it be supposed that in some of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies now on foot amongst us, there should in some solemn Assembly be an appeal made to heaven, to determine which of the Parties were in the right: If upon such an appeal, an Angel should immediately be sent down,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55636:60"/>
or men should rise from the dead, and declare that such a Way and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were in the right, and the others mistaken, one would think that upon such an advantage, men might have good ground to be zealous and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Why we have more reason to be zealous for <hi>righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost,</hi> than men would have upon such a miraculous confirmation of their Opinions: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these things are of the highest importance, and we have for them the same if not better evidence. And the reason is this: By the same natural light which convinces a man that God alone is Omnipotent, and can only do miracles, that he is infinitely good, and will not perform any miracle in confirmation of a sin or an error: By the same light it is that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of moral duties. But now we cannot have the like degree of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that this or that particular action is a miracle, (because of the obscurity of natural causes) as we may that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and righteousness, and peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, are duties, and of a natural good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and obligation. We are in the frame of our natures better fitted and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55636:61"/>
prepared to understand <hi>morals,</hi> than <hi>naturals,</hi> what is honest rather than what is possible; and 'tis great reason we should be so, because we are more concerned in the one than the other. So that 'tis not possible there should be any better evidence than what we have for the goodness and obligation of these things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Seasonableness</hi> of these things, both in respect of. 1. What we have seen in the Times <hi>lately past,</hi> And 2. What we are in expectation of for the <hi>future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>time past:</hi> No man can be ignorant of those horrid scandals that have been brought upon Religion by the neglect of these moral duties, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the highest pretences of zeal to other matters. Whereby some men have been induced to despise all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion, as being but mere pretence and design, as if there were nothing in it of reality. Now if we have in us any tenderness for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Religion, if we would make up that breach and wipe off that blemish that hath in this respect been brought upon it, it must be by our integrity and zeal for the promoting of these
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55636:61"/>
more substantial matters, both in our selves and others. 'Tis true, men have been always apt to rest themselves in moral performances, as if they alone were sufficient to entitle us to heaven, and consequently as the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to drive them off from such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions as these, can never be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable, so on the other hand when men shall out of pretence to some higher notions and attainments, dare to neglect and violate these moral duties, 'tis then, if ever, seasonable to insist upon the necessity, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reference to that settlement and peace, which we are now in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of, to which these things will most effectually conduce. It must be granted that 'tis beyond humane contrivance to find out any infallible way of securing future events; nor is it consistent with the nature of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, which are often swayed by such intricate providences, as we are not able to fore-see or comprehend the reason of; God sometimes making use of such men, who are most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against a thing to be the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of promoting it, and those
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55636:62"/>
who are most for it to be the occasions of hindering it.</p>
            <p>So that I say in this respect, there is a necessity that we should acquiesce in such fair probabilities, as the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of men can contrive and the state of things will admit. He that hath observed those various providences, which these poor distracted Nations have of late years been exercised with, cannot but take notice, that since our first civil tempests and storms, there have been some seasons wherein we have seemed to be near the Harbour and upon the borders of settlement: And yet in the midst of all our hopes, there hath still been some unexpected emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, whereby we have been driven back again into the wide Ocean, and exposed to all our former fears and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. What may be the issue of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent expectations, no man can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of. Only of this we may be most sure, that this laying out our selves upon the duties of <hi>righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost,</hi> will be the best security for every man in his private capacity, and the most effectual remedy for the publick.</p>
            <p>It cannot be but that in times of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55636:62"/>
change and revolution, mens minds must be variously exercised with hopes and fears, according as their several interests do engage them. The <hi>great thoughts of heart</hi> upon some men are, how they may be secured in the change of times: But now if men would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselves upon Scripture security, I would refer them to that place <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Wilt thou not then be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same.</hi> This being the very natural end of magistracy, <hi>namely, the praise of them that do well,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.14.</p>
            <p>I shall shut up all with that saying of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.10. cited out of the 34 Psal. <hi>What man is he that would see good days? Let him eschew evil and do good, let him seek peace and ensue it.</hi> He may be most certain by this means to be entitled unto the <hi>protection of God: For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers:</hi> And <hi>safety</hi> from <hi>men; For who is he that will harm you if you be followers of that which is good?</hi>

            <p>All which Exhortations are enforced by several reasons from the 11 <hi>v.</hi> to the end of the <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which <hi>Servants</hi> are exhorted to, is a submissive <hi>gentleness and fidelity</hi>; to be <hi>obedient unto their own Masters,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55636:65"/>
to please them well in all things, not answering again, not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity:</hi> Which exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is further pressed upon them by a particular reason, taken from that common duty incumbent upon all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, to bring a reputation upon the Religion which they did profess, in the words of the <hi>Text, That they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That's the connexion and scope of the <hi>Text.</hi> There are four <hi>Terms</hi> which may seem to need explication. What is meant by, <hi>They adorning the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Subjects</hi> of this exhortation, in the word <hi>they,</hi> that is, <hi>Servants, v.</hi> 9. By which word is not only meant such kind of Servants, as are now in use amongst us, <hi>Conductitij, hired Servants,</hi> who in other respects are Freemen, and can let themselves out to service, upon such kind of conditions, and for such a time as they shall agree upon: But it comprehends likewise <hi>Mancipia, Slaves,</hi> such as are bought and sold in the market, and reckoned amongst mens goods and chattels. For such were many of the Servants in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55636:66"/>
times. Now because those that are in a servile condition are naturally of a more illiberal, rugged and disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous temper, the <hi>Apostle</hi> would have such Servants as are converted, to manifest a change upon themselves in this respect, becoming more mild and gentle in their carriage, whereby they should remove that prejudice and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal that was brought upon Religion by others: As if the privilege of their being made free by Christ, and having him for their Master, might authorize them to be more stubborn and insolent towards their civil relations, and not to remain any longer under the yoke of human servitude. It would bring a reputation upon the doctrine of the Gospel which they professed, when others should by experience find it so powerful upon them, as to render those who are in the hardest condition of servitude, patient and submissive under their yoke, trusty and faithful in their duties.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next <hi>term</hi> to be inquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the <hi>Act, Adorn.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it signifies to set a thing off for its best advantage of comliness, that it may appear grateful and lovely
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55636:66"/>
to the beholders. It consists in two things, removal of blemishes, and addition of ornaments: Many things that are of an excellent beauty in their own native simplicities, may yet be capable of such supperadditions, as will contribute to their further orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now men may then be said to adorn their profession, when they do studiously endeavour to avoid all such uncomely actions, as may bring a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice upon it, and to do such things as may make it appear most ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and win over others to a love of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Object matter,</hi> in that phrase <hi>The doctrine of God our Saviour</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are to understand the Gospel; which is therefore said to be the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ, because he is the chief Author and object of it. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of reconciliation by him. Now tho it be not in the power of any creature to add any thing unto the beauty of this doctrine, which is in it self <hi>the wisdom of God in a mystery,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.7. The <hi>glorious Gospel,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>And the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Iesus Christ,</hi> v. 6. <hi>The riches of the glory of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55636:67"/>
God,</hi> Colos. 1.27. Which are some of the highest expressions of beauty, that words can reach unto: And so this doctrine is not in it self capable of any real addition of beauty from us, no more than we can add light to the Sun; yet God is pleased to esteem and to accept of that as an ornament to it, when our <hi>conversation is as becometh the Gospel of Christ,</hi> as the phrase is <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.27. When men walk sutably to those rules of goodness, and purity, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which are therein so often insisted upon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As for that phrase, <hi>All things,</hi> it do's refer not only to those duties of Religion and Worship, which do more immediately concern our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with himself; but likewise to the businesses of our conversing with others, to our managing of secular and worldly business; our very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations and diversions should not be without a savour of Christianity. And we should, even in these things, give evidence of our faith, sobriety and patience, and humility and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And so likewise for the duties of our relations, even the meanest of them: That of Servants, who tho they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55636:67"/>
be themselves of the basest and most contemptible condition, yet are in a capacity according to their sphere, of bringing honour to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession as well as those that are most noble.</p>
            <p>So much I conceive sufficient for the explication of the words in the Text. Tho the duty here mentioned do by its particular connexion in this place more immediately refer to those that are in the relation of Servants, yet it is supposed to be of a more general extent, and to reach unto all other degrees and professions, for whom the reasons of it will hold <hi>à fortiori.</hi> For if those of the meanest condition are not exempted from this endeavour, much more then should others make it their care and business, who have greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for it, and consequently greater engagements to it. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this more general extent of this duty, I intend the prosecution of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> I would insist upon, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the duty of every Christian so to demean himself in every business, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55636:68"/>
relation, as may adorn the Gospel, and win over others to a love of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a special care to be had to the comeliness of our actions, that they be such and so managed, as to bring a reputation to the doctrine we profess, and make it seem lovely in the eyes of others.</p>
            <p>I might cite abundance of proofs to this purpose. All those admonitions in Scripture. 1. Of not giving offence to others. But 2. Rather winning them over by our good examples, are but other kind of expressions sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfing the same thing with this in the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such are those places which do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the giving an occasion for <hi>the name of God and his doctrine to be blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed,</hi> Rom. 2.24. 1 Tim. 6.1. Or <hi>causing the way of truth to be evil spoken of,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.2. Or <hi>giving occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.14. Signifying that special care and caution which we ought to use in vindicating the reputation of Religion. Men are full of prejudice against the ways of God, apt to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hard thoughts against them, as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55636:68"/>
if they were rough, deformed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even, ready to catch at all occasions of confirming themselves in these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, from the haltings and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of those that profess Religion: And therefore it should be their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be very wary of giving any advantages of this kind. This was <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> argument, <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Ought ye not to walk in the fear of God, because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?</hi> And in this very <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> exhorteth that their <hi>behaviour be as becometh holiness,</hi> v. 3. <hi>that the word of God be not blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> v. 5. <hi>that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you,</hi> v. 8. So again, 1 Pet. 2.12. For this reason ought <hi>your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation to be honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they are apt to speak against you as evil doers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>they may by your good works which they shall behold, be brought to glorify God in the day of visitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpose likewise are all those other Scriptures, which do mention it as a duty to win over others by our good examples. To let <hi>our light so shine before men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16.</note> 
               <hi>that others seeing our good works may glorify our Father which is in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55636:69"/>
heaven;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24.</note> 
               <hi>To consider one another, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke unto love and good works,</hi> that is, so far to study the tempers, inclinations, interests, of those we converse with, that thereby we may be able to take the right advantage of doing good upon them.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.14.</note> 
               <hi>If by any means we may provoke them to an honest emulation.</hi> So <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.15. <hi>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the Sons of God, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, amongst whom</hi> ye may <hi>shine as lights in the world</hi>: That you may be of as great usefulness and ornament in your several Spheres as the lights in the firmament.</p>
            <p>So Womens conversations ought to be such, as <hi>to win their Husbands,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1, 2.</p>
            <p>I shall cite but one Text more for the <hi>proof</hi> of this, and then proceed to the <hi>Reasons</hi> of it. 'Tis that known place, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think of these things.</hi> Wherein the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55636:69"/>
a peculiar strain of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> inculcate upon the <hi>Philippians,</hi> in the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive words, and the most serious vehement manner, all such lovely and desireable qualifications, as might serve to adorn their professions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatsoever things are true:</hi> That is, sincere and real, free from all false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and appearances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatsoever things are honest:</hi> The original word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifies properly <hi>venerable.</hi> That is such things as may occasion in others a reverend esteem of you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatsoever things are just:</hi> That is, free from the suspicion of unworthy partiality or base ends, not so much aiming at serving the interest of a Party, as doing that which is in it self right and just.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatsoever things are pure:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, That is, things that are free from all immodest uncomliness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatsoever things are lovely:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, That is, grateful and benign, such as will render a man most accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to those with whom he converses; free from that asperity and ruggedness, which do's so deform some mens car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:55636:70"/>
               <hi>Whatsoever things are of good report:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. There are some things that by the consent of Nations are of a good fame and well reputed of; the Apostle would have a special care taken of such matters, there being nothing of greater consequence to the interest of a Profession, than the good name of those that profess it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If there be any virtue,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Which Word tho it be most frequent amongst the Philosophers, yet 'tis very seldom used in Scripture and not any where by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> excepting this place, as being perhaps too low an expression for those spiritual Graces, which Christians ought chiefly to labour after. But yet as for all those things that are commendable amongst the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, which they style by the name of <hi>Virtue,</hi> Christians ought not to be defective in such things, or think it below them to imitate such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If there be any praise,</hi> whatsoever is counted laudable and comely by the very light of nature, ought not to be neglected by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:55636:70"/>For the further confirmation of this Truth, I shall suggest three <hi>Reasons</hi> to convince the equity of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This doctrine doth adorn us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note> and therefore 'tis but reason that we should adorn it. We are all of us naturally in a deformed forlorn condition, being <hi>wretched and miserable, and poor and blind and naked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.</note> and 'tis alone this Doctrine of the Gospel that doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish us with <hi>gold, and eye-salve, and white rayment</hi> to enrich and beautfy us. We are of our selves <hi>children of darkness,</hi> 'tis the Gospel that doth <hi>beget us again to a lively hope,</hi> and make us <hi>children of the light</hi>; and therefore 'tis but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that we should <hi>walk worthy of our vocation, and as becomes children of the light,</hi> Ephes. 5.8. <hi>Setting forth the virtues of him that called us into his marvailous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. Light is one of the most glorious and beautiful creatures in the world, and therefore an earthly and sordid carriage will not become that title. Those that are raised to this privilege should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after such virtues as will be sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to it. Men are content in the night time to be homely and plain, but in the day they will endeavour to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55636:71"/>
have their garments decent and comely about them. So should Christians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themselves; remembring the obligation that lies upon them from their calling, counting it a greater shame to them to do any unworthy act, under the glorious light of the Gospel about them, and the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the spirit within them, than other men do to commit any filthiness in the face of the Sun. Men usually are very careful to advance the honour and reputation of that from which they receive their own. So that the Law of gratitude doth ingage us to this duty, which is the first reason.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the adorning of our professions, we do really promote our own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2.</note> and adorn our selves, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of that redounding to our benefit, and the blemishes of it to our disparagement. The honor and esteem that is given to any Profession do's reflect upon the Professors; men are usually very sensible in things of their own interest, how careful will they be in adorning their Habitations, not grudging to bestow much labor and cost to this purpose, and for their Bodies nothing more common than
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55636:71"/>
vanities and excess in the adorning of these; and yet after all their care and delicacy in this kind, these bodies of theirs are but frail earthly Tabernacles and must shortly prove worms-meat, and molder away into their original dust: And so likewise for their Names; all those difficulties that men undergo in the pursuit of fame and glory, which is the business of men of more large and generous spirits, is but for the adorning of their names and perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to posterity, which tho it have its proper use and bounds, yet is it but vanity as <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>seeing that which now is, in the days to come shall be forgotten, Eccles.</hi> 2.16. Every generation producing something which seems new and strange to take up mens talk and wonder, and to drown the memory of former persons and actions.</p>
            <p>Now if we would do any thing of this kind which may be for our real advantage, it must be by the adorning of this Doctrine, which abideth for ever. The sweet ornament of a good name, which we endeavour to pour upon the head of that, will run down and be communicated to the skirts
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55636:72"/>
about it, all that belong unto it. There are but two kind of things that may justly challenge any care from us of this nature; some things ought to be adorned for their own worth and dignity, other things for that special affection we bear to them, and the desire of having them loved and esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others; in both which respects, this doctrine of the Gospel ought to be preferred before any thing else, especially since our own advantage is so much concerned in it. That is a second Reason, the Law of self-love doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage it.</p>

                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3.</note>3. And <hi>lastly,</hi> which may serve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of all other Reasons, this is the great end of our Creation and Being, the chief business upon which we were sent into the world, to glorify God, and bring honor to his name: Which we then do in reference to others, when we demean our selves so as to cause them to acknowledge and speak well of him. This is <hi>to walk worthy of the Lord,</hi> 1 Thes. 2.12. and <hi>as becometh the Gospel of Christ, Philip.</hi> 1.27. When those that of themselves are apt <hi>to speak evil</hi> of our Profession, <hi>shall by our good conversation</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:55636:72"/>
be convinced and won over to a love of it. This is the greatest and most noble work, that any man is capable of contributing unto; And therefore that may be another Reason to enforce the necessity of it, 'tis the chief end of our Creation.</p>
            <p>I shall need to say no more by way of <hi>Explication</hi> or Proof: I come now to the <hi>Application</hi> of this Point, wherein it may be improved to these <hi>Uses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. For <hi>Information,</hi> If it be every ones duty to take special care of adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his profession, then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That men are not only to regard the lawfulness of their actions as to the matter, but the comeliness of them too as to the manner and degree. As there is difference betwixt clothing and ornaments, so is there betwixt the mere lawfulness of actions and the comeliness of them. A Christian should even in moral duties do something beyond the common level of men, aiming at things that are more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and heroical, and may give a lustre to his profession; especially in such matters, as border nearest to the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55636:73"/>
proper Graces of Christianity, as <hi>gratitude, patience, meekness, self-denial.</hi> And in such cases where other ordinary men may be supposed to yield unto common infirmity and temptation, the usual excuse of their failings; he should press on with greater vigor as considering the cause that depends upon him, the reputation of his holy Profession. Some things, that for the substance of them may be just, yet being performed without respect to this end, may prove blame worthy. <hi>Bonum</hi> must be <hi>ex causa integra:</hi> The defect of any such circumstance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an action might be better perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth lay a blemish upon it. Now we are <hi>to provide things honest in the sight of all men</hi>; to acquit and <hi>commend our selves not only to our own consciences,</hi> but to <hi>other mens</hi> consciences too, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. This doth principally consist in the right circumstantiating of actions, and will require much prudence to judge what is seasonable and fit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it will follow, that amongst that great variety of duties, which are incumbent upon a Christian, there ought to be a special regard unto such, as are of general approbation, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55636:73"/>
most sutable to the reason of mankind: that is, to those moral duties which the light of Nature doth oblige unto, because <hi>those who are without,</hi> will be apt to take an estimate of us, by our conformity to these. And that man will never arrive to the esteem of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religious who should be found negligent and defective in this kind, either in respect of an holy awe and fear towards the divine Majesty which he doth profess to adore, justice, equity, charity, gentleness in his dealing and conversing with others; these things being of an universal approbation, amongst men that pretend to any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For tho natural men are apt to entertain prejudices and hard thoughts against many religious duties, yet there are some things that are both <hi>acceptable of God,</hi> and <hi>approved of men, Rom.</hi> 14.18. And that is, when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not so much put in <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>drinks</hi> and external forms, as in <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and peace,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis true indeed, a man must take heed of resting in these moral attainments; but on the other side he must take heed of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing short of them too. He that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to grace and doth not come
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55636:74"/>
up to these, is in as bad, and (in many respects) a much worse condition, than he that rests in them. 'Tis true likewise, that there may be much danger in seeking to please men, but yet this is an end, which we may and should propose to our selves even in our religious conversation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Let every one please his neighbour:</hi> 'tis the <hi>Apostles</hi> advice there; and he owns it for his practice, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.33. <hi>Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many that they may be saved.</hi> There must and will always be an enmity betwixt <hi>the seed of the Woman</hi> and <hi>the seed of the Serpent</hi>; but yet this doth not hinder but that we may labour for so much favour in their eyes as may give us advantage of doing good upon them. 'Tis said of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that they <hi>had favour with all the people,</hi> Act. 2.47. And upon that account were they so powerful amongst them. Some of these things would not perhaps be so proper to be insisted on, did not the condition of the times make them seasonable; when so many men under the profession of Religion (which is now in fashion, and therefore easy)
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55636:74"/>
do indulge themselves in the neglect of moral duties. As if the pretences to holiness, which do really so much the more ingage to these things, might yet serve as a dispensation from them; than which nothing can be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But I hasten to a second <hi>Use,</hi> for <hi>Reproof</hi> of such persons who are so far from being Ornaments, that they are rather spots and blemishes to the Doctrine of the Gospel. Such are of two kinds, <hi>Careless</hi> and <hi>Scandalous</hi> Professors.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For those that are <hi>Careless</hi> and Barren, who are wholly immersed in themselves, and the observance of their own humours, without any regard to the profiting or pleasing of others. There is something in mens religious conversation, answerable to the slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venliness of their outward carriage, whereby others are made averse, and as it were nauseated from conversing with them. Such are all selfish, morose, churlish, contentious men, who instead of inviting others, do rather discourage them from the ways of Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:55636:75"/>II. For such as are <hi>scandalous,</hi> who whilst they profess religion, do allow themselves in some notorious sins: And sometimes commit them under the very pretence of Religion; as the Pharisees are accused to <hi>devour widows houses,</hi> that is to do acts of injustice and cruelty, under the pretence of devotion and zeal: Both these are an abomination, but especially the latter, which doth involve in it the highest affront and indignity against religion, that can be. It is really to scoff and despise that, to which in appearance we pretend the highest reverence. It is to carry Christ about in scorn to be derided by others, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>hail King of the Iews,</hi> and yet <hi>spitting upon him and buffeting him.</hi> Such persons are so far from adorning their profession, that they do their utmost to disparage it, and make it appear odious. What serious man would be invited to own that for a Religion, which is professed by men of such false and hateful conversations. There are <hi>two</hi> things I would briefly suggest by way of motive to dissuade men from offending in either of these kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Unworthiness,</hi> and the <hi>Danger</hi> of such carriage.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:55636:75"/>1. 'Tis <hi>Unworthy</hi> and odious to cast a blemish and reproach upon that to which we owe our own honour; to destroy those whom we are bound to love and help. The Scripture puts it as a brand upon the loose Sons of <hi>Eli, Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.17. That <hi>they caused men to abhor the offerings of the Lord.</hi> And nothing can be more hateful than to bring sacred things into contempt: It was <hi>Iacob</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint against his Sons, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> Gen. 34.30. That <hi>they had made him to stink amongst the inhabitants of the Lord.</hi> So doth the unworthy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Professors, cause the hearts of others to rise up against them with much scorn and detestation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as it is unworthy, so likewise is it <hi>dangerous</hi>; you know the several <hi>Woes</hi> in Scripture denounced and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted against those that give offence. <hi>Temporal</hi> judgements upon their names, <hi>Malach.</hi> 2.9. The Priests that caused others to stumble at the Law, are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dned to be made contemptible and base before all the people. And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more equal, than that those who expose religion to contempt should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer under it themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:55636:76"/>Judgments in respect of life: <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> was for this reason slain with the sword, <hi>because he taught</hi> Balak <hi>to lay a stumbling block before the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> Numb. 31.8. The Sons of <hi>Eli</hi> were upon the like account slain by the <hi>Philistines,</hi> 1 Sam. 4.11.</p>
            <p>But that's not all: For besides this temporal death, it doth expose a man likewise to <hi>Eternal</hi> death. And 'tis but reason that it should be so, because the sins of such offenders do extend to the ruine of the souls of others; they doing what in them lies <hi>to destroy those for whom Christ dyed,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.11. 'Tis spoken concerning the abuse of our liberty in things indifferent, 'tis much more concerning actions in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sinful.</p>
            <p>That's a known <hi>Text, Matth.</hi> 18.6. <hi>It were better for a man to have a milstone hung about his neck, and to be cast into the Sea, than to offend one of these little ones.</hi> Now if to offend but one, and that a little one, that is one that is weak in knowledge and faith, will expose a man to a certain and dreadful vengeance, what then may they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, who in regard of the eminency of their place, reputation, profession,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55636:76"/>
do occasion a more general and sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding scandal, both in respect of the number and quality of the persons offended, and cause the ways of God to be commonly evil spoken of? As if the profession of religion, were but a design to bring about some poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ends, and as if all men who did pretend to holiness were to be suspected as deceivers; if those that brought up an evil report upon the Land of promise, were so severely punished,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.37.</note> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by a plague from heaven. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then, the offence and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be estimated to be as much greater here, as this heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> is better than that earthly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have but one <hi>Use</hi> more, and that shall be for <hi>Exhortation,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade us unto the study of this duty in the <hi>Text.</hi> That we would every one in our several places, endeavour to bring honour to our profession, and to vindicate it from those reproaches, to which the unworthy conversation of some professors hath exposed it. I know not any duty more seasonable to be pressed than this, because of those so great and common scandals that have been given in our Times.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55636:77"/>
Wherein too many have justifyed all those old Calumnies and reproaches, which the malice of the ancient <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> was wont to charge upon the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians.</p>
            <p>For our better direction in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty, you may please to remember what was suggested be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. That the nature of <hi>adorning</hi> doth consist in these two things: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of <hi>Blemishes</hi> and the addition of <hi>Ornaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Removal of <hi>Blemishes:</hi> There are several things which are after a more especial manner blemishes to the conversation of a Christian. Besides those grosser vices, which are most opposite to the purity of evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical doctrine, by which this profession should be distinguished from all others: I say besides these, there are some actions likewise, which seeming not to contain in them any gross iniquity or injustice, are thereupon more easily fallen into. And yet being destructive to peace and friendship amongst men, and against the good of humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and consequently hateful to the generality of man-kind, are therefore very great blemishes to the profession
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55636:77"/>
of Religion. Such are <hi>suspitiousness, evil-surmisings, tale-bearers,</hi> which are the <hi>fewel to contention,</hi> as the <hi>Wiseman</hi> speaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Malignity,</hi> that is an aptness to put the worst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction upon things, <hi>whispering, backbiting, rash censuring</hi> of others; which things in the opinion of St. <hi>Iames</hi> are not consistent with the very shew or profession of Religion. <hi>If any man amongst you seemeth to be religious and bridleth not his tongue, that mans religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is vain,</hi> Jam. 1.26. Being <hi>busy-bodies,</hi> under the pretence of zeal and religion, in the affairs of others, wherein we are not concerned, which is very apt to provoke men unto much indignation and prejudice.</p>
            <p>And then besides these blemishes, which concern our civil conversation with others, there are some likewise which men are subject unto in the performance of their religious duties. An imprudent openness, and too much affecttation in them, as if we did them to be seen of men. A being strict in lesser things and loose in greater, which is <hi>to walk circumspectly, as fools not as wise,</hi> and hath usually much provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in it. There are several other
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55636:78"/>
things of this nature, which I cannot stand to enumerate; but these are some of those particular failings, to which those who would be thought the more strict Professors are subject, which ought to be avoided, as being after a more especial manner blemishes to our Profession.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are some peculiar Virtues and Graces, which are commended to us, as being more especial ornaments to our Profession.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15</note>1. Nothing doth become men more than a holy reverence and fear in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the things of God. There is an uncomeliness, and there may be a superstition too, in the unseasonable mixing of sacred things with mirth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reference to <hi>others</hi> nothing is of a more universal approbation, than <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Iustice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>Love,</hi> there must be a <hi>phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropia,</hi> extending to the good of mankind and publick benefit; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining our designs within the narrow compass of our own private advantage and the observance of our selves: And there must be a <hi>philadelphia</hi> too, a more especial love to the brethren, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness to serve and help them, especially
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55636:78"/>
for such as are in distress, and in a state of affliction. The works of mercy to such are not only sweet odors in the sight of God, but before men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And so for <hi>Iustice</hi> likewise: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness and single heartedness, a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from guile and designs, being commendable amongst all professions of men. And therefore the neglect or want of these must needs be a great ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish amongst Christians. When those that are professors shall be more ready to serve the interest of a Party, than to observe the rules of justice and equity, this must needs occasion hard thoughts and speeches against them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In regard of <hi>our selves</hi>; the holy Ghost doth frequently commend to us, <hi>humility, meekness, modesty,</hi> as being the most comely ornaments, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very badge and livery of our Profession. We are exhorted to be <hi>clothed with humility,</hi> resembling it to a garment, with which we are to deck our selves; and <hi>a meek and quiet spirit</hi> is expresly compared unto, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the <hi>adorning with gold and apparel</hi>; and as those are usually valued by men, so this is said to be <hi>in the sight of God of great price,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4. And
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55636:79"/>
the Scripture styles modest behaviour, <hi>neat,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That's the Word, we translate it, <hi>of good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,</hi> but 'tis the same with this in the Text, and signifies properly <hi>neat</hi> or <hi>comely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing is more frequently incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the Gospel, than these kind of graces, that we should be <hi>gentle, easie to be intreated,</hi> favourable towards the infirmities of others, putting the best construction upon things; Being <hi>soft</hi> in our answers, <hi>slow to anger, ready to forgive, overcoming evil with good, speaking evil of no man, being no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness to all men,</hi> Titus 3.2.</p>
            <p>These graces are all of them of such a lovely and winning nature, that it would exceedingly promote the interest of Religion if they did more shine forth in the lives of those who call themselves Professors in these times.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, these Graces do more naturally arise from a condition of trouble and suffering, as the primitive times were. And in such days as these, when the profession of Religion is in fashion, and advantageous to a mans secular ends, and the Church in a kind
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55636:79"/>
of triumphant condition, many of those who profess Religion (if they are not otherwise persons of judgment and solid worth) are more apt to grow insolent, and rugged towards others. But yet these Graces would be no less comely now, than they were then. Nay the greater the difficulty of them is, the greater would their ornament be. And therefore the more watchful ought we to be, in respect of the temptations against them.</p>
            <p>I know there are several other things which some men make choice of for the ornaments of Religion, as skill in some affected insignificant phrases, or some high airy notions, zeal for some particular forms, or in serving the interest of a Party. Nothing is more obvious to any ones observation, than that many men do principally insist upon some such things as these, for the great ornaments of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, by which they measure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others.</p>
            <p>Whereas some of these things are so far from being <hi>ornaments</hi> that they are at the best but <hi>spots</hi> and <hi>ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes,</hi> and the best of them are but <hi>fashions,</hi> which though they may seem
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55636:80"/>
comely in some particular place and seasons, yet they have not any absolute beauty in them, and at another time will appear deformed. Whereas these other things I have mentioned, will never be out of fashion, as having in them an absolute beauty of their own, not depending upon places, times, or opinion.</p>

            <p>THese words do contain one of the Apostolical Rules or Canons, whereby Church officers are directed, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the dignity of their places, and the authority of their ministry, and therefore cannot be unseasonable for for the present occasion and solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of this <hi>Chapter</hi> the Apostle had mentioned that <hi>sound Doctrine,</hi> which he would have <hi>Titus</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:55636:81"/>
in his preaching to insist upon, with reference to several ages, sexes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of persons, to <hi>verse</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>After which he proceeds to a brief recapitulation of those more <hi>general</hi> duties, wherein all men are concerned, of <hi>Sobriety, Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Godliness:</hi> And takes notice of those new peculiar reasons, whereby the Gospel doth oblige men to a strict observance of these moral duties, <hi>namely:</hi> 1. From that great reward, which it doth more clearly propose, <hi>The blessed hope and that glorious appearing of the great God,</hi> v. 13. 2. From the assistance which it gives to us, by <hi>redeeming us from our Iniquities,</hi> v. 14. Abolishing the <hi>guilt,</hi> and subduing the <hi>power</hi> of sin; which ought to be very powerful motives, whereby Christians should be excited, to become <hi>a peculiar people,</hi> separate from the rest of the world, <hi>zealous of good works</hi>; striving by their fervency, and diligence, and chearfulness, as much to excell others in their <hi>obedience,</hi> as they do in the <hi>privileges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having mentioned these great fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental duties, he thereupon sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns this exhortation, <hi>these things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:55636:81"/>
               <hi>These things,</hi> i. e. especially these more substantial and weighty matters, wherein the essence of Religion doth consist, in opposition to other smaller points of less evidence or consequence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These things speak:</hi> Be ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct such as are ignorant, in these duties; <hi>and exhort</hi> them to a careful observance of them. And if any man be so contumacious, notwithstanding this instruction and exhortation, as to violate these known duties, let him be <hi>rebuked with all authority.</hi> Do not deal with such an one in a precarious way, but with such a courage and majesty, as may become him who hath power in the name of God to command others to observe their duties. The messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God should not fear the faces of men; such kind of matters, as <hi>these,</hi> are of that evidence and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as may well bear a man out, to speak with authority, and to strike an awe upon the hearts of such as shall gainsay and oppose them.</p>
            <p>And in order to this, that such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes may be of authority, and the more effectual; the Apostle adviseth to take special care, that <hi>no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:55636:82"/>Not as if it were in our power what others shall think of us. For as <hi>honor est in honorante,</hi> so is contempt likewise: Men will take the liberty of judging as they please; they may through ignorance, or malice, or envy, have mean thoughts of those that are most worthy; but tho the <hi>form</hi> of honour be not in our power, yet the <hi>matter</hi> of it is, namely virtuous and worthy actions. And we may <hi>deserve</hi> the esteem of others, tho they should be so unjust as deny it to us.</p>
            <p>So that the meaning of this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>not letting others despise us,</hi> must be, so far as in us lies, we must be careful not to do any thing, which may give occasion to others to have mean and despicable thoughts of us. That man's exhortations and rebukes must needs be altogether vain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant, who by any unworthy actions hath rendered himself contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: Whereas, if by well-doing we approve our selves to the consciences of others, it cannot be but that we shall have authority with them. Men must and will stand in awe of us, when we demean our selves so as they may have reason to believe that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55636:82"/>
when we are angry, God is displeased with them.</p>

            <p n="1">I. Concerning the nature of <hi>despising,</hi> what it is, and wherein it consists: It signifies briefly, cheap and low thoughts of a person, together with a suitable demeanour towards him.</p>
            <p>The most proper object of it, is <hi>littleness</hi> and impotence. Whatever we apprehend to be of any kind of power, we have a suitable regard to it. If it be of a hurtful nature, we hate and fear and take care to avoid it: But as for such things as are little and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, not able to do either good or hurt, we are not any further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for them, but barely to despise and contemn them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:55636:83"/>'Tis properly opposed to <hi>honouring</hi>; both of them being originally acts of the understanding, in passing judgment upon the nature of things.</p>
            <p>When we do in our minds own or acknowledge the real worth or virtue of any one, this is <hi>inward honouring</hi>; when we testify this by our words or actions, this is <hi>external</hi> honouring: And so on the other side, when we do in our thoughts take notice of and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the vileness or worthlesness of things or persons, this is <hi>inward despising,</hi> which in Scripture phrase is styled,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.3 27.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.</note> 
               <hi>counting a thing vile, setting it at nought, esteeming it as dung.</hi> When we testify this by words or actions, this is <hi>external contempt,</hi> and in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phrase is expressed by <hi>kicking at a thing;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.29.</note> 
               <hi>treading it under our feet, casting it behind us, turning our back upon it, puffing at it.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Both these abstractly considered, are of an indifferent nature, neither good nor evil in themselves, but as they are circumstantiated by their manner, and measure, and objects. Every man should proportion his esteem of things, according to the real value of them, not <hi>calling good evil, or evil good.</hi> Where
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55636:83"/>
there is no real worth men may, and should despise; nor ought they towards such things to give any honour. 'Tis as much a mans duty <hi>to contemn a vile person,</hi>

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, we should abstract betwixt the <hi>calling</hi> and <hi>persons</hi> of others. There may be a reverence due to the <hi>calling,</hi> when there is none due to the <hi>person</hi> but only upon account of his calling; and 'tis a sin in men not to distinguish in such cases. But withall 'tis so easie, so common, so natural a thing, for the scandal of a <hi>person</hi> to reflect upon his <hi>profession,</hi> that it shall be put upon his account, as being part of his guilt, that he hath laid a stumbling block in the way of others, by causing them to speak evil of his profession. And as things now are in the world, nothing can be more vain, than for men to think that the <hi>dignity of their places</hi> will keep up their esteem in the hearts of others, without the foundation of <hi>real worth in their persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now amongst all other things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, there is nothing that hath in it so much provocation as <hi>contempt.</hi> 'Tis much worse than <hi>hatred; that</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55636:84"/>
a man to be considerable. The Philosophers make it to be the occasion of all <hi>anger:</hi> And experience tells us, 'tis one of the hardest things to be born, even by wise and good men.</p>
            <p>And so much shall serve to be spoken concerning the <hi>first</hi> head, the nature of <hi>despising,</hi> &amp;c. I proceed to the <hi>second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Of what great importance it is for persons in this sacred function, to preserve themselves from <hi>contempt.</hi> Which may be made evident by three kind of arguments, upon the account of 1. <hi>Fitness</hi> and <hi>Congruity:</hi> 2. <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Duty:</hi> and 3. <hi>Interest</hi> and advantage.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Upon the account of <hi>Fitness</hi> and <hi>Congruity:</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> had declared it as a rule a little before the <hi>Text,</hi> v. 10. That <hi>Servants should adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</hi> By Servants in those times are meant, amongst others, such as were <hi>slaves,</hi> bought and sold in the Market, the lowest and basest condition of men; and yet these are obliged by the rules of Christianity, so to demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as to <hi>adorn their profession,</hi> and win over others to a love of it; and therefore those of a higher calling and station, must needs be so much
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55636:84"/>
the more obliged to this, as they have greater abilities and opportunities for it.</p>
            <p>The men of our <hi>Calling</hi> ought to be of such eminence, that others in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison to them, may be called <hi>Grex,</hi> the <hi>Flock,</hi> of which we are the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> and <hi>Pastors.</hi> 'Tis required as a previous condition to capacitate a man for this <hi>Calling,</hi> that he must have <hi>a good report of those that are without,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. i. e. of the Heathens and Unbelievers; who, tho they are not competent judges of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>opinions,</hi> yet they may be of <hi>manners</hi> and <hi>honesty</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if this be required to admission into that Calling, 'tis most reasonable that men should not lose it afterwards. We are the <hi>lights of the world,</hi> and therefore ought to contribute to the beauty of it: The <hi>salt of the Earth,</hi> and therefore ought to be of grateful and savoury conversation.</p>
            <p>There lies a more peculiar obligation upon persons in publick places, to preserve their reputations clear and without blemish. The higher any thing is situated in the universe, the more lustre hath it, as the Stars: And so likewise is it in the body, the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55636:85"/>
superior parts, the face and eyes, are the proper seat for beauty and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>A <hi>private</hi> person is not so much concerned to look after <hi>publick</hi> fame, as he who is engaged in publick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. That kind of generous virtue which can abundantly satisfie it self with the conscience of well-doing, while in a private station, if once called to any such employment, where it must be useful to others by its Authority, 'tis most fitting then, that it should seek the aid of opinion and publick esteem. Because 'tis this which rules the world, and stamps upon things the rates at which they are to pass. Not that this can add any thing to a mans virtue, more than the light of the Sun doth to the beauty of the other creatures in the universe, but only render it more conspicuous and visible to others, who are to be influenced by it. That's the first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: There is a <hi>Congruity</hi> that such persons, as are of <hi>publick employment,</hi> should be of <hi>publick esteem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis necessary also, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Duty,</hi> both towards <hi>others</hi> and <hi>our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:55636:85"/>1. With respect to those with whom we converse, who are committed to our charge; towards whom we must needs be alltogether insignificant and as mere cyphers, unless we demean our selves so as to be reverenced by them.</p>
            <p>There are two things which every man ought with his utmost care to attend unto, <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Credit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> chiefly for our selves, the <hi>other</hi> both for our selves and others: <hi>Nobis est necessaria vita nostra, aliis fama nostra:</hi> As St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks. He is cruel to himself who neglects the <hi>first,</hi> and he is both imprudent to himself, and useless to others, who neglects the <hi>second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God gives men favour and respect in the eyes of others, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per improvement of it is, to make use of it as an advantage for prevailing with them, and doing good upon them. Whereas without this, all that a man can do or say must be ineffectual. If he himself be once looked upon as contemptible, 'tis not to be expected that others should have any regard to his exhortations or counsels. You know the story of that people, who refused
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55636:86"/>
their consent to a good Law, because it was proposed by a vile person.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authority</hi> in the first notion of it is a relative term, and doth import that reverend opinion which men have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the persons of others: It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Fear.</hi> It supposes as its correlate, <hi>Venerableness,</hi> that is goodness and power, in the persons whom it refers to. And these two, according to the rule of Relations, <hi>mutuò se ponunt &amp; tollunt.</hi> Where there is no <hi>venerableness,</hi> there can be no <hi>authority,</hi> in this sense.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Upon account of <hi>duty</hi> towards <hi>our selves,</hi> who by being despised may be rendred desperate; there being no such way to make a man loose and profligate as to have a blasted name. Shame is one of the most powerful curbs to restrain men from unworthy courses, and where this doth not, there is little hope that any thing else should prevail. Reproach is styled <hi>the snare of the Devil,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.7. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they who are deservedly fallen under this, are as much in his power, and at his disposal, as if he had taken them in a snare</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:55636:86"/>The appetite of glory is that natural principle, whereby we are to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto virtuous actions. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a sense of honour, no man is like ever to attempt any thing that is great and noble. <hi>Negligere quid de se quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que sentiat, non solum arrogantis est, sed etiam dissoluti,</hi> saith <hi>Tully.</hi> No man doth neglect or despise a good name, but such a one, as doth either <hi>despair of,</hi> or <hi>resolve against,</hi> doing any thing that may deserve it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis highly advantageous upon the account of <hi>Interest.</hi> And that both in regard to the <hi>benefit</hi> to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>obtained,</hi> and the <hi>mischief</hi> to be <hi>avoided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>advantage</hi> accruing to us, by preserving our selves from being despised: Honour is the greatest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing among all humane things which this world can afford us; infinitely to be preferred before riches or pleasures, and in some cases before life it self. <hi>A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.1 <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.1 <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 41.12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>and loving favour rather than silver or gold.</hi> One that is a generous virtuous man, will chuse to die rather than to do any thing that may justly expose him to infamy. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55636:87"/>
of this mind, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.15. <hi>It were better for me to die, than that any should make my glorying void.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because 'tis a thing of so great excellency, therefore do we pay it, as the best service we can do, to God, and to his Deputies, <hi>magistrates</hi> and <hi>parents.</hi> 'Tis the reward of virtue, and therefore doth highly deserve our esteem.</p>
            <p>Besides the advantage we have by this while we live, 'tis one of those things, that will abide after us, when we are gone out of the world, and for that reason a special regard is to be had to it; and the more wise and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous any man is, the more care will he take to transmit a grateful memory of himself to future times: And if he must be spoken of after his departure, that he be well spoken of, that his name may be as a <hi>pretious ointment,</hi> leaving a perfume behind it, that men may <hi>rise up</hi> at the mention of him and <hi>call him blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis our <hi>interest,</hi> in reference to the avoiding of that mischief which we may otherwise be exposed unto by doing things that will render us despicable. I shall mention only two
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55636:87"/>
places of Scripture which will afford abundant proof to this purpose. One is, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17. Where 'tis said of the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> that they did by their scandalous carriage <hi>render themselves vile before all the assembly, and caused them to abhor the offerings of the Lord.</hi> And 'tis worth your special notice, that which follows upon this. I do not know any more dreadful threats in the whole Bible. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.11, God tells them, that he will execute his vengeance upon them in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as shall strike a dread and horror by the very relation of it, and <hi>cause both the ears of them that hear it to tingle.</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>I have sworn to the house of Eli, that their iniquity shall not be purged with sacrifices nor with offerings for ever:</hi> i. e. Those very means which were appointed as the remedy and expiation for other mens sins shall be no benefit to <hi>them. Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> were the things about which they had offended, by rendering them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, causing others to abhor them: And therefore no reason for such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to expect any remedy from them, whatsoever their particular repentance might do, as to the saving of their souls.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55636:88"/>
The offences they had committed were so highly scandalous, that God was immutably resolved, <hi>(he had sworn it)</hi> to execute upon them some signal ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance in this life that should mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to the world how much he was concerned, for that dishonour which these men had cast upon his Worship. Which judgments did afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly come to pass in the suddain death of <hi>Eli</hi> and his <hi>two Sons,</hi> and his <hi>Daughter in Law,</hi> in the rejection of <hi>Abiathar</hi> from the Priests office,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.27.</note> and in that Massacre committed by <hi>Saul</hi> at <hi>Nob,</hi> upon <hi>fourscore and five Priests of this family,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.19.</note> 
               <hi>together with their wives and children and servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Scripture is <hi>that, Malach</hi> 2. towards the beginning, where speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such Priests, as by their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy carriage, did render the publick worship contemptible,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note> and <hi>cause others to stumble at the Law,</hi> God threatens that <hi>he will send a curse upon them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>and will curse their blessings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 3.</note> and <hi>spread dung upon their faces,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 9.</note> and make them <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and base before all the people.</hi>
               <note place="margin">See <hi>Ierem</hi> 23.40.</note> And there is nothing more equal, than that those who expose religion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, should suffer under it themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:55636:88"/>Now to put all this together, if we have any ingenuity, and desire to do things decent and congruous to our Profession; any sense of the duty which we owe to others, whom it is our business to persuade; or which we owe to our selves, in the preservation of that whereby we are to be excited unto virtuous and worthy actions: If we have any sense of our own interest, in securing to our selves the greatest blessing, and avoiding the greatest mischief that this world can afford, it will upon all accounts highly concern us, that we do not so demean our selves as to deserve to be despised.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I proceed to the third general <hi>head</hi> proposed, namely the <hi>means</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are to preserve our selves from contempt; which are of two kinds: <hi>Negative</hi> and <hi>Positive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negative,</hi> or such things as in order to this we are carefully to avoid. All kind of vices whatsoever, especially such as have in them a more peculiar deformity and turpitude, which are most likely to alienate the minds of others from us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:55636:89"/>I observed before that <hi>littleness</hi> and impotence is the most proper object of <hi>contempt. I am small and despised,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 119.141.</p>
            <p>So that all such qualities and actions, as will make us appear unto others to be but minute and little things, must needs render us despicable.</p>
            <p>Such are <hi>Narrowness</hi> of mind, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things and persons by little mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; setting up for reputation by zeal in the smallest matters, with neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the greater: Putting the highest value upon those little things of gain and promotion and the favour of men; which therefore ought to be esteemed but little, because they cannot make us better, and we can enjoy them but a little while. We must shortly go out of this world, when all such things shall be useless to us, and therefore ought not to come in competition with those other matters, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to our living with honour, and dying with comfort.</p>
            <p>Being subject to immoderate desires, fears, impatience; to be amused and transported with wonder at outward pomp and grandeur. All which doth arise from a wrong estimate of things
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55636:89"/>
occasioned by our own littleness. <hi>Magna ista, quia parvi sumus, credimus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Senec.</hi>
               </note> These things would not seem great to us, if we our selves were not little.</p>
            <p>From whence will follow a servility of spirit, a readiness to dissemble, flatter, revile, to bow down to any kind of baseness before such whom we conceive able to assist or to hinder us in our little designs of gain: And on the other side, demeaning our selves with insolence towards others from whom we can neither hope nor fear any thing in this kind.</p>
            <p>These are blemishes, which in all ages the men of our Calling have been accused of. And the truth is, they are liable to some peculiar temptations in this kind, more than others: And therefore ought to be more especially careful for the avoiding of them.</p>
            <p>To which I shall only add this one consideration: If we of the <hi>Clergy</hi> would not have others to despise us, we must be careful not to despise one another. Those in places of dignity and power should not carry it with too great a distance from their brethren. The proper notation of the word <hi>despise,</hi> is to look down upon a thing, as being much below us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:55636:90"/>And much less should they permit any of their <hi>Officers,</hi> to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with insolence towards such as are of this sacred Functoin. It cannot be but that others will despise us, when they see that we despise one another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Positive</hi> means to this end, are, in general, all kind of virtue and goodness. But there are some things which the <hi>Apostle</hi> adviseth to, as having a more peculiar fitness and tendency to this purpose, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Whatsoever things are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, have these things in account,</hi> Phil. 4.8.</p>
            <p>Of these I shall mention only <hi>three.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>

               <item>3. <hi>Holiness of life.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Wisdom, this makes a mans face to shine, and the strength of it to be doubled, Eccles.</hi> 8.1. Puts a lustre upon a person, renders him venerable and amiable, conciliates an honour and an awe from those with whom he converseth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:55636:90"/>By <hi>wisdom</hi> I mean, <hi>recta ratio agibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas</hi> defines it. Not only skill in books, and things, and notions, but the art of business, directing a man to what is fit and convenient in several cases and circumstances, the knowledg of humane nature, of the various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, tempers, interests of <hi>men</hi> and <hi>times.</hi> 'Tis not sufficient for him that would be a Pilot to understand the <hi>general</hi> Theory of Navigation, without the knowledge of <hi>particular</hi> Coasts, and Shelves, and Currents, and Tydes, and Winds.</p>
            <p>'Tis by this virtue of prudence, that a man must be enabled to <hi>cut off occasion from them that would seek occasion,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.12. And, considering that great variety and inconstancy which there is in the judgments and affections of men, the clashings and intanglements of cross interests, the several changes and vicissitudes that befall humane affairs; I say all these things considered, it is not mere <hi>integrity,</hi> without great <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> that can preserve a man in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and clear reputation.</p>

this true greatness and largeness of soul must make him venerable. By this I mean an inclination of mind to things that are truly great and noble, making virtue and true honour the common measure of every thing, aiming at that which is great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in every kind of virtue; having but a small esteem for any of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal matters, because they can add nothing to our inward real worth.</p>
            <p>Every man is endowed with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principle, inclining him to a state of happiness; and hath in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure both an ability to judge <hi>of,</hi> and a freedom or liberty to apply himself <hi>unto,</hi> those moral actions or duties, which are the proper means for the promoting of this end. Nor is he upon any other account to be justly praised or blamed, but according to the right or wrong use of this natural liberty. And therefore according as such a man doth find either in himself or others a constant and firm resolution to make a right use of this, so doth he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion his esteem towards them. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring this inward greatness, this rectitude of mind, whereby a man is resolved in every condition, to do that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55636:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which shall appear to be his duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any kind of external greatness whatsoever.</p>
            <p>And if men did rightly understand their true interests, there is nothing more sutable or more advantageous to humane nature than this.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sen. Epist.</hi> 104.</note> 
               <hi>Magnanimos nos natura produxit, &amp; ut quibusdam animali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ferum dedit, quibusdam subdolum, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busdam pavidum, ita nobis gloriosum &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsum spiritum, quaerentem ubi honestissimè, non ubi tutissimè vivat.</hi> We are naturally born with greater and more generous souls than other creatures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for a man to debase himself below the Nobility of his creation may justly expose him to contempt.</p>
            <p>'Tis this that must make a man humble and gentle, set him above the common impotences of pride and passion, the false disguises of greatness. Of which kind of temper it may be truly said, <hi>non est magnitudo, tumor est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis this that must keep us from being puffed up with prosperity or dejected with adversity; free us from being envious, suspitious, fearful, being secure upon the confidence of our own innocence; not being subject to those vehement desires and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55636:92"/>
whereby others are transported. Because those things which provoke them seem but little to us, and therefore must have but little power over us.</p>
            <p>'Tis this that must make a man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an empire over himself, before power over others; and the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of being helpful to others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the advantage of gaining by them; bearing good will to all mankind, compassionate, affable, officious, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all opportunities of doing good to every one. Nor is there any other qualification whatsoever, that will make a man appear more grateful and lovely even to enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, than this generous frame of mind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> particular I mentioned to this purpose was <hi>Holiness of life.</hi> Which is frequently mentioned in Scripture as a proper means to keep our esteem in the hearts of others, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve us from being despised. They that would be <hi>blameless</hi> must be <hi>harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, carrying themselves as the Sons of God without rebuke,</hi> Philip. 2.15. And a little before the <hi>Text,</hi> v. 7. The <hi>Apostle</hi> exhorts <hi>Titus,</hi> to <hi>shew himself
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55636:92"/>
a pattern of good works, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no evil thing to say of you.</hi> So again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. 'Tis said that a <hi>good conversation will make people ashamed to speak evil of us.</hi> And it was by faith and holiness that <hi>the Elders obtained a good report,</hi> Heb. 11.2.</p>
            <p>In the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. There is the same precept with this in the <hi>Text. Let no man despise thy youth:</hi> To which 'tis immediately subjoyned as the most proper direction to this purpose, <hi>but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in purity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When a man is careful to say what is good, and to do what is honest; to speak well and to act better, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be what he would seem to be, avoiding all suspitions and appearances of evil; when he is zealous according to his capacity for the promoting of publick good, acting sincerely, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and justly; endeavouring to make the times the better for him, wherein he lives, this will be the most effectual means to make his name honourable, and his memory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:55636:93"/>More <hi>particularly:</hi> The demeaning of our selves with all due respect and lowliness to our Superiours, is one of those <hi>well-doings whereby we are to put to silence the ignorance of foolish men,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13, 15, 18.</p>
            <p>The proportioning of our zeal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the real worth and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of things, that's another <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi> direction to this purpose, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15, 16. Having said, <hi>Let not your good be evil spoken of,</hi> he presently adds: <hi>For the kingdom of God is not meats and drinks, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost; whosoever in these things serveth Christ, shall be accepted of God, and approved of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being mild and gentle, not boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and peremptory; having <hi>the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a meek and quiet spirit</hi>; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring <hi>as much as in us lies to live in peace with all men,</hi> as being that which gives opportunity to the more calm, benign, ingenuous operations of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the world.</p>
            <p>Wherever these qualifications are, they must and will contract at least a secret reverence, even from those that may outwardly pretend to hate and despise us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:55636:93"/>I have now done with the three general <hi>Heads</hi> proposed, it remains that I add something briefly by way of <hi>application,</hi> in answer to this case, What's to be done if men will despise us, though we do not deserve it from them? In order thereunto I shall sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest two things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. By way of rebuke to such despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, who if they would but consult the Scriptures, should find this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy disposition set off with such great aggravations, both as to the nature of the <hi>sin,</hi> and the <hi>punishments</hi> that shall be inflicted upon it, as were enough to fright men from offending in this kind.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Nature</hi> of the sin: The <hi>Wiseman</hi> tells us, <hi>He that despiseth his neighbour is void of wisdom,</hi> Prov. 11.12. and <hi>sinneth,</hi> chap. 14.21. 'Tis made the character of a proud <hi>Pharisee</hi> to despise others, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9. That which renders men like to dogs and swine trampling pretious things under their feet. <hi>Esau</hi> was therefore bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the note of prophaness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he despised holy things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16, 17. All which tho it be bad enough, yet that is much worse, which our
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55636:94"/>
Saviour affirms concerning it, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that despiseth you despiseth me, and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</hi> And what a horrid thing that must be for a poor mortal man to contemn the omnipotent God, I need not, I cannot say: He himself hath said, that as <hi>he will honour those that honour him, so those that despise him shall be lightly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. And he who is the King of Kings must needs be the fountain of honour to dispose of it as he pleaseth. Those men shall be sure to be put to shame whom God doth despise, <hi>Psal,</hi> 53.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for those <hi>judgments</hi> of all kinds which this sin will expose unto, I shall only refer you to some few Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>Temporal</hi> judgments: See that place, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16, 17. <hi>They mocked the messengers of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised their words, and misused the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, till the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, that there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; therefore he brought upon them the King of the</hi> Chaldees, <hi>who slew their young men with the Sword, and had no compassion upon young men and maidens, old men or him that stooped for age,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55636:94"/>
he gave them all into his hand.</hi> Where the ruine of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were deprived of all kind of priviledges, both civil and ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, is ascribed to this sin.</p>
            <p>That's a dreadful imprecation in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>Hear, O our God, for we are despised, and turn their reproach upon their own heads, and give them for a prey in the land of Captivity, and cover not their iniquity, let not their sin be blotted out from before thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And as for punishments in <hi>the other world:</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>that those who despise dominions and speak evil of dignities shall perish in their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.10. <hi>And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness,</hi> v. 12. To which St. <hi>Iude</hi> adds, that <hi>there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for them the blackness of darkness for ever,</hi> v. 8. and 13.</p>
            <p n="2">II. By way of <hi>Direction,</hi> to those who are thus unworthily despised, not to be discouraged at it, remembring what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith that <hi>with us it is but a small thing to be judged of man's judgment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.</note> but to <hi>approve our selves unto God in honour and dishonour:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering what he hath promised, that when men <hi>speak evil against us falsely,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55636:95"/>
great shall our reward be in heaven:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11.</note> 
               <hi>And we shall have praise of God.</hi> 'Tis said of our Saviour that <hi>he despised the shame</hi>:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.</note> And so should we too,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</note> contemn the contempt, of injurious scornful men. This perhaps was the meaning of that precept to the disciples of <hi>shaking the dust off their feet</hi> against those that despised them.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.51</note>
            </p>
            <p>True honour is <hi>Consentiens laus bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cicero. Tusc.</hi> 2.</note> Such only can give true praise, who are themselves praise-worthy. For a man deeply to resent his being despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by ignorant or unworthy men is over much to honour them, as if their esteem could add any thing to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
            <p>To shut up all in a word; you have heard of what great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence it is, that we should preserve our selves from being despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and by what means this is to be done. Let me beseech you to consider and apply these things. We all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be zealous for the well-fare of the Church, and very good reason we should be so: But now, if in good earnest we are desireous to promote the honour and interest of it, these
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55636:95"/>
are the ways whereby it must be done; and (whatsoever any may think) nothing else without these, can be effectual to this purpose.</p>
            <p>My brethren, 'tis not so long ago, but that we may and ought still to remember it, what flouds of contempt have been poured upon our sacred Profession, how it hath been exposed to indignities of all kinds. For which though there be abundant reason to shame and condemn those unworthy men who were the instruments of it, yet there is cause enough to believe that the holy providence of God, who thought fit thus to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and dispose of it, had just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for it, and wise ends in it. Will it not then concern us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, what those former provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations might be, whether any of those particulars I have mentioned, that we may endeavour to prevent the like judgement for the future; least if it should again befall us, it should make an utter end, and not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a second remedy.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I beseech you, as you have any tenderness for your own
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55636:96"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

reputation, for the dignity of your callings, for the peace of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the honour of Religion, that you would be very jealous of all such things, as may reflect dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement on your holy calling.</p>
            <p>'Tis not the opposition of enemies on all hands that can do us so much hurt, as the scandal and folly of pretending friends. If our enemies be more prudent and holy, more humble and useful in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations than we are, it cannot be but that they shall be reverenced when we shall be despised.</p>
            <p>What remains then, but that we make our addresses to the <hi>Father of lights,</hi> that he would continually supply his Church with faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, who may make it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to honour God, and serve their generations, and adorn their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: That he would sanctify us with his spirit, and fill all our hearts with his fear, that walking worthy of our Calling we may be honoured while we live, and happy when we dye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:55636:97"/>Now <hi>the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Iesus Christ, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, make us perfect in every good work, to do his will; working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Iesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>THere are <hi>two</hi> kind of things which every serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering man is naturally very thoughtful about and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive after, the <hi>ways</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> and the <hi>ways</hi> of <hi>Happiness.</hi> Both which in reference to the various opinions and conjectures of men, are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and largely discussed in two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Books of Scripture.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> in the book of <hi>Iob,</hi> wherein we have the most natural risings and obvious suggestions of mens hearts, concerning the reasons and designs of Providence in the dispensation of good and evil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:55636:99"/>The <hi>other</hi> in this book of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> wherein are set down the different thoughts and attempts of men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their several principles and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the pursuit after happiness.</p>
            <p>In the first verse of this chapter we have a description of the <hi>Preacher, the Son of David, King in Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second <hi>verse</hi> is his <hi>Text: Vanity of Vanities,</hi> &amp;c. This he doth largely prove by some general reasons to the twelfth <hi>verse</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> and by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of particulars, in several of the following <hi>Chapters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The general reasons are chiefly <hi>four.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The fruitlesness of all our labours,</hi> v. 3. by which we are not able to procure for our selves any substantial profit <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>any remainder,</hi> that will tarry with us afterwards; but like a sound they pass away, and leave nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The changeableness and uncertainty of our conditions</hi>; in which respect, we are much inferior to our other fellow creatures. This he illustrates by <hi>four</hi> examples or similtudes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the <hi>Earth,</hi> which though it seems to be but as the sediment and rubbish of the creation, yet is it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55636:99"/>
than man in respect of it's lasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For <hi>one generation passeth away and another cometh, but the earth abides for ever,</hi> v. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the <hi>sun,</hi> which though it do every day decline and set, yet doe's it constantly rise again and shine with the same glory, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>But man dieth and wasteth away, yea man giveth up the Ghost, and where is he? He lieth down and riseth not till the heavens be no more,</hi> Job 14.10, 12.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Soles occidere &amp; redire possunt;</l>
               <l>Nobis cùm semel occidit brevis lux</l>
               <l>Nox est perpetua una dormienda.</l>
            </q>
            <p>As 'tis elegantly expressed by a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen Poet.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the <hi>wind,</hi> the common emblem of uncertainty yet is it more constant than man. For that knoweth its circuits and whirls about continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>v.</hi> 6. Whereas <hi>our life passeth away as doth the wind, but returneth not again,</hi> Psal. 78.39.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From the <hi>sea,</hi> which though it be as uncertain as the moon by which 'tis governed, yet is it more constant than man and his happiness. For though the <hi>rivers run into it,</hi> and <hi>from</hi> it, yet that still keeps to its proper
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55636:100"/>
state and dimensions, <hi>v.</hi> 7. Whereas man is still subject to ebbs and flows, to waves and tempests, never resting in any settled condition, and at last wears out and vanisheth away. So that in these respects we are much inferiour to the very elements of which we are composed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>From that unspeakable wearisomness which is in every condition. All things are full of labour, man cannot utter it,</hi> v. 8. The <hi>eye,</hi> and the <hi>ear,</hi> are senses not easily cloyed, and yet are they sooner wearied than satisfied; there being such an intrinsical weakness in the best outward delights, that the most capacious senses are quickly glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, even to a loathing of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>From the disability of man by any new discovery to restore himself unto a better condition</hi>; since there is no hope of finding any such new way to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, which hath not been formerly tryed; from the <hi>ninth</hi> to the <hi>eleventh verse.</hi> Though these latter ages in some respects are wiser, yet all their inventions for the substance of them have already been of old time, and <hi>there is no new thing under the Sun.</hi> That fancy of <hi>Plato</hi> being in some
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55636:100"/>
sense to be allowed, <hi>that all knowledge is but remembrance,</hi> and forgetfulness the reason of novelty.</p>
            <p>These are the general reasons by which the <hi>Wise-man</hi> endeavours to prove and illustrate that common vanity which overspreads the face of all things.</p>
            <p>In the next place, he doe's further amplify and confirm this by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of those particulars in which men usually place their happiness; <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of this <hi>Chapter; Mirth</hi> and <hi>Iollity,</hi> chap. 2.1. <hi>Sensual</hi> delights, <hi>v.</hi> 3. Works of <hi>Magnificence</hi> and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> v. 4.5, 6. External <hi>Pomp</hi> and greatness, <hi>v.</hi> 7. Abundance of <hi>Riches</hi> and treasure, <hi>v.</hi> 8.9.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Text</hi> I have chosen doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Solomon</hi>'s censure and experiment concerning the <hi>first</hi> of these, which of all other things in the world doth bear in it the fairest appearance and probability of affording satisfaction to the mind: This being its proper food and suitable to its desires, and most excellent in it self. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Devil being to tempt our first parents in the state of innocence, doth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55636:101"/>
propose this to them, as the most likely temptation to prevail with such intelligent natures, that <hi>they should know good and evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now because Learning is of <hi>two</hi> kinds, either of <hi>Business</hi> or <hi>Things</hi>; therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> makes a distinct en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into each. The <hi>first</hi> he calls <hi>Wisdom,</hi> the other <hi>Knowledge</hi>: And he was himself very eminent for his great ability in both; having made this choice, when it was put to him, that he might have wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.10. And the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> bears witness of him, that in this respect there was <hi>none like unto him before him,</hi> nor <hi>after him should any arise like unto him,</hi> 1 Kings 3.12.</p>
            <p>And yet this Wiseman, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the great success of his enquiries, upon a review of them doth find by experience that as his fruitful studies had encreased his learning so had they also multiplied his grief. And therefore as the issue of his experiment he lays down this observation which I have read unto you, <hi>that in much wisdom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Text</hi> then is the result of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> experience upon his enquiry
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55636:101"/>
after happiness in <hi>Learning.</hi> The chief terms of it are reducible under these two <hi>heads.</hi>

               <item>1. The things censured, <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
               </item>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>Wisdom</hi> is the art of business, directing a man in the practical affairs of life to what is fit and convenient, according to the variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. It consists in a solid judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to discern the tempers and the interests of men, the state of business, the probabilities of events and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, together with a present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mind to obviate sudden accid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Knowledge</hi> doth concern the speculation of Nature in reference to <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>effects,</hi> the <hi>differences</hi> and <hi>properties</hi> of things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the <hi>first</hi> of these, <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us that <hi>there is much grief</hi> in it. The original word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifieth properly <hi>indignation</hi>; and the nature of that is a sharp anger mixed with scorn, occasioned either by contempt in persons, or disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in things.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:55636:102"/>2. As for <hi>knowledge,</hi> that <hi>encreaseth sorrow:</hi> Now <hi>sorrow</hi> is a perturbation of mind in the apprehension of some present evil, which we are not able to contest with or avoid. And least any should mistrust that these were only casual accidental concomitants, without any mutual influence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tells us that they are usually proportioned to one another, for the measure of them, and do increase together to shew their casual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>We scarce read of any person in Scripture under greater discontent and vexation of mind, than <hi>Achitophel</hi>; in whom it was the eminency of his parts that set home upon his thoughts the disgrace of having his counsel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, with such aggravations as made him run upon his own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ruine: And there cannot be any higher degree of indignation than that which drives a man to despair and self murder. I shall not need to cite that saying of <hi>Festus,</hi> to St. <hi>Paul, much learning hath made thee mad:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 26.24.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'twas a gross falsehood and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal as he applied it: But yet there was somewhat of the common notion
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55636:102"/>
in it, that <hi>Nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura dementiae.</hi> You know that Fable of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> the great inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Arts and Philosophy, who is said to have an Eagle or a Vulture perpetually knowing upon his liver, signifying those continual cares and anxieties of mind which knowing and inquisitive men are exposed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>But the chief proofs of this assertion of <hi>Solomon</hi> I would rank under <hi>three</hi> Heads, by considering that vexation which there is in the <hi>Getting, Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,</hi> and <hi>Loss</hi> of these things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Getting</hi> of them: 'Tis part of the primitive curse that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is now attainable without <hi>the sweat of our brows</hi>; and the difficulty of every thing is proportionable to the excellency of it: And therefore these being the best of all other things, there must needs be much vexation and labour in the enquiry after them. The <hi>Wise-man</hi> speaking concerning the search afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wisdom, <hi>v.</hi> 13, tells us, that <hi>this sore travel hath God given to the Sons of</hi> Adam, <hi>to be exercised or afflicted therewith:</hi> He seems to allude unto that natural thirst and appetite
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55636:103"/>
after knowledge, which our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have transmitted down to their posterity: And intimates the great justice and equity, that the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> should for <hi>his</hi> ambition and curiosity be punished with a <hi>tantalizing</hi> desire; that the tree of knowledge should be within their view, but out of their reach; so that they could not chuse but desire and attempt after it, but cannot attain unto it. And this earnest desire after knowledge implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our hearts, compared with that great difficulty and labour in getting of it, is that <hi>sore travel which God hath given to the Sons of</hi> Adam <hi>to be afflicted therewith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the perplexities in this kind must needs be very great; whether we consider, the blindness of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, or the intricacie of things themselves; the many dark recesses of nature, the obscurity and implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of causes and effects (there being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Books of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi>) besides tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> accidental difficulties, which are occasioned by the subtilty and intanglement of error, the variety of intricate opinions, the many involutions of controversies and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55636:103"/>
disputes, which are apt to whirl a man about with a <hi>vertigo</hi> of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory probabilities; and instead of settling, to amuse and distract the mind. To which may be added that difficulty and labour which is occasioned by the disease of curiosity, to which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive men are commonly liable; by which they are made to wander about after all kind of varieties, and like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove are continually ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, not knowing where to rest themselves or set their feet. So that in all these respects the <hi>Wise-man</hi> had just cause to complain, <hi>that much study is a weariness to the flesh,</hi> by reason of those many cares and difficulties in the acquisition of wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor is it better with us in the <hi>second</hi> place as to the <hi>Possession</hi> of them: It being the property of learning, as not to diminish by communicating, so not to fill up by addition to it: But the thirst after knowledge doth increase with it; like drink to a man in a feaver, which inflames the appetite to a more impetuous craving. Besides that it is apt to bring along with it much disquietness in other respects,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55636:104"/>
infusing into the soul weak fears, vast desires, jealousies, impatience, emulations, doubts; in all which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects it is almost grown into a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,</hi> that <hi>nihil scire est vita jucun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Philosopher</hi> hath observed it, that the most studious men (though they may be naturally cheerful) yet commonly are by their studies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement made soure and morose, and less patient of opposition; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually chafed and tired out in wrestling with difficulties. And when they have leisure to look abroad upon the state of things round about them, they cannot chuse but see every where much defect and lameness, much confusion and disorder, besides the evils that are a far off; and not being able either to avoid these or amend those, no wonder though their knowledge increaseth their sorrow. The more skill a man hath in any thing, with so much the more disgust and regret doth he behold the failings and deficiencies in that kind. He that hath in his mind the exact <hi>Idea</hi>'s of <hi>Musick</hi> or of <hi>Painting,</hi> cannot hear the discords, or behold the bungling of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55636:104"/>
such as are pretenders to those arts, without displeasure and offence. And thus must it be with every wise man that beholds those irregularities and confusions which he shall meet withall in the world.</p>
            <p>But this will yet better appear, if we consider such mens conditions either in relation to their <hi>Sufferings</hi> or <hi>Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For their <hi>Sufferings:</hi> Such persons have usually the most tender sense, and therefore must needs have the greatest sufferings: As an exact health is required to an exquisite pain. They cannot but be very apprehensive of the cares, dangers, and necessities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are incompassed; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and abuses that are offered to them: <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.7. 'tis said, that <hi>oppression makes a wise man mad,</hi> that is, transports him to some unusual rage; such an one being best able to see and to judge of the deformity of any unjust, unworthy action; and therefore his heart must needs rise up with much nauseousness and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against it.</p>
            <p>A man that by his knowledge hath gotten an enlarged heart, is thereby made less capable of a narrow indigent
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55636:105"/>
condition. He that useth to busy his thoughts in surveying the vast frame of Nature, the several situations and advantages of Kingdoms, or else in censuring the miscarriages of those publick counsels and transactions, upon which the fate of the greatest Nations and Persons have depended; for this man to be himself without any kind of possession or power, and after all these great thoughts to want necessaries for himself or family, to be insulted over by some sordid igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant peasant; how irksome must this be to such a person? And yet this is oftentimes the case of wise and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.11.</note> For <hi>the race is not always to the swift, neither yet bread to the wise, nor riches to men of understanding, nor favour to men of skill, but time and chance happens to them all</hi>; that is, the great abilities of these persons cannot secure them, by any such special pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, but that they may be invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the same necessities and casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which befall the common herd of mankind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for <hi>Sin:</hi> Such persons are more exposed to it, by reason of those temptations to which they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55636:105"/>
knowledge in it self being apt to <hi>puff up.</hi> And yet they cannot find so much pleasure in it as others,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1.</note> by reason of those inward regrets and smitings of conscience which will imbitter it to them. Nor can they sin at so cheap a rate, by reason of those <hi>many stripes</hi> denounced against the <hi>knowing Servant.</hi> The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase in translating of the <hi>Text,</hi> renders the words thus: <hi>That man who increaseth in knowledge and not in grace and repentance, doth treasure up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the anger and indignation of the Lord.</hi> So that in all these respects, there must needs be much vexation, in the possession of wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And yet notwithstanding all this men cannot chuse but be much troubled at the loss of it. Which may be <hi>three</hi> manner of ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. by the <hi>unfaithfulness of memory</hi>; which is like a leaking vessel, and doth quicky let slip the things committed to its custody. Now it must needs be a great vexation to a man to take much pains in gathering in, and treasuring up, and afterwards to let all drop out again through the chinks of a leaking
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55636:106"/>
memory; his labour being to as little purpose as if he had laved water into a sive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Through the <hi>defects of old age</hi>; when <hi>the sun and the moon, and the stars shall be darkned, chap.</hi> 12. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and the other inferior Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties being deprived of their wonted light and reason: Childhood returning again to the mind as well as to the feeble members. 'Tis related of a great <hi>Scholar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Richard Swisset, <hi>a person that lived about</hi> 300 <hi>years since; of so profound learning and subtilty that</hi>

               </note> some ages since of this Place, by name <hi>Swis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi>; who for his manner of Writing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations was afterwards called the <hi>Calculator</hi>; that being grown old he often wept, because he was not able to understand the Books which he had written in his younger days.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By <hi>Death,</hi> which shall put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to our Lives and our Learning at once. Now for men to think, that though they run in never so hot a pursuit after knowledge, yet they must shortly be laid in the dust, from whence
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55636:106"/>
all their learning cannot either preserve or deliver them; to consider, that in this, the wise hath not a greater pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege than the fool; but the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness shall cover both their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories: <hi>For after death there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the wiseman, more than of the fool; seeing that which now is, in the days to come shall be forgotten.</hi> And <hi>lastly,</hi> to consider that after death, the soul of the most ignorant peasant shall presently know more, than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest <hi>Philosophers,</hi> or the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile <hi>Schoolman</hi> could ever attain unto. I say to consider all this, is of it self apt to make a man weary of life and learning, whereby he is exposed to so much vexation.</p>
            <p>I have been so long in the explication and proof of this, <hi>that it is so,</hi> that I shall be but brief in the reasons, <hi>why it is so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I shall mention only those <hi>two,</hi> which are put together in the fifth <hi>ver.</hi> of this <hi>chapter,</hi> 1. The <hi>impotency</hi> of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge, <hi>that which is crooked cannot be made strait.</hi> 2. The <hi>imperfection</hi> of it, <hi>that which is wanting cannot be numbred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:55636:107"/>The vexation of every thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the disappointment of it; which in these things is so much the greater, by how much the hopes and likelyhoods of contentment here, are more promising, and yet the trial and issue more remote and contrary. Now that these things are so far from affording real happiness must needs be evident upon these <hi>two</hi> grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From their utter <hi>impotence</hi> and disability for that work wherein our happiness doth properly consist, the rectifying of our crooked natures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of us to an uprightness and conformity unto that image after which we were created. Now, who knows not, that it is above the power of any natural wisdom or knowledge fully to discover to us the deformity of our natural states? much less then can they direct how to recover us out of it. The Devil is perhaps a greater scholar than any man in the world, and yet all his learning cannot find out a way, how to reinstate himself in his former privileges of a glorified Angel.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:55636:107"/>2. From the deficiency and <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of these things in reference to their own proper faculty, the <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; that which is wanting cannot be numbred.</hi> That is, there are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable particulars in nature, which the most inquisitive judgment shall never reach unto. <hi>No man</hi> shall ever <hi>find out the works of God from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end.</hi> And this is one of the most proper effects of learning, that it discovers to a man his own ignorance. Now as there is on the one hand much pleasure in finding out what a man knew not; so must there be a proportionable grief in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of those innumerable other things which we cannot attain unto. It was the ambition of our first Parents to aspire unto a perfect knowledge, to <hi>be like Gods, knowing good and evil</hi>; and therefore 'tis but just that their posterity should be thus afflicted by the vexation of their imperfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. It must needs be a greater trouble to an inquisitive man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that notwithstanding all his pains and care, yet he must grow old in ignorance, and in most things shall know as little, as those that are idle
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55636:108"/>
and foolish, <hi>the secrets of wisdom being double to that which is,</hi> as <hi>Zophar</hi> tells us in <hi>Iob,</hi> 11.6.</p>
            <p>Now this great <hi>imperfection</hi> of our knowledge will more distinctly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we consider it under those several heads to which it is reducible, <hi>namely,</hi> the knowledge of <hi>Words, Things, Times, Persons</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That learning which consists only in the form and paedagogy of Arts, or the <hi>Critical</hi> notions upon <hi>words</hi> and phrases, hath in it this intrinsical imperfection, that 'tis only so far to be esteemed, as it conduceth to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>things</hi>; being in it self but a kind of pedantry, apt to infect a man with such odd humours of pride, and affectation, and curiosity, as will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him unfit for any great employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Words being but the images of matter, and to be wholly given up to the study of these, what is it but <hi>Pygmalions</hi> phrenzy, to fall in love with a picture or image, as for <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> which is the best skill about words, that hath by some Wisemen been esteemed but a voluptuary art, like to cookery, which spoils whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55636:108"/>
meats, and helps unwholesome, by the variety of sauces serving more to the pleasure of taste than the health of the body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for <hi>real</hi> knowledge, that is likewise exceeding imperfect; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the we look to the history of nature, delivered down to us by the Antients, which in many things is evidently false, and therefore to be suspected in others; or else to what the industry of these latter times hath discovered; men having not been so diligent and exact in their observations, as not to be deceived with casual and fortuitous events.</p>
            <p>The frame of this great Universe as it is represented to humane considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inquiry,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verulam. Pref. ad Nov. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</hi>
               </note> appearing like a perplexed Labyrinth, wherein there is so much ambiguity in the several ways, so much fallacy in the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of things and signs, such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqueness and intricacy in the course of nature, that even sense it self, which in such things is our chiefest guide, is fain to wander up and down in uncertainties, and instead of leading us <hi>out,</hi> do's many times lead us <hi>into</hi> error. And for this reason, Philosophy hath
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55636:109"/>
been so often questioned and subverted in the very principle of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for History of <hi>Times, Persons, Actions</hi>; we have reason enough to suspect that they are generally written, according to the <hi>Author</hi>'s interests and prejudices, and do seldome contain an impartial and upright representation of truth.</p>
            <p>I do not mention <hi>Divinity,</hi> though here our knowledge be most imperfect; nor hath this been wholly free from its changes and fashions according to the course of times.</p>
            <p>Now all this arises from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of our knowledge in these things, because <hi>We see but in part, darkly; That which is wanting</hi> in any of them <hi>cannot be numbred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any one shall from hence object: That according to this, it were better for a man to be idle, ignorant and cheerful, than to macerate himself with much reading. If every state of life hath its proper vexation, 'tis best to chuse that which hath least.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Solomon</hi> answers, that 'tis true, every condition is bad enough, yet some are better than others, <hi>For wisdom excelleth folly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>c.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>as much as a light

                  <hi>c.</hi> 7.3.</note> For <hi>by sadness the heart is made better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be again objected, that 'tis not imaginable how the best things in the world, should expose us to the worst mischiefs and troubles.</p>
            <p>I answer, they are therefore the worst because they spring from the corruption of the best, For <hi>Corruptio optimi est pessima,</hi> the more excellent any thing is in it self, the worse do's it prove when abused or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
            <p>I have been too long in the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part, 'tis more than time that I hasten to the <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I shall not need to apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize, for the suitableness of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course both to this Place and Time. Knowledge is here our business and profession, the great Merchandize that we deal in, and this solemnity is our chief <hi>Mart,</hi> wherein 'tis exposed to publick view, and ought to be after a more especial manner taught and learn'd. And therefore it cannot now be improper for us to be put in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55636:110"/>
of the many troubles and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards we are exposed unto in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
            <p>You have heard already how the greatest natural wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is not only short of, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise opposite unto, that rest and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of mind which we all pretend to seek after.</p>
            <p>And therefore certainly it must needs follow as a most obvious and natural inference.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of <hi>Instruction</hi> or Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we have no reason to be proud of, or to trust in that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which we have already attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or to pursue after more with so much heat and eagerness as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get those practical duties which are most necessary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> that we have great reason to apply our selves unto those means which may prevent or remove the sorrows and dangers, to which these things of themselves will expose us. And that's the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of what I have to say in the <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:55636:110"/>I. It may serve for <hi>Instruction,</hi> to acquaint us:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That we have little reason to be proud of, or to trust in that knowledge we have already attained.</hi> 'Tis true, it hath naturally a fermenting quality in it, being apt to swell and puff up, and 'tis an hard matter for a man that hath much learning not to have a <hi>broad heart,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phrase is, that is, a <hi>proud heart,</hi> as our Translation ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.4. But yet if it be rightly considered, there can be no reason why any man should be proud of that wherein the Devil do's excell him. And the truth is, knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of all others have most cause to be humbled in the apprehension of their own ignorance and folly, of which they must needs be most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. And as for confidence in these things, they will be so far from assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or relieving us in our greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igencies, that they will rather add to our trouble and danger. 'Tis not all the art of Reasoning or Rhetorick in the world that can deceive the Devil, or silence a guilty clamorus conscience; nay, these things do usually help to aggravate such mens conditions, by
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55636:111"/>
many dreadful apprehensions of that wrath and vengeance to which their sins do expose them. The damned souls could not suffer such exquisite torments, if in the state of separation they were not raised to a much higher degree of knowledge than here they are capable of. And as for that great business of a man's life, which doth most of all concern him, conversion and regeneration, <hi>the wisdom of this world</hi> is so far from helping us in this, that <hi>'tis enmity against God.</hi> No men usually are such fierce and bitter oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of the power of godliness, as those that have learned heads and unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied hearts: <hi>Paul</hi>'s powerful preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was never more fruitless than amongst the <hi>Athenians,</hi> whose learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was so far from shewing them the excellency, that it made them despise the simplicity of the Gospel. Our Saviour never met with more malitious opposition, than from the learned <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi>; who did not only by open contempt resist his ministry, but also by secret practises undermine his person. And therefore in all these respects we have little reason either of pride or confidence in that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55636:111"/>
knowledge which any of us have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have as little reason <hi>to be so eager in the pursuit after more, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or neglect those practical duties which are most necessary.</hi> 'Tis true, knowledge is here the business of our particular Callings, as <hi>Scholars</hi>; in which 'tis our duty to be diligent, and our just commendation to be skilful. But yet there is somewhat else of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to us in our general Callings, as <hi>Christians,</hi> a demeanour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation suitable to this Profession; our failing in this will quickly bring a blemish upon the other. There have been of late great complaints (and too much occasion for them) of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and reproach poured out upon men of our Calling; which though it may argue much folly and madness in those unreasonable men who are the Authors of it, yet perhaps there may be too much occasion given on our parts, for want of that holiness and zeal and prudence and gravity which should accompany our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; besides that many of us do by our sloth and idleness, let other men outgo us in those very gifts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55636:112"/>
which are more peculiarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to our Calling. Now I say, that which must promote both the useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and the reputation of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is when our practice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is made suitable to it. 'Tis not an ability to talk or to dispute of Religion; for in these times, what <hi>man,</hi> nay what <hi>woman</hi> almost is there who do's not pretend to skill in this? But it is a holy and prudent conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that must adorn our profession, and provoke others to the love of it. And there are stronger engagements upon us to this purpose, than upon any others. Because by our Callings we profess our selves to be amongst those servants, who do not only know, but are able to teach our masters will, and therefore our disobedience shall be punished with <hi>many stripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but that skill in <hi>Controversies,</hi> the <hi>Tongues, History, Philosophy,</hi> the <hi>Arts,</hi> are all of them not only great ornaments and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to particular men, but in some sense also necessary for the Church; but yet when all is done, 'tis this practical <hi>Divinity,</hi> that must bring us to heaven, that must poise our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55636:112"/>
and settle our consciences, and strengthen our comforts; and save our souls. This must be <hi>our rejoycing</hi> at the last day, <hi>the testimony of our consciences,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</note> 
               <hi>that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God we have had our conversations in this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A second <hi>Use</hi> shall be for <hi>exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> that we would <hi>apply our selves to those means which may help to remedy the sorrows and dangers to which those things of themselves will expose us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are divers things of excellent use in Physick which yet cannot be safely prescribed without the addition of some correctives to abate their noxious qualities. Such is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this natural wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which of themselves have many flatuous and corroding qualities; but yet being mixed with some proper correctives, may be made of singular use and efficacy. But you will say, what are these other ingredients? Why the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth prescribe a large <hi>recipe</hi> of them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Add to your knowledge, faith, virtue, temperance, patience, goodness, brotherly kindness, charity.</hi> The mixture of these
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55636:113"/>
other Christians Graces, will make our knowledge exceeding wholesome and useful. I must not insist upon the particulars; only there are <hi>two</hi> Graces amongst all the rest, which I cannot omit, being in Scripture phrase styled by the name of <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>knowledge</hi>; and therefore of all others, the study of these must needs be the most proper remedies to be applied in this case: namely: 1. <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ: 2. <hi>Fear</hi> of God: These are properly the <hi>graces,</hi> the other but the <hi>gifts</hi> of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>wisdom unto salvation</hi>; the <hi>other</hi> is but wisdom <hi>unto grief</hi>; this leads us unto a practical acquaintance with the Doctrine of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ, in whom are laid up all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</hi>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55636:113"/>
an one is but a fool, if he be either ignorant, or careless, how to save his own soul. And therefore if we aim at true wisdom, we should make it our chief business <hi>to grow in grace,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> this <hi>knowledge of our Lord and Saviour</hi> Jesus Christ. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a man of as great abilities as any that we read of, <hi>bred up at the feet of</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel, very well versed in the chief Authors of his time, <hi>Epimenides, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander, Aratus,</hi> whom he cites upon several occasions; of a very powerful and masculine Oratory, as may be seen by the effects of it, in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with <hi>Faelix, Agrippa, Festus,</hi> and the men of <hi>Lystra,</hi> who for this reason called him <hi>Mercury.</hi> And for his skill in Languages, <hi>he spake with tongues more than they all:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note> And yet this learned man, notwithstanding all these great abilities, doth profess that he <hi>desired to know nothing but Christ and him Crucified,</hi> that is, nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison to that knowledg, or nothing but what might lead him to it, or further him in it; nay he <hi>counts all things but loss for the excellency of this knowledge of Christ Iesus his Lord.</hi>

This he makes the conclusion of his whole <hi>Sermon</hi>; and I shall shut up all with the same advice.

            <p>AMongst that great variety of subjects which <hi>Solomon</hi> treats of, in this and his other moral discourses, there is none more frequently mentioned, or more largely insisted upon, than this of wisdom. He himself, when he was put to his choice, having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred this before all other things, and being so very eminent above all other men, for his great abilities in this kind: He doth thereupon take all occasions to celebrate the praise of it, and to excite others to the love and study of it.</p>

to speak of: Being a subject amongst all others the most difficult to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, partly for the abstruseness of it, and partly for the copiousness of it, being that which we are still to be learning all the days of our lives. And therefore is it no easy matter, either to explain the nature, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the doctrine of it within a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compass; which yet I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do with as much plainness and brevity as I can.</p>

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>In the prosecution of this, I shall endeavour. 1. To shew the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> what it is, and wherein it consists. 2. The <hi>Necessity</hi> of it, or the grounds of our obligation to it, from Scripture, and Reason. 3. To apply this by some useful <hi>inferences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. To shew what <hi>Wisdom</hi> is, and wherein it consists: Which I would enlarge under these <hi>four heads.</hi>

               <item>1. The description of its <hi>Nature</hi> and causes.</item>
               <item>2. The several <hi>kinds</hi> and distinctions of it.</item>
               <item>3. The <hi>properties</hi> or effects that flow from it.</item>
               <item>4. The <hi>opposites</hi> to it.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. For the description of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> this is by <hi>Aristotle</hi> said to be that intellectual Virtue whereby we are directed in our manners and carriage, to make choice of the right Means in the prosecution of our true End. <hi>Tully</hi> describes it to be <hi>ars vivendi:</hi> And to the same purpose <hi>Aquinas, Recta ratio agibilium, the skill of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning a mans self aright in practical
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55636:117"/>
affairs.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: <hi>The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way,</hi> Prov. 14.8. It is the end of science or knowledge to furnish our minds with due concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, concerning the nature of things in <hi>general,</hi> their differences, relations, dependencies, whether in themselves they are either true or false, good or evil; but to be able to give a true judgment of <hi>particulars,</hi> concerning what may be most fit and convenient, in that great variety of Cases, which we shall meet with in the practical affairs of life, this is properly the work of Wisdom and Prudence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Philosophers</hi> in their distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of virtues have generally agreed upon <hi>four,</hi> which they call <hi>cardinal,</hi> because all the rest do turn upon them as upon their hinges.</p>
            <p>These are <hi>Prudence,</hi> and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal <hi>Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance: Prudence</hi> is that virtue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man is inabled to judge of what is right and fitting to be done, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to variety of cases and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. <hi>Iustice</hi> is that inclination of mind, whereby a man is disposed and fixed to do in every business ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55636:117"/>
to the Rules of right, and just as he ought. <hi>Fortitude</hi> is that virtue whereby he is inabled to resist and subdue all such difficulties as he may meet with in the performance of his duty, on the <hi>one</hi> hand, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of danger or fear. And <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> is that virtue whereby he is inabled to overcome the temptations on the <hi>other</hi> hand, of pleasure and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that each of these virtues are of universal extent in all the affairs and conditions of life; and there are many particular Cases, all such as are of any importance, wherein every one of them is to be exercised. When a man shall stand in need of <hi>Prudence</hi> to direct him in what is fitting; and of <hi>Iustice</hi> to incline him to do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; and of <hi>Fortitude</hi> to resist those fears and discouragements which be put in his way; and of <hi>Temperance</hi> to overcome the temptations of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement and pleasure, whereby he may be drawn aside and inticed.</p>
            <p>The first of these, which I am now treating of, is <hi>Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and it consists of these <hi>three</hi> parts:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:55636:118"/>I. A <hi>Sagacity of judgment</hi> to make a true estimate of 1. <hi>Things,</hi> 2. <hi>Persons,</hi> 3. <hi>Times</hi> and 4. <hi>Events.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Of <hi>Things,</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>nature</hi> of them, whether they are <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> and according to their <hi>degrees</hi> whether <hi>Gnatts</hi> or <hi>Camels, Moats</hi> or <hi>Beams, Mint</hi> and <hi>Cummin</hi> or <hi>the weighty matters of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Of <hi>Persons,</hi> according to their various tempers, interests and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The <hi>Philosopher</hi> hath observed that every man hath some <hi>handle</hi> in his disposition, which he that can take hold of may thereby lead him about and persuade him to any thing: Nor can there be a more palpable folly than to use such courses in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the persuading of men, as in their own natures are like to alienate and exasperate them, rather than to convince them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of <hi>Times</hi> and seasons; as to the fitness of them, <hi>a wise mans heart dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth both of time and judgment,</hi> Eccles. 8.5. That which at one time may be very useful and proper, may not prove so at another season.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:55636:118"/>4. Of <hi>Events,</hi> as to the probability of them: <hi>A wise man foresees the evil and hides himself:</hi> Again, he knows that things and persons are not to be judged of by their present state, but by their final issues, which he is able oftimes to foresee in their causes.</p>
            <p n="2">II. A <hi>Presence of mind,</hi> to obviate suddain accidents, that a man may not be daunted with a surprize or unexpected emergency, but may have his wits about him, to make the best diversion and provision that such a case will admit of.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Experience</hi> and observation of the most usual and probable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of things, which being for the most part acquired upon many trials, and in long time, therefore is this Virtue of <hi>Wisdom</hi> commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to old age, according to that in <hi>Iob: With the antients is wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in length of days understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 12.12. But because a diligent observation of History is somewhat equivalent to this, the world being but a great Theatre, wherein the same parts are repeated and acted over again in several Ages, there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore this may be some help and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55636:119"/>
supply where the other is wanting.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>second</hi> particular to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed is concerning the several <hi>kinds</hi> and distinctions of it. The Scripture takes notice of two general kinds of it: <hi>One</hi> that is a Grace or Virtue, the <hi>other</hi> that is not so.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first of these is sometimes styled: <hi>The wisdom that is from above,</hi> James 3.17. to shew its <hi>original</hi> and descent: <hi>The wisdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.7. as the <hi>Author</hi> of it: <hi>Wise unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as the <hi>end</hi> of it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Wise to that which is good,</hi> as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>object</hi> of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Opposite</hi> to this is sometimes called, the wisdom from beneath, or <hi>which descendeth not from above,</hi> James 3.15. but is <hi>earthly, sensual, devilish.</hi> The <hi>wisdom of the flesh,</hi> Rom. 8.6, 7. <hi>which is enmity against God.</hi> The <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.6. <hi>We speak not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world,</hi> that is, 'tis not our business to instruct men in those subtilties of Philosophy, or arts of Policy, which pertain to these worldly affairs, for which other men are celebrated as princes and famous in their generations: <hi>But we speak the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55636:119"/>
wisdom of God in a mystery,</hi> as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next <hi>verse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides this general distinction of <hi>Wisdom</hi> into <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> there is likewise another distribution of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the several <hi>ends</hi> which men propose to themselves, and the means whereby these several ends are to be attained. The common end which every man doth and must propose to himself by a natural necessity, is a state of happiness. But according to mens different apprehensions of this, and those several designs wherein they place their happiness, so may their wisdom be distributed. Now there are <hi>three</hi> kinds of things which men of several tempers do propose to themselves as their happiness, either, 1. The gratifying of their carnal appetites in enjoying of these worldly things. 2. In that peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of mind, which may be attained by the exercise of moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: Or, 3. In spiritual blessedness. According to which it is distinguished into these <hi>three</hi> kinds, <hi>Carnal Policy, Moral Prudence, Spiritual Wisdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:55636:120"/>1. For <hi>Carnal Policy:</hi> The end of this is the satisfying of our sensual appetites; either by luxury and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, by gain and riches, or by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, power and greatness in the world. Which the Apostle St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.16. hath styled <hi>the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life.</hi> Sensuality, Covetousness and Pride; to which St. <hi>Iames</hi> hath appropriated the Epithetes of <hi>sensual, earthly, devilish.</hi> James 3.15. The more weak and impotent any Creature is, of so much the more narrow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs must it be. 'Tis an argument of an infirm and little soul, when men are wholly immersed in themselves, and confined to the gratifying of their brutish appetites: Such persons are usually <hi>sui amantes sine rivali,</hi> as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> speaks; great lovers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but without any rival or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor: If they do attain their ends, they are of all others the most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble and despicable, a kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent vermine amongst men; and if they fail of their ends, nothing can be more vain or miserable. Now the end that such men propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves being small and vile, and much
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55636:120"/>
below the nobility of the humane nature, therefore no wonder, if they are put to prosecute it by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy means, by secret undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, crafty and fraudulent sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizals, destruction on the one hand, and base flattery and complyances on the other hand, all kind of courses, <hi>per fas, &amp; nefas, quocunque modo,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any consideration of what is honest or just, if it seem but likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their particular design.</p>
            <p>When these worldly things are made our chief end, then all those arts and devices that are used about them, are but worldly policy and devilish craft. But now when they are made a subordinate end, as they may, then the grace or virtue of wisdom, may be of great use in the prosecution of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Moral Prudence:</hi> The end which this proposes to it self, is peace, quiet, safety as to our outward condition, contentment and joy as to our inward frame, and usefulness to those with whom we converse; and such a future state of happiness as the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will inable men to believe and hope for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:55636:121"/>The <hi>Means</hi> for the attaining of this <hi>end,</hi> are the <hi>Moral</hi> Virtues: All those virtuous habits whereby we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to moderate our passions, to subdue our corrupt inclinations, and to regulate our actions and carriage. Now though this be not the same thing with that we call <hi>Divinity,</hi> yet 'tis in the very next degree to it; if there had been no special Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from heaven, this had been the utmost felicity that we could have proposed to our selves, or that our natures had been capable of: And now that there is another way discovered to repair the defects of our lapsed condition, it doth not exclude <hi>moral</hi> honesty and prudence as things super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, but doth comprehend and take them in as a necessary part of Religion, without which a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so much as pretend to grace and holiness; and where it stands alone separated from Christianity, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and insufficient soever it may be for the attainment of true blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet 'tis of it self of a very amiable nature, deserving love and commendation. 'Tis said of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> that he <hi>loved</hi> the young man in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55636:121"/>
the Gospel upon this account: I do the rather mention this, because in the unwary expressions of some men, morality hath been sometimes declai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med against as if it were a vice. 'Tis a disparagement indeed to a man, who lives under the means of Grace, not to get above the morality of the Heathens, but 'tis a far greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement for a man to pretend unto higher attainments, and yet to fall short of them in the practice of moral duties.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Christian Wisdom:</hi> The <hi>end</hi> which this proposeth is a state of eternal blessedness, consisting in reconciliation to God, and communion with him. The <hi>means</hi> for the attaining of this end, are the infused principles of grace, by which our corrupted natures are to be renewed and repaired to their primitive rectitude; <hi>Faith</hi> in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, together with an hearty, constant and universal submission to the doctrine of the Gospel. Which is the <hi>wisdom of God</hi> whereby we are made <hi>wise unto Salvation:</hi> So that <hi>Christian Wisdom</hi> may be defined to be that habit of mind whereby a man is inabled to propose the true end of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55636:122"/>
eternal blessedness, and to judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right concerning such means as may be most fit for the attaining of this end, conforming his life and carriage accordingly.</p>
            <p>This doth not abolish <hi>humane wisdom,</hi> so far as we keep within due bounds, in the getting and enjoying these worldly things, much less <hi>moral pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>; but they may be both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under it, as being subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate and subservient to it. Only this hath upon all accounts the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, as proposing the best end, chusing the most certain and infallible means. In these secular affairs the effect is not always tyed to the means; <hi>The battel is not to the strong, nor the race to the swift, but time and chance happen to them all.</hi> There may happen some unexpected emergencies from undiscernible accidents, which may blast all our designs and most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contrivances: Besides that in a long <hi>series</hi> and concatenation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, life it self may fail us, and <hi>then all our thoughts perish.</hi> Nor can moral virtue always attain that joy and contentment which it aims at, considering the many infirmities and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55636:122"/>
temptations we are liable unto. But now those graces and duties which are prescribed by Christian wisdom, are most certain and infallible, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail of their end.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The next thing to be spoken unto, is concerning the <hi>proper effects</hi> of Wisdom; the chief of which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> tells us is to <hi>direct,</hi> Eccles. 10.10. <hi>Wisdom is profitable to direct.</hi> And this it doth both as to the <hi>end</hi> and the <hi>means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It directs to propose the right end, such as may be perfective of our natures, and suitable to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of a spiritual immortal soul, <hi>namely,</hi> the fruition of the first and most supreme Being. That which is highest and greatest <hi>in genere veri,</hi> to gratify our understandings; and <hi>in genere boni,</hi> to satisfy our wills and affections. Any thing that is short of this will not reach up to the nature of an end, <hi>namely,</hi> to the utmost perfection of our natures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their kind. And for a man to mistake in his ultimate end, is the most fatal incurable folly that may be, not to be remedied by any possible artifice or diligence to be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55636:123"/>
used about the <hi>means:</hi> All which will but help to promote and increase the first error.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It directs to consult about the means: This the <hi>Philosopher</hi> calls, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which consists in a judicious investigation about the several ways, and a choice of such as are more proper to the end we propose. There are these <hi>two</hi> qualifications requisite unto all such means as are consistent with true wisdom. 1. They must be <hi>fit</hi> and accommodate to the end. And 2. They must be <hi>honest</hi> and lawful in themselves: A defect in either of these will expose men to the censure of <hi>folly,</hi> or of <hi>fraud.</hi> And there are <hi>two</hi> things which every wise man should propose to himself in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his affairs, <hi>success</hi> and <hi>safety.</hi> The making of some advance and progress in his main design; and the securing himself from such dangers as he may meet with. In order to which there are <hi>four</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to be observed, as being highly subservient to the due manner of contriving and executing of things. These are:
<list>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:55636:123"/>
                  <item>1. <hi>Forecast</hi> and providence against want.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Wariness</hi> and caution against danger.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> against oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Sedulity</hi> and diligence against difficulties.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Which <hi>four</hi> qualifications seem to me to be recommended by <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 30.24. Where he tells us, that there be <hi>four things, which are little upon the earth, but they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wise, sapientiora sapientibus. The Ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer. The Conies are but a feeble folk:</hi> Some read this Word <hi>mures montani</hi> the <hi>Mice,</hi> which for their smallness seems more agreeable to those other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples with which they are joyned. These <hi>are but a feeble folk, yet they make their houses in the Rock.</hi> The Locusts <hi>have no King, yet go they forth all of them by bands. The Spider takes hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:55636:124"/>
               <hi>Interpreters</hi> do very much vary in their expositions of this place: Some would have it to refer to <hi>four</hi> kinds of necessary things to be acquired by wisdom. 1. <hi>Food</hi> and sustenance, in the example of the <hi>Ant.</hi> 2. <hi>Safe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,</hi> in the instance of the <hi>Mice.</hi> 3. <hi>Power,</hi> in the example of the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs.</hi> 4. <hi>Honour,</hi> by that instance of the <hi>Spider.</hi> Implying that there is no person so mean and impotent, but by wisdom may provide for his own, 1. <hi>Necessary subsistence,</hi> if he takes the right opportunity. Gathering in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>working whilst it is day, before the night comes when no man can work.</hi> And 2. For his <hi>safe habitation,</hi> by building upon <hi>a Rock, Matth.</hi> 7. Get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>a house not made with hands eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the heavens,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. And 3. For his <hi>Power,</hi> by joyning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in <hi>society</hi> and observing the Laws of it. And lastly for <hi>Honour,</hi> by his <hi>Sedulity</hi> and diligence in opposing all the difficulties that he meets with.</p>
            <p>Others conceive these words to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to those several kinds of wisdom, which belong to these four conditions or states of life. 1. That of the <hi>Countryman</hi> or Husbandman, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55636:124"/>
by the <hi>Ant,</hi> who lives in the field and <hi>gathers in the harvest.</hi> 2. That of the <hi>Citizens,</hi> by the <hi>Mice, whose habitation is in the Rocks.</hi> 3. That of the <hi>Souldier,</hi> by the <hi>Locusts, who go forth in bands.</hi> 4. That of the <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,</hi> by the <hi>Spider, who lives in Kings Palaces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are several other conjectures about the meaning of the <hi>Wiseman</hi> in these examples, which I shall not now mention. Only 'tis observable that the instances here made use of, are of such Creatures as, besides their own littleness and weakness, are withall of no kind of benefit to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, either as to clothing, or food, or physick, but rather noxious and hurtful to men; but what they want in usefulness as to these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, they may supply by their teaching us wisdom.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Ant prepares his meat in the summer,</hi> thereby teaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing us in that part of wisdom, which concerns providence and forecast against future want.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:55636:125"/>2. The <hi>Conies,</hi> or as it may be more properly rendred the <hi>Mice,</hi> which are <hi>but a feeble folk build their houses in the Rock,</hi> and not being able to make any opposition or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance against their enemies, they use their best wariness and caution for the avoiding of them, and place their security in the inaccessibleness of their habitation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Locusts go forth by bands:</hi> Though the <hi>Locust</hi> of it self be a most impotent Creature, easily swept away or trodden under foot, yet are they safe upon account of their numbers, and most formidable in their troops, wasting whole Countries before them; so that no kind of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or resistance can prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Spider takes hold with her hands, and is in Kings palaces.</hi> Though such places be most frequented by company, and kept most neat and elegant, the Spiders webb being often destroyed and swept down, yet by her unwearied diligence and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable industry, she renews it again, being ready to repeat over her former labours, without despondency, as
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55636:125"/>
often as her losses and necessities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; and by that means gets and continues an habitation in palaces.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The <hi>fourth</hi> thing I proposed to speak to, was the <hi>Opposites</hi> to this virtue of wisdom, whether by way of excess, <hi>Craft</hi>; or by way of <hi>Defect, Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Redundant</hi> extream of it is <hi>Craft,</hi> guile, a fraudulent subtilty, which may properly be styled a being overwise <hi>i. e.</hi> wiser than the Rule; as if by this a man were able to find out shorter ways than the lawful road, breaking over hedge and ditch and all legal bounds, as if this were the most expedite way to arrive at our journeys end. This is that which the <hi>Serpent</hi> is said to be eminent for, above all other <hi>beasts of the field, Gen.</hi> 3. Whence it is usually called a kind of crooked serpentine wisdom, consisting in an ability of surprizing and putting tricks upon others, lying always upon the catch, and dealing by way of stratagem; which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable only in a state of War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst professed declared enemies, and where matters depend upon suddain actions; and yet even in such cases
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55636:126"/>
this way of Craft will by a noble and generous enemy be avoided as much as may be: But in our ordinary carriage to make use of it, towards such to whom we profess amity and fair dealing, is exceeding unworthy, and will make a man suspected by every one with whom he converseth, as a dangerous person.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Deficient</hi> extream of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is called <hi>Folly</hi> or simpleness; which consists in such a vitious habit as is acquired by the frequent neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or rejection of the ways of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And this is properly both a sin and a punishment. This peculiar dishonour belonging to it, amongst all other vices, that whereas some men have been so impudent, as to boast and take a pride in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest actions; yet there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be found so wretched, as to brag of his Folly. This being amongst all men counted most reproachful, and that which will render one most contemptible.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the <hi>first</hi> thing I proposed, concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of Wisdom. I proceed to the <hi>second,</hi> concerning the <hi>Necessity</hi> of it, or the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55636:126"/>
grounds of our obligation to it, both from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> proofs to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose may be reduced to these <hi>two</hi> Heads; the <hi>precepts</hi> for it, the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Precepts</hi> for it, are very frequent in Scripture, especially in this Book, <hi>v.</hi> 5. of this <hi>Chapter. Get wisdom, get understanding, and forget it not.</hi> So <hi>chap.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Say unto wisdom thou art my Sister, and to understanding, thou art my Kinswoman,</hi> That is, grow into such an intimate relation and familiar acquaintance with it, as persons usually have with such as are of the same consanguinity. <hi>Dig for her as for Silver,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>and search for her as for hid treasure.</hi> Count no labour too much, that may further you in this enquiry. In the N. T. we are commanded to be <hi>wise as Serpents</hi>; to be <hi>wise unto that which is good;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.</note> to <hi>walk wisely to them that are without</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Colos.</hi> 4.5.</note> to demean our selves amidst all the difficulties and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we shall meet with in the world, with much caution and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, <hi>not as fools but as wise,</hi> Ephes. 5.15.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:55636:127"/>2. The <hi>Commendations</hi> that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Scripture to this virtue, are so very numerous, that 'tis very hard to speak briefly of them. There are <hi>four</hi> things which are usually of greatest value and esteem amongst men, <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi> And when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would set forth the commendation of any thing, it doth frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with, and prefer it before, some of these things. 'Tis so in the present subject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis better than <hi>Riches,</hi> Job 28.16. <hi>Wisdom cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious Onyx, or the Saphyr. The Gold and the Chrystal cannot equal it. And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of it shall not be for Iewels of fine gold. No mention shall be made of Coral or Pearls, for the price of wisdom is above Rubies, the Topaz of Aethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is it self the greatest <hi>Honour,</hi> and will be a means to advance a man in the esteem of others. <hi>It makes a man's face to shine, and the boldness
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55636:127"/>
of his face shall be changed, Eccles.</hi> 8.1. It multiplies the strength of his face, as the <hi>Original</hi> words may signifie. It gives a lustre to a person, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he contracts love and reverence from all that know him. <hi>Good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing giveth favour,</hi> Prov. 13.15. that is, renders a man amiable and acceptable to others. <hi>The wise shall inherit glory,</hi> Prov. 3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wisdom is the truest and the best <hi>Pleasure.</hi> Filling the heart with joy and the conscience with peace. <hi>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17. <hi>Wisdom excelleth folly, as much as light excelleth darkness. Now light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun,</hi> Eccles. 11.7. 'Tis not an easy matter to describe, what great pleasure and satisfaction it is, for a man to stand upon the advantage-ground of wisdom and experience, and to look down upon the mists and errors and wandrings which those are subject to who walk in the vale below.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Wisdom is as our <hi>life: Length of days is in her right hand,</hi> Prov. 3.16. <hi>She is a tree of life to them that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55636:128"/>
lay hold upon her,</hi> v. 18. <hi>Whoso findeth me, findeth life, and he shall obtain favour of the Lord; but he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul. All they that hate me love death,</hi> chap. 8.35. The <hi>Scripture</hi> doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in several other expressions to the same purpose, which I have not now time to mention.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the principles of <hi>Reason,</hi> it may be made very evident, that Wisdom is necessary to the <hi>safety</hi> of our <hi>persons,</hi> and to the <hi>success</hi> of our Actions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis necessary to the <hi>safety</hi> of our <hi>persons</hi>; for the preventing and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing all those difficulties and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions and dangers that we shall meet with. <hi>Discretion shall preserve thee, and understanding shall keep thee, to deliver thee from the way of the evil man,</hi> Prov. 2.11. <hi>It shall teach thee to walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble,</hi> chap. 3.23. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> having sent forth his Disciples as <hi>sheeep in the midst of wolves,</hi> bids them be <hi>wise as serpents, and innocent as doves.</hi> Innocence must secure them against any legal punishment, or the sufferings
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55636:128"/>
under just government; and wisdom must protect them against irregular violence, and the injustice of others: Teaching them how to escape the snare, and prevent the surprizals of such as watch for advantage against them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis necessary to the <hi>management</hi> of our <hi>affairs</hi> with success: That which on our parts is required to the success of any business, is an ability to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive</hi> and to <hi>execute</hi>; and this wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom only can enable us for.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>first, Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>a wise man's eyes are in his head,</hi> Eccles. 2.14, where they may best serve him to look round about him, to discover the distance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of things, and what is the shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test way of passing from one affair to another. Such an one can see afar off: And though future matters be for the most part, but as a dark empty space, which is alike invisible to him that is blind, and to him that sees; yet a prudent man hath some advantage in this respect, being able in some cases in a good measure to foresee
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55636:129"/>
events in their causes, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to provide for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as Wisdom doth thus fit a man for <hi>contrivance,</hi> by the right situation of the <hi>eye,</hi> the organ of seeing; so likewise doth it for <hi>execution,</hi> by the right qualification of the <hi>hand,</hi> the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>action. A wise man's heart is at his right hand, Eccles.</hi> 10.2. The most useful part for employment. He goes readily and wisely to work, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms things with dexterity and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, according to the most decent order: Whereas <hi>the heart of the fool is at his left hand,</hi> that is, he goes about things awkwardly, not with that dexterity and strength as he should. Now businesses thus managed are usually attended with success, nor is there any thing to be further done on our parts to make any action prosperous. <hi>Nullum Numen abest si sit prudentia:</hi> There is for the most part a blessing from heaven upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings that are wisely contrived and managed.</p>

               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:55636:129"/>In brief, <hi>Wisdom</hi> is necessary to our <hi>Obedience:</hi> A man may have good affections, and be enclined to do that which is right, but he will not be able to act accordingly, and to do honest things, without some measure of prudence to judge of particular cases. 'Tis this that must preserve our minds from error, our hearts from corruption, our lives from sin, our persons from shame and danger; that must fit us for every condition, teaching us <hi>how to want, and how to abound</hi>; that must render all our gifts and abilities useful. Such persons as are much below others, as to <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Art, Wit, Diligence, Riches, Power,</hi> yet by this virtue of <hi>Prudence</hi> may prove much more serviceable to God and his Church, more useful in their generations, than those who do much exceed them in all these other respects. From all which it may appear, that there is sufficient reason to infer the <hi>necessity</hi> of this grace of Wisdom.</p>
            <p>There remains only one <hi>Enquiry</hi> or <hi>Objection</hi> to be briefly stated and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and I shall proceed to <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:55636:130"/>May not this be said to be a <hi>gift</hi> and a privilege,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> rather than a <hi>duty</hi>; and the want of it, a <hi>defect</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness, rather than a <hi>sin?</hi> Every man is not bound to be eloquent, learned, beautiful, witty, strong. These are blessings and gifts, which depend upon our natural abilities, leisure, education, experience, some of which are not in our power, and therefore not to be imposed as duties, as if there were sin and guilt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without them; and why may not the same be said of Wisdom?</p>
            <p>To this <hi>two</hi> things may be answered. 1. That <hi>Christian</hi> wisdom, for the nature and <hi>substance</hi> of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi>
               </note> is a <hi>duty</hi>; for the <hi>degrees,</hi> a <hi>gift.</hi> Every Christian though of the lowest form is supposed to have the prudence of a <hi>Disciple</hi> and of <hi>submission,</hi> though not of a <hi>Teacher</hi> and of <hi>conduct.</hi> He may have a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ability, both to understand and to make a right use of those means, which are necessary to his chief end, namely eternal blessedness. And 2. As for <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>civil</hi> prudence, whereby a man is to conduct himself in the ordinary affairs of life: This likewise is, as to the substance of it, a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55636:130"/>
duty, which all men are obliged unto in some measure, according as their capacities, conditions, and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may require; though not all alike in the same kinds, or the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. 'Tis no culpable defect in a private man, that he is without the art of government, any more than it is in an Husbandman or Tradesman, to be destitute of skill in Military and Naval matters, which are things of another kind. A private souldier is not obliged to have the prudence of a General; nor is it to be expected that every one who can govern a Family, should be able to govern a City. But when a man is called from a private to a publick station, he is then by virtue of this Call, under an obligation of labouring after all those endowments and abilities, whereby he may fill up and adorn his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The neglect of such abilities as are suitable to a mans station, is not only a <hi>defect</hi> but a <hi>fault.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now done with the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part: I shall be very brief in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi>; wherein I shall touch at three <hi>Inferences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:55636:131"/>1. From the nature of Wisdom, as it hath been described, it will follow, that no wicked man can be truly wise; because such men mistake in their chief end, preferring earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heaven, transient momentany things before those of everlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; than which there cannot be a more monstrous folly. And they mistake likewise in the honesty and fitness of the means, by reason of their disability to <hi>discern betwixt things that differ,</hi> and to <hi>approve those that are more excellent.</hi> They may have good wits, a quickness and vivacity of fancy, and yet be far from being wise. 'Tis a Proverbial saying, that some men have good wits, if wise men had them in keeping. When these two are separated the former of them doth many times prove a prejudice and an occasion of mischief, and 'twere better for such persons to wear wooden daggers than those of steel.</p>
            <p>They may have much humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But great Clerks are not always wise men. <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> were for their knowledge called the <hi>two eyes of the world</hi>; as <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:55636:131"/>
were for their military strength, the two <hi>Arms</hi> of it. And yet the <hi>Apostle</hi> styles those of <hi>Corinth, fools,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>God hath made foolish the wisdom of the wise.</hi> And elsewhere speaking of the <hi>Graecian Philosophers,</hi> he says, <hi>whilst they profess'd themselves to be wise, they became fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They may have some skill in the Scriptures, as the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors had, whom yet our Saviour calls fools: <hi>Yea fools and blind,</hi> Matth. 23.17.</p>
            <p>They may have the art of bringing about their secular designs, growing great and rich, and yet deserve no better a title than that laborious Rich man in the Gospel, whom our Saviour calls <hi>fool</hi> for his pains, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20.</p>
            <p>And <hi>lastly,</hi> they may likewise have some measure of moral uprightness, keeping themselves unspotted from the pollutions of the world; and upon that account may be called <hi>Virgins,</hi> but without true religion and holiness, they are but <hi>foolish virgins,</hi> and such as shall miss of their end, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it will follow, that grace and holiness is the truest wisdom. He that is truly religious (whatever
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55636:132"/>
other accomplishments he may want) he is truly wise.<hi>Behold, the fear of the Lord that is wisdom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 28.28</note> 
               <hi>and to depart from evil is understanding:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 111.10.</note> Therefore <hi>keep his statutes, for this is your wisdom and understanding in the sight of the Nations,</hi> Deut. 4.6. A good man is in Scripture phrase styled, <hi>the man of wisdom, Micah,</hi> 6.9. And conversion a <hi>being turned to the wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om of the just, Luke</hi> 1.17. And on the other side all kind of Sin is in the usual Scripture phrase called by the name of folly. Now 'tis no small advantage to such as are truly religious, that whatever they may be destitute of as to these worldly matters, yet they have <hi>the principal thing,</hi> namely, <hi>wisdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And <hi>lastly,</hi> if <hi>wisdom be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing,</hi> then let it be our principal endeavour to attain it; and <hi>above all other gettings, let us labour to get under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi> Nothing can be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, than that our love and zeal toward any thing, should be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the excellency of it. In order to which we should carefully apply our selves to all those good means, whereby wisdom is to be attained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:55636:132"/>As for that kind of Prudence, which is requisite to the management of secular business; this depends upon some natural abilities, as sagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of judgment, quickness and presence of mind, together with the advantage of long experience, and therefore is not to be taught and learnt as other Arts and Sciences may.</p>
            <p>We have Schools for <hi>Logick, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, Mathematicks, Philosophy,</hi> but none to teach men wisdom and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. And the reason is, because this cannot (by reason of the infinite variety of cases) be comprehended under any certain rules; or if it could, yet all the <hi>Maximes</hi> that can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed of this nature will be but as a workman's tools; which though never so good in themselves, yet without skill in the Artist will never make good work: And for a man to think that he may be able in this respect to act wisely, by any certain Rules or Maximes prescribed him, is all one as to imagine that the tools of some excellent Artificer should (though in the hands of a bungler) be able to produce good work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:55636:133"/>But now on the other hand, that kind of Christian wisdom, which we are obliged unto as our principal duty, and whereby we are to be made <hi>wise unto Salvation:</hi> This is subject to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rules and means for the attaining of it. Which in the general are, keeping the Commandments, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the doctrine of the Gospel; and in order to this, <hi>attending at the gates of wisdom, receiving instruction</hi> with all readiness, <hi>hiding the Law in our hearts, continually meditating</hi> upon it; furnishing our minds with right principles, <hi>that 'tis better to suffer than to sin, to have a good conscience than a great estate</hi>; that these <hi>things which are seen are but temporal, Scenes and pageantry,</hi> false pleasures and <hi>but for a season, but the things which are not seen are eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly. 1. The <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> with good company: <hi>He that walks with the wise shall be wise,</hi> Prov. 13.20. 2. <hi>Humility,</hi> which is a grace that will render a man teachable: <hi>The meek will he guide in judgment and teach his way.</hi> 3. <hi>Praying</hi> for it: <hi>If any man lack wisdom, let him ask it of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.31.</note> 
               <hi>Iames</hi> 1.5. 'Tis he that <hi>gives
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55636:133"/>
wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding.</hi> And therefore to him it is that we must apply our selves for wise and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hearts, beseeching him that he would first direct us by his counsel, assist us by his grace, and then bring us to glory.</p>

            <p>THIS Book of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> is a Miscellany of Sentences, full of various and profound wisdom, both with regard to things <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>sacred.</hi> It concerns all kind of matters, the customs, vices, humours of men; the duties and business of life; the government and events of providence. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal rules and observations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these, are here set down in plain and pithy Sentences: And though some of them may at first glance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps seem to be but obvious and flat, yet upon a nearer and more considerate

               </gap>, <hi>ruling speeches,</hi> such as are fit to have a special authority over a man, in the guidance of his affairs.</p>
            <p>The Text concerns that great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or prejudice which will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon the choice of those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions with whom we do most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly converse.</p>
            <p>Society is in it self so necessary to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, that the Philosopher doth from thence define a Man to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a sociable creature</hi>; as if this were one main property and end of humane nature. <hi>Quaecunque vaga nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur &amp; actura vitam segregem,</hi>

               <hi>armata sunt, hominem imbecillitas cingit,</hi> saith the <hi>Stoick.

            </p>
            <p>But now because the chief bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of this is not always to be attained in a common relation to a publick Body, without the more private and intimate league of friendship; <hi>a crowd
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55636:135"/>
is not company; magna civitas</hi> may be <hi>magna solitudo,</hi> therefore the want of friends may in some sense be called <hi>solitude,</hi> and so disadvantageous to the well-being and comfort of life, <hi>ut solem è mundo videantur tollere, qui amicitiam de vita humana,</hi> (as the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator speaks) that <hi>we had as good lose the sun out of the firmament,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>as friendship from amongst men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath been observed, that the wisest and greatest Monarchs that ever were, in the midst of all their other enjoyments, could not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves happy without this. And though the distance of their condition, might seem to debar them from this privilege, which requires an equal; yet rather than want a friend, they have descended to some of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, making them to be <hi>participes curarum,</hi> though not without great inconveniences and hazards from the people. Such a high rate have they put upon this privilege of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of innocence, could not be happy, though in <hi>Paradise,</hi> without a companion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:55636:136"/>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, who for our sakes was content to forgoe the usual pleasures and contentments of life, yet would not be without this necessary refreshment of an intimate friend, but rather chose to admit one of his servants unto this near relation, <hi>the disciple whom he loved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Wiseman</hi> having observed this great necessity of friendship and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and of what high importance it is to be right in the choice of them, he doth in this Book scatter up and down diverse Proverbial sayings for our direction about it. Amongst these the <hi>Text</hi> is one.</p>
            <p>For the manner of it, 'tis put by way of <hi>Antithesis</hi> or opposition, betwixt <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> company, under the name of <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>foolish</hi>; together with the several consequences which will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon such conversation. The one shall grow <hi>wise,</hi> the other <hi>shall be destroyed</hi>; wherein there is implyed a double issue or event, that being twice to be understood which is but once spoken; it being all one as if he should have said, <hi>he that walketh with the wise shall be wise and prosperous, but a companion of fools shall be foolish and miserable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:55636:136"/>The <hi>Terms</hi> have little of difficulty in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that walketh.</hi> By <hi>walking with</hi> or being a companion, is not meant every casual commerce or negotiation with others: For he that in this sense would wholly avoid wicked men, <hi>must</hi> needs <hi>go out of the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.10. But those phrases do signifie a more familiar and intimate converse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With the wise.</hi> All mankind is in the usual Scripture phrase, especially in the Writings of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> distributed under these two heads of <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>foolish,</hi> that is good or bad: Wisdom being that which enables a man to make choice of the right means for the attaining of the right end, and only those that are religious being enabled for this, in reference to the chief end of a mans eternal happiness, therefore they alone are said to be wise. <hi>A companion of fools shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Word translated <hi>destroyed,</hi> is derivable either from one root which signifies to <hi>grow worse,</hi> or else from another which signifies to be <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>ruined</hi>; and is fitly chosen out to comprehend both senses. Besides that it has an
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55636:137"/>
elegant allusion by way of <hi>Paranomasiae</hi> unto the former word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</p>
            <p>The chief scope of the <hi>Text</hi> may be summed up in this <hi>Observation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That every mans present and future well-fare, doth very much depend upon the right choice and improvement of those friends or companions with whom he doth most familiarly converse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If with such as are good, he shall be wise and happy; if with wicked persons he shall prove foolish for the present, and miserable for the future.</p>
            <p>So that the subject I am to treat of is very proper and sutable to this Place, which being chiefly intended for education, unto which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and friends that men make choice of doth so much contribute; therefore it can never be unseasonable here to put them in remembrance, or to stir them up to their duties in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
            <p>For the clearing of this <hi>Observation,</hi> it may be made very evident from diverse Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:55636:137"/>Upon this account it is, that we have such frequent cautions and threats against conversing with bad company. This was the meaning of all those severe prohibitions in the ceremonial Law, against <hi>touching of any unclean thing</hi>; which in the morality of it (say the Antient <hi>Fathers</hi> and other <hi>Interpreters</hi>) doth signifie that exact care which we ought to have against all such company whereby we may contract any inward pollutions.</p>
            <p>'Tis observable, that he who touched a dead beast was unclean but <hi>till the evening, Levit.</hi> 11.24. But he who touched a dead man was unclean <hi>for seven days, Numb.</hi> 19.11. signifying a bad man to be the most dangerous of all other Creatures. For that this in scripture-phrase is meant by <hi>a dead man,</hi> may be sufficiently explained by that expression of the <hi>Apostle</hi> where he styles wicked men to be such as are <hi>dead in trespasses and sins,</hi> Ephes. 2.1. <hi>even whilst they live,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. And elsewhere they are said to be <hi>whited sepulchers,</hi> which may appear beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful outwardly, but <hi>within are full of dead mens bones and all uncleanness,</hi> Matth. 23.27.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:55636:138"/>That's a very sharp and elegant reprehension which the Prophet uses towards <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> in reference to his association with <hi>Ahab,</hi> 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 19.2. <hi>Should'st thou love them that hate the Lord?</hi> He puts it by way of question, to shew the inexcusable inconsistency of those mens actions who pretend to love God and yet will be friends to those that hate him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.24. <hi>Make no friendship with an angry man, and with a furious man thou shalt not go, least thou learn his ways.</hi> And because some might be apt to think that they could converse with bad men without any such danger, therefore 'tis further added, <hi>lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.</hi> Implying, that though a man be very wary to avoid the corruption of bad company yet it may insensibly steal upon him and surprize him as a <hi>snare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are divers the like Precepts in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. The Apostle having recited a long Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of vitious persons, <hi>despisers of those that are good, heady, highminded, having a form,</hi> &amp;c. adds this clause at the end of it, <hi>from such turn away</hi>;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55636:138"/>
that is, avoid as much as may be all converse with them. And there is a solemn adjuration, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Now we command you Brethren, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that you will draw your selves from every brother that walketh disorderly.</hi> That place doth not so properly signifie exclusion <hi>à sacris,</hi> but from familiar converse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.4. 'Tis set down as a special mark and evidence of such as shall be saved, <hi>in whose eyes a vile person is contemned, but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And holy <hi>David</hi> is very frequent in the proof of his integrity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently of his happy condition from this sign, by his dislike of wicked company, and his love to those that are good.</p>
            <p>Psal. 26.4, 5. <hi>I have not sate with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. I have hated the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evil doers, and will not sit with the wicked,</hi> Psal. 101.4. <hi>I will not know a wicked person,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour will I cut off; him that hath a high look and proud heart will I not suffer,</hi> Psal. 139.21. <hi>Do not I hate them O Lord that hate thee? and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55636:139"/>
am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred and count them mine enemies. Psal.</hi> 120.5. He bemoans his unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that he was forced <hi>to dwell in Meshec,</hi> and to have <hi>his habitation in the tents of Kedar,</hi> that is, amongst such ungodly and cruel men as those of that Country.</p>
            <p>And so on the other side, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses that his <hi>delight was in the saints and to the excellent of the earth,</hi> Psal. 16.3. <hi>Mine eye shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me,</hi> Psal. 101.6. <hi>I am a companion for all those that fear thee and keep thy precepts, Psal.</hi> 119.63. It were easy to cite abundance of other <hi>Scriptures</hi> to this purpose.</p>
            <p>And there is very good <hi>reason,</hi> why the nature of a mans friends or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany should be looked upon as of such great consequence to his well-being: Because they have such a special influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not only upon a mans temper and manners, but upon all his chief concernments.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>four</hi> things wherein most men place their well-fare, some or all of which every rational man doth
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55636:139"/>
propose to himself in the choice of his friends. These are <hi>reputation, safety, comfort, profit.</hi> Now each of these is only attainable by conversing with those that are good.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>reputation</hi> or honour: Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are <hi>fools</hi> in the phrase of the <hi>Text</hi>; and what credit can a wise man expect by conversing with fools? They are styled <hi>beasts</hi> in Scripture, <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>swine</hi> and <hi>vipers</hi>; And 'tis the lowest most ignoble condition that our humane natures can be deprest to with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to converse with <hi>beasts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.32.</note> 
               <hi>Iob</hi> doth make it his great grief and complaint, <hi>I am a brother to dragons and a companion to estriches, Iob</hi> 30.29. They are <hi>dead men</hi> in the Scripture phrase,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 24.5</note> and <hi>what should the living do amongst the dead:</hi> They are <hi>whited sepulchers that are full of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness,</hi> and none but a <hi>mad man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.27.</note> one that is possest with a Devil, <hi>will live among tombs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other side, good men are the <hi>excellent of the earth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 163.</note> Such alone are truly noble and magnanimous, though not in outward respects, yet in regard of intrinsecal value, which can only put a true worth upon a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55636:140"/>
man: So <hi>the righteous is always more excellent than his neighbour. Iob</hi> upon the dunghill, and <hi>Ieremiah</hi> in the mire, had more real worth in them, than any of the greatest men of the world in the midst of all their pomp and glory. The Saints of old when in their most despicable condition, <hi>wandring about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented,</hi> were in themselves of so noble and inestimable a value that, in the judgment of the holy Ghost, <hi>the world was not worthy of them.</hi> These are they that have the highest relations, they are the <hi>children of God, heirs of a kingdom,</hi> the <hi>spouse,</hi> the <hi>members</hi> of Christ: And therefore who ever would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to himself honour and reputation in his society, must make choice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of such companions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For <hi>safety</hi>; The <hi>Text</hi> tells us that <hi>a companion of fools shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</hi> Good men may be sometimes involved in the punishments of bad company, and perish in their sins: <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Come out of her my people, least you receive of her plagues.</hi> That's a known story of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who durst not stay in the same Bath where
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55636:140"/>
               <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Heretick was for fear he might be surprized with some sudden judgment. Wicked men are infected leprous persons; and who can converse with such without danger. If any one shall persuade himself that he can enjoy their company and yet escape their contagion, he may as well think to suspend the natural o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of fire; <hi>Can any one think to take coals in his bosom and not be burned? Or can a man walk barefoot upon burning coals and yet not hurt himself?</hi> Prov. 6.28. The conversing with bad company hath as unavoidable and powerful an efficacy as these natural agents which work necessarily, whose operations cannot be suspended: Or if any should possibly so far escape as not to be <hi>burnt with the fire</hi> of bad company, yet he must needs be <hi>blacked with their smoak,</hi> which every prudent Christian will be careful to avoid.</p>
            <p>Whereas on the other side every one fares the better for the company of those that are good. They are the <hi>lights of the world, the salt of the earth, the pillars of a nation,</hi> those that <hi>stand in the gap</hi> to prevent an inundation of judgment. The place
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55636:141"/>
is the safer for them where they live. <hi>Ten righteous persons</hi> may sometimes be enough to save a whole City from temporal ruine. <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s house was blessed for <hi>Iosephs</hi> sake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.5. and all the passengers in the ship were saved from drowning for St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s sake, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.24. And if their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation or common neighbourhood may be so advantageous, what is it then to be leagued unto them by a nearer and more intimate tye of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For <hi>comfort:</hi> This is one of the principal ends of friendship, to ease and refresh a man amidst the anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life; and there is nothing of greater efficacy to this purpose.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 133.1.</note> 
               <hi>How pleasant is it for brethren to live together in unity:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seneca de Tranq. c.</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>Quantum bonum est ubi sunt praeparata pectora, in quae tutò secretum omne descendat, quorum sermo solicitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines leniat, sententia consilium expediat, hilaritas tristitiam dissipet, conspectus ipse delectet?</hi> What a great comfort and privilege is it to have another self to whom a man may freely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate all his secret troubles; whose conference may help to asswage our cares, whose counsel to expedite our
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55636:141"/>
difficulties, whose cheerfulness to dissipate our sadness, whose very look and presenee doth delight? As <hi>Oyntment and perfumes rejoyce the heart, so doth the sweetness of a mans friend,</hi> Prov. 27.9.</p>
            <p>But now this cannot be expected from any wicked person. There is such an utter inconsistency and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition betwixt good and bad, that there cannot be any communion or harmony betwixt them: For <hi>what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion hath light with darkness,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.14. Speaking of those who are unequally yoaked; <hi>An unjust man is an abomination to the just, and he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked,</hi> Prov. 29.27: There is a natural enmity betwixt them, being of opposite principles and ways.</p>
            <p>How is it possible for a man that hath any love or zeal for God to delight in those by whom He is continually dishonoured and provoked? Instead of any refreshment by such company (if a man have <hi>David</hi>'s temper) it will still administer new occasion of trouble and sorrow. <hi>I beheld the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors and was grieved.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.136, 158.</note> 
               <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because men
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:55636:142"/>
keep not thy laws.</hi> No man can delight in those that despise and reproach him. Why now a holy man looks upon all rebellions against God, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities against himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.9. <hi>The reproaches of them that reproached thee, are fallen upon me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas on the other side: Those that are <hi>wise</hi> in the phrase of the Text are the most delightful company that are. <hi>Wisdom makes a mans face to shine,</hi> puts a splendor and amiableness upon a person: And for this reason, the communion of saints is to be esteemed, one of the greatest comforts and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges that we are capable of in this world. 'Tis a kind of <hi>excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be debarred of such company; and it shall be a great part of our joy and happiness in heaven that we shall there converse with the <hi>spirits of just men made perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And lastly, for <hi>Profit:</hi> The most usual reason of mens friendship in the world, is the hopes they have of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by one another: though this in it self is mercenary and poor, <hi>arva enim &amp; pecudes isto modo diliguntur, Men love their cattel and their land upon this account,</hi> they should love their friends from an
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55636:142"/>
higher principle. But yet, if any should look for this, 'tis not to be had from those that are bad: There is nothing to be expected from such friends, but the increase of our sins and of our punishments:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Micah</hi> 7.4.</note> 
               <hi>The best of them is a briar and a thorn,</hi> which may pull off our fleece, deprive us of our defence and our innocence; take from us what we have, but can contribute nothing: Or if we should get some outward advantage by them, yet we shall get partnership in their guilt, by that approbation which we seem to give to them in our conversing with them. We may harden them in their impenitency, blemish our profession; and what outward gain can be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient compensation for such da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages?</p>
            <p>Whereas in conversing with those that are good, there are these advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. 1. Their example will by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees insinuate into the mind, and obtain the force of precepts, exciting us to a holy emulation. 2. Their very presence will affect us with some kind of awe against evil.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sen. Ep</hi> 94</note> 
               <hi>Est aliquid quod ex magno viro vel tacente proficias.</hi> 3. Their conference, wholesome and savory,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55636:143"/>
               <hi>administring grace to the hearers.</hi> 4. Their counsel, faithful and wise and hearty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Their prayers, powerful, ready: And 'tis not easily imaginable, what an advantage that is, to have a praying friend, or companion. We esteem it a great privilege to have a friend at Court, who is able to further us in our business and petitions, to have any spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial interest in a favorite; why, every good man hath <hi>power with God,</hi> and can prevail with him.</p>
            <p>But I have stayed too long in the Doctrinal parts of this Discourse.</p>
            <p>There are three lessons I would brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insist upon in the <hi>Application</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we would take notice of the great benefit to be obtained by the right improvement of society and mutual converse with one another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we of this place would be careful, both for our selves and those committed to our charge, in the right choice of our friends and company.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That we would labour for those proper qualifications and abilities which may render us acceptable and useful in our conversing with others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>first,</hi> that we would take notice of the great benefit to be obtain'd
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55636:143"/>
by Society. One chief reason why in these Places men do not make so great a progress either in piety or learning as might be expected from those special advantages which here we enjoy, is because they are not so careful to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the benefit to be had by society. Nothing more usual amongst men of all ranks and conditions, than to joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in some common design for the improvement of this quality of soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness unto mutual benefit. This is the chief ground of all those common Associations amongst men: In ordinary affairs, <hi>Corporations</hi> for Cities, <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> for Trades; and so in higher matters, <hi>Universities</hi> and <hi>Colleges</hi> for Learning, particular Churches for Religion: Each of which in their kinds have in them a natural aptitude to afford some special help for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of their several ends, though perhaps none of them, especially not the <hi>two</hi> last, are usually improved to the utmost benefit they are capable of. 'Tis not easie to express what great advantage might be obtained if men would but study to make the right use of mutual converse. We may see daily, especially by late experience, how
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55636:144"/>
men of common and low breeding, being called out to such imployments, wherein they have been necessitated to put forth themselves in a more than ordinary way of conversing together and debating of businesses with one another, how strangely their parts are heightned, how judicious and nimble they grow at business, how ready at discourse; whereas a Bookish man, that spends the greatest part of his time in reading and study, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he doth not know more, or if he should, yet is he less fit for those actions and businesses to which his knowledge should be applyed. And therefore the great and active men of the world have still looked upon knowledge thus acquired as <hi>Pedantry,</hi> which rendred a man unfit for any great imployment. And this is one reason of those prejudices which by some men have been lately taken up against these Places of learning; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they see some others that have been bred up in another way to be as knowing and as useful men, as those that come from hence; though such perhaps, besides the eminency of their natural abilities, have had some other
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55636:144"/>
special advantages in their educations, some way aquivalent to what is to be had in these Places, which ought to be considered and allowed for; yet it cannot be denied, but that we our selves may give too much occasion to such prejudices, by not improving all the helps we have to the best pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
            <p>I cannot stand to mention how much men might by this means promote their knowledge in the whole Circle of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning; particularly in that ability of a ready, voluble, popular Rhetorick (wherein studious and retired men are commonly defective) though it be so necessary in all kind of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, especially for the gifts of Prayer and Preaching.</p>
            <p>But chiefly in matter of practical Religion, which would be much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged if men were but more free towards one another in communicating their doubts, temptations, comforts; warming their affections and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up one another by mutual confe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we of this Place would be very wary and careful both for our selves and those committed to our
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55636:145"/>
charge, in the right choice of our friends and company.</p>
            <p>There is nothing usually hath a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter influence upon a mans temper and carriage than the company with whom he doth converse. And hence is it that if good and bad be joyned together in any near society, they either quickly part or become alike. And 'tis the infirmity of our natures, that grace in the best men is so imperfect, and sin so powerful, that in the conjunction of good and evil, the good by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural course are more easily corrupted than the evil rectified.</p>
            <p>We all know that it hath been the bane of many young men sent hither for education to mistake in the first choice of their company: And 'twere well if some publick brand could be set upon such loose flagitious persons, as make it their business to seduce and corrupt others. A <hi>Leper</hi> under the law was the type of a sinner; and he was to go with his head uncovered that others might know and avoid him. These close and covered sinners are very dangerous, and may do much hurt by their infection; there is scarce any such to be conversed with, <hi>Qui
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55636:145"/>
non aliquod nobis vitium, aut commendat, aut imprimit, aut nescientibus allinit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, a man may make good use of the worst company, by observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deformity and hating the evil of them the more; but yet there is this danger in the frequent converse with such, that the edge of our zeal and hate should be somewhat abated by custom. He that with <hi>Lot vexeth his soul with the wicked conversation</hi> of those amongst whom he lives, may in time be less and less vexed according as they grow more familiar to him. Besides, conversing with such will be a means to make a man satisfie himself with any low or weak degrees of goodness (which perhaps in comparison to his company may be considerable;) whereas amongst those that are better, we have still new matter of imitation and provocation. 'Tis a good rule of a heathen, <hi>Cum his conversare, qui te meliorem facturi sunt; illos admitte,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sen. Ep.</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>quos tu potes facere meliores. Chuse those for your intimates, by whom you may be made better your selves, admit such; of whom you have any probable hopes that they may be made better by you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:55636:146"/>Nothing is more incongruous and unsuitable than for a man that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends love to religion, to delight in those that care not for it. Such persons are of opposite relations and principles. Every good man is <hi>on the Lords side,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.26.</note> 
               <hi>the friend of God,</hi> and consequently is bound <hi>to hate that which is evil.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.15</note> Wicked men are his enemies,<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 19.6.</note> Wicked men walk contrary unto him, and turn their backs upon him; And therefore such are by no means fit to associate withall.</p>
            <p>On the other side; Good men are all of a City, <hi>fellow Citizens with the Saints</hi>; all of a family,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10.</note> 
               <hi>of the houshold of faith</hi>; all of a body,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.16.</note> 
               <hi>a body fitly joyned together and compact, by that which every joynt supplieth.</hi> God delights in them, tho he inhabit eternity, and dwells in that high and lofty place, yet he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to those of humble and contrite spirits.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5 <hi>Ierem.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.3.</note> They are styled <hi>his portion, his inheritance; a peculiar treasure unto him; the dearly beloved of his soul: he sets apart the man that is godly for himself.</hi> They that do not love such company here,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55636:146"/>
have little reason to expect that they shall enjoy communion with them hereafter.</p>
            <p>A man may examin the choice of his friends by this Rule: Suppose he were in some great exigence, wherein there were no help to be expected but from heaven, can he then with any confidence send to his usual compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to relieve him with their prayers? It may be he could heretofore freely discourse and jest with them, but are they fit to pray for him; If not, this may convince his conscience that he had made a bad choice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That we would labour for those special qualifications and abilities which may render us acceptable and useful in our conversing with others.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>four</hi> conditions, amongst many others, that are more especially suitable to this purpose.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A readiness to communicate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the gifts we have received, so ministring the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10</note> There is much envy and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowness of spirit in that close reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved humour which some men have; who confine all their gifts to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55636:147"/>
as if they should lose their own knowledge by communicating of it. Such men live to themselves, as if they were not members of a body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Humility.</hi> That's a sociable grace, lovely in it self and acceptable to all: It fits a man both to learn and to teach; such an one will not contend, censure, disdain, but is kindly affectioned to others, esteeming better of them, than of himself.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Prudence,</hi> in distinguishing of mens tempers, prejudices, infirmities; in discerning of the right seasons and advantages to do good amongst them: Teaching a man such an amiable and alluring facility, whereby he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate into the affections of others, and the more easily provoke them to love and good works.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> and <hi>Candor of disposition,</hi> in owning of our own weaknesses or faults, anothers gifts or preheminences. A sobriety and calmness of spirit, in suspending rash censures, bitter expressions, or whatever may exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; <hi>Forbearing one another in love.</hi> There is in some good men such a sower and riged severity, such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to censure, as makes them less
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:55636:147"/>
acceptable and useful in their society, and deprives them of many opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doing good to others.</p>
            <p>I can but name these particulars; each of them would deserve to be more largely insisted upon, as being so very suitable and necessary for us of this place. But <hi>I speak to wise men,</hi> and am loath any further to trespass upon your patience: So then the substance of what been said is this, that society being so necessary to humane nature, and the advantage or prejudice so very great as to our well or ill being, according to our choice of such friends with whom we do most famillarly converse, Therefore will it concern men to be very cautious and wary in this matter.</p>
            <p>And if they would render themselves useful and acceptable to others, it must be by being wise and virtuous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious persons. Those only who are good in themselves being capable of doing good to others.</p>

            <p>In the eighth <hi>verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> the <hi>Wiseman</hi> enters upon a description of the miseries of a covetous life, which he sets forth under these three conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. 1. His <hi>drudgery</hi> and excessive toyl, because <hi>three is no end of his labour; neither is his eyes satisfied with riches.</hi> A very proper expression that, concerning <hi>satisfying the eye</hi>; that being the only enjoyment that a <hi>miser</hi> hath of his estate,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:55636:149"/>
namely, that he can look upon it as his own; and no wonder if his labour be endless, if he must still drudge on till he have got enough to <hi>satisfie his eye.</hi> 2. His <hi>inconsiderateness,</hi> in that he doth <hi>bereave his soul of good,</hi> that is, deprive himself of the benefit which he might have in a cheerful fruition of his possessions; and yet he asks not <hi>for whom do I labour,</hi> that is, he doth not dispose them to any end; he neither uses them himself while he lives, nor knows who shall enjoy them when he dies. 3. <hi>His solitariness: There is one alone, there is not a second, yea, he hath neither child nor brother</hi>; that is, he is a forlorn friendless man, without the benefit and help of society. Which kind of misery the <hi>Wiseman</hi> takes pains to set forth, by commending the contrary, shewing the advantage and convenience of a soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life; which is first <hi>generally</hi> asserted in the words of the <hi>Text, Two are better than one</hi>: Then <hi>particularly</hi> illustrated by some common instances; to shew the advantage of society, both to the attaining of good, and the preventing and avoiding of evil. There is in such a condition, <hi>mutual gain</hi>; men rid more work when joyned in society, and so
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:55636:149"/>
increase their reward, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>mutual help</hi> in their <hi>infirmities, lifting one another when they fall,</hi> v. 10. In their <hi>defects</hi> and <hi>wants,</hi> warning one another, <hi>v.</hi> 11, in their <hi>dangers,</hi> in respect of enemies, whom an united strength may more effectually withstand, <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>The words of the <hi>Text</hi> are for the <hi>scope</hi> and <hi>matter</hi> intended to assert the advantages of friendship and a sociable life. For the <hi>manner</hi> of them, they are in figurative expressions; the force of which I shall endeavour to explain both <hi>Negatively,</hi> and <hi>Positively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively:</hi> 1. By <hi>two</hi> is not meant any kind of multitude; there may be too much of this, as well as too little. No where is there less en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a mans self than when a man is oppressed with clients and visitants.</p>
            <p>And according to this construction the Words should be inverted; and we might truly say <hi>One</hi> were better than <hi>Two,</hi> retiredness than multitude. Again, by <hi>Two</hi> is not meant any kind of society or friends: Not companions in iniquity, as were <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> this is rather a <hi>conspiracy</hi> than a <hi>company</hi>; and though such do <hi>associate themselves, yet they shall be broken in pieces, Isai,</hi> 8.9. <hi>Though they
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:55636:150"/>
joyn hand in hand, yet they shall not go unpunished, Prov.</hi> 11.21. 2. By <hi>One</hi> is not meant any kind of solitude or privacy; not such as is opposed to that hurry of business which men in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick imployments are exposed unto: Those continual bustles and imbroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby a man is hindred from retiring into or being acquainted with himself. For according to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, the words should be inverted, and we might say <hi>One</hi> were better than <hi>Two,</hi> privacy and retirement than multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and tumult: Again by <hi>One</hi> here, we are not to understand <hi>unity,</hi> and by <hi>Two division,</hi> as those expressions do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times signifie:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 7.26.</note> For <hi>unity</hi> is much better than <hi>division</hi>; upon which account the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philosophers, amongst their other mystical traditions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing numbers, were wont to set a note of infamy upon the number <hi>Two,</hi> because it was the <hi>first departure from unity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Positively:</hi> 1. By <hi>Two</hi> is meant such as have the mutual help and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of one another, being linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the bonds of friendship; among whom those are especially to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended who are joyned by that nearer and more sacred union of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:55636:150"/>
2. By <hi>One</hi> is meant such an one as lives in a forlorn desolate condition, neither loving any, nor being loved by any but himself; without the privilege of a friend to assist his labours, settle his fears, ease his griefs, and augment his comforts: So that the true meaning of the words may be comprehended in this <hi>Proposition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the sociable life of a friend is much more advantageous than to live alone.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prop.</hi>
               </note> 'Tis a principle this, that hath so clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for it in the very light of nature, that it might be needless to urge for it any Scripture authority.</p>
            <p>'Tis upon this ground that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher doth describe a man to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>sociable creature,</hi> as if this did belong to the essence, and were one of the properties of humane nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> himself in the state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence could not be happy (though in Paradise) without a companion. Not to mention any thing of that tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous mystery of the <hi>Trinity</hi> of Persons in the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Godhead.</p>
            <p>As for that imaginary <hi>Wiseman</hi> of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> whom they suppose to be clapt up in some dark dungeon, lost in some desolate Island, yet then he shall enjoy
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55636:151"/>
such a kind of happiness as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self would do if the world were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, <hi>acquiescit sibi, cogitationibus suis traditus — in se reconditur, secum est:</hi> Besides, that this is but boasting, and an imaginary <hi>Idea</hi> of such a state of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as no man perhaps ever did, or shall attain unto. They themselves do likewise acknowledge that though their <hi>Wiseman</hi> be <hi>seipso contentus,</hi> yet <hi>mavult amicum. Though he may make some shift without a friend, yet he had much rather have one</hi>; and therefore blame such, <hi>qui sapientem intra cutem suam cogunt,</hi> who would deny him this privilege and confine him to himself.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>three</hi> things of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to the comfort and safety of life. 1. <hi>The rectifying of our judgments.</hi> 2. <hi>The regulating and composing of our passions.</hi> 3. <hi>The assistance of our labours.</hi> Now the sociable life of a friend will be very advantageous in all these respects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>the rectifying of our judgments;</hi> that we may have a true notion of things and business, and be able to judge what is most fit and expedient in several cases and circumstances. There are two general defects which the understandings of men are liable unto, <hi>Confusion</hi> and <hi>Error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:55636:151"/>1. <hi>Confusion</hi>; when our minds are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with tumultuous thoughts for want of being methodized and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested by the relation of them. A man will be apt to run away with vain <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera</hi>'s, with weak and flat projects, whilst they remain meerly in specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and in thoughts; whereas when they are put into words in our relation of them to others, the weakness and defects of them will presently appear.</p>
            <p>So that a man had better (saith a <hi>Noble Author</hi>) discourse <hi>to a statue or picture than suffer his thoughts to pass in a smother.</hi> So that herein lies one spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial advantage of friendship, that a man hath the liberty of communicating his secret thoughts, and thereby clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up to himself.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath hereby likewise the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of faithful counsel to direct him against the <hi>error</hi> of his thoughts. 'Tis an usual Saying, <hi>plus vident oculi quàm oculus; two eyes see more than one:</hi> And <hi>a stander by</hi> many times discerns that which a better <hi>gamester</hi> overlooks. Men are usually very partial in judging of things wherein they are concerned, according to their inclinations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests; apt to gloss them over with
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55636:152"/>
such appearances as may best sute with their own advantage; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in such cases they have need of the help of others. No wiseman will in a business of moment trust to the advice of a flatterer, because such an one will be sure to tell him what will please rather than what will profit; why, for the same reason neither should he trust to himself in such cases, for <hi>Maximus quisque adulator sibi, every man naturally is his own greatest flatterer:</hi> Nor will a Stranger be fit for this work of counsel, because such an one may not know the whole state of our businesses, the <hi>series</hi> and circumstances of our affairs: Or if he do, yet we can have no security of such an ones faithfulness, but that he may be apt to warp and bend his counsels for his own private ends. 'Tis true indeed, Books will give impartial counsel, without flattery or self-seeking: But there may be these inconveniences in such counsel; that 'tis not like to be so suitable to our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occasions, in all the various cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of them; nor so lively and efficacious as to the operation of it. And though good Books may in some sense be said to be good friends and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:55636:152"/>
councellors, yet they are dead ones; whereas the advice of a faithful friend hath in it a remedy against all these inconveniences; Such an one will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flatter us nor serve his own ends; His wisdom and fidelity will be ready <hi>to help us up when we fall,</hi> v. 10. and to <hi>warm</hi> us with vigor when we are slack and remiss, <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence likewise in the <hi>second</hi> place may we expect the best help <hi>for the regulating and composing of our passions.</hi> That which for the most part proves the greatest disturbance to the peace and quiet of our lives is from the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and vicissitudes of our passions, whereby the mind is kept continually out of frame. What betwixt the frenzy of anger, the ague of hopes and fears, the feaver of love, the consumption of envy, our minds are kept in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual disease and distemper. So that whatever will conduce to the preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these in a composedness and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, must needs be of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to our well-fare: And the society of a friend may be very proper and effectual to this purpose; not only for the liberty we have hereby of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out our secret troubles, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:55636:153"/>
that inward restraint and suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby they would be multiplied, and by his counsel (which I mentioned before;) but upon this account likewise, that such an one will help to bear a part with us, and so lighten us of our burden by his compassion, and so the less will come to our shares.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Passions</hi> may be distinguished into <hi>two</hi> kinds; such as are more <hi>violent,</hi> troublesome and unnatural, referring to <hi>evil</hi>; as <hi>Anger, Fear, Grief,</hi> &amp;c. Others more <hi>kindly</hi> and natural, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to that which is <hi>good,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have a greater agreeableness to our desires; as <hi>Love, Hope, Ioy,</hi> &amp;c. Now the <hi>first</hi> of these are by the help of a friend abated and weakened, the <hi>other</hi> strengthened and confirmed, and <hi>both</hi> ways our quiet much promoted. And the reason of this difference is founded in nature: <hi>Union strengthens any thing that is natural, and weakens all violent impressions.</hi> That which adds to the vigor of any living Creature, doth both fit it for its natural operations, and likewise to repel any praeternatural injury or violence. Thus likewise is it in those things which concern the mind; the union of a friend doth help
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55636:153"/>
to strengthen us in matters agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our natures, and to weaken those which are repugnant. We <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide</hi> to a friend our griefs, and so <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish</hi> them; we <hi>communicate</hi> our joys, and so <hi>increase</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The sociable life of a friend is likewise advantageous to us, <hi>for the assistance of us in our labours</hi>; in respect of those many hazards and difficulties we shall meet with in our several im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; we may by this help be carried on, 1. With greater <hi>safety and confidence.</hi> 2. With greater <hi>cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and vigor.</hi> 3. With greater <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess and advantage</hi>; and that both in <hi>secular</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> affairs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With greater <hi>safety and confidence:</hi> Which the <hi>Wiseman</hi> doth take particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice of in this place, under a <hi>twofold</hi> instance. 1. Of <hi>two travailing together,</hi> and <hi>if one of them fall the other will lift him up; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him,</hi> that is, if there be any evil which befalls a solitary help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less person, he may irrecoverably sink under it, whereas another man will find support and relief from the help of a friend. 2. Of <hi>two contending together</hi>;
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55636:154"/>
that opposition which may be too strong for one, may be withstood and overcome by two. Which was the consideration wherewith <hi>Ioab</hi> and his Brother <hi>Abishai</hi> did encourage one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.11. <hi>If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me, but if the Ammonites be too strong for thee, then will I come and help thee.</hi> Whereas those that live without this mutual entercourse of friendly officers, must be singly exposed to all kind of hazards. The strongest guards are but weak protections, in comparison to love and friendship: <hi>Ab ipsis armis inter arma periculum est.</hi> Those very arms which should defend us and be for our safety, may be turned against us and prove our ruine.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Non sic excubiae, nec circumstantia tela,</l>
               <l>Quàm tutatur amor — <hi>saith</hi> Claudian.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And 'tis true this, in respect of <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> affairs as well as <hi>civil</hi>; we may proceed in our duties with greater safety upon this account. Solitariness is a time of advantage for <hi>Satans</hi> temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. He set upon <hi>Eve</hi> when alone, and our <hi>Saviour</hi> when in the desart:
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55636:154"/>
This tempts the tempter; <hi>Omnia nobis mala solitudo persuadet,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca:</hi> Nothing so mischievous but this may be a temptation unto: 'Tis an old say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he that gives himself up to solitude, must be <hi>aut Deus aut Daemon,</hi> either he must have a self-sufficiency as <hi>God,</hi> or else <hi>Sathan</hi> will make him as bad as himself. We are dependant creatures, and shall always in this world stand in need of mutual help from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This will help to carry us on with <hi>greater cheerfulness, and vivacity in our business.</hi> Society and mutual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, will deceive the tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our labour, and cheer us up against all the troubles and oppositions we meet with. 'Tis one of the main ends of friendship, this, to stand by and comfort a man when he is in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress: 'Twas the custom of ancient times, for friends to meet together for this very purpose; which was the occasion of the visit which <hi>Iob</hi>'s friends made to him, in the time of his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: <hi>A friend is made for adversity,</hi> saith the <hi>Wiseman.</hi> 'Tis no difficult matter for a man to be full of zeal and affection, whilst all things are well,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55636:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and prosperous, and there is no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the contrary: but,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <note place="margin">Ovid de Trist. lib. <hi>5.</hi> el. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note>Cùm Deus intonuit, non se subducere nimbo,</l>
                  <l>Id demùm est pietas, id socialis amor.</l>
               </q>
We are to expect from others, who do not stand in the relation of friends, that they should not own us in our troubles, but estrange themselves from us, lest they likewise should partake of our misery: Like an herd of Deer, who will push away any of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that is wounded. But he that is a real friend, will then take occasion to manifest his fidelity: Upon which account it is that the privilege of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath been always esteemed one of the greatest comforts of life. <hi>How pleasant is it for brethren to live together in unity,</hi> Psal. 133.1. As <hi>Oyntment and perfumes rejoyce the heart, so doth the sweetness of a mans friend,</hi> Prov. 27.9. And for the same reason is it, that the loss of such Relations, is to be esteemed as one of the greatest afflictions that we are capable of; losing a part of our selves, which cannot be without much pain and grief. Which made <hi>David</hi> so bemoan the death of his
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:55636:155"/>
friend <hi>Ionathan</hi> in those pathetical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: <hi>I am distressed for thee my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Jonathan, <hi>very pleasant hast thou been unto me, thy love to me was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, passing the love of Women,</hi> 2 Sam. 1.26.</p>
            <p>'Tis so likewise as to our spiritual conditions, the society of Christian friends being one main branch of the <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi> Which is, next to the favour of God and the comfort of a good conscience, the greatest privilege we enjoy on this side of heaven. Besides their good examples we have likewise their counsel and their comforts to direct and support us in the performances of our duty: And this is the work of an <hi>Angel,</hi> nay of <hi>God himself,</hi> the Son being styled the <hi>Counsellor, Isai</hi> 9.6. And the holy Ghost the <hi>Comforter:</hi> So that by this means, one friend may be as an <hi>Angel, nay as God to another.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self though he were all-sufficient, yet when he was in his agonie, thought fit to make use of the comfort of an Angel. And as for the power of such to excite us unto duty,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43.</note> the <hi>Wiseman</hi> hath well expressed it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.17. <hi>As Iron sharpens Iron, so doth a man his friend:</hi> Upon which account the <hi>Apostle</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:55636:156"/>
exhorts <hi>to consider one another, to provoke unto love and good works, exhorting one another,</hi> Heb. 10.24, 25.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This will much <hi>promote the success of our labours,</hi> and procure for us a better reward, in the <hi>verse</hi> of the Text. When several heads and hands joyn together in mutual fellowship, their affairs are managed with greater wisdom, and end with better success: <hi>Vis unita for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior.</hi> And this is more peculiarly true in spiritual services. Though God doth always hear men when we pray to him in secret and alone, yet he hath promised that <hi>when two or three are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in his name, he will,</hi> after a more especial manner, <hi>be in the midst of them</hi>; which made St. <hi>Paul</hi> so earnestly desire the prayers of the <hi>Romans,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that they might <hi>wrestle together with him,</hi> Rom. 15.30. And so more effectually prevail. 'Twas for this reason that our <hi>Saviour</hi> sent out his Disciples <hi>two by two,</hi> that so they might more successfully advantage one another in the work of their ministry. You know the story of King <hi>Ioash,</hi> how he prospered in all his affairs during the life of his good friend <hi>Iehoiada</hi>; but after his death, he revolted to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55636:156"/>
Idolatry, and with an ungrateful cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty slew the Son of <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his apostacy; after which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing prospered with him, but having been first spoiled by the <hi>Syrians,</hi> he was <hi>slain by his own servants,</hi> 1 Chron. 24. From all which the truth of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> may sufficiently appear, <hi>that the sociable life of a friend, is in many respects much more advantageous, than to live alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Application</hi> of this; it may in the first place serve to convince such as pretend to this relation, of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation they are under to observe those mutual offices of friendship towards one another; of counselling them in their difficulties, bearing a share with them in their several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, rejoycing with them in their joys, and grieving with them in their griefs; assisting them in their labours: Without which all the professions of love and service, are but words of course that vanish into air and signifie nothing. Nay those near Relations of <hi>Parent</hi> and <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Brother,</hi> and which is nearer, for which a man is to forsake all other, that conjugal relation of <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> are only valuable
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:55636:157"/>
upon this account, as they are <hi>friends,</hi> and without this they are but empty names, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6. <hi>If thy Brother the Son of thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or the Son of thy Daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend that is as thy own soul.</hi> This last is the highest step in the gradation: All the other relations continue, though mixed with unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but this last implies dearness in the very essence of it, and is altogether inseparable from it, a man may be a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, Husband,</hi> and without loving, but 'tis not possible for him to be a <hi>friend</hi> without love and friendship.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And that we may be thus mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually helpful, to such as we profess friendship to, we should labour for those due qualifications requisite to such a condition. Of these I shall reckon <hi>four.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There must be <hi>true love,</hi> which is styled the <hi>bond of perfection, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Colos.</hi> 3.14. The only bond that can make a perfect union. As two pieces of Iron will never be perfectly hammered together, unless they are both red hot, so neither will two minds be joyned together in such an helpful union, unless they are both warmed with the same heats of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:55636:157"/>
That kind of amity which is founded wholly upon private ends, <hi>negotiatio est, non amicitia,</hi> it is <hi>trafick</hi> but not <hi>friendship.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. A <hi>wise freedom,</hi> not to conceal any thing that may be beneficial, though it may prove distasteful: <hi>An profecturus sim nescio, malum successum mihi, quàm fidem deesse:</hi> When we are uncertain of the issue of our admonitions, yet this we may be sure of, that <hi>'tis better to be without success on his part, than fidelity on our own.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Patience: Make no friendship with an angry man, and with a furious man thou shalt not go,</hi> Prov. 22.24. <hi>Short spirited men,</hi> are neither good <hi>Counsellors</hi> nor <hi>Comforters.</hi> God is said <gap reason="foreign">

baseness and meaness of spirit, and to be without all true generosity. The carriage of the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> towards <hi>Saul</hi> will cast shame upon such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy persons: Though she was sure that he was the next day to lose his kingdom and be slain with his Sons, and so could neither hope for good nor fear any hurt from him, yet when she saw him exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, lying upon the ground, and refusing to eat, the remembrance of what he had been impresses upon her such a reverence, that instead of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating revenge for the law he had enacted against persons of her Trade, she courts him with all the humble and respective language that may be; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to cheer him up,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.</note> bespeaks him to eat, kills for him her fatted calf; bestirs her self to prepare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread, and uses him with as much respect as if he had been still to continue in his most flourishing estate. The example of this Witch may be a just condemnation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the perfidiousness of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant friend.</p>
            <p>But above all other kinds of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, this of the <hi>Conjugal Relation</hi> doth
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55636:158"/>
most firmly oblige to these mutual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And because the occasion of this present Meeting is to commemorate a solemnity of this nature, which was celebrated in this <hi>Church</hi> this day was 16 years the happiness of which hath since that time been still continued with all the blessings of domestical love and peace, besides the comforts of a hopeful posterity to succeed; therefore in order to the present occasion, the better to excite your gratitude for the mercies you commemorate, I would offer it to your consideration to look abroad into the World and take a view of the state of many other great Families; how uncomfortably they live by reason of domestical dissentions, which sometimes rise to that height as to make a separation of those whom God hath joyned, to their mutual dishonour and discomfort: And perhaps either no posterity to continue the name, or such a vicious and debauched one, as will be a scandal to it. They that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the state of things abroad will find no great scarcity of examples to this purpose. And therefore how great reason have others to be thankful for their exemption in these respects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:55636:159"/>Gods peculiar blessing of any in a relation is a farther obligation upon them to serve him in the duties of that relation, which are in this case either <hi>special</hi> to <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> or <hi>joint</hi> and common to both.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Husbands</hi> should <hi>love their Wives as Christ loves his Church,</hi> Ephes. 5.25. Or <hi>as they love their own selves,</hi> v. 33.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be <hi>kind to them,</hi> v. 29. <hi>Not harsh and bitter against them,</hi> Colos. 3.19. Lest <hi>she cover the Altar of the Lord with her tears, so that he will not regard thy offering any more, nor receive it with good will at thy hand,</hi> Malachi 2.13, 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Give honour to them as the weaker vessels, as being heirs with you of the grace of life,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.7. Being tender of displeasing or disatisfying them, by any imprudent action, or seeming neglect. <hi>Let her be unto thee as the loving Hinde, or the tender Roe, and be thou always satisfied with her love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Wife</hi> must:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Be subject to her Husband as to the Lord,</hi> Ephes. 5.22. <hi>This is meet and comely,</hi> Colos. 3.18. <hi>For after this manner the holy women of old time, that trusted in God, were in subjection to their husbands,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.5. Which was signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

            <p>IN the former part of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> we have a prophetical description of the happy state of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church and Nation under the reign of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who was in this respect a type of <hi>Christ,</hi> as to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the times of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55636:164"/>
Either <hi>serious deliberation</hi> about it, or <hi>readiness of mind</hi> to it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Serious deliberation about it</hi>; he <hi>deviseth,</hi> that is, he imploys his most serious thoughts in this business, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting and contriving in his mind, the most proper and effectual ways for it: This is styled, <hi>v.</hi> 6.

            <p n="2">II. <hi>Readiness</hi> and spontaneity, such an one doth not stay till he be provoked or necessitated by others to such kind of works, but doth of his own mind cast about in his thoughts, how to find the most fitting objects for them. It hath been a Proverbial saying that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitas non facit syllogismum,</hi> liberality, doth not stay to argue and debate, when a proper and fitting occasion is offered, but upon the first suggestion doth most freely close and comply with it.</p>

               </gap>.

very <hi>Heathens.</hi> Such kind of persons shall not only be <hi>not ruined</hi> by their bounty, but they shall hereby be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> and <hi>advanced</hi> in all kind of pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; what they bestow in this kind shall prove a <hi>saving</hi> instead of <hi>casting</hi> away;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6.</note> and <hi>he that soweth bountifully shall reap bountifully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the <hi>Text</hi> doth contain a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> of this virtue of <hi>liberality,</hi> by its work or <hi>property</hi>; and a <hi>recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of it by its wages, or the blessing and <hi>success</hi> that belongs to it.</p>
            <p>'Tis a noble subject and very proper for the present Solemnity. And if the plainest evidence from <hi>Scripture,</hi> or the clearest deductions of <hi>reason</hi> may be of any force, I doubt not but to propose such considerations about it, as to men that will attend and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, shall either convince them, and win them over to their duties, or leave them inexcusable.</p>
            <p>In the prosecution of this subject, I shall observe this plain method.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Endeavour to shew the <hi>nature</hi> of this Virtue; what it is, and wherein it consists.</p>

            <p n="3">3. To apply it to our selves by some useful inference.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In treating concerning the <hi>first</hi> of these, the <hi>nature</hi> of this Virtue, I shall speak briefly to these <hi>four</hi> heads: 1.

            <p>Whereas there is a twofold office of liberality, namely, to direct us in a due measure in <hi>getting</hi> or <hi>keeping,</hi> and in <hi>spending</hi> or <hi>giving.</hi> The <hi>Prodigal</hi> is <hi>excessive</hi> in the <hi>latter</hi> and <hi>defective</hi> in the <hi>former:</hi> on the contrary the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> is <hi>excessive</hi> in the former and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective</hi> in the latter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>exceeding</hi> extreme is styled <hi>Prodigality,</hi> profuseness, riotousness, which observes neither the due manner, nor measure in keeping, or giving. It hath this peculiar folly belonging to it, that it takes care to destroy it self: <hi>Quid stultius</hi> (saith <hi>Cicero) quam quod libenter facias, curare ut id diutiùs facere non possis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>deficient</hi> extream is chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness, tenacity, <hi>shutting up the bowels of compassion,</hi> being <hi>greedy of filthy lucre.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. I proceed to the <hi>second</hi> head, the <hi>necessity</hi> of it, or the grounds of our obligation to it from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> proofs to this purpose I shall reduce under these <hi>four</hi> heads: 1. The <hi>Precepts</hi> for it: 2. The <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> of it: 3. The <hi>Promises</hi> made to it: 4. The <hi>Threats</hi> and <hi>Iudgments</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon the neglect of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Precepts</hi> for it, which are very numerous, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. This duty within a little compass, is inculcated no less than four several times, and urged with much emphaticalness: <hi>Thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand against thy poor Brother,</hi>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:55636:169"/>
v. 7. <hi>But thou shalt open thy hand wide to him,</hi> v. 8. <hi>Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest to him,</hi> v. 10. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I command thee saying, thou shalt open thy hand wide to thy Brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy in thy land,</hi> v. 11.</p>
            <p>Eccles. 11.1. <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters, give a portion to seven, and also to eight: In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand,</hi> Matth. 5.42. <hi>Give to him that asketh thee,</hi> Luke 6.33. <hi>Do good — Hoping for nothing again,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.18. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate,</hi> Titus 3.8. <hi>This I will that thou affirm constantly, that those who believe in God be careful to maintain good works.</hi> These are some of the Scripture <hi>Commands</hi> to this purpose, which are very plain and positive. Nor can any reasonable man doubt, but that he ought in such cases, to yield obedience to him, who hath the supreme dominion over us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Commendations</hi> of it: That which we translate a <hi>liberal soul,</hi> Prov. 11.25. In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is the <hi>soul of
<pb facs="tcp:55636:170"/>
blessing</hi>; because 'tis so both active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and passively. As the virtue of charity is frequently celebrated for one of the most excellent amongst all the rest, and set forth by many pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar commendations, as being <hi>better than sacrifice; the fulfilling of the Law; the bond of perfectness; the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; the Royal Law:</hi> So is <hi>Bounty</hi> one of the top branches of Charity. 'Tis justly counted a privilege, which men ought to seek after and rejoyce in, that they may receive good from others. Now the Scripture tells us, that <hi>'tis more blessed to give than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> Acts 20.35. 'Tis both the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and the ornament of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: 'Tis the chief fruit whereby we are to judge of our sincerity. Men do vainly pretend to Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, without the proof of such good works: <hi>Obadiah</hi> doth urge this to the <hi>Prophet</hi> as an evidence of his <hi>fearing God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18, 12, 13.</note> that he had been careful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve others in distress. And the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> was for this reason styled <hi>a man of worth:</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Apostle</hi> describes liberality to be a demeaning our selves sutably, <hi>to our professed subjection to the Gospel of Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. And elsewhere he styles being <hi>fruitful in good works,</hi> a <hi>walking worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing,</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:55636:173"/>1. In respect of <hi>God,</hi> who bestows upon us all that we have, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may well expect that we should be ready to lay out some of it for his use, according to his appointment. <hi>All things come of thee, and of thine own we have given thee</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 29.14. <hi>He renews his mercies</hi> to us <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning, and daily loads us with his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</hi> He <hi>gives</hi> to us <hi>liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids</hi> us <hi>not, He spreads our Tables and fills our Cups,</hi> till they run over, that we may be more ready with our superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, to fill the empty, <hi>and satisfie the hungry with our good things, that our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance may be a supply for others wants, that there may be an equality,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.14. That passage 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. doth in every word of it contain an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to this purpose, <hi>He gives us all things richly to enjoy.</hi> He <hi>gives,</hi> we can claim nothing as our due; <hi>us,</hi> so unworthy; <hi>richly; (i. e.</hi> bountifully) that others might be supplyed out of our store; to <hi>enjoy,</hi> not to hoard up or waste upon our lusts, but to dispose of to their proper end and use. <hi>For ye know the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:55636:174"/>
might be made rich.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9.</p>
            <p>And there is all imaginable equity in this consequence, why God should require this of us, having done so much for us. Suppose a man ransomed from death and slavery, and want, and put into the possession of a great estate by the bounty of another; who thereupon should make it his earnest request to him, that for his sake he would spare some little of that plenty he had now conferred upon him, towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of some friends of his, who were nearly related to him, upon whom he might have bestowed all that wealth, which he had chosen rather to confer upon him: And should adjure him to this, by all the entreaties, promises, and repeated importunities that could be; would not Heaven and Earth cry shame against such a vile ungrateful wretch, as should in so small a matter neglect so great an obligation? would not every mans heart rise up with much keenness and indignation against the very mention of such a monster? But you will say, are there any such vile wretches in the world? I Answer, all those that are rich, and not bountiful upon good occasions, they are such.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55636:174"/>
And if any such there be in this place, I would say to every one of them, as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> did to <hi>David; Thou art the man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis equitable in respect of the <hi>Poor,</hi> who by reason of their relation to us, and their need of us, may reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect assistance from us. God could have provided sufficiently for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, But his providence hath so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it,<note place="margin">

               <hi>That there shall be alwayes poor in the Land,</hi> to prove us in this kind, that we might have fit matter for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of this grace, &amp; that we might have some visible examples of what he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to when he pleases. Nor are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities or riches upon any other account desirable, but as they afford means and opportunities of doing good to such as stand in need of our help. So that the different states and degrees amongst men as to riches and poverty, seem by the Providence of God to be purposely designed in order to the exercise of this Virtue.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis equitable in respect of <hi>our selves.</hi> We are miserable, despicable creatures, and can hope for nothing from God, but upon the account of Bounty; without his mercy we are all
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:55636:175"/>
of us lost and undone. Now the rules of congruity will require, that we should be as ready to shew mercy to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as to expect it for our selves; there is no man so absolute and independent, as not at some time to stand in need of the help of others; Humane Society could not subsist, without the mutual offices of kindnesses; and nothing is more su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to natural reason, than that we should be ready to do as we would be done unto. That's the <hi>first</hi> argument upon the account of common reason and ingenuity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is not only equitable and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the not doing of it an incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unreasonable thing: But 'tis likewise <hi>just,</hi> and the omission of it an <hi>injury</hi> or sin. 'Tis observed by some learned <hi>Criticks,</hi> That in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Oriental</hi> Tongues, this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Bounty and beneficence is styled by the name of <hi>Iustice</hi> or <hi>Righteousness</hi>

               <hi>The wicked borroweth and payeth not again, but the righteous sheweth mercy and giveth</hi>: And in several other places.</p>
            <p>Though one man cannot implead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother before the bar of humane Law, for not doing him a kindness, for not being liberal to him: The end of the Law being to preserve men within the bounds of justice; to keep them from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injuries to one another, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is more immediately necessary to the peace of Societies. Yet in Gods Law, the not doing a kindness, when we have a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting occasion, is counted <hi>injustice</hi>; and he will arraign us for the omission of such occasions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apostle</hi> having said <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Render to all their dues,</hi> pay to every man your debts, subjoyns in the next <hi>verses; Owe no man any thing, but to love one another</hi>; Implying that in the Scripture sense, Charity is a debt, and the not paying of it an injustice. 'Tis such a debt as we can never fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, but though we are alwayes pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, yet we must still be in arrear, whilst there shall remain any ability,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55636:176"/>
and occasion for our exercising of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Withhold not good from him to whom it is due</hi> (or <hi>from the owners thereof</hi>) speaking of works of bounty. When there are fit objects proposed to us that need our help, they have a just title to it; and the not assisting of them, is withholding from them their due.</p>
            <p>We are but Stewards of our estate, and are to lay it out for such uses of the Family, as are most agreeable to our <hi>Masters</hi> will; and the neglect of this is styled,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>God himself is the great Soveraign and Proprietor of the world; all men are but his Subjects and Tenants; there is a Tribute or Rent which he requires from them, upon the non-payment of which they forfeit their Tenure, and afterwards do but usurp, being in his sight without any lawful title to what they possess. And he hath appointed two kind of Receivers for this tribute or rent, which we owe to him, his <hi>Ministers</hi> and the <hi>Poor</hi>; the not paying to one of these is expresly styled, <hi>robbing</hi> of God, <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.8. 'tis so likewise in the other case, <hi>Pauperibus non impertire rapina est,</hi> Nay, it may prove much worse, a kind
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:55636:176"/>
of <hi>Murther,</hi> which is the highest kind of injustice, Because not to save when we may is to destroy, as is implyed by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.9. That's the <hi>Second</hi> Argument upon the account of <hi>justice</hi> or duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis highly <hi>advantageous</hi> to us; which is the <hi>last</hi> Argument upon the account of <hi>interest. By liberal things shall we stand.</hi> 'Tis the best means to improve and confirm a mans condition, in all the felicities of this life, and a better.</p>

            <p n="1">1. For the increasing of our estates: The <hi>Apostle</hi> compares it to <hi>sowing,</hi> which refers to an <hi>harvest.</hi> The Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would never scatter his seed upon the ground, if he did not know, that 'tis much better for him to dispose of it so, than to keep it in his granary. 'Tis of all others the most gainful way of Trading. <hi>Ars omnium quaestuosissima,</hi> as one of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> When we receive much for a little, certain for uncertain, eternal things for temporal.</p>

Answered, <hi>ea ipsa quae dono</hi>: implying, that instead of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enating, he did rather confirm his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in them, by disposing of them to good uses.</p>
            <p>'Twas a significant saying to this purpose, <hi>Habeo quod dedi, perdidi quod servavi.

               <hi>Every man is a friend to a man of gifts.</hi> Nor is such an one so much a loser in his purse by his bounty, as he is a gainer in the hearts and affections of men. The <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> (though of a different way from the <hi>Iews</hi>) was upon this account high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued in their esteem, which made them so earnestly to intercede with our <hi>Saviour</hi> in his behalf, as being a

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If such persons only be truly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and generous, who devise liberal things, then all such as are averse from such things are but <hi>Nabals,</hi> vile and foolish, and ought to be so esteemed, amongst them that will pass righteous judgment, and are able to distinguish of things that differ. There may be an outward respect due to titles of Honour and dignity, but when they are mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly nominal, without any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of real worth to answer them, 'tis not to be expected that they should
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:55636:179"/>
acquire an inward esteem in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and affections of judicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Men may have the custody of great estates, but they are rather the <hi>slaves</hi> than the <hi>masters</hi> of them, unless they have hearts to dispose of them to good uses.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence we learn what to think of those, who are so far from <hi>devising libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things,</hi> that they must be <hi>forced</hi> to do <hi>just things.</hi> And will in cases of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences yield no further than they can be compelled by Law: insisting to the utmost upon every <hi>punctilio</hi> of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which the rigor and the letter of the Law will afford them. These are so far from being persons of <hi>honour,</hi> that in the Scripture sense they ought not to be reputed persons of honesty; <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> being necessary to that no less than <hi>Iustice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Those Persons are much mistaken, who think acts of this kind to be arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; that they may exert or restrain their bounty, at their own pleasure, without doing injury to any one. Whereas 'tis plain, that the Scripture doth impose it as a necessary duty, and esteem the omission of it an injury. And though we cannot be accused for our
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:55636:180"/>
neglects in this kind before mans <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,</hi> yet God will pass upon us our final Sentence according to these works.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If this be so sure a means for the securing and improving our estates, and that <hi>by liberal things men shall stand:</hi> This may afford some ground for our enquiry, Whether the neglect of this duty may not have some influence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the general complaints in these times, of want of money and trading, and of mens failing in their estates. This is plain enough, that there is no age to be mentioned, wherein the generality of persons of all ranks and conditions have been more profuse and extravagant, as to those particular expences that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themselves in all respects, <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Diet, Apparel, &amp;c.</hi> And it may justly be feared that this <hi>excess</hi> in <hi>private</hi> expences, may occasion a <hi>defect</hi> in their publick bounty: And then no wonder if men by neglect of <hi>liberal things</hi> do <hi>fall</hi> and <hi>break.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. By way of <hi>Exhortation</hi>; We may from hence be excited to these <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To give honour, love and respect to liberal persons: This is as much due
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55636:180"/>
to them from others, as their bounty and charity is due from them to others. And it cannot be less than an injury to detain from any one what is his due.</p>
            <p>It was an usual form amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> upon the naming of worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons deceased, to add this clause to the mention of them, <hi>whose memory is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi> And hence was that custom in the Primitive times of appointing <hi>Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> Memorials and Festivals in honour of the Worthies deceased; to recount their good deeds, celebrating the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses due to them, that others by their example might be excited to do the like. And here I cannot in justice omit the mentioning of a late publick good Work (not sufficiently taken notice of, though) redounding much to the honour of our Nation and Religion, I mean the Redemption of so many Captives from Slavery, and restoring them again to their native Countries; which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought to be commemorated with praise as a work <hi>of a sweet savour,</hi> both to God and men: and a further additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that double honour, which was before due to such as were the chief Promoters of it; I mean the Clergy of this Church, in gratitude to God for his
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55636:181"/>
gracious and wonderful restitution of them to their just Rights and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues.</p>
            <p>And I may truly speak it to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting honour of this famous <hi>City,</hi> that it hath afforded as many liberal worthy Benefactors for publick good works, (and that too since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> whatever the <hi>Papists</hi> suggest to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) as any other <hi>City</hi> in the Christian World. And which ought further to be acknowledged to their deserved praise, the several <hi>Companies</hi> of it, have generally discharged the trust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them by the Legacies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with much more honour and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity than particular men use to do. Having of their own accord, without being necessitated to it by a course of Law, observed that fair ingenuous equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is proper in such cases, by augmenting the allowances bequeathed in some proportion, according as the price and value of things hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased. This I know hath been done in some cases; and I am sure by the rules of equity it ought to be so in others. That what was at first designed by the will of the <hi>Donour</hi> as a meet and liberal maintenance, and now by the rising of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:55636:181"/>
the value of things falls short of it, (if the revenue will bear it) ought to be augmented in some proportion to what was first intended. Such persons cannot justly pretend to this Character in the Text of <hi>devising liberal things</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who are not free and generous in the right disposal of the liberality of others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Which brings me to the <hi>second</hi> branch of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> with which I shall conclude: That as we are now convinced of, so should we be affected with, and accordingly practise this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent virtue of Liberality. And as we abound in every thing, in <hi>Riches, Peace, Faith, Knowledg,</hi> that <hi>we abound in this grace also.</hi> It may seem superfluous to add any thing further to that great cloud of Testimonies and Arguments which I have already urged to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Without this bounty and pity to others we can have no good assurance of Gods favour to us, nor any grounds to expect it. With what face or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can any man ask mercy for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">Nehem. 13.14, 22. Mat. 5.7.</note> who is not ready to shew it to others?</p>
            <p>'Tis this that must add an efficacy to our prayers, as it did with <hi>Cornelius</hi>;
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55636:182"/>
that must sanctifie our possessions, our <hi>unrighteous Mammon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 11.41</note> which otherwise <hi>will not be clean to us.</hi> 'Tis the parent of honour, safety, prosperity without us, of joy, peace, confidence within us; the greatest comfort both in life and death,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.8, 24.</note> as being the surest evidence both of our grace here, and our glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>'Twill be but a little while before every one of you shall be called to <hi>give an account of your Stewardships</hi>; and would it not be your wisdom, before that time to have a right state of your accounts and to examine how they stand? I am sensible that I speak to men of experience, such as by their constant way of dealing must needs be well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in things of this nature; and do tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly understand what belongs to the making up and adjusting of Accounts; how to put together the charge, first of what they have received, and are responsible for; and then the discharge, how it hath been laid out and expended. And I appeal to your Consciences, can you think this would be a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at the last day to say, Lord thou hast intrusted me with so many Talents, such a revenue in land, such a stock
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:55636:182"/>
in money and commodities, such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Trading, or by Offices, to the value it may be of some thousands or hundreds by the year. Of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts I have expended, <hi>Imprimis,</hi> for my own use in <hi>buildings, furniture, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, feasting, recreations, law suits,</hi> and perhaps some more vicious way of expence, so many <hi>hundreds. Item,</hi> for thy use and service towards the relief of thy poor members, to works of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or publick bounty, either so many <hi>blanks,</hi> or so many <hi>pence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If men would deal impartially with themselves, putting both these together, and compare them with one another; would not this be enough to shame and confound men, if they were but serious in Religion, and did in good earnest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they profess?</p>
            <p>When we come to die, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of those sums, though but small ones, which we have sent before us to heaven in works of bounty and charity, will be a greater comfort and support to our minds than all those vast trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures which we must leave behind us upon earth. If men do not believe these things, why do they pretend to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians? If they do believe them, how is
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:55636:183"/>
it possible they should walk so unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably to them?</p>
            <p>Oh! that what hath been said might prevail with some amongst you, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a firm resolution of altering the state of your Accounts for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by reducing these two general Heads for <hi>your selves,</hi> and for <hi>God,</hi> unto a more decent and equal proportion; that the one may not consist only of <hi>pounds,</hi> and the other of <hi>pence.</hi> That so much at least may be laid out upon good works, as may afford to your faith and hope some ground and <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to lay hold on eternal life.</hi>

            <p>AMongst the many Passages in the <hi>Gospel</hi> concerning those miraculous cures, which were wrought by our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> this of the <hi>Centurion's servant</hi> is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on several accounts one of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</p>
            <p>We have it recorded in <hi>two</hi> several <hi>Evangelists,</hi> by St. <hi>Matthew, Chap.</hi> 8. and <hi>here</hi> by St. <hi>Luke.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> of these studying brevity and conciseness in the relation of it, doth thereupon omit se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral circumstances specified by the <hi>other</hi>; whence there ariseth some seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconsistency betwixt them. From which the <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Manichees</hi> of old,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55636:184"/>
took advantage in their Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>The chief circumstance wherein the difference lies, is concerning the persons who came unto Christ. In St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 'tis said, that the <hi>Centurion</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self came, <hi>beseeching of Christ, vers.</hi> 6. and <hi>answering of him, v.</hi> 8. And in this place 'tis said, that the <hi>Centurion</hi> first <hi>sent the elders to him, v.</hi> 3. and after <hi>his friends, v.</hi> 6. And part of their mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is, <hi>Neither thought I my self worthy to come unto thee, v.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Several things are answered to this Objection by those who write concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Harmony of the <hi>Evangelists.</hi> The most common Solution is, That what is done by a man's Proxy or mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, may be ascribed to a mans self, <hi>Apostolus cujusque est &amp; quisque, He that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.40.</note> Christ is said to have preached <hi>peace to the Ephesians, Ephes.</hi> 2.17. and <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the old World,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. which he did not in his own Person, but by his Messengers.</p>
            <p>Others conceive, That the <hi>Centurion</hi> first sent the <hi>Elders of the Iews,</hi> whose commission was only to beseech cure for his servant: And when upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:55636:184"/>
our <hi>Saviour</hi> was pleased to come towards his house, then he sends some other friends to deprecate that trouble, and to let him know, that he was not so presumptuous as to expect or desire any such favour from him: but when notwithstanding this message, our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> still kept on his way towards his house, then at last the <hi>Centurion</hi> himself comes out, and tells him, That he is altogether unworthy to have so great a Guest come under his roof.</p>
            <p>This being very suitable to all the circumstances of the story recorded by both <hi>Evangelists,</hi> doth sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the seeming difficulty about it.</p>
            <p>So that the <hi>Text</hi> is part of that mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage which was sent to our <hi>Saviour</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Centurions</hi> servant. For the better understanding of the Words, and the Story to which they refer, it may be proper to premise something concerning these four particulars.</p>

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55636:185"/>
Religion,</hi> those special <hi>Virtues</hi> for which he was eminent.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>Calling</hi> or Profession. A <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Centurion, v.</hi> 2. A military Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, one of those Captains who were quartered up and down the several parts of <hi>Iudea,</hi> to prevent any commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or seditions amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> whilst they were under the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; And 'tis likely that his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison or head quarters were at <hi>Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> the place where this Miracle was wrought.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For his <hi>Religion,</hi> he was neither <hi>Iew</hi> nor <hi>Christian</hi> but a <hi>Heathen</hi>; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging no other principles but what the light of Nature might lead a man unto; whereby men are obliged to renounce Idols, to worship only the one true God, to observe the rules of justice and charity, dealing so with others as they desire to be dealt with themselves. Which rules are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly enumerated under seven heads, styled by the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> the <hi>seven precepts</hi> of <hi>Noah.</hi> And the observance of these was then counted sufficient to entitle a man a <hi>Proselyte</hi>; of which there were two kinds amongst the Jews called by them, <hi>proselytes</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> and of the <hi>Gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:55636:185"/>Those were called <hi>proselytes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> who took upon them the sign of it, namely <hi>circumcision,</hi> and did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to all the <hi>Iewish</hi> Rites in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by <hi>Moses.</hi> And all such of what Nation soever, who were thus fully converted to that Religion, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards counted as native <hi>Iews,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the same common priviledges, and to worship with them, both in the times of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Such was <hi>Vriah, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those were called <hi>proselytes of the Gate,</hi> who during the time of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, stood only without at the <hi>Gate,</hi> not being admitted within the <hi>septs</hi> or inclosures of it; though in the <hi>second</hi> Temple there was an outward court appointed for them called <hi>Atrium gentium.</hi> These were neither circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised nor observed any of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Rites, but only those precepts of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Religion which I mentioned before. And of these there were some in all Times amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> and usually great numbers in all Cities and Places of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> where the <hi>Iews</hi> had Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues. Such was <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> in the <hi>Old</hi> Testament; <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and the <hi>Centurion</hi> in the <hi>New.</hi> In the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:55636:186"/>
History of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> there is frequent mention of these kind of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes</hi> under the title of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers</hi> or <hi>devout</hi> persons, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.43; 16.14; 17.4, 17; 18.4. who also were the first <hi>Gentiles</hi> converted to <hi>Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though there was a wide diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the <hi>Iews</hi> and these <hi>prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes</hi> in matters of Religion, yet did it not grow up to any such heats and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities betwixt them, but they lived peaceably together. As for the <hi>Iews,</hi> though they were by the <hi>Law</hi> obliged to esteem such persons as <hi>Gentiles</hi> and unclean, with whom they might not familiarly converse; yet were they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon account of their virtue to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them some share in their good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and friendship: esteeming them to be pious men, and such as (according to their opinion) should be admitted to some portion of happiness in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. And the <hi>Apostle</hi> sayes of some of them that <hi>they feared God, Acts</hi> 10.1, 2. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.16.</p>
            <p>And on the other side, these <hi>Heathen</hi> proselytes, though they did not believe the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion, or submit to the Rites of it, yet because they found the Principles of it more rational than any
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:55636:186"/>
other, in the prohibiting of all vices, in their worship of one God, and being free from Idolatry, which all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were guilty of; therefore had they a greater esteem for the <hi>Iews</hi> than for any other; frequenting their <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi> to hear the <hi>Law</hi> read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and being ready to oblige them by any bounty and favour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might testifie a peculiar respect to them, as being devout and religious men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for those special <hi>virtues</hi> record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this <hi>Centurion,</hi> there are observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Story of him these <hi>four</hi> things for which he was eminent.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His great <hi>tenderness</hi> and <hi>pity</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his sick servant, who is said to be <hi>dear to him, v.</hi> 2. though 'tis probable that he was but a slave, either bought with his money, or taken amongst the spoils of War; For such kind of Servants were then most usual with the <hi>Romans,</hi> especially amongst military men; yet you see how full of compassion he is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him in his sickness, how solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for his recovery, making all the interest he could, and ingaging his chief friends to mediate in his behalf; And from his being thus merciful we may
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:55636:187"/>
probably infer that he was likewise a man of courage and valour. For as fierceness and cruelty is a sure indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Coward, so gentleness and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity are usually arguments of a great and generous mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>modesty</hi> and <hi>humility.</hi> Though others that knew him had a great esteem of him, yet had he a mean opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of himself; <hi>Neither thought he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self worthy to come unto Christ.</hi> v. 7. He knew that the <hi>Iews</hi> did count themselves polluted by any familiar converse with such as he was; and much less could he think himself worthy to receive any such honour from <hi>Christ,</hi> as that he should vouchsafe <hi>to come under his roof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. His <hi>bounty</hi> and <hi>generosity</hi> in works of devotion, manifested by building a <hi>Synagogue</hi> for the <hi>Iews,</hi> erecting for them a place of publick worship at his own charge, which was a matter of no small expence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His great <hi>ingenuity</hi> of mind in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to sufficient evidence. Having been informed of those great Miracles wrought by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and that holy Doctrine which he taught, he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately convinced that he must needs be a Divine person. And accordingly he
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:55636:187"/>
makes his address to him suitably to this belief; expressing his faith in such a way as hath no other instance like it in <hi>Scripture</hi>: His request is, <hi>Say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</hi> As if he should have said, I do not think it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting either for me to ask, or Christ to grant, that he should vouchsafe to come and see my servant, or to lay his hand on him; 'twill be sufficient if he shall please to speak the word only. And he gives this reason for it, For if <hi>I who am</hi> but <hi>a man under authority,</hi> have such a power over those committed to my charge as to make them <hi>come</hi> and <hi>go</hi> at my command, much more then may he send away diseases by a word of his mouth. For <hi>I am a man,</hi> thou art a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> person, I am <hi>set under authority,</hi> thou art the <hi>supreme Lord</hi> of all; <hi>I have Soldiers under me,</hi> a rough untractable generation of men, and yet when <hi>I say to one go, he goes; and to another come, he comes; to a third do this, he does it.</hi> Now sicknesses and diseases are thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, under thine absolute dominion and command, to be disposed of as thou pleasest; and therefore as I am not worthy to come unto thee, nor is it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for me to expect that thou shouldst
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55636:188"/>
vouchsafe to come unto me; so is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these necessary to the grant of my petition, <hi>'Tis but saying the word, and my servant shall be healed.</hi> Upon this mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage our <hi>Saviour</hi> seems to be somewhat surprized: 'tis said, <hi>he marvelled at him,</hi> and having made a stand, he turns about to the people that followed him, and said unto them, <hi>I have not found so great faith, no not in</hi> Israel, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The business or <hi>message</hi>; which was to intercede with Christ for cure of a sick servant. And this, those who were imployed on this account did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly endeavour with much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness; pressing their request with arguments taken from the great merit and commendation of the Person in whose behalf they did intercede; which they express <hi>first</hi> in the <hi>general,</hi> saying, <hi>he is worthy for whom he should do this,</hi> v. 4. and this they further specifie by two <hi>particular</hi> instances: 1. From his <hi>publick spiritedness, He loves our Nation</hi>; he is not a person of the common temper, of a little narrow mind, immersed wholly in himself, or given up to some small designs for his own private gain and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. 2. His <hi>bounty</hi> and <hi>generosity</hi> in works of devotion, <hi>He hath built us a
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55636:188"/>
Synagogue.</hi> What by the help of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and his own expence, he hath very liberally erected for us a place for publick Worship: which must needs be a great obligation to those who had any zeal for their Religion; and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly made use of as a powerful motive of favour towards him.</p>
            <p>But here, before I proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it may be proper to speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the clearing up of this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, How it comes to be recorded as a commendable thing for a man <hi>to build a Synagogue,</hi> when we find no command or institution for it in Scripture? And therefore it may seem to be a kind of <hi>Will-worship,</hi> or humane invention, which may as well be said likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Churches in these Times of Christianity. We read indeed of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and after of a stately <hi>Temple</hi> appointed by God himself. All the <hi>Parts, Vtensils, Services, Officers,</hi> and every other <hi>circumstance</hi> belonging to that worship, being particularly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in <hi>Scripture.</hi> But we read nothing at all of any command concerning <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi> or <hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this it may be answered, that the having of particular Places set apart

for the duties of publick worship is of natural obligation, and therefore doth not require any positive law for the commanding of it. Though such kind of <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Typical</hi> precepts, as are no way derivable from natural light, do receive all their obligation from being <hi>instituted</hi>; yet in things that are <hi>moral,</hi> which a man may be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, and obliged unto by the meer light of nature, in such cases a man is left to the dictates of Reason and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>And from this natural Principle was it that the ancient <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> who lived abroad in Booths and Tents, frequently changing their places for fresh pasture, when they came to any new place of abode, where they pitched their Tents, their custom was to erect Altars, and enclose them about, which was usually done in some <hi>mountains, high places</hi> and <hi>groves.</hi> And these (before they came to be abused by Idolatry) were in general request amongst them, being styled by the name of Sanctuaries or holy places, to which a reverence is commanded, <hi>Ye shall keep my Sabbaths,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>and reverence my Sanctuaries,</hi> Levit. 19.30.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Israelites</hi> wandered in the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:55636:189"/>
Wilderness without any setled habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were commanded to make a moveable <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> before which they were to worship, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. And before that glorious <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was erected, <hi>Moses</hi> had a <hi>Tent without the Camp</hi> for that purpose, called the <hi>Tabernacle of the Congregation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they were to be in a setled condition, they are then commanded to <hi>fix unto the place which the Lord their God should chuse,</hi> Deut. 12.5. After, when God had chosen <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and in it <hi>Mount Moriah, David</hi> did first, out of his own inclination, make an attempt towards this work of building the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> which was afterwards accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Solomon.</hi> And that Temple being destroyed, another was erected in the room of it, which (though it fell much short of the former) yet was it one of the most noble and famous Structures in the whole World.</p>
            <p>Each of these, the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and the <hi>Temples,</hi> were by particular appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In after times we read of other kinds of buildings for worship, <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi> and <hi>Oratories.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Synagogues</hi> were somewhat answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our <hi>Parish-Churches,</hi> in which
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:55636:190"/>
they were wont to assemble for Prayer, Reading and interpreting the Law.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Oratories</hi> or <hi>Proseuchae</hi> were lesser Structures, commonly erected without the <hi>Towns,</hi> and by the Sea-side: into which it was usual for Passengers to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Praying, and giving of Alms.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Synagogues</hi> began first to be erected is very difficult to determine. The most common opinion is, that there were no Buildings of this kind till after the <hi>Captivity.</hi> As for that phrase, <hi>They have burnt up all the Synagogues of God in the land,</hi> Psal. 74.8. the Original word translated <hi>Synagogues</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is frequently used in other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to signifie <hi>tempus statutum,</hi> or <hi>stata solennitas</hi>; according to which the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it must be, that they have abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the solemn <hi>Festivals,</hi> and caused them to cease: 'Tis so rendred by the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase, the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and most of the other <hi>Versions.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as St. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. <hi>Moses of old time had in every City those that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath-day.</hi> To this it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that the phrase of <hi>old time</hi> is not necessarily to be extended unto the times of purest Antiquity, but may be
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:55636:190"/>
well enough restrained to four or five hundred years preceding, when <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi> might first begin, <hi>namely</hi> after the <hi>Captivity.</hi> But of this I have had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to treat more largely in another Discourse.</p>
            <p>Only this is sufficiently evident, that the liberty of building <hi>Synagogues,</hi> was allowed every where to the <hi>Iews</hi> under the <hi>Roman</hi> Government in our <hi>Saviours</hi> time; that He himself and his <hi>Apostles</hi> did very much frequent them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently approve them; that though the several Officers and Laws belonging to them were without any <hi>Scripture-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> yet our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth rather suit the Doctrine and precepts of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> worship to this of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> which was <hi>moral</hi> and perpetual, than to that of the <hi>Temple-service</hi> which was <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted</hi> and transitory.</p>
            <p>As for publick Buildings for <hi>Christian</hi> worship, 'tis obvious that <hi>this Way</hi> being in the first Ages every where opposed and spoken against, the Professors of it were fain to meet (as they could with safety) sometimes in private houses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to some of the <hi>Disciples,</hi> where they had usually a fair upper room fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and set a part for these Meetings,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:55636:191"/>
and sometimes in <hi>grots</hi> and <hi>caves,</hi> and <hi>woods:</hi> Till afterwards, the heat of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution being somewhat abated, they had permission to build little <hi>Oratories</hi>; and in process of time as <hi>Emperours</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> began to favour <hi>Christianity,</hi> so were they careful to erect for them most sumptuous and magnificent <hi>Temples.</hi> For which this <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> of ours was more particularly famous above any other part of the world. Our <hi>Ancestors</hi> having been very devout and bountiful in works of this nature, according to the old <hi>verse:</hi>
               <q>Anglia, mons, pons, fons, Ecclesia. —</q>
Now though it be true that where ever men worship God with a sincere and upright heart they shall be accepted; <hi>Ieremy</hi> in the <hi>mire, Ionah</hi> in the <hi>Whales belly, Daniel</hi> in the <hi>den,</hi> the <hi>three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> in the furnace, the <hi>Thief</hi> on the <hi>Cross</hi>; yet this doth not hinder but that when we have opportunity for it, our Places of publick Worship should be both built and maintained, and esteemed in some measure suitably to the dignity of that service they are to be imployed about. And when we are in a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:55636:191"/>
estate, 'tis as proper for us to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in the <hi>beauty of Holiness,</hi> as it is to do it in <hi>caves</hi> and <hi>prisons</hi> when we are in a condition that doth necessitate us thereunto.</p>
            <p>You have heard the two <hi>first</hi> Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the <hi>person sending,</hi> and his <hi>message.</hi> I shall speak more briefly to the other <hi>Two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>messengers</hi> imployed about this business; which were of <hi>two</hi> kinds. Those who were first sent are said to be <hi>the Elders of the Iews, v.</hi> 3. whether the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> or the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> the <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Rulers is not evident; the Word may signifie either. After these, 'tis said he sent <hi>his friends, v.</hi> 6. who were perhaps some other of his fellow-Officers belonging to that <hi>Garrison.</hi> And these Messengers (it should seem) were heartily concerned in the good success of that business they undertook, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their earnestness about it: 'tis said that they did beseech Christ, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>instantly,</hi> with much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and vehemence, thereby te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying their zeal and good affection for the Person by whom they were imployed.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:55636:192"/>4. And <hi>lastly,</hi> the <hi>success</hi> or issue of this Negotiation: 'Tis said that our <hi>Saviour</hi> did upon the first motion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to their request. Though at another time when he was twice sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited in the behalf of the <hi>Noblemans</hi> Son, he refused to go, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.46. yet to shew his special esteem and favour for a Person under so worthy a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as this <hi>Centurion,</hi> he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his willingness, not only to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him in the thing desired, the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his servant, but to do more for him than was asked, namely to give him a visit; besides that large testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and approbation which he gives to the people concerning his great worth.</p>
            <p>So much shall serve for the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Text and Story. The <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> I would make from the words is this:
<q>To be of a publick spirit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Observ.</hi>
                  </note> and of a bountiful generous mind in works of Charity and Devotion is a sure way to render a man acceptable to God and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was by these <hi>virtues</hi> that the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> (though a <hi>Heathen</hi>) was so much
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:55636:192"/>
endeared to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of by our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth attest to this truth in several other places. 'Tis said <hi>Psal.</hi> 112.6. of the bountiful man <hi>that he shall be had in everlasting remembrance</hi>; and <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>His name shall be exalted with honour.</hi> In conformity to which it hath been always a custom amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> in their speaking of any worthy man deceased to add this clause to the mention of his name, <hi>whose memorial is blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. when <hi>David</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the people to offer willingly and freely towards the building of the <hi>Temple,</hi> see how they did all rejoice and exult in the apprehension of it, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Then the people rejoiced, and David the King also rejoiced with great joy, because they had offered willingly, and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart unto the Lord.</hi> They looked upon this work as a thing that was very well pleasing to God, and an honour to their Nation, and consequently a just occasion of joy and triumph to all the People.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Nehemiah, Chap.</hi> 13.14. had with great industry and success promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the rebuilding of the Temple, he
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:55636:193"/>
doth, upon the reflection of it, break out into this expression, <hi>Remember me, O my God, concerning this; and wipe not out the good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the Officers thereof.</hi> It seems he believed his care and activity in this work to be a thing very acceptable to God; which makes him desire that it might be recorded and kept in remembrance to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>I might further confirm this <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> by several Reasons. I shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only <hi>two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. From the suitableness of such kind of duties unto the moral and more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial parts of Religion. The <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us that <hi>the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteusness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost; and they who in these things serve Christ shall be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God, and approved of men, Rom.</hi> 14.17, 18. The word <hi>Righteousness</hi> is frequently used in the Scripture-phrase for the virtue of beneficence and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. By <hi>peace</hi> is meant that gentle and charitable disposition, whereby a man is inclined to promote the quiet of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and good will amongst men. And by <hi>the joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> we are
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:55636:193"/>
to understand an ability to rejoice in an afflicted estate. These are the things recommended to us as being the more weighty and essential parts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 'Tis no difficult matter for a man to be zealous about <hi>meats and drinks,</hi> he may do it to gratifie his contentious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and to endear himself to a Party: Nor is it hard for a man to pretend a zeal for Religion by some good wishes or kind words, which are cheap things, and will cost him nothing; but to give testimony of it by bountiful actions, <hi>that others may see our good works,</hi> this is that which will make them <hi>glorifie God in our behalf,</hi> and acknowledg <hi>that he is in us of a truth.</hi> It was an humour in the <hi>Apostolical</hi> times, as well as since, that men set up for reputation in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by their zeal about some Opinions in lesser matters. Against which the <hi>Apostle</hi> cautions <hi>Titus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8.</note> 
               <hi>This I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God be careful to maintain good works.</hi> For which he gives this reason, <hi>For these things are good and profitable unto men.</hi> Contentions and disputes may please and gratifie mens present humours and passions, but they are these works of Piety and Bounty that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:55636:194"/>
must promote the more lasting and publick welfare, and the general good of mankind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Persons thus qualified are suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be of an higher rank and degree above other men. It is in Religion as in other Professions; there are some of a Vulgar sort, of an ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon standard; and there are others of a taller stature, of a higher form and attainments, from whom it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that they should adorn and add a luster to their Profession. And they are the Virtues of this kind, namely a bountiful and charitable disposition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any publick good work, that must raise men to this higher pitch of esteem above others. When <hi>Araunah</hi> offered <hi>David</hi> freely his <hi>threshing-floor,</hi> and <hi>oxen,</hi> and <hi>threshing instruments</hi> for Sacrifice, 'tis said, that he <hi>did it as a King,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.23. in a royal and princely manner; and <hi>David</hi> on the other side refused it <hi>as a King,</hi> thinking it unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him to <hi>offer unto God of that which cost him nothing,</hi> v. 24.</p>
            <p>I shall add nothing further at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by way of <hi>confirmation</hi> of this Point. that which I chiefly aim at is the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:55636:194"/>I have purposely made choice of this Subject, as having a peculiar suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the present state of things in this place. God hath been pleased by his late severe dispensations, first to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the inhabitants of this City by the noisome pestilence, and since to lay waste our habitations by a dreadful fire; wherein his own Houses, those that were dedicated to his Worship, did not escape; But <hi>the devouring fire</hi> (in the phrase of the <hi>Psalmist) did come into his Sanctuaries,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 74.7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>casting down the dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places of his name to the ground; burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Synagogues of God.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst the other dismal ruins of this place, 'tis one of the saddest spectacles to behold so many <hi>Sacred Structures,</hi> the Monuments of our Forefathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and bounty laid in the dust.</p>
            <p>I suppose it needless to prove the necessity of Religion to Government, or the necessity of Places for publick Worship to the keeping up of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Those things are in themselves so plain and obvious, that no reasonable man can have any just cause to doubt of them. That which I aim at is, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite others by this example of the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> to such a <hi>love</hi> of their <hi>Nation</hi> and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:55636:195"/>
               <hi>City,</hi> as may engage them to some effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual care for the building up of our <hi>Synagogues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in order to this I would speak something: 1. <hi>Particularly</hi> to such as are <hi>Magistrates</hi>; 2. <hi>Generally</hi> to all <hi>sorts of people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To you that are <hi>Magistrates</hi> of this City: 'Tis one of the styles belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Offices to be <hi>repairers of breaches.</hi> Publick things ought to be taken care of by publick persons. You have already made some provision to preserve mens Proprieties in their grounds, to enlarge the passages and avenues, whereby the City may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more safe, beautiful and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for Trading; which are good works, and such as become worthy Magistrates: But these things concern you as you are men and Citizens; there are other things to be provided for as you are Christians: And I would crave leave to be your remembrancer that some effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual care may be taken for the rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Places for publick Worship. It would be very convenient that as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Parishes</hi> are built up, so the repair of Churches should be in some forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to which the Inhabitants might
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:55636:195"/>
resort for the duties of Religion. The doing of this will perhaps prove a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of too great charge to be defrayed by the contribution of the Inhabitants, considering their particular losses. But if any considerable help could be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for it from the Publick (which there is no reason to doubt of) the remainder might be made up by particular Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And both together might prove sufficient for this great work. Nor is there any reason to question, but if this business were seriously consulted, and vigorously pursued, such ways might be offered as might prove effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual both for the building of such a number of <hi>Churches</hi> as shall be thought sufficient, and likewise for the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a sufficient maintenance for them, that none of their <hi>Incumbents</hi> may be put to live precariously upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of their hearers. I humbly offer this to your consideration, as a thing that is your duty, and will tend to your honour. And I do the rather mention it now, because this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per season for it, while the <hi>Parliament</hi> is sitting, of whose assistance towards so pious and necessary a work, there is no reason to doubt. And because it will
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:55636:196"/>
be a business of some time and much consideration, to enumerate and digest all such particulars as are necessary to be provided for, and established by Law; therefore will it be requisite that this work should be timely set about, that there may be sufficient leisure to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and consult about the due manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More <hi>generally</hi> to <hi>all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>; that they would lend their helping hands to so good a work as this is. If this <hi>Centurion</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> in a state of <hi>Heathenism,</hi> under his more dark ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of Religion, was so forward in these works of publick bounty, much more then will it concern us that are <hi>Christians</hi> not to be backward or defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in them. I might (if the time would permit) press this with great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of arguments; I shall mention on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some few.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis our <hi>duty</hi> to be bountiful and liberal upon all good occasions, and may of right and justice be required of us. God is pleased indeed for the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of men to these things to style them <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Loans</hi> which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages himself to repay, but they are <hi>Rent</hi> and <hi>Tribute,</hi> and <hi>Debt</hi>; upon the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:55636:196"/>
due payment of which we hold our Possessions, and upon the neglect or non-payment we forfeit our right to them. He is the supreme Lord of all, we are but his Tenants. As in the times of the <hi>Law</hi> men were to acknowledg his right and dominion by the offering of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; so should they in these times of the <hi>Gospel</hi> by their liberal contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards any good work, <hi>for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</hi> When there is any good occasion offered for our bounty, that is the time for the paying of our Rent and Tribute, and God doth then require it of us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis our <hi>interest,</hi> a thing which upon several accounts tends to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and benefit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With respect to our safety: The bountiful man shall be <hi>delivered in the time of trouble, preserved from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, strengthened upon the bed of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishment,</hi> Psal. 41.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis a means to promote the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of our estates: <hi>The liberal man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth liberal things, and by liberal things shall he stand,</hi> Isa. 32.8. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) He shall by this means be established and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his estate. <hi>The liberal soul shall be made fat, and he that watereth shall be
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:55636:197"/>
watered also himself,</hi> Prov. 11.25. Such kinds of works are in the <hi>Scripture-phrase</hi> compared to <hi>sowing,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in order to an <hi>harvest</hi> and encrease, <hi>And he that soweth bountifully shall reap bountifully,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This will promote the interest of honour and esteem amongst others: <hi>A bountiful man shall be had in everlasting remembrance, and his name shall be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with honour,</hi> Psal. 112.6, 9. <hi>Every one is a friend to a man of gifts,</hi> Prov. 19.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This will be a means to render our prayers and other services accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to entitle us to the Divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. 'Tis mentioned as an argument of Gods designing mercy and kindness to his people, when they became duly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at his displeasure against them in the ruin of their <hi>Temple,</hi> and were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to engage in the repair of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.13, 14. <hi>Thou wilt arise and have mercy upon Sion, for the time to favour her, yea the set time is come. For thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants take pleasure in her stones, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the dust thereof.</hi> That <hi>Psalm</hi> is thought to be composed by <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he designed the repair of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>; and he mentions this as a ground of hope that God would now at last be
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:55636:197"/>
favourable to his People, because they were affected with a sad resentment at the ruins of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and a zeal for the repair of it. Where 'tis implied to be a mournful spectacle to see the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of God lying in the dust, under decay and ruin; and an argument of Gods favour to a People when he puts it into their hearts to restore such ruins.</p>
            <p>There are several things which men are apt to pretend as <hi>Excuses</hi> from such kind of duties: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The fear of want for themselves</hi>; to this the <hi>Scripture</hi> answers, that <hi>such as are bountiful shall not lack,</hi> Prov. 28:27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They must lay up for their children:</hi> Why? he that is merciful, <hi>his seed shall be blessed,</hi> Psal. 37.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But they are but of a mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being put to labour hard for a poor living. Neither should this exempt men from works of Charity. The <hi>Apostle</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts men to labour with their hands
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:55636:198"/>
for this reason, <hi>that they may be able to give to such as need,</hi> Ephes. 4.28. This indeed will alter the case as to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of such mens bounty, but will not totally excuse them from it.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Goats hair,</hi> and <hi>Badgers skins,</hi> were heretofore estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a suitable gift for the poor of the people. A brother of low degree may be allowed to give <gap reason="foreign">

But those who are rich in this world, should be rich in good works also, such were to bestow <hi>purple</hi> and <hi>gold,</hi> and <hi>jewels.</hi> And in this sense is that Scripture to be fulfilled, that <hi>to whom much is given, of them much shall be required.</hi> There being no kind of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or exception apt to rise up in the hearts of men against this duty, but the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth in several places purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obviate and answer it.</p>
            <p>I have only this one word to add, That we must all of us shortly die, and after a few days are past, must <hi>go to the place whence we shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi> And when we come to lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our death-beds, then the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our pious bounty and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:55636:198"/>
and of the <hi>good deeds we have done for the House of our God,</hi> will minister more comfort to our minds than all the vast Treasures that we can leave behind us upon Earth.

            <p>THE Book of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> is a Miscellany of Sentences full of various and profound wisdom; such <hi>ruling Sentences,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as are fit to have a special authority over a man in the guidance of his affairs. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all kind of matters, the <hi>customs, vices, humours</hi> of men, the various <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> of life. <hi>Quicquid agunt homines, votum, timor, ira, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptas; Gaudia, discursus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because there is no greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of wisdom (which is the thing here professed to be taught) than the due regulating of our <hi>words</hi> and <hi>spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> therefore is there no other subject which the <hi>Wiseman</hi> doth more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insist upon than this. And 'tis one of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:55636:200"/>
his <hi>Proverbs</hi> of this kind that I have now made choice to treat of.</p>
            <p>Amongst the many other Rules and Qualifications to be observed in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our Words, that of <hi>mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> or <hi>meekness,</hi> both as to the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of them is one of the most considerable.</p>
            <p>And there is a special elegance in the <hi>Text</hi> to this purpose; 'tis one of those Proverbs that doth consist both of <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes</hi> and <hi>Antitheses</hi> or oppositions, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word in it is figurative and metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical. The reducing of them to their plain and natural significations will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently unfold the meaning of them, and may serve for Explication.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>Tongue</hi> we are to understand the speech or discourse, by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>cause</hi> for the <hi>effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By the <hi>softness</hi> of it, is meant that kind of disposition which is answerable to tenderness and yieldingness amongst tactile qualities, when a thing doth not resist the touch, so as to be offensive to it, but doth rather gently yield and give place to it. 'Tis styled elsewhere by the name of <hi>smoothness,</hi> and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>butter</hi> and <hi>oyl,</hi> Psal. 55.21.</p>

                  </gap>, qui sapit amica:</hi> When a man endeavours to speak things benign and grateful, in whom there is a facility or accommodateness for humane converse.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Kindness,</hi> Prov. 31.26. the <hi>Law of Kindness</hi> is said to be <hi>in the tongue</hi> of a virtuous person. The original word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifies properly <hi>benignity,</hi> mercifulness, benevolence. The saying or doing more in the behalf of others, than in strictness we are obliged unto.</p>
            <p>These are the several Virtues com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the metaphor of a <hi>soft tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:55636:201"/>The <hi>Opposites</hi> to it are described in Scripture by these other expressions,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hardness,</hi> in opposition to <hi>soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.13. 'tis said that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi> answered the people <hi>hardly,</hi> as 'tis properly rendered in the <hi>Margent,</hi> in the Original <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the same <hi>Greek</hi> word that in the 15<hi>th</hi> verse by St. <hi>Iude</hi> is translated <hi>hard speeches</hi>; it denotes properly things that are harsh, stiff, rigorous; 'tis the same <hi>Hebrew</hi> word with that which is render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>churlishness,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.3. <hi>Nabal</hi> is there said to be an <hi>evil &amp; churlish person,</hi> a difficult intractable man, such as no art or industry could make pliable, or manage to any good purpose, as may be easily guessed by the manner of that answer which he returned to <hi>Davids</hi> messengers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Roughness</hi> in opposition to <hi>smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Prov. 18.23. <hi>The poor useth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, but the rich answereth roughly. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> fortia, robusta, sava,</hi> boisterousness, imperiousness, that which is opposite to the meekness of obsecrations and intreaties.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Sharpness,</hi> under the comparison of <hi>swords</hi> and <hi>arrows,</hi> and <hi>stings,</hi> and <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zors,</hi> that which is apt to pierce and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:55636:201"/>
wound men, instead of that opposite quality of <hi>Healing,</hi> which there should be in a virtuous tongue.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Bitterness,</hi> we read, <hi>Ps.</hi> 64.3. of <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words</hi>; and <hi>cursing</hi> is styled <hi>bitterness, Iam.</hi> 3.10, 11. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.11. they are both put together as being <hi>synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</hi> Amongst other kinds of <hi>evil speaking,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> reckons <hi>bitterness and wrath, and anger,</hi> which are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.31. 'tis styled by this name, because it hath such a kind of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the <hi>mind</hi> of others as this quality of <hi>bitterness</hi> hath upon the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> to constringe and nauseate it. <hi>For the ear tasteth words as the mouth tasteth meats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Clamor, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, noise,</hi> loudness; which is likewise forbidden in that forecited place, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.31. because 'tis usually an indication of some such eager passions as do not become a sober and prudent man, and are not suitable to the spirit of Christianity.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Brawling,</hi> Tit. 3.2. <hi>to speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a verbal pugnacity, an aptness to wrangle and contend in words, to <hi>smite with the tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:55636:202"/>And so much shall serve for <hi>explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of <hi>softness,</hi> together with the <hi>opposites</hi> to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the word <hi>bone,</hi> is meant that kind of <hi>hardness</hi> which is opposite to this <hi>softness,</hi> that is, surly, fierce, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable passions or dispositions; or else such with whom, by reason of their place and distance, 'tis difficult for a man to prevail, as is implied in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the verse, <hi>By long forbearing is a Prince perswaded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. By <hi>breaking</hi> is meant perswading (as in the forecited clause) pacifying, convincing, appeasing, prevailing with. In brief, it signifies the subduing and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the proper effect of hardness, which is to resist and oppose any thing that it meets with. Now things that are hard are not usually broken, but by such bodies as are more hard than they; so that herein lyes the proper elegance of the <hi>Text,</hi> that the <hi>tongue,</hi> which is a fleshy, tender and weak part, should by the <hi>softness</hi> of it, be able to <hi>break</hi> that which is the hardest of all the rest, the <hi>bones</hi>; and yet so it is that a meek and gentle way of discourse is the most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual means to overcome the fiercest passions, and most obdurate cruel dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:55636:202"/>
And that is the true sense of the words stript off their <hi>Metaphors</hi>; and 'tis the <hi>Proposition</hi> I intend to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</p>
            <p>There are several other Scriptures to this purpose, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.1. <hi>A soft an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer turns away wrath.</hi> By <hi>wrath</hi> is meant the height and intention of anger; a soft answer is prescribed as the best way to divert and appease it: <hi>Be ready always to give an answer with meekness and reverence,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. and then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next verse, <hi>That those who speak evil of you, and accuse you, may be ashamed.</hi> A calm and gentle way in vindicating our selves is the most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual means to work confusion in such as would calumniate and reproach us. 'Twas St. <hi>Pauls</hi> advised this, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. <hi>In meekness instructing those that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselves,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, though they be such as set themselves against us. And his practice was accordingly. <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntiche</hi> were two women in the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> who (it should seem) were at variance betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, St. <hi>Paul</hi> might have made use of his Apostolical authority to have stated the difference, and to have rebuk'd the offending party; but he rather chuseth
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:55636:203"/>
this more effectual way of entreaty; and perhaps they were both in fault: <hi>I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntiche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord,</hi> Phil. 4.2. But the great power and efficacy of this will better appear, by the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral instances and examples to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose recorded in Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. we have a story of <hi>Esau</hi>'s meeting his brother <hi>Iacob; Esau</hi> was a <hi>rough man</hi> as well in his <hi>inward</hi> dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as his <hi>outward</hi> behaviour and way of living, and 'tis probable by his bringing four hundred men with him, that he came with a purpose of being revenged, and killing his brother <hi>Iacob,</hi> according to his former resolution, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.41. but those mild and humble expressions of <hi>Iacob</hi> in styling him <hi>Lord,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a <hi>Servant</hi>; that message he sent by the men who were to convey the droves, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Behold thy servant Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob is behind us, for he said I will appease him with a present, and afterwards I will see his face, peradventure he will accept of me.</hi> These speeches did so soften the rugged and inflexible disposition of <hi>Esau,</hi> that instead of taking revenge he offers his brother kindness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:55636:203"/>
               <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8.1. when the men of <hi>Ephraim</hi> did enter into a high contest with <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and did <hi>chide with him sharply,</hi> as the Text hath it, he did by his mild and gentle answer, allay their heat: <hi>Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the vintage of Abiezer? then their anger was abated towards him, when he said that,</hi> v. 3.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. Old <hi>Eli,</hi> who was mild more than enough towards his wicked Sons, yet very severe in his censuring of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> when he tells her she was drunk, <hi>v.</hi> 14. she might have replied that he wronged her, and that she was no more drunk than himself; but she rather chuses to answer, <hi>Not so my Lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit, I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord; count not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial, ver.</hi> 15, 16. Upon this mild answer of hers, the old <hi>Prophet</hi> saw himself mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and for his rebuking he now bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses her, <hi>Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition,</hi> v. 17.</p>
            <p>What a kind of temper <hi>Saul</hi> was of, how full of passion and fierceness and cruelty doth appear by several instances; what an enmity he had against <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:55636:204"/>
with what ardor and impatience he did desire his ruin, may likewise be evident from his secret underminings, and his open pursuit of him; and yet this harsh and cruel disposition of his, is strangely wrought upon by the mild and humble carriage of <hi>David.</hi> When he had cut off the skirt of his garment, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. and thereby testified his fidelity to him, in that he had refused an opportunity of hurting him, when it was in his power; styling him, <hi>My Lord</hi> and <hi>my Father, the Lords Anointed, the King of Israel,</hi> in comparison to whom himself was but as <hi>a dead dog,</hi> or a <hi>flea, v.</hi> 14. 'Tis said this did immediately so melt and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve that stony heart of <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>he lift up his voice and wept, Animum san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis &amp; caedis sitientem repente ad la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta &amp; ejulatus compulit,</hi>

                  <hi>Chrysost.</hi>
               </note> saith one of the <hi>Fathers:</hi> Whereas before he thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted for nothing so much as blood and slaughter, now he is so effectually wrought upon by this mildness as to break out into tears of kindness and pity. And now he returns him a gentle answer, <hi>Is it thy voice my son David, v.</hi> 16. Whom before he prosecuted as his chiefest enemy, now he acknowledges for a Son, and commits to him (as if
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:55636:204"/>
he were his dearest friend) the care of his posterity. <hi>V.</hi> 21. <hi>Swear now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto me, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, nor destroy my name out of my Fathers house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. There is another pregnant example to this purpose. When <hi>David</hi> was in a great chafe and fury against <hi>Nabal,</hi> and in the heat of his passion had taken an Oath to kill all that belonged to him, <hi>v.</hi> 22. for that churlish and taunting answer returned by his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers; then doth <hi>Abigal</hi> by her soft and gentle speeches mollifie and allay this passion, she fell at his feet and said, <hi>Let thy handmaid I pray thee speak in thine audience. v.</hi> 24. She acknowledges the fault, that he had deserved better from <hi>Nabal</hi>; beseeches his pardon, and tells him, that <hi>it will hereafter be no grief or offence of heart unto my Lord, that thou hast not shed blood causeless, or avenged thy self. V.</hi> 31. By which she present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reduced him to a coolness and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, made him gentle as a Lamb, who was before fierce as a Lyon. When our <hi>Saviour</hi> called the <hi>Caananitish</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Dog</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.</note> We know how her humble and gentle answer prevailed with him, for the success of her petition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:55636:205"/>And it may be pertinent to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, though it be in a Parable, what we read <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.23. of a certain King who called his Servants to an account, and finding that one of them owed him ten thousand Talents, commanded him to be sold with his Wife and Children and all that he had, who thereupon <hi>fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord have patience with we and I will pay thee all.</hi> Ye know the issue of this humble demeanour? 'tis said, <hi>His Lord was moved with compassion towards him, and forgave him his debt, v.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>Thus much shall serve for Scripture Testimonies and examples to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. I proceed to the further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this truth by two <hi>Reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. From the <hi>nature of these fierce pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> and this obduracy or hardness of temper, which are increased by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and consequently must be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by gentleness and yielding. The collision of two bodies that are hard, will be apt to strike fire betwixt them, which cannot be done when one of them is soft. Wrath is oftentimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to fire; now the way to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish fire is not by blowing it, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fewel to it, but rather by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:55636:205"/>
that by which it is supplyed: And it was a wise saying of the Son of <hi>Sirach, Ecclesiasticus</hi> 8.3. <hi>He that stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth with a man of tongue, heaps wood upon his fire</hi>; and again <hi>chap.</hi> 28.12. <hi>If thou blow the spark it shall burn, if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched, and both these come out of the mouth: i. e.</hi> such words may be spoken as may either <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame</hi> the anger of others, or <hi>extinguish</hi> it; and of what kind these must be, may be easily known by what I have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing. I appeal to every mans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; did you ever know any man convinced or converted by this wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful boistrous way? doth it not rather alienate mens minds, and set them at a further distance? true indeed, it may be a means to fright some meaner time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous spirits to a seeming feigned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, to make them disguise their enmity, but it will never work them over to a hearty conviction, and make them true friends. With what reason can any man expect those counsels should be effectual, which are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in such a way as to argue a hatred and contempt of the persons whom we would perswade. Though a man be supposed to have the truth on his side,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:55636:206"/>
and should be able to urge very cogent and strong arguments for the proof of it; yet if they should be pressed with scorn and harshness and bitterness, the <hi>reason</hi> of them will not so much enforce, as the <hi>passion</hi> of them will weaken and disparage them: It will undoubtedly be the most effectual way to put <hi>hard</hi> arguments into <hi>soft</hi> words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the <hi>nature of Lenity</hi> and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness, whose property it is to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it self into the hardest things. 'Tis compared to <hi>Oyle,</hi> which will pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate and supple more than any other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. He that goes about to convince and perswade another, if he doth so manage it that it may appear he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends kindness to the person whom he would prevail upon, that he hath a love for him, and doth heartily desire his welfare, his work is half done. That prophecy <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.4. <hi>Ride on prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously because of the word of truth and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> doth refer to the Doctrine of the Gospel, and the Kingdom of Christ, which by the <hi>meekness</hi> of its professors, was first propagated and became trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, through the Heathen World. The true nature of things may be more clearly distinguished, when there are
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:55636:206"/>
no mists or clouds stirred up by the heat of contention. Many differences might be half reconciled, if they were but mildly debated. It was not perhaps without some mystery, that <hi>Noahs</hi> dove brought an <hi>Olive</hi> branch in her mouth, to shew the mutual dependance betwixt these two, <hi>mildness</hi> and <hi>peace.</hi> 'Tis the end of anger to bring men to a sense of their fault, or be revenged upon them for it; now a meek submission is one way of satisfying this end. Besides, that mild and gentle carriage will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the weakness and deformity of rage and fierceness, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect may be a means to break it in others.</p>
            <p>This expression in the Text concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hardest things being broken by the softest, may perhaps contain in it an allusion to that ordinary experiment of breaking of Flint upon a Pillow, and a Sword upon a Feather-bed; when the concussion of a blow is more equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispersed into all the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy so as to operate upon the weakest. It is <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his counsel, that a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician should alwayes be provided with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Lenitives,</hi> gentle mollifying applications, as being of frequent use
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:55636:207"/>
and great efficacy; and they are so no less to the <hi>minds</hi> and passions of men, than to their <hi>bodily diseases.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come to the <hi>Application</hi> of this Point, there are these <hi>three Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to be spoken unto for the clearer stating of it, How this Doctrine may consist with
<list>
                  <item>1. Those <hi>Imprecations,</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Those severe <hi>Increpations,</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The duty of <hi>zeal</hi> and reproving.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Imprecations</hi> and Curses. We have frequent example of these in Scripture,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obj.</hi>
               </note> not only against sin in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as those pronounced in Mount <hi>Ebal</hi>; but likewise against particular persons. They are frequent in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and especially that 109. <hi>Psalm</hi>; and in the <hi>New Testament</hi> likewise, St. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8.20. <hi>Thy Money pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with thee.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Elymas, Acts</hi> 13.10. and elsewhere to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-smith. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. and he wishes <hi>they were cut off that trouble the Church. Gal.</hi> 5.12. Besides the many <hi>woes</hi> which are denounced by our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> himself against the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees.</hi> Now the Question is, How these examples may consist with this Doctrine concerning <hi>soft words?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:55636:207"/>To this several things may be said by way of Answer and Solution,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi>
               </note> which the time will not permit me to insist upon, I shall only mention these few.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Diverse of these <hi>Imprecations</hi> in Scripture, though they are pronounced <hi>optatively,</hi> yet are they to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>declaratively,</hi> as being declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the true state and condition of such persons. They are <hi>Verba praedicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, non vota imprecantium,</hi> as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> speaks. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Phrase in those places which are rendred as Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, being as well capable of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative</hi> future, as the <hi>Imperative</hi> Mood and sense.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Those who used these Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were such as were extraordinary Persons, endowed with the Spirit of discerning, whereby they were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to judge of the incurable state of those with whom they conversed. There are some that are <hi>cursed Children,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>filii maledictionis, execrandi homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and to such curses are reserved as their due portion: And therefore no wonder though such as had an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Spirit of discerning their true state do use imprecations against them,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:55636:208"/>
which yet can be no warrant for other persons to imitate. As none but the Magistrate may use the Sword for revenge, because of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick station and calling, whereby he is authorized for it; so none but extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Prophetical men should use these maledictions. If others shall presume upon it because of their example, they will justly fall under the rebuke of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.55. <hi>You know not what Spirit ye are of.</hi> The ordinary rule prescribed for mens practice, is that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Bless I say and curse not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We are to consider the motive or affection, upon which such imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as we read of have proceeded; which were not carnal, or rash anger or desire of revenge in reference to any particular hurt or injury against themselves, the usual occasions of them in other men; but Spiritual and Divine, respecting the interest and cause of God and zeal for his glory. In our own cases we are taught to be patient and long suffering, praying for our persecutors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The wishing of evil directly to any under the notion of evil, must needs be malice, and can never be lawful;
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:55636:208"/>
Not but that 'tis lawful to pray for such things as by way of consequence will necessarily imply a blasting and kind of malediction upon the attempts of others, which is no way inconsistent with the true happiness of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. The wishing of such kind of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral evils, as tend to the preventing of greater evils, or else are to be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by way of correction and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of Divine Justice, are not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the rules of Charity. 'Tis law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to wish conditionally some temporal evils upon our selves by way of correction and restraint from sin, that God would rather afflict us than suffer sin upon us; and consequently we may wish the same to others, the love of our selves being the rule and measure of our love to others. Of this nature was that petition <hi>Psal.</hi> 83.16. <hi>Fill their faces with shame O Lord, that they may seek thy name.</hi> This is not to pray against them but for them. We may likewise pray against the unjust actions and attempts of our enemies. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.29. <hi>And now O Lord! behold their threatnings,</hi> but not against their persons. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> speaking concerning this Question, in his <hi>Cases of Conscience,</hi> concludes it to
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55636:209"/>
be unlawful for a man to pray against the person of the <hi>Pope,</hi> though he should believe him to be the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> but only against his <hi>Antichristian</hi> state and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby he sets himself against the Kingdom of Christ. As for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations of <hi>David</hi> that are sometimes repeated out of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> they are by us to be used, either as the Historical part of Scripture, or else as being dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted against the kingdom of sin in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the obdurate implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God; or as being a kind of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, wherein the punishment and revenge of such is foretold.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Obj.</hi>
               </note>2. How may this Doctrine of mild and soft words consist with those severe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepations</hi> in Scripture. Doth not our Saviour call the Pharisees, <hi>Serpents, and generation of vipers,</hi> Mat. 23.33? and <hi>Herod</hi> by the name of <hi>Fox, Luk.</hi> 13.32? Doth not the <hi>Apostle</hi> style some among the <hi>Philippians, doggs,</hi> Phil. 3.2? <hi>Beware of dogs</hi>; and the <hi>Galatians, Fools,</hi> 3.1?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note>To this it may be said, 1. That such Prophetical men as have an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary spirit of discerning, whereby they are able to judg the true state of others, may use such hard words towards them, which it may not be lawful for others
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:55636:209"/>
to imitate, as was said before concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imprecations. 2. Those that are in a publick station or in such a superior relation to us, as doth authorize them to correct and punish us, may likewise chide and reprehend us with severity; but not such as are of a private conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or have no superiority over us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How may this consist with the duties of <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>reproving,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Obj.</hi>
               </note> which ought sometimes to be done with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Rebuke them sharply.</hi> He that saith, <hi>Be angry and sin not,</hi> doth seem to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that a man may sometimes sin in not being angry, when by his sinful si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and lenity, he either really doth, or else seems to consent unto, and be partaker with others in their offences?</p>
            <p>To this it may be said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> that 'tis not the nature of these things to oppose, but to regulate one another. We read, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.13. of <hi>meekness of wisdom,</hi> that is, such a wise mildness as will direct a man how to order his zeal and rebukes, both as to the degrees, objects, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and manner of expressing them. That's a bottomless boundless charity and severity which extends alike to all persons and offences. Let the proper objects of these be duly distinguished,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:55636:210"/>
and these graces may very well consist together and be subservient to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When the matter we are to speak to, doth require any special indignation, it should appear to proceed from the zeal of a displeased friend, rather than the bitterness of a provoked enemy. It should seem to argue too much levity, for men to accustom themselves to an <hi>Ironical</hi> and jeering way of rebuking others; nor is it so sutable to that aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reverence which men should be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with in the discharge of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial employments. And it will be too much rashness to check men in a passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate revengeful manner.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Appl.</hi>
               </note>For the <hi>Application</hi> of what hath been said, I would infer these few <hi>Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If soft words be of such a prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing efficacy upon men, above such as are wrathful and harsh, then soft and gentle <hi>Actions</hi> must be so too. Words being of no other force than as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note our inward thoughts or outward actions. We read <hi>Hos.</hi> 11.4. of the <hi>bands of a man,</hi> and the <hi>cords of love</hi>; imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that to such as have not put off the nature of Humanity, there can be no such powerful obligation as that of kindness.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:55636:210"/>2. The <hi>folly and sinfulness of hard speeches,</hi> to which may be reduced <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, reviling, upbraiding, scoffing</hi> or <hi>taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, brawling, masterliness,</hi> or imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of speech, <hi>ostentation, scorning, churlishness</hi> and <hi>roughness,</hi> or any other the like dispositions, whereby others may be provoked to anger and offence; which will not become any man that pretends to Christianity in his ordinary converse, much less Ministers, and least of all in the discharge of this solemn duty. <hi>Nugae in ore sacerdotis sunt blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemiae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>lawfulnese and fitness of giving men the reverence and honour in respect of their proper Titles, just praise and other civil respects, belonging to their places and degrees.</hi> Against that melancholick generation of men, of late risen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, who place so much of their Religion in being unmannerly; than which nothing is more disagreeable to the light of nature, or to the precepts and practice of Scripture.

man that due esteem, both in our carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and words, which according to the rules of justice or charity, may belong unto him in respect of his <hi>place</hi> or <hi>abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> or <hi>condition.</hi> The compellations of <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> are frequently used in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> by way of civil respect to those in a superior condition. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did not give any check to the <hi>Iaylour,</hi> Act. 16.30. when he styl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>As for that Objection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.8, 9. <hi>Call no man Father upon earth, neither be ye called Masters.</hi> This cannot refer to
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:55636:212"/>
those Titles of respect, which concern Natural or Civil Relations, because these words were afterward frequently used by the <hi>Apostles</hi> in this sense; but they must refer to that signification of the words, wherein they were given to the leading men of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> whose dictates and Traditions were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without any examination or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, as if they had a <hi>masterly</hi> or <hi>paternal</hi> power over the faith of men, and in this sense <hi>God only is our Father or Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. For the Reprehension of such as are apt to be transported unto bitter and provoking words. This is very <hi>unmanly,</hi> as being against the rules of <hi>Morality,</hi> and very <hi>unchristian,</hi> against the precepts of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Though others should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with us by provoking language, yet 'twill not be proper for us to return the like, this were to draw the saw of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which must needs make a very harsh ungrateful noise to any sober hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. 'Twere more noble to yield to our adversary in this kind, than to subdue him; whereas if you do not give place to him, you must give place to anger, and that is to give place to the Devil.

pretence that it is the sins of others by which they are provoked to use so much sharpness to them; and against sin men ought to be zealously angry.</p>
            <p>There are two Considerations I would suggest to such: 1. Have you any zeal against your own sins, do they fasten upon your thoughts with any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure and trouble proportionably to the injuries you suffer from men. To pretend that your zeal is against the sins of others, when you have little sense of your own must needs be hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie. 2. If it be a sense of the sin and fault of others that you are so affected with, then you will be willing to use the most effectual way for the redressing of it, which is by such kind of reproofs as proceed from love, not anger or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, such as may convince not exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. Let it be supposed that the thing you contend for is truth, yet you must <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>follow the truth in love.</hi> If one man may be fierce and severe because he is in the right, why then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man that doth but think himself so, will be so too; and at this rate, what would become of peace and society a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men?</p>

               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:55636:214"/>4. I proceed to a word of <hi>Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> to perswade us unto that kind of softness and lenity in our speeches, which is here commended.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the <hi>sinfulness, danger, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi> of the contrary disposition in a threefold regard.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>effect</hi> of it. 'Tis quite opposite to the other. As <hi>a soft tongue breaks the bone,</hi> so an hard tongue will be so far from breaking that which is hard, nay or so much as that which is soft, that it will rather render it more obdurate.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 15 1.</note> 
               <hi>Grievous words will stir up an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> even amongst men of gentle and peaceable dispositions. <hi>David</hi> was a man of a meek and humble spirit, and yet what transport of fury was he under upon the churlish answer of <hi>Nabal.</hi> And though at another time when his spirit was low and he was under great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he did with another kind of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per endure the revilings of <hi>Shimei</hi>; yet that made an impression upon him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; and his followers were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no little indignation upon it, as may appear by that speech of <hi>Abisha, Why should this dead dog curse my Lord the King, let me go over I pray thee, and take off his head, ver.</hi> 9. When the people
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:55636:215"/>
were assembled at the Coronation of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.4.</note> professing their readiness to serve him, and beseeching him to make their yoke lighter, upon his answering of them roughly, you know what a mischievous consequence happened.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Punishment</hi> belonging to it. There are many severe threats and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denounced in Scripture against <hi>hard speeches.</hi> Psal. 12.3. <hi>The Lord will cut off the tongue that speaketh proud things.</hi> Pride is the principle of this hardness, as humility is of softness, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Whosoever shall say to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Racha, i. e.</hi> whosoever shall out of anger call him vain empty fellow, shall be in danger of the Council, or the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of stoning; whosoever shall use any more virulent opprobrious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and <hi>call him fool,</hi> shall be in danger of the <hi>Vivicomburium,</hi> to be burnt alive, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) there shall hereafter at the last judgment be such a kind of grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the punishment of these sins, as there are for the most Capital offences among men. One of the principal things that men shall hereafter be condemned for, when <hi>the Lord cometh with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of his Saints to execute judgment,</hi> is <hi>their hard speeches, Iude</hi> 15.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:55636:215"/>3. 'Tis <hi>an indication of a rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hewen spirit,</hi> not reduced from its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ferity and savageness; not polished by education, not tamed and made gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for civil converse. <hi>A Fool will upbraid churlishly, Ecclus.</hi> 18.18. 'Tis for a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> to use hard words. All kind of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty is commonly an argument of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardice. There is not usually a surer sign of an inveterate ill nature, than the habit of sharp provoking speeches. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the Son of <hi>Sirach, Ecclus.</hi> 23.15. <hi>The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words, will never be reformed all the days of his life.</hi> 'Tis the work of a <hi>Shimei</hi> and a <hi>Rabshekah</hi> to <hi>revile,</hi> who upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count are infamous to a <hi>Proverb.</hi> 'Tis observable that in the distribution of the <hi>Tribes,</hi> betwixt mount <hi>Gerizim</hi> and mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> for the work of <hi>blessing</hi> and <hi>cursing</hi>; those Tribes for the most part were appointed to stand upon mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> who were the children of the <hi>bondwomen,</hi> less noble and generous than the rest, and so the fitter for this harsh and servile work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are other motives to this purpose, to be derived from the <hi>benefit</hi> and advantage of soft words, besides the <hi>efficacy</hi> and power of them.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:55636:216"/>1. They are of great <hi>Ornament</hi>; which should be a prevailing motive. Men usually put an high value upon, and take great pains for those abilities which will render their speech graceful and acceptable, to which nothing will contribute more than this. Upon which account the Scripture styles it by this name, that very Word which in one place is called <hi>kindness of the tongue,</hi> in another place is rendered <hi>goodliness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.26.</note> 
               <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.6. <hi>All flesh is grass, and the goodliness,</hi> &amp;c. implying that nothing is more <hi>comely</hi> and <hi>graceful</hi> than this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Its <hi>suitableness to our profession,</hi> from the pattern set us by our <hi>Lord and Master. Meekness</hi> was <hi>the grace of his lips; when he was reviled, he reviled not again, when he suffered he threatned not,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23. He was mild and gentle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his betrayers, accusers, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, crucifiers, <hi>As a sheep before his shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</hi> And he hath prescribed our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him in this, as the surest way to <hi>find rest for our souls, Mat.</hi> 11.29. 'Tis for dogs and swine to bark and tear, and bite one another; Christians are, or should be, sheep and lambs.</p>
            <p>In brief, 'tis a qualification this, that is usually an indication of wisdom and
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:55636:216"/>
greatness of mind, 'tis profitable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane society, acceptable to God, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to men, advantageous to our quiet, honour, safety, and therefore upon all these accounts may justly challenge our care and study.</p>
            <p>I have been forced to run over some of these things but slightly, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tedious. And Oh that what I have said might effectually prevail with men, <hi>to lay aside all that bitterness and wrath, and evil speaking,</hi> which persons of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perswasions have in all times, been prone to; that we might in this kind unanimously join our hearts, and tongues and pens, to promote the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace and prosperity both of Church and State. What kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and obsecrations should we not use towards one another for this end. But men can but speak to the ear, 'tis God that must speak to the heart; let us beseech him, the God of all pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and comfort, that he would bestow upon us soft hearts, and soft tongues; that he would <hi>set a watch before our mouths, and keep the door of our lips</hi>; that upon the experience we have had, of the mischief of mutual exasperations, we may now every one of us apply our
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:55636:217"/>
selves to the most effectual means for composing the spirits of men, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their differences, that laying aside all other provocations, we may make this our business, <hi>to consider one another, to provoke unto love and good works.</hi>

            <p>THESE Words are among several other precepts and counsels which seem to have no connexion with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore I shall handle them absolutely without any reference to the Context.</p>
            <p>And there are these three parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in the words:

            <p>I have severed the <hi>Text</hi> into these parts for the more orderly explication
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:55636:218"/>
of the several <hi>Terms</hi> contained in it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Concerning the <hi>virtue</hi> enjoined, <hi>your Moderation,</hi>

The <hi>Aethiopic, Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas vestra,</hi> your Autority; for which there seems to be very little ground in the signification of the word. Others <hi>Humanitas:</hi> Our <hi>old Translation</hi> did ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it by the word <hi>Patience.</hi> And the same original word is by our <hi>present Translation</hi> so rendred, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3.

            <p>The <hi>Hebrews</hi> express the same notion by three words, derived from the root <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The one signifying <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude,</hi> the other <hi>readiness to pardon,</hi> the other <hi>Peace.</hi>

                  <hi>Aristot. Ethic. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</note>The <hi>Philosopher</hi> in his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> where he treats particularly of it, makes it to be a <hi>species</hi> or branch of <hi>Iustice,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:55636:218"/>
we are directed and inclined to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that by right reason, which is not provided for in the words of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law. Because 'tis not possible in the making of general Rules or Laws to foresee all such particular cases and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances as may happen. Therefore that habit whereby a man is inabled and inclined to deal according to the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table sense of the Law, and to allow for such particular circumstances as may make a real difference in several Cases, this is styled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>equity,</hi> which is a moral <hi>virtue</hi> placed betwixt the two <hi>extremes</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>rigour,</hi> or <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum jus</hi> on the one hand, insisting too much upon the letter; and <hi>relaxatio nimia,</hi> remitting too much from the true sense of it, on the other hand. Now both these extremes, the excess and the defect being evidently vices, it must thence necessarily follow, that the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> betwixt them must be a virtue, and have in it the obligation of a duty.</p>
            <p>So that he who in those things which the Law-giver could not particularly provide for doth judg according to the equitable sense of the Law, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> an equal Magistrate. And he who in such a case is willing to depart from his
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:55636:219"/>
own strict right, out of compliance with that meaning which the Legislator would in such a case have particularly determined could he have foreseen it, is <hi>homo aequus,</hi> as a private person.</p>
            <p>But now besides this forinsecal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word as it refers to positive Laws, and the dispensation of justice, there may yet be another more general sense of it, with relation to all kind of differences and contests amongst men, whether in matters of Opinion or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; wherein they should demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves towards one another with such a kind of temper as may be mutually best for all, and may in the various changes and revolutions of things, most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the good of mankind. And so 'tis a virtue inclining us to such a kind of benign and equitable temper in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with one another, whereby we may endeavour to preserve concord and amity in our treating concerning those things about which we differ.</p>
            <p>There are some virtues that go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der several names, and yet are of the same family and very near of kin, being differenced rather <hi>modally</hi> than <hi>specifical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> from the quality and condition of the <hi>person</hi> by whom they are to be exercised.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:55636:219"/>
So the same virtue which in the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of men we call <hi>meekness and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> this in superiours is styled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> which is <hi>lenitas superioris adversus inferiorem.</hi> Not that it hath any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent form or act, but is only distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the object towards whom 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised, namely towards those of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior rank. And thus it is with this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is a kind of meekness, with this peculiar difference that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers more especially to matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, and doth always incline to the most amicable and gentle way in judging of and accommodating of things, and such a prudent relaxation of the utmost rigor, as right reason shall direct according to the variety of cases and circumstances.</p>
            <p>And this I conceive to be the most proper notion of this word, according to its true scope and extent. There are several other virtues of affinity to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either fruits or concomitants of it, which I may have occasion to speak of afterwards.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Second</hi> particular observed in the words, was the <hi>extent</hi> or manner of this virtues being exercised, it must be <hi>known unto all men,</hi> which phrase may signifie three these things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:55636:220"/>1. Those <hi>manifest</hi> and real <hi>proofs</hi> we are to give of this Virtue; which must be such as may be seen and <hi>known unto all men.</hi> It must not only be internal as to our temper and frame of mind, but external too in all our dealings and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it be <hi>signal</hi> and eminent as to the <hi>degree</hi> of it, as being one of those properties whereby Christians are to be distinguished from other Professions and Sects of men in the world. Their <hi>light</hi> must <hi>so shine before men, that others see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their good works,</hi> may speak well of them. They must <hi>adorn the doctrine</hi> they profess, by such a demeanour as may win over others to a love of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it be <hi>universal</hi> as to the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> of it, both in regard of the <hi>Acts, Objects</hi> and <hi>Occasions</hi> of it, by shewing equity and moderation in all businesses, towards all persons, as well inferiors as superiors, the unconverted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the contentious <hi>Iews</hi>; that neither of these may have any just ground <hi>to accuse our good conversation.</hi> 'Tis no difficult matter for men to be fair and kind, and moderate towards such as are of the same way, and agree with them in the main. This is but a common and low
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55636:220"/>
attainment, and is not thank-worthy, doth not deserve any peculiar commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. The rules of Christianity do oblige to a greater extent of it, <hi>namely</hi> that it should be towards all men.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Third</hi> particular observed in the words is the <hi>reason</hi> or argument to enforce this duty, <hi>The Lord is at hand, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, propè,</hi> he is near. Which phrase is capable of various senses. It may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To his presence with us, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of our actions. He always looks on, and takes notice what our carriage and demeanour is; whether it be with that gentleness and equity towards others, as his is towards us. He observes all our ways, and therefore we had need to demean our selves as being under his eye.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes this phrase of Gods being near doth refer to approaching judgments. So the time of the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is styled the <hi>coming of the day of Christ,</hi> when he should exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute temporal judgments upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Upon which account St. <hi>Iohn</hi> styles that age by the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the last hour,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.18. So likewise is that place interpreted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.37.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:55636:221"/>
               <hi>Ye have need of patience, for yet a little while, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and he that shall come will come and will not tarry.</hi> The scope of it being to comfort them that were ready to fall off from Christianity, upon the persecution of the <hi>Iews,</hi> amongst whom the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Christians lived.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is near in respect of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Judgment, and that in a twofold respect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of every mans particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar judgment at the time of his death. 'Tis but a little while that we are to continue in this world, we must shortly die, none of these lesser things are worth our eager contention. We should so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean our selves at the present, as may bring us comfort at the last.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In respect of the general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That time cannot be far off, <hi>The end of all things is at hand,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.7. <hi>He that shall come will come and will not tarry.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.10.</note> 
               <hi>The Iudg is at the door, Iam.</hi> 5.9. There are several passages in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which seem to intimate as if the <hi>Christians</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times did expect that this day should come before the end of that generation. Which St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth caution them against, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:55636:221"/>
2.2. <hi>Be not soon shaken in mind or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as if the day of Christ were at hand.</hi> So near at hand it was not. The belief and expectation of that, as if this were the sense of those Prophecies concerning it, might upon the disappointment of it, prove a temptation to unbelief and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie from the Christian faith: And therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> thinks fit to rectifie that mistake and prevent the further progress of it. But yet since no man knew when that day and hour would come, Christians ought always to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themselves as if it were at hand, and to live in a continual expectation of that time when Christ shall come to judg the world and to vindicate his Saints: When he shall <hi>render to every man according to his works,</hi> to them who by a moderate demeanour of themselves, amidst the various conditions of this life, and <hi>by a patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honour, eternal life.</hi> But to them that are violent and <hi>contentious, tribulation</hi> and <hi>anguish, Rom.</hi> 2.7, 8. And therefore there is upon this account very good reason why <hi>our moderation should be known unto all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:55636:222"/>The words thus explained will afford this <hi>Observation:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis the duty of Christians to give signal testimony of their equity and moderation upon all occasions of difference and contest with one another:</hi> Not to insist upon the utmost rigour of things, but to be ready to comply with all such gentle and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent expedients, as may help to heal and accommodate the differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
            <p>Though this word <hi>Moderation</hi> do but seldom occur in Scripture, being scarce any where else used but here: yet that which is the substance and meaning of it, is frequently commanded, and the contrary thereunto prohibited, under different expressions in other places of Scripture. This some conceive to be the sense of that place, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Be not righteous over much, neither make thy self over wise, why shouldst thou destroy thy self. (i. e.)</hi> insist not upon the utmost extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of things, as if it were wisdom to take all the advantages you could from the strict letter of the Law.

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:55636:222"/>
you; there being no safety for any one, if every one must use another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the utmost rigour. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.11. <hi>It is the glory of a man to pass over a transgression.</hi> Men may think to get the repute of strictness and zeal by being rigid and severe towards the failings of others: But 'tis a much more glorious thing to shew gentleness and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance towards them; It argues a man to have a noble and generous mind, and a real sense of humanity.</p>
            <p>There are several other expressions to this purpose in the <hi>New Testament.</hi> As <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>I beseech you that ye walk worthy of that vocation wherewith ye are called, in all lowliness and meekness, with long suffering, forbearing one another in love. v.</hi> 32. <hi>And be ye kind to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tender hearted, forgiving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven you.</hi>

            <p>It were easie to back these precepts by several examples out of Scripture.

            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself was as eminent for the practice of this duty, as for the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it upon others: In his <hi>becoming all things to all men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.22. and <hi>in pleasing all men in all things, not seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:55636:223"/>
his own profit, but the profit of many, that they might be saved,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.33.</p>
            <p>Suitable to this was that carriage of the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Apostles, Act.</hi> 15. in their not insisting upon the strict right of things, but accommodating those Controversies of the Primitive times about the <hi>Iewish</hi> Rites, by such a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate expedient, as might most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally heal and compose those diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
            <p>There are two kinds of Reasons by which I would confirm the necessity of this duty. In respect of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>

If they shall from our Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be so much the more ready to injure us, He will be as ready to vindicate and reward us. <hi>Psal.</hi> 76.9. <hi>He will arise to
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:55636:224"/>
judgment, to save all the meek of the earth</hi>; here in this life. But besides, he is <hi>near</hi> in respect of that <hi>final judgment</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he will call us unto at the last:</p>
            <p>Either

                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Particular</hi> at every mans death, that time cannot be far off. When a few days are come we must all <hi>go to the place whence we shall not return.</hi> Then all other things will forsake us and vanish away, and nothing will be of any real value to us, but the conscience of well-doing, which will go along with us, and abide with us for ever. Men are here apt to put the greatest estimate upon those things that concern their secular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests and advantages, whereas such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will be of little use to us then: And 'tis usually mens being immersed in these lesser designs about some worldly selfish advantage that makes them more eager and fierce about other matters of difference.</p>
            <p>They that are of a narrow contracted soul in respect of their possessions, have not usually any largeness or generosity of mind in reference to opinion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is <hi>at hand</hi> likewise in respect
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:55636:224"/>
of his <hi>general</hi> judgment; when he will not only <hi>judg the world in equity,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks, <hi>Psal.</hi> 98.9. but for their equity likewise; when there shall be a particular account required of men for their works of <hi>Mercy, Kindness and Pity,</hi> and according as their carriage hath been in these respects here, so shall their condition be hereafter; when there shall be special notice taken of mens severe and rigorous demeanour in beating and insulting over their fellow-servants. How can such persons answer it then, when they shall expect mercy for themselves, and yet have not been ready to shew it to others? God hath told us that he will not forgive us here, without this readiness to forgive our brethren; and therefore we have no reason to expect it from him hereafter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Which brings me to the <hi>second</hi> branch of this <hi>first</hi> Reason, we should deal so with others because <hi>God deals so with us.</hi> He is kind <hi>to the unthankful and the evil. Be ye therefore merciful as your heavenly Father is merciful:</hi> 'Tis our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours inference, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.36. It were not possible that the world should subsist one moment, if it were not that his mercy did moderate the rigour of his
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:55636:225"/>
justice. If he should be <hi>severe to mark what is done amiss, who might abide it?</hi> Every minute we deserve hell, and might expect to be cast into it. It is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his compassions fail not, that we are not consumed.</hi> He considers what we are able to do and to suffer; <hi>He knows our frame and remembers that we are but dust</hi>; He chastiseth us with <hi>the rod of a man</hi>; and doth never <hi>grieve will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly or afflict the children of men</hi>: And all this he doth upon this very ground, that we might from hence learn to deal so with others. The less gentle and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate we are in our dealings with others, by so much the less sense have we of the guilt and danger of our own sins, and the less experience of Gods love and mercy in the pardon of them.</p>
            <p>That's a remarkable Parable to this purpose, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.23. concerning the Servant who being indebted to his Lord ten thousand Talents, was yet forgiven out of great compassion. After which he did notwithstanding rigorously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act from his fellow-servant an hundred pence. You know what sentence was passed upon him for it, <hi>Serve nequam, v.</hi> 32. <hi>O thou wicked servant, I forgive thee all thy debt, shouldst thou not also have
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:55636:225"/>
had compassion on thy fellow servant, even as I had pity on thee? And his Lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors. So likewise shall my heavenly Father do unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>second</hi> kind of <hi>Reasons</hi> which I proposed for the enforcing of this Duty was in respect of <hi>men,</hi> with reference to whom this virtue of <hi>Moderation</hi> will appear to be a thing,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Most <hi>reasonable</hi> and fitting <hi>in it self,</hi> considering the

            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Most <hi>beneficial</hi> and advantageous for the good of men, both in regard of
<list>
                  <item>Our <hi>own private</hi> welfare.</item>
                  <item>The good of <hi>humane Societies</hi> in general.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. 'Tis a thing most <hi>reasonable</hi> and fitting in it self, because of the <hi>Fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of humane judgment: And that not only from the impotence of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and the prejudices we are liable unto upon the account of interests, which will strangely biass a mans judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against clear evidence: But like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from the difficulty and obscurity of things; there being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:55636:226"/>
not only in Nature and Scripture, but likewise in Political things, and the ordinary concernments of humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, whether matters of Right, or of Fact: the most learned and inquisitive men many times differing in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning matters of Right: and as for matters of Story and Fact that are variously reported, if a man hath not been an eye-witness of them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, it cannot be but that he must give credit to them according to that esteem and opinion which he hath of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by whom they are related. All which put together shew how exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficult and next to impossible it is, that men should ever agree in the same apprehension of things. There is no considering man who hath with any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts reflected upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon state and condition of mankind in this respect but must needs own and acknowledg the truth of that Saying, <hi>Pauci res ipsas sequuntur, plures nomina rerum, plurimi nomina Magistrorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The generality of men being carried away by the <hi>Names</hi> of Leaders and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, taking up opinions by the bulk and in the gross, as they are owned and professed by that Party of men amongst whom they are listed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:55636:226"/>Many are swayed by the prejudice of the Names of things either for or against a thing. If an opinion or a design do but pretend to such a Name, they do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly either receive or reject it, without examining how far it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally promote or prejudice the thing they aim at.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Nature</hi> of things in themselves, there are but few, very few, who set themselves to any serious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial inquiry concerning them.</p>
            <p>Now I say, he that considers the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold mistakes which the judgments of men are liable unto upon these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, he must, unless he will go out of the world (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another occasion) demean himself towards others, with this tenderness and moderation as to the things about which they differ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the <hi>mutability</hi> of Humane affairs, which in their most secure and flourishing estate are subject to revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It being beyond the contrivance of humane wisdom, to establish things unto such a fixedness as shall exempt them from change; but many times those very courses which wise men take for the setling and securing of things,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:55636:227"/>
and which may in themselves have a natural aptitude to that purpose, are by the Providence of God made use of as the means and occasions of trouble and change:
<q>Ludit in humanis divina potentia rebus.</q>
He that hath not yet learnt this lesson upon the experience of all those various revolutions we have seen in these latter Times may deserve to be taught it, as <hi>Gideon</hi> taught the men <hi>of Succoth with briars and thorns, Iudg.</hi> 8.16.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more obvious to any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving man than this, That when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions have happened men make this their security and refuge, that they have in the former state of things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned themselves with moderation, and have by many kindnesses and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties obliged such as differed from them. And this, if any thing can, redounds to their advantage afterwards, especially if they have to do with such as have any true greatness or generosity of mind. Indeed if there were any certain way to fix the state of things unto such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable stability as could not alter, it would upon that account be more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:55636:227"/>
for a man to act with an uniform vigor and severity against every one that differed. But supposing the meer possibility of change, nothing can be more irrational than to demean our selves so towards others with that harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and severity as to render our selves incapable of receiving any kindness from them. I do not speak this out of any compliance with that <hi>Machiavilian</hi> principle which directs a man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage no further in any good cause than he can safely retreat. Every worthy man should with fidelity and courage assert the cause he is well perswaded of; But it should be without all kind of fierceness and bitterness against the persons of others, with as much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and gentleness as the nature of the thing will bear.</p>
            <p>Considering that continual mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which every condition is liable unto, and which no humane wisdom can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see and prevent, that kind of demeanour is most rational, which may be most beneficial and safe as to our own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and mutually best for all others. Which brings me to the other Branch of this <hi>second</hi> Reason.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:55636:228"/>II. This virtue is most advantageous <hi>for the good of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of every <hi>mans private quiet and welfare</hi> in particular. It will help to establish a mans title to these earthly things both with reference to
<list>
                  <item>His Possession of them.</item>
                  <item>His Fruition of them.</item>
               </list>
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.11. <hi>The meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</hi> Which is afterward repeated by our <hi>Saviour, Mat.</hi> 5.5. and again in another place, <hi>Learn of me for I am meek and lowly, and ye shall find rest for your souls, Mat.</hi> 11.29. The most effectual means to attain unto a quiet state of life with others, is to carry our selves gently and kindly to them, <hi>v.</hi> 7. of this Chapter, <hi>And the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Iesus,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. The <hi>Apostle</hi> having exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to be <hi>pitiful</hi> and <hi>courteous, not rendring evil for evil,</hi> or <hi>railing for rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but contrariwise blessing,</hi> he presently subjoins, <hi>he that will love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, let him seek peace and ensue it.</hi> And then presently after, <hi>Who is he that will
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:55636:228"/>
harm you if you be followers of that which is good?</hi> No such way to render our lives quiet, comfortable and safe, as to demean our selves with candor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity towards those with whom we converse: And that not only in respect of the effects and consequences of such carriage, but from the nature of the thing it self; it supposeth a calm and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date temper of mind. Whereas on the other side, that eagerness and fierceness of disposition, whereby a man is apt to be transported with heats and severity in matters of contest, as it doth suppose such aestuations and storms as are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with inward serenity, so likewise will it occasion outward trouble and opposition from others. They who are always biting of others, will be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual danger of being devoured by others, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.15. Those two qualities of <hi>hateful</hi> and <hi>hating one another,</hi> are joined together as usual concomitants, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. they who are apt to demean themselves as <hi>hating</hi> of others, will thereby be rendred <hi>hateful</hi> to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This vertue will be very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the <hi>peace</hi> and welfare of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane society</hi> in the <hi>general,</hi> which doth very much depend upon the mutual
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:55636:229"/>
condescension and forbearance of men towards one another, in the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which they differ: It being utterly impossible, considering the infirmity and prejudice to which our judgments are liable, that we should always agree in the same apprehension of things. If upon every difference men should think themselves obliged to prosecute matters to the utmost height and rigour, such eager persons may easily from hence be induced to have recourse to Arms ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than such precious things as truth and justice shall suffer; and being once thus engaged, it will be impossible (if they will act consistently) to end their differences by any accommodation, they must fight it out to the last till one side be wholly subdued and destroyed. And thus would men grow wild and savage, the benefits of Society would be lost, and mankind destroyed out of the world.</p>
            <p>'Tis this moderation and calmness of spirit which takes men off from their natural wildness and ferity, which tames and fits them for society. The less any man hath of it, the more doth he dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and draw near to the nature of brute creatures. The true notion of
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:55636:229"/>
               <hi>Gentileness</hi> and <hi>Nobility</hi> consisting in these kind of qualifications, whereby a man is fitted for a sociable condition.</p>
            <p>Now the design of Christianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to promote the good of mankind and the peace of Societies, therefore doth the Doctrine of it so frequently insist upon those kind of virtues and graces which are most conducible to this end. And therefore upon all these accounts the truth of the Doctrine will appear very evident, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis the duty of Christians to give signal testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their equity and moderation upon all occasions of difference and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests with one another.</p>
            <p>There remains only one <hi>Objection</hi> to be briefly answered, and I shall proceed to <hi>Application.</hi> 'Tis this,
<q>How may this consist with that zeal and strictness of duty which we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto?</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this it may be answered: 1. That zeal doth properly consist in an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind, and earnestness of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the prosecuting of such things as are our duty, and in opposing such things whereby we are hindred in the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:55636:230"/>
performance of our duty. Now suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing moderation to be a duty, a man ought to be zealous for this grace, and against all such persons and things as are enemies and hindrances of it. So that these things are not opposite, but consistent with, and subservient to one another.</p>
            <p>And as for that other Branch of the Objection concerning strictness and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness of duty, from which a man ought not to deviate out of compliance with others. To this it may be said, That strictness is properly a keeping close to the Law. Now 'tis not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked letter, but the sense and meaning that is the Law. And that man may be said to be most strict in his obedience, who doth most exactly comply with this. A man may violate the Law by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Letter, and he may keep the Law by going against the letter.</p>
            <p>Now Divine Laws themselves are capable of relaxation, which is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Proverbial saying so frequent in Scripture, That God <hi>will have mercy and not sacrifice.</hi> And therefore much more will humane Laws admit of it.</p>
            <p>There are these three things I would insist upon in the <hi>Application</hi> of this Point.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:55636:230"/>1. <hi>First,</hi> To enquire whether we our selves are such as the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth here require Christians to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And then <hi>secondly,</hi> if not, that we would endeavour to be convinced of that deformity and mischief which there is in the want of this Grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Lastly</hi> that we would be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be more careful in the attaining, improving, and exercising of this Grace for the future.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To enquire whether we our selves are such as the Apostle doth here require Christians to be; such as upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of difference are ready to give sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal testimony of our gentleness and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. There are these two ways whereby this may be discovered, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the

'Tis certain that there are several other virtues of near affinity to this, such as are either the effects or concomitants of this virtue, by which
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:55636:231"/>
the reality of it may be known. Of these I shall mention <hi>six.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Mutual forbearance</hi> towards one another, not taking all the advantages we may have of vindicating our selves, making allowance for the infirmity of those by whom we are injured. <hi>We that are strong ought to bear with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the weak, and not to please our selves, but our neighbour for his good: For even Christ pleased not himself. Rom.</hi> 15.1. We are to <hi>comfort the feeble-minded, and to support the weak,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5 14; not to be harsh and rigorous towards them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>readiness to forgive</hi> and conceal the manifest injuries of others, when either the glory of God or the good of men either publick or private shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of us. That very expression which is translated <hi>ready to forgive, Psal.</hi> 89.5. is by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> rendred by the same word in the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Long-suffering,</hi> both with respect to <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi>; not easily provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to passions, being slow to anger; not suddenly tired or discouraged by the continuance of the things we suffer, or the delay of the things we hope for. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Charity suffereth long, and
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:55636:231"/>
is kind. vers.</hi> 7. <hi>It beareth all things, hopeth all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Benignity,</hi> kindness, courtesie; a readiness to do good, to help and shew favour to those by whom we have been injured; such an affable, amiable carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age as may win upon them; not harsh, scornful, churlish; <hi>over-coming evil with good</hi>; a forwardness to promote love and peace with them, though it be by receding from somewhat of our own right. Being favourable in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the words and actions of others. Approving what is good in them; not aggravating what is evil; taking doubtful matters in the best sense; chusing rather to offend by too much mildness than by too much severity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Aequanimity,</hi> meekness, gentleness; such a sedateness of mind, whereby a man is not easily transported to any high passions; not difficultly appeased, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon submission and repentance. Such an evenness and smoothness of disposition, as doth not only serve to attemper anger, but to add a sweetness and placidness to our carriage. An equal state of mind under the variety of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conditions, without being elated or dejected by them, <hi>Knowing how to
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:55636:232"/>
want, and how to abound.</hi> When our hearts are not immersed in any of these earthly things, beyond their real worth and usefulness.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And <hi>lastly, Easiness to be intreated,</hi> when a man is exorable without the violence of importunity; Not stiff and tenacious in matters of opinion beyond what the great evidence and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of things doth require. Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the business of our converse with others, <hi>without murmurings and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, Phil.</hi> 2.14. This same disputaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or aptness to contend for victory, is no small occasion of discord amongst men. And on the contrary, this willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to condescend, not leaning too much to our own understanding, is a special means to promote amity and peace amongst them. This very word in the Text being used by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. is there by <hi>Beza</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be of the same sense with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, apt to yield and submit, <hi>non facilè contentiosus,</hi> not easily provoked to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious disputes nor pertinacious in them.</p>
            <p>Let a man look over the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel in the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and he shall find that there is not
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:55636:232"/>
any other virtue or duty whatsoever so often and so earnestly inculcated as those of this nature; as if our Saviour had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to fix upon these, as being the grand <hi>Criteria</hi> whereby his Followers should be distinguished from all other Sects and Professions of men in the world.</p>
            <p>Now if we desire to make enquiry concerning our own conditions in this respect, these are some of those <hi>Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants,</hi> effects, properties whereby this moderation is to be discerned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Rule whereby we may examine our conformity to this precept in the <hi>Text</hi> is the <hi>Vniversality</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it; whether we exercise it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men, in all times, upon all occasions. They that are for moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the managing of affairs at one time, and yet perhaps at another will look upon it as an argument of disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and style it by the name of lukewarmness and detestable neutrality, such persons cannot be said to love the <hi>virtue</hi> of Moderation but the <hi>blessing</hi> and happiness of it. They are only for the passive not the active part, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from others not to shew it to them. And to how narrow a compass
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:55636:233"/>
an enquiry by this Rule will confine this Grace, amidst the several pretenders to it, I need not say.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the next place we may hence be convinced of that deformity and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which there is in the want of this Grace. It renders a man,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Vnlike to God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Vnacceptable to men.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Pernicious to himself.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It renders a man <hi>unlike to God;</hi> in conformity to whom all our excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and happiness doth consist. He is <hi>the Father of Mercies, the God of all consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> His appearance was in <hi>the soft and still voice,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.10, 11; not in whirlwinds and Hurricanes: where there is <hi>spiritus procellae,</hi> it proceeds from another principle. Christ is the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> the great Exemplar of meekness. 'Tis prophesied of him that he shall <hi>come down like dew on a fleece of wool, like rain on the mowen grass, Psal.</hi> 72.6. <hi>He shall not cry, nor his voice be heard in the street, Isa.</hi> 42.2. The Holy Ghost was pleased to appear in the shape of a Dove, the emblem of Meekness. <hi>Simplex animal &amp; laetum,</hi>

                  <hi>St. Cypr. de unit. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>

               <hi>non felle ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, non morsibus saevum, non unguium laceratione violentum.</hi> The true Church
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:55636:233"/>
is styled by the name of the <hi>Lilly amongst thorns:</hi> the Lilly doth not scratch and tear, that's the property of thorns and briars. Christians are the Sheep and Lambs. <hi>Quid facit in pectore Christiano luporum feritas, Canum rabies?</hi> saith the same <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Vnacceptable to men</hi>; as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that common peace and quiet which 'tis every mans interest to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. It seems very obvious for men to reflect what thoughts they have had concerning such persons as have been the chief drivers on of several interests, in those wild revolutions we have seen of late; how we have looked upon them as Incendiaries and enemies to publick peace. If it be said that the case is now altered, and we have a right side, and a good cause; This ought to be most free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owned, and acknowledged with all thankfulness: But yet 'tis farther consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that this virtue of Moderation, doth suppose a matter of right and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. And then besides, the better the cause is, the less need is there of any immoderate rigorous course in the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it. We shall hereby rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice than promote it; by inducing a suspicion, that 'tis not so much truth or
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:55636:234"/>
justice as something else that drives us on. And then besides where would this principle end? if one man may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and rigorous because he is in the right; why then another who doth but think himself so, will be so too. And according to this, what would become of peace and society?</p>
            <p>Such blustering boisterous tempers as are all for the great river <hi>Euphrates</hi> which runs with a torrent and a mighty noise, and refuse the still waters of <hi>Shiloah</hi> which <hi>run soft and gently,</hi> as the <hi>Prophet</hi> speaks, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.6. such are no friends to peace, because 'tis the latter which is the river whose streams must <hi>make glad the City of God, Psal.</hi> 46.4. that is, must promote the quiet and flourishing state of the Church, as a Reverend <hi>Prelate</hi> hath elegantly exprest it:<note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> Serm.</note> 'Tis the advice of <hi>Seneca,</hi> that men would consider <hi>Vtrum mundi status gratior sit, sereno &amp; puro die, an cum fragoribus crebris omnia quatiuntur, &amp; ignes hinc at<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> illinc micant.</hi> What difference there is betwixt a serene and clear day, and another full of thunder and flashes, and storms; Such differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there is, saith he, betwixt a calm moderate temper, and the passionate severity of others.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:55636:234"/>3. It will prove <hi>pernicious to a mans self.</hi> For which I shall only give that one instance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.55. the two Disciples there, <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> those <hi>Sons of thunder,</hi> being much offended with the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who refused to receive our Saviour, would needs in their immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate zeal have fire from Heaven to destroy them; For which they had a Scripture example in the story of <hi>Elias.</hi> But what must have been the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this? Why a while after our Saviour went up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where he was Crucified, and therefore very good reason why fire should come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that likewise. Nay these very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons themselves, <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert and renounce him, and therefore there ought to be fire upon them also; And so they make good that saying of the wise man, and by being <hi>righteous overmuch destroy themselves, Eccles.</hi> 7.7. Nay one of these Disciples tells us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>That the world knew him not, nor received him.</hi> Therefore why should not that likewise be destroyed by fire? Of such a large and comprehensive mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is this sin, according to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral consequences of it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:55636:235"/>3. Lastly, we should hence be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to be more careful in the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, improving, exercising of this grace for the future. 'Tis a duty this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all sorts of persons are concerned, not only those of a private condition, in their dealings with one another, but likewise such as are publick Magistrates, both as to their making and executing of Laws. They who are to consult publick settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should have special regard to this equity and moderation, thereby to heal the minds of men and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their differences. They should look upon past sufferings as happening to them, <hi>eo modo quo grandines ac diluvia accidere solent,</hi> and so bury them in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.</p>
            <p>I might to the many arguments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, add divers other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations to excite men unto this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue (would the time permit it). I cannot omit that passage out of <hi>Seneca,</hi> so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this purpose, <hi>Quod si dii placabiles &amp; aequi delicta potentium non statim ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus prosequuntur, quanto aequius est, homines hominibus praepositos miti animo exercere imperium. If God doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently take vengeance of our faults with thunder from heaven, why should not men
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:55636:235"/>
by his example become gentle and mild to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another.</hi> 'Tis a thought this, very proper for a man to revolve in his mind when he is by his passion provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to deal with rigour and extremity towards others. Let him then consider, am not I more under Gods power than this offending person is under mine; more obnoxious to his wrath and justice than he is to me? Had he dealt with me according to my desert, I had long ago been cast into hell: Yet I live and am spared, and do every day receive many testimonies of his kindness. Is he thus favourable to me for this end, that I may be severe and cruel to others? Hath he forgiven my Talents, that I may rigorously exact the pence from my brother? That man who hath but any sparks of Religion or ingenuity, cannot chuse but be either overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with confusion, or melted into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion by such thoughts as these.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Dearly beloved, avenge not your selves, but rather give place unto wrath: For it is written, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.</p>

            <p>I HAVE treated of late in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Discourse concerning the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Moderation</hi>; shewing the true nature and necessity of it, and how seasonable and proper the pressing of it hath been and will continually be for all places and times; And more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for such as in any revolution are apt to think it least seasonable, who for that very reason have more need to be put in remembrance of their duty in this particular.</p>
            <p>Now because this other subject of Revenge is of near affinity to it; being in some sense the object of it, according
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:55636:237"/>
to that definition of <hi>Seneca</hi> where he describes Clemency and Moderation to be <hi>Temperantia animi in potestate Vlci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendi</hi>; A temperance of mind when we have the power and opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: Therefore I could not but judg it a very proper Subject to be annexed to the former, and this Text as proper to found a discourse upon of this nature as any other.</p>
            <p>In the former part of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> had insisted at large upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral points of faith, more particularly upon that great Doctrine of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In this <hi>Chapter</hi> he proceeds to lay down certain precepts of Christianity concerning practice and obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with those that refer <hi>to God,</hi> in the three first <hi>verses</hi>: And amongst them, with that which is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the rest, namely that we whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devote and resign up our selves unto his spiritual service. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Then he proceeds to such duties as we owe to our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> whether, 1. Those that are fellow-members of the same Church, partakers of the same faith; from <hi>ver.</hi> 4. to the 13. Or 2<hi>dly,</hi> such as are enemies and persecutors, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Bless them which persecute you</hi>; and again,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:55636:237"/>
               <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Recompence to no man evil for evil.</hi> And because 'tis a duty (this) of more than ordinary difficulty, very much against the natural inclinations of men, therefore he returns again to the enforcing of it, in the words of the <hi>Text,</hi> and so to the end of the <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Text</hi> is a Dissuasive from the sin of <hi>Revenge</hi>; in it there lye four parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars very obvious:</p>
            <p n="1">1. An insinuating compellation, <hi>Dearly beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Precept or Prohibition it self, <hi>Avenge not your selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A direction for the better obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of this precept, <hi>But rather give place unto wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A Reason or Argument for the enforcing of it, <hi>For it is written, Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is mine,</hi> or <hi>belongs to me. I will repay saith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall briefly explain the several <hi>Terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Compellation; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved.</hi> 'Tis but one word in the <hi>Greek,</hi> but because of the special <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis</hi> of it, signifying the most cordial love, therefore is it thus rendred in the <hi>English.</hi> And upon this account 'tis usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ascribed to an onely child; so the 70
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:55636:238"/>
translate that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2. <hi>Thine onely Son, thy dearly beloved Son.</hi> In which sense 'tis frequently used by other <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, <hi>Homer, Plutarch,</hi> and others (as divers <hi>Criticks</hi> have observed.) It signifies the dearest and most intimate affection. The <hi>Apostle</hi> doth use it both here and in several other places, that by so mild and obliging a compellation he might the better insinuate and prevail with those whom he is to perswade: Suitable to his own rule, <hi>In meekness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing those that oppose themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>Prohibition</hi> it self, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Revenging.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. What this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Vltio</hi> or <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta</hi> is may be very proper to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed, because 'tis by several <hi>Authors</hi> used in such various and equivocal sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; sometimes for a Passion of the mind, so <hi>Plato</hi> defines it in his Book <hi>de Legibus, Vindicta est passio justitiae sequax</hi>; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:55636:238"/>
for a <hi>virtue,</hi> amongst the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of which <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth reckon it. <hi>Eth. lib.</hi> 4. And so likewise <hi>Aquinas</hi> 2. 2<hi>dae,</hi> making the two extremes of it to be cruelty, and too much remission or abjectness. And sometimes likewise 'tis reckoned for a <hi>vice,</hi> as in the <hi>Text,</hi> and according to the most usual accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word. And there is reason enough why it may be referred to each of these heads, because supposing it to be the first, a <hi>Passion,</hi> it must likewise be capable of being both a Virtue and a Vice.</p>
            <p>As there is in every man a natural inclination to vindicate himself from injuries, so 'tis a <hi>Passion,</hi> that is, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural act of the appetite. As this passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is duly guided in the exercise of its acts, by the rules of justice and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, both as to the proper objects, acts and circumstances of it, so 'tis a <hi>virtue.</hi> As it doth deviate from and transgress these rules, so 'tis a <hi>vice.</hi> Which may be said of all the other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions likewise, <hi>Anger, Love, Fear,</hi> &amp;c. Though because of the general procli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of men to offend in this kind, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the most ordinary use of the word is in this worst sense.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:55636:239"/>That desire which a man may have of occasioning to another some trouble and inconvenience upon the account of injury suffered from him, this is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely and abstractedly considered, in it self evil, but may be both lawful and commendable, provided that the thing hereby chiefly aimed at be such a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate castigation as may be requisite for the conviction and the amendment of the offender, a keeping up the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Laws, and a due satisfaction for the damages we have suffered. There being a vast difference betwixt the <hi>study of revenge,</hi> and the <hi>endeavour of repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This latter being no ways oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to Christian love, meekness, mutual forgiveness; God himself may remit the sin, and not hate the person, and yet he may correct the offender, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Law and repair his own honour.</p>
            <p>But now on the other hand, when the thing we chiefly aim at, is mischief to the person by whom we have been injured, though we our selves receive no benefit thereby, besides the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our own inraged passions: Such a <hi>wrathful retribution of evil</hi> is properly the <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>Revenge</hi>; whether or no the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:55636:239"/>
evil that we occasion to him, be either greater, or equal, or less, to what we have suffered from him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What by <hi>revenging our selves</hi>? This expression doth direct to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per agent of that suffering and penalty which we may occasion to another. Though persons of a private capacity may seek to bring such as injure them to punishment, yet they must not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves inflict it, because there are others appointed to this work, namely the publick Magistrate, whose proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice this is, <hi>He is the Minister of God,</hi> a <hi>revenger,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the same word as in the Text, <hi>to execute wrath upon him that doth evil,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle</hi> in the next <hi>Chapter, Rom.</hi> 13.4. 'tis a part this of distributive justice, and therefore doth belong to Governours, either to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, to whom it doth primarily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain, or to those who are delegated by him; who are the Conservators of humane Societies, and Guardians of Laws. Without such revengers there could be no Government in the world; and therefore for private persons to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade their office, is in some sense to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them, and consequently to destroy Government. Though even such pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:55636:240"/>
persons to whose office this work doth properly belong, are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exempted from the danger of this sin. Upon which account it is that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours themselves ought not ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be Judges in their own particular concernments; or at least not to be the inflicters of the penalty upon such as injure them. To which may be added that such Magistrates who take delight in inflicting punishment as punishment; who do it with insolence, bitterness, contumely (which are against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Laws of humanity) such as do not principally respect the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and of the offending person, but have some secret regard to their own private utility, or the satisfaction of their particular anger: In such cases the Magistrate himself, whose office it is to revenge, may yet be guilty of the sin of revenge.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third particular observed in the words is a <hi>Direction</hi> for the better observance of this duty, in that clause, <hi>but rather give place unto wrath.</hi> That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of <hi>giving place, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, date locum,</hi> is a Metaphorical phrase. But 'tis such a Metaphor as is not a peculiar Phraseology, but is somewhat general
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55636:240"/>
and significant in several languages. The meaning of it is to yield and submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. What kind of wrath is hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended is another question, fit to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed. There are three several senses that have each of them a fair pretence to the scope and meaning of this place.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may signifie the wrath of thine <hi>enemy</hi>; do not immediately fly to an opposition of it, but rather withdraw from him that is provoked. <hi>Dum furor in cursu est, currenti cede furori. Iacob</hi> did so to his brother. <hi>Esau,</hi> when he was inraged against him, and resolved to kill him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may signifie the wrath of <hi>God.</hi> Do not prevent or hinder <hi>that</hi> by reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your self. Take heed of invading his Office. Leave him to his own work. <hi>Commit your selves to him that judgeth righteously,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may refer to our <hi>own wrath.</hi> To the impetuousness of which we must so far give place as not to act any thing upon the instigation of it. <hi>Respirate in vestro furore, neque ruite praecipites, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec ira vestra deferveat.</hi> Let it have some time to cool and abate, and take heed of being transported with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:55636:241"/>Each of these are suitable enough to the sense of the place, though the <hi>two</hi> first seem to be more agreeable to the Reason annexed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Which is the fourth particular observable in the words: <hi>For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Vengeance is mine, I will repay saith the Lord,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which refers to that place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to that <hi>Psal.</hi> 94.1. <hi>O Lord God to whom venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance belongeth.</hi> Which is again repeated <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.30. <hi>For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompence saith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then it follows in the next <hi>verse</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> which is cited out of <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.21. <hi>Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him, if he thirst give him drink.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which expressions of meat and drink are comprehended all kind of necessaries or conveniences, which his condition may require. Be kind and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolous to him, not only in case of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme exigence, but so often as you have opportunity of procuring any consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advantage to his condition, <hi>For in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,</hi> whereby he shall be either melted into kindness, or burnt for his obdurateness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="439" facs="tcp:55636:241"/>Some think the meaning of this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is to be restrained only to the first of these; it being against the chief scope of the place, and the highest kind of revenge for a man to aim at the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of another to divine wrath and vengeance; usually the roughest most obdurate tempers are to be subdued with kindness. <hi>David</hi> conquered <hi>Saul</hi> this way, and melted him into tears of repentance for his enmity against him. <hi>Nimis durus est animus, qui si dilectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem nolit impendere, nolit rependere,</hi> saith St. <hi>Austin.</hi> That man must needs be of a very savage inflexible temper, who is not to be bent by gentleness and kindness.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
               </note> Some conceive this phrase to be an allusion to the custom of Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in their dealing with metals, which when they cannot bring to fusion by putting fire under them, they use to heap live coals on the head or top of them, and by that means do cause them to melt. That man is to be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired of as being without all sense of humanity, whom repeated kindness will not melt and dissolve.</p>
            <p>But now because the most usual sense of this expression, <hi>coals of fire,</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note punishment and vengeance, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:55636:242"/>
to the proper importance of it in other Scriptures, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.8, 12, 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 140.12. and several other places. Therefore this sense is not to be wholly neglected, nor is it unlawful for a man in a secondary way to have respect unto it. And 'tis most suitable to that clause in the precedent verse, <hi>Vengeance is mine.</hi> Though withal it must be granted, that the precept in the verse immediately following of overcoming evil with good, doth seem to favour more the former sense.</p>
            <p>And so much for Explication of the <hi>Text,</hi> both as to the <hi>Context</hi> and the <hi>Terms</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> I would insist upon shall be this:
<q>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prop.</hi>
                  </note>Christians ought to be very cautious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this sin of revenge.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Apostle</hi> doth in this place insist much upon it, frequently repeats the prohibition to this purpose, which he endeavours to insinuate by the most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perswasions, and to enforce by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral arguments to shew of how great moment and consequence this duty is. And 'tis withal both agreeable to the light of nature, and to several other precepts and examples, both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Testament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="441" facs="tcp:55636:242"/>And <hi>first,</hi> 'tis most consonant this to the clear light of nature, and such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principles as are common to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Though I know very well that divers eminent <hi>Authors,</hi> the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> and others do from hence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove the insufficiency of Reason and Philosophy for the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and attainment of true virtue. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the wisest and best of the <hi>Heathen</hi> do indulge themselves in this matter of revenge. To which purpose they usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cite those sayings out of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> where he reckons it for a virtue, and in another place where he saith, <hi>Servile est, si contumeliose tracteris, id tolerare.</hi> And that of <hi>Cicero,</hi> where he mentions revenge amongst those things, <hi>Quae ad jus naturae pertinent.</hi> Besides that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who were a sect of men most strict and sublime in their morality; amongst whom notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it was a principle, <hi>Sapientem non ignoscere, non misereri.</hi> That <hi>a wise man ought not to pardon another mans faults, nor to compassionate his sufferings.</hi> For which <hi>Seneca</hi> reasons thus, <hi>Venia est poenae meritae remissio.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi> 2.6.</note> 
               <hi>Ergo ei ignoscitur qui pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niri debuit. Sapiens autem nihil facit quod non debet.</hi> To which may be
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:55636:243"/>
added that Doctrine of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> wherein the remitting of injuries and neglect of revenge, is condemned as an impious thing.</p>
            <p>From all which 'tis inferred that this prohibition of revenge is a pure institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belonging to the Gospel and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and not derivable from the light of nature.</p>
            <p>But with reverence to those great Names, this will upon an impartial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry be found to be a mistake; all the <hi>Agenda</hi> of Christianity being so far from being opposite that they are most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to humane reason, as 'tis cultivated and heightned to its utmost improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Philosophy. As for those spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that are cited to this purpose, they may refer to the <hi>passion</hi> or <hi>virtue</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, not the <hi>vice</hi> of it. The same <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> abounding in many severe prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions against this <hi>vice.</hi> Besides the many arguments they produce of the unlawfulness and mischief of it, as the inconsistency of it with Government and Society, with several other reasons which I may have occasion to mention afterwards. And the plain truth is, there is not any one thing in morality that is capable of being made out by clearer
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:55636:243"/>
natural evidence than the sinfulness of revenge, supposing men to live under Laws and Government, as I shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after endeavour to shew.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Scripture</hi> evidence to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose out of the <hi>Old</hi> Testament, nothing can be more express than that place, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudg against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.</hi> To which is annexed the same reason as in the Text, <hi>I am the Lord.</hi> Nor is this to be extended meerly to their persons, but to their possessions likewise. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4, 5. <hi>If thou meet thine enemies ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. If thou seest the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, thou shalt surely help with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though it cannot be denied that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Judicial Laws of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, there are some that seem to make an allowance and indulgence for the frowardness and hardness of that people in this particular (whether the revenger of blood were not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to kill the man-slayer see <hi>Weemes,</hi> 2. <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>part, p.</hi> 129.) as that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the liberty for the avenger of blood,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:55636:244"/>
while his heart is hot, to pursue him that had unwittingly slain his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and if he could overtake him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he got to one of the Cities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to be revenged of him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 20.3. Besides those other Laws of retaliation, of <hi>an eye for an eye,</hi> and <hi>a tooth for a tooth;</hi> yet these Laws were not established amongst them out of any fitness or commendableness of the things in themselves absolutely consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but only indulged by way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as being most suitable to the imperfect state of that people, and for the prevention of greater mischiefs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath stated this business, and out of him the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Book <hi>de jure belli &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. §. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.11. the wise man tells us that <hi>'tis the discretion of a man to defer his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and his glory to pass over a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> 'Tis the want of prudence and generosity that doth hastily transport men to the retribution of injuries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.17, 18. <hi>Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth, Lest the Lord see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him to thee.</hi> Where
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:55636:244"/>
not only the doing of mischief our selves, but the rejoicing at that which upon any other account doth happen to him is prohibited as an unworthy thing. And <hi>David</hi> complains of it as very injurious dealing that his enemies <hi>rejoiced at his adversity, Psal.</hi> 35.15. though he <hi>had compassion on them when they were sick, and behaved himself as to his friend or brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25.12. there are severe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings denounced against <hi>Edom,</hi> because he had greatly offended by taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and revenging himself upon the house of <hi>Iudah, ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Therefore will I lay my vengeance upon Edom, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to mine anger, and according to my fury, and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord God.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart to destroy it for the old hatred; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus saith the Lord, Behold I will stretch out my hands against the Philistines, and I will execute great vengeance upon them, with furious rebukes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Gospel</hi> is much more copious to this purpose, wherein our Saviour doth require an higher degree of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this kind, and doth abolish those
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:55636:245"/>
indulgences which the <hi>Iudicial Law</hi> did admit. He expects that <hi>Christians</hi> should be so far from being overcome with this passion of private revenge, that they should rather suffer patiently a second and third injury than revenge one. Which is the true meaning of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 39. <hi>Whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also.</hi> That expression of <hi>turning the cheek,</hi> being a usual Scripture-phrase to signifie bearing evil patiently, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.6. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.30.</p>
            <p>And <hi>v.</hi> 44. <hi>I say unto you love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you. For if you love them that love you, what reward have you, do not even Publicans and sinners the same?</hi> But when once you come to love and do good to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, this will prove you to <hi>be children of the Highest,</hi> and render you <hi>perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. Having taught his Disciples that form of prayer, wherein they are to beg a conditional pardon of their own sins, <hi>Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us.</hi>
               <pb n="447" facs="tcp:55636:245"/>
Of which it may be said (as of the fifth Commandment that it was the <hi>first with promise</hi>) so was this the <hi>first,</hi> the only Petition <hi>with condition.</hi> And having signified this form, he returns immediately after to comment upon this clause (singling it out from all the other Petitions as laying great weight upon it) and this he doth both <hi>positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ver.</hi> 14. <hi>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, then will your Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgive you your trespasses.</hi> And <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively,</hi> v. 15. <hi>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive your trespasses.</hi> By which place it appears that he who meditates revenge must curse himself when he prays; he must carry in his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som the evidence that his sins are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned, and likewise a bar and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, whereby he is disabled to ask or expect the forgiveness of them.</p>
            <p>To which may be added that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>being reconciled to our brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we bring our gift to the Altar, Mat.</hi> 5.

            </p>
            <p>I might mention several Examples to this purpose; that of <hi>Ioseph</hi> towards his Brethren: that of <hi>Iob, Chap.</hi> 31.29. who professed that he <hi>rejoiced not at the destruction of him that hated him; nor lift up himself when evil found him.</hi> That of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> who prayed for those that stoned him, saying, <hi>Lord lay not this sin to their charge, Act.</hi> 7.60. And above all that of our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, <hi>Who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he suffered he threatned not, but committed himself to him that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteously,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23.</p>
            <p>I proceed to some <hi>Reasons</hi> or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the confirmation of this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi> And shall mention <hi>six.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis a sin against God,</hi> the supreme Governour of the world, to whom this work of vengeance belongeth; which is the reason in the <hi>Text.</hi> And therefore men who intrude upon it without his commission, do but invade his office; and consequently renounce their subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him, and put themselves out of his protection. We that are poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Creatures, earthen vessels,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:55636:246"/>
               <hi>worms and no men,</hi> think our selves highly injured and affronted when those that are in any inferiour relation to us, our children or servants shall take upon them to revenge themselves upon one another without appealing to us to do them right. Why, God is infinitely more just, powerful, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient, and therefore hath much more reason to resent it as an high indignity when his creatures and vassals shall so far forget their dependance upon him as to invade his office. The <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.20. <hi>That the wrath of men worketh not the righteousness of God.</hi> That justice which is done by a wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man doth not render him righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the sight of God. Or God hath not appointed that violent revengeful disposition of men to be the executor of his justice; because 'tis not like to effect it with such a mixture of mercy as he will approve or accept of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis <hi>against Government,</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, Laws; those bonds of Societies, which are all needless and in vain, if every one may take a liberty of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself. 'Tis the very end of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy to prevent this. He is made
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:55636:247"/>
a publick Avenger, to distribute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and punishments according to stated Laws, that private men might not intermeddle with it. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as for such barbarous savage people as live wild, without being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociated and united by those bonds of justice, 'tis no wonder if such be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually retaliating of injuries accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opportunities and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they can get over one another; there being no other remedy for men who live according to a state of nature, amongst whom there is no person or place for appeal. And thus likewise is it with such publick persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whom there is no common Judg to state and vindicate their differences (as Soveraign Princes are) there being in such cases no other remedy (unless they can accommodate things by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) but that War must follow, and the sword decide their Controversies. But when men are once associated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Government and Laws, they must then have recourse to such as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to this office of vindicating com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon justice. Have you received an injury, saith <hi>Quintilian, Est lex, forum,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:55636:247"/>
judex nisi vos jure vindicari pudet; There are Laws, Courts, Iudges, unless your cause be such as you are ashamed or afraid to bring it unto the trial and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Law.</hi> Though even in this way 'tis not for every trivial offence that we are to trouble our neighbour; nor for matters of moment, till all other ways of accommodation have been first offered and tried, <hi>Law being a kind of War, which must be the last means for Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis against the very scope and <hi>spirit of Christianity,</hi> which consists in self-denial, taking up the Cross, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, loving our enemies, forgiving such as trespass against us. The great rule of Christianity is not to do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as they do to us, but as we would have them do to us. <hi>Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ye would that men should do unto you, do you the same unto them, Mat.</hi> 7.12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis against <hi>humanity; Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num verbum est ultio,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca.</hi> 'Tis proper enough for wild brute creatures, but not for men. Nothing becomes humane nature more than gentleness and humanity.<note place="margin">Quintil.</note>

est,</hi> saith one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Orators. <hi>The pleasure of revenge ought not to stand in any competition with the praise of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</hi> Nothing is more universally necessary for the peace and welfare of humane Societies, than mutual pardon and forbearance; because every one must frequently stand in need of it for himself, and therefore must be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to extend it to others. He that hath any real sense of his own frail conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will find reason enough not to take all advantages he may against others.</p>
            <p n="5">5. 'Tis <hi>against our own quiet</hi> and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; which consists in such a serene and be calmed spirit as will not <hi>let the Sun go down upon our wrath.</hi> The study of revenge will be a means to keep wounds green and festering, whereas otherwise they might heal. <hi>Multi le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves injurias altius sibi dimisêre dum vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant.</hi>

                  <hi>Senec.</hi>
               </note> This gives impression to a slight injury, and makes it wound deep when we resent it with revengeful thoughts. <hi>Maledicta, si irascaris, agnita videntur, spreta exolescunt.</hi> He that neglects an injury, doth blunt the edge of it. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking words</hi> (saith the Son of <hi>Syrach,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:55636:248"/>
Eccles.</hi> 28.12.) <hi>are like a coal of fire, which if a man blow upon, it will kindle the more, but if he spit upon it, 'twill go out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides that it will be a means to multiply and renew fresh injuries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. If we cannot stop at the first blow, why should we expect that our adversary should stop at the second? He that will strike when he is not provoked, will do so much more when he is smitten again, and so we shall but help to draw the sawe of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and multiply sufferings upon our selves by endeavouring to retaliate them upon others.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Revenge is in it self as great, and in many respects a much greater sin, than the first injury whereby 'tis occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned. <hi>Quid refert inter provocantem &amp; provocatum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>nisi quod ille prior in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leficio deprehenditur, &amp; ille posterior. All the difference betwixt the provoker and revenger is this, That the one is first, the other second in the mischief. Et quid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert primus pecces an ultimus? And what advantage is there for a man to be first or second in an evil action?</hi> It cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be any good argument, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:55636:249"/>
such an one sinned first, therefore we will second him: <hi>Qui dolorem rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit tantum excusatius peccat</hi> (saith <hi>Seneca), He that doth revenge, doth sin as well as the other,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Ira.</note> 
               <hi>though he have this excuse for it, that he was first provoked to it.</hi> And yet in another place he saith, <hi>Non du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitabo dicere magis improbum esse eum, qui illatam ulciscitur quàm qui infert inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam. I shall not doubt to affirm that man of the two to be the most wicked, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges, than he who inflicts an injury. Qui replicat multiplicat. Alter principi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um malo dedit, alter modum abstulit. One gives a beginning, the other growth, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, continuance, and consequently endeavours to make it without measure or end.</hi> The first violates some particular branch of the Law, but the revenge of that wrong doth depose the whole Law, and puts it out of office. He that hath newly received an injury, and hath the sense of it fresh upon his own mind, doth thereby better understand the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and grievousness of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for him to deal hardly with others, whilst he hath this sense fresh upon him, must needs from hence receive an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, <hi>Qui exemplo peccat, bis peccat,</hi>
               <pb n="455" facs="tcp:55636:249"/>
he having immediately before experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the deformity and mischief of that sin in another.</p>
            <p>If it be objected against all this which hath been delivered, that we read sometimes in <hi>Scripture</hi> of good men who are said to rejoice at the sight of vengeance upon others, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58.10. <hi>The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance.</hi> And elsewhere they are said to pray for vengeance, <hi>Ier.</hi> 11.20. <hi>O Lord of Hosts that judgest righteously,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 20.12.</note> 
               <hi>let me see thy vengeance upon them.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. speaking of <hi>Alexander the Coppersmith doing him much harm,</hi> adds, <hi>the Lord reward him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his works.</hi> And <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.10. 'Tis said, <hi>that the souls under the Altar do cry with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true dost thou not judg and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth.</hi> Besides several imprecations in other places.</p>
            <p>To this it may be answered: 1. That as a man may pity men under those suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, which he may acknowledg to be just upon them, so he may rejoice at those sufferings as they are accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Divine justice, though not as
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:55636:250"/>
they are revenge for his particular inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. 2. To speak unto God that he would vindicate us, is but to appeal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the supreme Judg that he would do us right, <hi>to commit our cause unto him that judgeth righteously,</hi> as is said of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. Though this should be in such a manner as may tend to the conviction, reformation and forgiveness of the offending person, rather than to his ruin and condemnation; unless it be for such extraordinary persons as have a spirit of discerning, and are able to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into the true state of men as to their implacable incorrigible condition. Other persons should consider <hi>what spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit they are of</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells the Disciples <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> Every man may not <hi>call for fire from heaven</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy others, though <hi>Elias</hi> did and might.</p>

            <p>THere are these three things I would insist upon in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of this Point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>examine</hi> whether we are not guilty of this sin?</p>
            <p n="2">2. To <hi>convince</hi> men of the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and mischief of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To <hi>quicken</hi> and excite them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a greater degree of watchfulness over themselves, in respect of the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to this vice for the future.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>examine</hi> whether we our selves are not guilty of this sin? There is no one thing wherein the corruption of
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:55636:251"/>
nature is more apt to exert it self than in offences of this kind, as relating to that first fundamental principle of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is self-preservation; nor is it every ordinary degree of grace and virtue that will exempt a man from the power of this sin. According to that measure which there is in any, either of impotence, pride, cowardice, cruelty, narrowness of mind, selfish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in such a proportion must that man be of a vindicative temper. And on the other side, he that is open and free in his way of converse, apt to put the best construction upon things, to take more notice of the virtues and kindnesses of men than of their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not subject to jealousies and evil surmisings, but of a noble generous temper and carriage, lifted up above the common level of vulgar minds, in such a degree will he be exempted from this sin.</p>
            <p>But now because there is a vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive anger and indignation against o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which is our duty, namely that which is against offenders And that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is apt to palliate and excuse his
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:55636:251"/>
own revengeful temper and carriage by pretending this; therefore I shall briefly suggest these two Rules, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the truth of it may be discovered, whether it be a Virtue or Vice. To examine whether,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our anger be not more against the Persons than the Offences.</p>
            <p>And, 2. whether it be not directed more against offences as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to us, than as they are violations of the Divine Law. In both which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses we fall under the guilt of this sin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to examine whether our anger be not directed more against the persons of offenders than against their offences. If so, 'tis not the virtue but the sin of revenge. And this may be known by our readiness to exert any act of charity towards the offending person, in pitying and grieving for him, and applying the most effectual means for his conviction and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at the sins of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and yet he wept over and bemoaned their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. So did <hi>David</hi> for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35.13, 14. <hi>When they were
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:55636:252"/>
sick I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with fasting, I behaved my self as though he had been my friend or brother, I bowed down heavily as one that mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other side when we have no kind of compassion towards them, nor charity for them, but are continually reviling their persons, aggravating their faults, adding to and increasing their sufferings, 'tis a sure sign this of a vindicative temper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are to examine whether our anger be not more directed against offences as they are injuries to us, than as they are violations of the Divine Law. Which will appear by that sense which we have of such transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, wherein we our selves are not particularly reflected upon, though God be thereby highly dishonoured. If in such cases a man be calm and altogether unconcerned, if he have little or no displeasure against persons that are highly debauched and vicious, nay if he indulge himself in such kind of vices, 'tis altogether in vain for such a man in his punishing of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:55636:252"/>
to pretend to zeal for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of Law and justice, and the glory of God. 'Tis a disguise that which every one may see through. And though the punishment inflicted by such may be righteous, and in it self justly deserved, yet as it comes from them under these qualifications, 'tis not so much justice as revenge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the next place we may hence be <hi>convinced</hi> of that deformity and mischief which there is in this sin. There are these six things that do usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accompany it, either as <hi>causes, effects,</hi> or <hi>properties</hi> of it, <hi>Folly, Pride, Impotence, Cowardice, Cruelty, Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Folly:</hi> The meditating of revenge is styled the <hi>resting</hi> or cherishing <hi>of anger in our bosoms.</hi> And the <hi>Wise man</hi> tells us, that <hi>anger resteth in the bosom of fools, Eccles.</hi> 7.9. 'Tis the fool that rageth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.16. The discretion of a man will teach him to defer his anger, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.11. And by the Rule of Contraries it must be his folly to precipitate and hasten to revenge.
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:55636:253"/>
Would not that man be counted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fond and imprudent, who if a horse kick him, will think himself bound to recalcitrate or kick again, or to bite the dog by which he is bitten? You will say those creatures want rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and do not understand the injury they do. <hi>Eo loco sit tibi quisquis consilio caret,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca. Why, so perhaps may those foolish men, by whom you have been unwarily provoked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Pride:</hi> Every little injury will seem great, where men seem great to themselves. 'Tis from the opinion and conceit which they have of their own worth, that they are apt to aggravate every trespass as an high indignity. Fierceness doth arise from Pride. He that is puffed up with high imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of himself and of his own deserts, <hi>Iove dignas concipit iras. What? such a man as he?</hi> of so much worth to be so unworthily used by such an one? and thus (as one well expresseth it) <hi>as the boar whets and sharpens his tusks in his own foam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Robinson</hi>'s Essays.</note> 
               <hi>so doth a proud man excite and sharpen his own indignation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in the frothy imagination of his own worth.</hi> This is the reason why our
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:55636:253"/>
               <hi>Saviour</hi> doth join together <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>lowliness, self-denial</hi> and <hi>taking up the Cross.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Impotence,</hi> weakness, narrowness of soul, which is apt to make a man suspicious, to startle and be provoked at every shadow. <hi>Quo infirmiores eo magis iracundi.</hi> Persons that are old, sick, weak, are usually upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count most froward and vindicative. Whereas he that hath any true cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and greatness of mind will think it below him so much as to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every little injury. <hi>Non est mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus animus quem incurvat injuria.</hi> 'Tis not every little blast that can shake him who is of a steady and noble cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. To be always fretting and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating of injuries, <hi>formicarum &amp; muscarum est</hi> (saith <hi>Plutarch) belongs to such little impotent creatures as Ants and Flies.</hi> And to the same purpose <hi>Seneca, Pusilli hominis est &amp; miseri repetere mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentem. 'Tis the property of small and mean wretches to be always retaliating. Mures &amp; formicae, si manum admoveris, ora convertunt. Imbecillia, se laedi putant si tanguntur.</hi> The more impotent any thing is, the more suspicious and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:55636:254"/>
is it. There are many other say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to this purpose amongst the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Writers. I cannot omit that one more out of the <hi>Satyrist. Iuvenal. Sat.</hi> 13.</p>

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>I have the rather mentioned several of these <hi>Sayings</hi> out of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers, in confirmation of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I asserted, That Revenge is a sin against the light of Nature, and that the rules of Philosophy are not in this kind so defective as some have sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Cruelty:</hi> This naturally follows from the other. The less confidence any one hath in his own courage, the more rigorous and severe must he be in taking the advantages which he hath against another. <hi>Vltio est aestus &amp; fervor animi turbidi, &amp; mentis effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratae. Revenge is the aestuation of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:55636:254"/>
mind.</hi> 'Tis styled <hi>humana fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas.</hi> It transports a man to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageness and ferity. Upon which account it is that Civil Wars are of all others the most cruel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are commonly mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the dregs of the people, such kind of persons as have no true generosity, which renders them fierce and cruel.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Cowardice:</hi> This likewise is an usual concomitant of the other. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more natural to men than to make themselves the rule and measure whereby to judg of others. And therefore it cannot be but that such persons must be very obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and timerous towards all such as are above them, out of an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of what they themselves would do upon the like advantage. Such persons as are usually most fierce in asserting a Cause when it hath prevailed, are usually least ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable and couragious in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it when it is low. <hi>Vltio est desperationi proxima, etsi videri vult fortitudo. It puts on the disguise of gallantry and courage, which cannot
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:55636:255"/>
bear the least shadow of dishonour, but it proceeds from no better a ground than timerousness and despair.</hi> All kind of Insolence and Tyranny what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever being founded upon fear and cowardice.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Ingratitude:</hi> The very same unworthy temper and base princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which makes revenge seem an ease, will make thanks seem a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. That which aggravates inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will diminish kindnesses. He who is ready to account every wrong intolerable, will be apt to esteem every favour a due debt.</p>
            <p>Add to all this, that 'tis a sin which will indispose a man for the duties of piety, render our services unacceptable, put us into an inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of having our sins forgiven, or so much as expecting or praying for it.</p>
            <p>Besides that it will render a man feared and hated of all kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever, as being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a train of such vile concomitants as I have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. He who wrongs one doth thereby threaten all whom he hath
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:55636:255"/>
power to hurt. And 'tis too true a saying, <hi>Oderunt quem metuunt, Men hate those whom they fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But amongst all others this vice is more especially hateful in four sorts of people (as a certain <hi>Author</hi> hath observed.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Robinson</hi>'s Essays.</note>)</p>
            <p n="1">1. In <hi>men of power and authority</hi>; whose proper office it is in a legal regular way, to execute wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on evil doers, and to vindicate others from injury. If they become guilty in this kind themselves, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit murder with the sword of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, they transform themselves from Gods to Devils, and become <hi>wickednesses in high places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In such persons <hi>as have been obliged</hi> by acts of kindness and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which adds a peculiar aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to revengeful injurious deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Had it been an enemy that had reproached me, then I could have born it; or if he that hated me had lifted up himself against me, I would have hid my self from him: But it was thou my friend and my acquaintance, Psal.</hi> 55, 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="468" facs="tcp:55636:256"/>3. <hi>Professors of Religion</hi>; who are under the highest obligations and restraints from offending in this kind, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.11. when <hi>Abraham</hi> came to a place where <hi>the fear of God was not,</hi> there was no kind of injurious dealing but he thought he might expect from them; but to meet with this from such as make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion, must needs have in it this aggravation of a surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal and disappointment, as being so directly against the principles they pretend to.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such as are <hi>Poor, Prov.</hi> 28.3. <hi>A poor man that oppresseth is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</hi> Such an one is most like to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and rapacious, because of his necessities. And yet 'tis directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his interest, as being most liable to suffer by such dealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To which I may add a <hi>fifth</hi> sort, <hi>namely,</hi> such as have but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received any signal deliverance or mercy themselves, to whom their Lord hath freely remitted <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Talents,</hi> for them immediately
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:55636:256"/>
after to be rigorous with <hi>their fellow servants</hi> in exacting <hi>an hundred pence,</hi> hath in it a great unworthiness and incongruity. Such as have but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experimented what a suffering condition is, and can tell with what inward vexation and regret of mind they were affected at the hard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful dealing of others towards them; for such men to endeavour to bring others into the same state, the evil whereof they have so lately tasted, hath in it a peculiar aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> and last particular to be insisted upon, is to <hi>quicken</hi> and excite men unto a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of watchfulness over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in respect of the temptations to this vice for the future.

And though it be a noble generous thing to contend in benefits, not to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in kindnesses; yet not so in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries. <hi>Illic vinci turpe est, hic vincere.</hi> That man hath the greatest mind who can subdue his enemies by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and forgiving, and those are the most ingenuous conquests which are made over the minds and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of men by kindness. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that old <hi>Motto, Nobile vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendi genus patientia.</hi> Nothing ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a man more venerable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable than this readiness to forgive. As for such cases wherein 'tis not safe to pardon, there the exacting of due punishment is not cruelty

but just severity, and a political vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: But when there is no such pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick danger, when there may be any hopes of winning and obliging men by kindness, 'tis not then only less profitable but likewise less glorious to pursue them with punishments. How do we reverence the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and rise up at the mention of the names of such persons as have in former ages been famous for their <hi>Clemency</hi> and Indulgence? <hi>Camillus, Aristides, Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> of whom 'tis said, that he was <hi>in Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscendo lenissimus,</hi>

               </note> apt to forget no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much as injuries. And <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> no great lover or flatterer of him, tells him, <hi>Nil habet nec fortuna tua majus, quam ut possis, nec natura tua melius, quam ut velis, conservare quamplurimos. That herein did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the true greatness of his fortune, that he was able, and the goodness of his nature that he was willing to shew favour to his Adversaries.</hi> And on the other side with what horrour and aversation do we think of such as have been full of fierceness and immanity.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="472" facs="tcp:55636:258"/>2. A <hi>Second</hi> particular I would suggest, is, That we would consider what difference there is, betwixt the advantages to be acquired by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging</hi> and <hi>Pardoning</hi> of Injuries.</p>
            <p>By occasioning some hurt and damage to an Adversary we may procure some satisfaction to our own private particular passions. But on the other side, his prosperity and virtue will redound to the publick advantage.</p>
            <p>The pleasure of revenge is but short and momentany; that which ariseth from the conscience of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and worthy actions is lasting and permanent.</p>
            <p>By revenge a man is but even with his enemy, but by pardoning he is superior to him.</p>
            <p>He that suffers injury is but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted; but he that studies revenge is overcome. <hi>Be not overcome of evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men are very averse from yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Adversaries, but he that hath a revengeful mind, doth that which is much worse, <hi>he gives place to the Devil, Ephes.</hi> 4.27. who may be said to subdue us when he doth
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:55636:258"/>
by his instruments provoke us to this sin.</p>
            <p>By Revenge we may perhaps en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage our adversaries estate or body, but we do withal thereby hurt our own souls; whereas by pardoning and relieving him we do that which will be advantageous both to him and our selves.</p>
            <p>'Tis made a question amongst some, Which is most eligible, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have one friend more, or one enemy less?</hi> Whether to add to our help, or substract from our opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But without all scruple it must needs be more desirable, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect both these, namely, both to get one friend more and one enemy less. Which can only be done by subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with kindness.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though this be a duty always seasonable as to the habit, yet it is more particularly necessary as to our exerting the acts of it when we approach before God in any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn duty.</p>
            <p>The duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> men must <hi>lift up holy hands without wrath,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="474" facs="tcp:55636:259"/>
               <hi>Hearing the Word, Receive with meekness the ingrafted word,</hi> Jam. 1.21.</p>
            <p>Particularly <hi>the Lords Supper,</hi> which is therefore styled a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, because of that mutual love and agreement which it suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth amongst those that partake of it. There was a strict prohibition of <hi>Leaven</hi> in the celebrating of the <hi>Passover,</hi> and what was thereby sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the Apostle may inform us, where he speaks of the <hi>leaven of malice and revenge,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23. <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift, and go first be reconciled to him.</hi> Though Sacrifices and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were a duty of the first Table, and one of the principal parts of Religion, yet without this fraternal love and forbearance, it will not be acceptable. And 'tis in vain for men to pretend to acts of Piety, who are negligent in duties of Charity, and God will have this kind of <hi>mercy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than sacrifice.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us that the giving of <hi>alms is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a sweet smelling savour, Phil.</hi>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:55636:259"/>
4.18. And yet in another place he tells us, that though a man should <hi>give all his goods to feed the poor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> yet <hi>without this charity it would profit him nothing.</hi> So necessary is this to the rendring of our persons and services acceptable.</p>
            <p>For the better observance of our duty in this particular be pleased to take notice of these few <hi>Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Labour to see the hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in every evil that befalls you; this will take us off from revengeful thoughts against the instruments of our sufferings. This was that which made <hi>Iob</hi> so patient, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.21. his ascribing the losses he had by the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.11.</note> And so <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Shimei</hi> railed at him, pacified himself with this consideration, <hi>The Lord hath bid him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Labour to get a true sense of your own sins and great unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Where sins lye heavy, injuries will lye light. The more humble any man is the less revengeful will he be.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="476" facs="tcp:55636:260"/>3. Be very cautious to prevent the rising, or however to suppress the growth of anger, <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon it.</hi> That which is but <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> when we go to bed, may rise up <hi>malice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Consider that there are no kind of injurious persons but upon cool deliberate thoughts, we may find sufficient reason not to revenge our selves upon. <hi>Aut potentior, aut imbecillior, laesit: si imbecillior, parce illi;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sen. de Ira.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>si potentior, tibi. If he be much your inferiour, spare him out of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and generosity; if more potent, spare your self out of wisdom.</hi> Is he a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest enemy? he doth but according to his kind. Have we deserved it from him? he gives us but our due. Is he a good man? we should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him because God doth. Is he a wicked person? we may well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear him, considering that dreadful vengeance he is exposed to from God, both for that and all his other sins. Is he a friend? we should the rather submit to some injuries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have received former kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses from him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="477" facs="tcp:55636:260"/>It was a desperate speech that of <hi>Cosmus</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence, Though we read that we are commanded to forgive our enemies, yet we no where read that we are commanded to forgive our friends.</hi> Whereas this follows <hi>à majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> if enemies much more friends; for that very reason, whereby <hi>Iob</hi> did humble and appease all impatient thoughts, <hi>Shall we receive good from their hands, and shall we not receive evil?</hi> So that I say there is no kind of provocation we can meet with, but may afford some ground or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for our forgiving of it.</p>
            <p>I could not think of any fitter sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with which to take my leave of this place than those that I have been lately insisting upon, concerning <hi>Gentleness</hi> and <hi>Moderation,</hi> mutual <hi>forbearance</hi> and <hi>forgiveness</hi> of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; which are so universally sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for all times and places, of such general advantage both as to publick and private welfare, so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly suited to the main drift and spirit of the Gospel. And I should esteem it for a very great happiness and success if I might be any ways instrumental to emancipate the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:55636:261"/>
minds of men from those narrow and fierce principles whereby they are so easily apt to be provoked to keenness and severity one against another, to the disturbance of Society, and the taking men off from the quiet and comfort of their conditions.</p>
            <p>The Scripture tells us that 'tis this virtue which I have now been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting unto, that must render us <hi>perfect as our Heavenly Father is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>; that must raise us up unto the highest and nearest resemblance unto the Deity; that must promote our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort, and our outward peace. And therefore I cannot more fitly shut up all than with that Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Apostles</hi> with which he concludes his <hi>Second</hi> Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, Brethren, farewell: Be perfect,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.11.</note> 
               <hi>be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</hi>
