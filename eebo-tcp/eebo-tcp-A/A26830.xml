            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE have in theſe Words a Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how to behave our ſelves in the publick Worſhip of God; and I have made Choice of them at this time to juſtify the Practice of our own Church in her laudable Uſe of Muſick, both Vocal and Inſtrumental, in her ſolemn Aſſembles. Which theſe two Expreſſions of <hi>making a joyfull Noiſe unto the Lord, and coming before his Preſence with Singing,</hi> may be taken to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Or if the former be not ſo very plain here for Inſtruments of Muſick, as the latter is for Singing, yet we need not doubt, but it was intended, becauſe mention is made of them in ſo many other Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> and particularly in the laſt Pſalm. That none may therefore henceforth go about to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48121:3"/>
thoſe two things which agree ſo very well together, I will aſſert the Lawfulneſs, yea the Fitneſs and great Expediency of both Vocal and Inſtrumental Muſick in the Church, during the ſolemn Worſhip of God there. But becauſe ſome have been heretofore ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized at it, and others may perhaps ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſcrupulous about it, I will,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Speak a few Words in proving, that what was the Cuſtom of Holy Men of Old, and what is recommended, to us by the Sacred Scriptures, and what was ſo early in Uſe in the Chriſtian Church, muſt needs be lawfull notwithſtanding all the Objections or Cavils that have been brought to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I will alſo endeavour to ſhew, that this Practice is not only barely lawfull, but alſo highly advantageous, and greatly available towards the more magnificent and ſolemn Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>That Muſick has in it a natural Propriety to excite and heighten Devotion, will in ſome meaſure appear from the very Cuſtoms of the Heathen who did always uſe it in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Rites. Now even theſe had ſome Light, together with their Darkneſs, and were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48121:3"/>
in the Right concerning a Religious Worſhip to be paid ſomewhere, though in the wrong as to its object, and did well to make their Religious Entercourſes appear auguſt and ſolemn, though they were ignorant of the Statutes and Ordinances of the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now <hi>Homer</hi> one of the ancienteſt Heathen Writers, gives us an account that the <hi>Greeks</hi> celebrated the Praiſes of their Gods and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes upon the Harp. Others tell us, how the <hi>Phrygians</hi> worſhipped <hi>Cybelle</hi> with the Drum; and the <hi>Egyptians, Iſis</hi> with the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brel: And the third Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that the Cornet, Flute, Harp, Sackbut, Pſaltery, Dulcimer, and all kinds of Muſick were uſed (amonſt thoſe Eaſtern Nations) in the Worſhip of their Idols. The <hi>Latines</hi> had alſo their Tibicines or Players up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Wind-Muſick, upon whom they ſet a great Value, and granted to them many Priviledges, becauſe they were aſſiſtant at their holy Rites. Now although theſe Examples alone would not be throughly material to our Purpoſe, yet when in the Sacred Scriptures we alſo find Holy men in the Church of God recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending, approving and practiſing theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48121:4"/>
things, we may ſafely from thence conclude, that even theſe Cuſtoms in the Heathen were not any Corruption of their Hearts, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of Satan's, but a Remnant of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light, and natural Religion, which was ſtill left in them, and taught them to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate what by divine Impulſe and Inſpiration was at firſt taught the Children of God, and afterwards by the Ordinance of his Prophets and religious Kings was continued and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed amongſt them.</p>
            <p>The firſt mention that is made of this thing in the Scripture upon a Religious account, is before the Law was given from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when <hi>Miriam the Propheteſs the Siſter of Aaron</hi> (to celebrate the Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt) took a Timbrel in her hand, and went forth with her women with Timbrels to accompany the Song of Moſes,</hi> Exod. 15. 20. After that we read in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 5. of a Company of Prophets who were met by <hi>Saul, coming down from the high place with a Pſaltery, and a Tabret, and a Pipe, and a Harp before them, while they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied, and ſang praiſes to God.</hi> In Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we read in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 16. That <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid the King appointed ſingers with Inſtruments</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48121:4"/>
               <hi>of Muſick to welcom home the Ark at its return from the Philiſtines;</hi> that he alſo compoſed a Pſalm upon that occaſion, and <hi>left there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ark of the covenant of the Lord, Aſaph and his brethren to miniſter before the Ark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, as every days work required,</hi> as we read 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 37. And this was the firſt eſtabliſhment of the thing that we read of. This Cuſtom when afterwards in the Reigns of evil Kings it had been neglected, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his good Reign reſtored, as we find in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 25. <hi>And he ſet the Levites in the houſe of the Lord, with Cymbals, with Pſalteries, and with Harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the Kings Seer, and Nathan the Prophet, for ſo was the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord by his Prophets.</hi> To proceed yet on, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> an inſpired man and a Prophet, <hi>ſung to his well beloved, a ſong of his beloved touching his vineyard,</hi> Iſaiah 5. 1. The three Children ſang a Hymn of Praiſe when they were caſt into the fiery Furnace, and had that great Miracle wrought for their Deliverance. The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> in lofty Strains com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in juſt Meaſure, and fitted for the Skill of Muſick, aſſwaged the publick Grief, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48121:5"/>
               <hi>the acceptable day of the Lord, and the compleat triumphs of Chriſts paſſion.</hi> Yea all the Prophets, ſaith St. <hi>Ambroſe, cantaverunt ſpiritualibus modulis,</hi> &amp;c. they ſang forth the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of divine Redemption, in ſpiritual Hymns, and in melancholy Dirges lamented the hard-heartedneſs of their own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the <hi>Jews.</hi> In the New Teſtament we read that our Saviour <hi>ſang a Hymn</hi> with his Diſciples a little before his Paſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 30. And even in his higheſt Agony upon the Croſs, he recited a part of one of the Pſalms of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 22. 1. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſang in Priſon at Midnight, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 25. And the Viſions of S. <hi>John</hi> do repreſent the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Church; and even in Heaven <hi>they ſing the Song of Moſes and of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 15. 3. All Antiquity does agree in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, acquainting us that this was the conſtant practice of the Primitive Chriſtians, Profane Authors, together with Sacred, joyntly atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it. Of the firſt kind we have <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger, who when he had enquired into the Errour of the Chriſtians (as he calls it) he takes notice of no other Prayers that they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48121:5"/>
had, but a Verſe or Hymn to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to God. The Author of <hi>Philopatridis</hi> alſo obſerves that the Chriſtians ſang Hymns, <hi>etiam tota nocte,</hi> even all night long. Amongſt the Ancient Fathers of the Church we have <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> mentioning their Hymns; and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their <hi>Daily Liturgies:</hi> and a Cloud of Witneſſes might be brought for the confirmation of this thing. The <hi>Cathemerina</hi> of <hi>Prudentius,</hi> the Odes of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> the Pſalms of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> and <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> and the Hymns of <hi>Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> all yet extant, are ſo many ſtanding proofs of this matter, and do ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how much the Devotion of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chriſtians did conſiſt in Harmony: They ſang together in the Church, and they ſang there alſo alternately; for ſo <hi>Philo</hi> mentions them ſinging with a Praecentor, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple anſwering the extreams or ends; and <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> alſo joyns with him to this effect. They ſang at home in the Family, and abroad in the Field at their daily Labour; they ſang in Priſon and under Perſecution, yea and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, moved with the Spirit of God, they ſang forth Hymns of Praiſe even at the Stake,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48121:6"/>
and amidſt the Flames of Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>So that for the firſt of theſe, Vocal Muſick, I ſuppoſe there can be no Objection raiſed againſt it, or any doubt but that it was ever uſed in the Chriſtian as well as the Jewiſh Church: but there lies an exception which ſome have framed againſt Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, becauſe we do not read that that was in uſe ſo early amongſt the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and <hi>Juſtin</hi> mentions no other Muſick uſed among them but the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the bare ſinging with the Voice, unaccompanied with any Muſical Inſtruments. Now as to this Exception let theſe two things be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That if it were thus for a time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Primitive Chriſtians, yet is it not any good Argument for its Perpetuity, any more than that becauſe the upper Rooms and the ſubterraneous Caverns were the places where the perſecuted Chriſtians did uſe to meet, therefore alſo theſe are ſtill to be uſed rather than the Churches, now the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is (by God's Mercy) ceaſed, in a great part of the World: And Kings and Queens are become the nurſing Fathers and nurſing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48121:6"/>
Mothers to the Church. If it were ſo for a Seaſon we may and ought to look upon it as the neceſſity of the firſt Chriſtians, rather than their Choice, and that they had not wherewithall to be at the charge of theſe Aids and Ornaments to their Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, rather than that they withheld the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, becauſe they thought it unlawfull or unbecoming their Aſſemblies. For no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did the Church begin to flouriſh, but they grew into uſe and eſteem: And we read of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who lived about the latter end of the fourth Century, ſoon after the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and who it is alſo ſaid compoſed the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> the ſame Hymn of Praiſe which we ſtill retain in our Liturgy directed to the glorious Trinity, that he joyned Inſtruments of Muſick with the publick Service in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church of <hi>Milan,</hi> where he was then Biſhop: Which Example of his was ſo well approved of, that by degrees it became the general Practice of other Churches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and has ſince obtained in almoſt all the Chriſtian World beſides.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Others have referr'd this to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe, namely, that as Inſpiration in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48121:7"/>
ſinging Pſalms, (which was doubtleſs an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gift common to the Primitive Chriſtians) began to ceaſe, Inſtruments and Skill were brought in in its Room, even as Learning and ordinary means took place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of extraordinary Gifts: And this alſo might be another reaſon why Inſtrumental Muſick was not ſo much in uſe at firſt, as it was afterwards. Now both theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, if one of them alone be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, I hope may paſs for a good anſwer to that Exception that has been taken by ſome from that paſſage in <hi>Juſtin,</hi> or any other of a like kind (if any ſuch be found) in the moſt ancient Fathers.</p>
            <p>To this I may add farther, that the New Teſtament is not without ſome Texts which ſeem to point out this thing, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 2. where <hi>the voice of harpers harping with their harps</hi> is mentioned; which place is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily expounded of publick Worſhip in the Church. And again in the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 19. the Apoſtle there ſpeaking of <hi>Pſalms and Hymns and Spiritual Songs,</hi> adds in the Concluſion of the Verſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48121:7"/>
word ſignifies only ſinging, ſo this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter does properly denote the uſe of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. But notwithſtanding all theſe things, we find the Annotation which in the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bibles is affixed to the third Verſe of the 150. Pſalm runs thus; <q>
                  <hi>David</hi> maketh mention of thoſe Inſtruments which by God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment were appointed in the old Law, but under Chriſt the uſe thereof is aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church.</q> Now this indeed is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry peremptorily ſaid, but without offering us any proof of the thing. However I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine an Objection which is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought by thoſe men who ſide with the men of <hi>Geneva</hi> in this matter, and endeavour to ſhew you its Defects. Now the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that Inſtrumental Muſick is a part of the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> which vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Chriſt: But it is a great miſtake in any who look upon this as a thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for had it really been ſuch, it would either have been a Type of Chriſt, or at leaſt it would have been of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Inſtitution, and yet it was neither the one nor the other. Not a Type, becauſe its repreſentation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſet forth; not of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Inſtitution,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48121:8"/>
becauſe in his time it bore no part in the Sanctuary. We read indeed of Trumpets upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which were to aſſemble the People together: And for the like uſe they were appointed unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> as we read <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 2. <hi>for the calling of the Aſſembly, and the journeying of the Camps,</hi> but they went no farther in his Days. So that this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if it were of any Force, ſhould rather be againſt our Bells that call us to Church, than our Organs or other Inſtruments that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany our Pſalms and Anthems when we are there. And yet I have not heard that any are offended with the former, and I hope there is as little cauſe why they ſhould be ſo with the latter. For in ſhort it was not <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> but <hi>David</hi> who firſt applied Inſtruments of Muſick to Religious Purpoſes, as I have before ſhewed, and this he might do partly out of a Sence of Natural Religion, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo farther as we may piouſly believe, (he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an inſpired Man and a Prophet) by the Spirit of God: And his example is the firſt of the kind which our own Church does fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and which we look upon as Authentick in the caſe, and a ſufficient Pattern for our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48121:8"/>
Imitation: And although I do not ſee but why even a Jewiſh Ceremony or Cuſtom if it were either ornamental or ſignificant, or any way properly and naturally ſubſervient to Religious Uſes, (for inſtance, Sackcloth and Aſhes, or the like) might be aſſumed and adopted into the Chriſtian Service, if our Governors of the Church thought it fitting, they having a power left them to do all things for Decency, though they are not tied to the neceſſity of any thing in theſe matters as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, and which is indeed the very formal Difference between Jewiſh and Chriſtian Ceremonies: Yet that none may be offended in this particular, the Church has determined nothing in the caſe, but left it to be taken as a voluntary and free Thing, and as it comes recommended from Holy <hi>David, a man after God's own Heart.</hi> If the Authority of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Divines may yet ſway with ſome, let me only by way of Ballance to it, give you the Authority of the Aſſembly-Divines in this caſe, and I hope this may go at leaſt as far as the other: Now they have given us this different ſenſe of theſe matters in their Expoſition of the laſt Pſalm of <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48121:9"/>
               <q>
                  <hi>David</hi> (ſay they) exhorteth men the better to ſtir up their Joy to praiſe God with Muſical Inſtruments, and if Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments (as is granted) had that power then, how have they changed their nature ſince?</q> To this I will only add farther the opinion of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> a conſiderable man eſteemed amongſt thoſe of the Separation from us in this Nation, let his Authority pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail where it can, moſt of his Arguments I verily think are unanſwerable. And thus he has ſet them down in his Caſes of Conſcience, annexed to his Chriſtian Directory. As, </p>
            <q>
               <p>Firſt, God ſet up Inſtruments of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in his Service, long after <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law by <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis not an inſtituted Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony merely, but a natural help to the Mind's Alacrity; and (under this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) he adds, as it is lawfull to uſe the comfortable Help of Spectacles in reading the Bible, ſo is it of Muſick to exhilerate the Soul towards God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Jeſus Chriſt joined with the <hi>Jews</hi> that uſed it, and never ſpake a word againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48121:9"/>
Fourthly, No Scripture forbiddeth it, and therefore it is not unlawfull.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Nothing can be ſaid againſt it, but what may be ſaid againſt Tunes and Melody of Voice; and whereas ſome ſay that they find it to do them Harm, yet all wiſe Men ſay, they find it to do them good: and why ſhould the experience of ſome prejudiced ſelf-conceited Perſons, or of a half man that knoweth not what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody is, be ſet againſt the experience of all others, and deprive them of ſuch Helps and Mercies as theſe People ſay they find no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by?</p>
            </q>
            <p> Thus far, and more to this effect is ſaid by him upon this Subject; which now leads me to the</p>
            <p>Second thing I propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that do redound from hence, and how it is highly conducing towards the more magnificent and ſolemn Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>Muſical Harmony, whether by Voice or Inſtrument, but eſpecially by both together, is ſo pleaſing and agreeable to that part of man which is moſt Divine, that ſome Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have called the Soul Harmony; all have agreed it to have a compleat Share of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48121:10"/>
Harmony in it. Hence it is that Melody is a thing which delights all Ages, and becomes all States of Life; 'tis as ſeaſonable in Sorrow, as in Joy; as ſuitable an attendant on publick Actions, as diverting in private Recreations; as capable to raiſe Devotion, as to procure Delight; and as ſubſervient to the ends of Religion, as conducive to the Pleaſure of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. The reaſon hereof according to the judicious Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> is, <q>An admirable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which is in Muſick, to expreſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to the Mind more inwardly than any other ſenſible thing, the Riſing and Falling, the Turns and Varieties of all Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions whereunto the Soul is Subject: Yea and ſo to imitate them, that whether it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the ſame State we are in or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; we are not more contentedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the one, than changed and led away by the other: Hence it is, that ſome ſorts of Harmony are apt to move and ſtir our Affections, others to draw us to a grave and ſober Mediocrity, and there is that will carry us into Extaſies, filling the Mind with a heavenly joy; ſo that although we ſhould lay aſide the ſubject-matter of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48121:10"/>
the Pſalm or Hymn, yet even the very Harmony of Sounds being carried from the Ear to the ſpiritual Faculties of the Soul, is by a native power greatly avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bring to a perfect temper whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is there troubled; apt as well to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Spirits, as to allay that which is too eager, ſovereign againſt melancholy and deſpair, forcible to draw forth Tears of Devotion, and able both to move and moderate all Affections. <hi>Boetius</hi> tells us this is wrought by vertue of the anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the Notes in Muſick to thoſe in Nature:</q> And therefore a well compoſed Harmony, ſhall have even a natural Efficacy to work changes for the better in humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to enliven and ſtir up thoſe that are dull, and to compoſe and pacifie thoſe which are irregular: So that not only the Pſalms of the Church, but even the Voluntaries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuitably framed, may have a good effect upon the Mind, and even influence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to ſober and Religious purpoſes. Let me alſo give you a few Eulogies hereof from the antient Fathers of the Church, who found the Benefits of it in their Religious Exerciſes,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48121:11"/>
and have thus commended it to us. Firſt, <hi>Juſtin</hi> Martyr, ſays of the ſingle or plain Song which only was in uſe in his time. <q>That it ſtirs up the Mind with a certain Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto an ardent Deſire of that which is celebrated in the Song, that it allays the Deſires and Affections of the Fleſh, that it drives away evil Thoughts, and makes the Mind pregnant and apt to bring forth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Divine Fruits; that it makes the generous Contenders in Piety Valiant and Strong in Adverſity, and brings a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine and Remedy to all the evil Accidents of our Life: He alſo adds, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his ſpiritual Armory, calls this the Sword of the Spirit, for it is all of it the Word of God that is celebrated in the Mind, in the Song, and in the Verſe; it drives away evil Spirits, and the pious mind is by the Songs of the Church perfected in vertue.</q> The next that I ſhall mention is St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and he alſo ſpeaks after this manner. <q>Whereas the Holy Spirit ſaw that Mankind was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly drawn unto Vertue, and that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs was the leſs accounted of by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the proneneſs of our affections to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48121:11"/>
that which delighteth; it pleaſed the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the ſame Spirit, to borrow from melody that pleaſure which mingled with Heavenly Myſteries, ſhould convey as it were by ſtealth the treaſure of Good things into mens Minds. Oh the wiſe contrivance of that Heavenly Teacher! who hath by his skill found out a way, that doing thoſe things wherein we delight, we might alſo meet with thoſe things whereby we profit.</q>St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo in his Confeſſions joyns in this matter, and ſays,  <q>I am induced to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the Cuſtom of Singing in the Church, that through the Delight of the Ear the Minds of the infirm may raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a pious Affection. And ſpeaking of himſelf, he tells us, that he has often wept piouſly being thereunto moved by the ſweet Harmony in the Church.</q> The laſt of this kind that I ſhall mention, is that of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his Homily upon the 41ſt. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> who there ſpeaks to this effect, <q>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing raiſes the Mind ſo much, and affects it being raiſed, and frees it from the earth, and ſets it looſe from the Bonds of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and fills it with the love of Wiſdom, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48121:12"/>
makes it deſpiſe the things of this World, as a divine Hymn harmonically compoſed.</q> And that Muſick is thus apt to move the Mind to pious Diſpoſitions, and raiſe it up to a pitch above it ſelf, and in ſome meaſure as it were to inſpire it divinely, at leaſt to fit it for ſuch Inſpiration, we may gather from the Cuſtoms of the Prophets of Old, (already mentioned) of whom we read that while they prophecied, <hi>they came down from the high Place with a Pſaltery, and a Tabret, and a Pipe, and a Harp before them: and the Spirit of the Lord came alſo upon Saul who met them, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a new man, and propheſied with them,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 5. 6. Another wonderfull effect we read of that Muſick had upon him was, that <hi>when an evil Spirit from the Lord was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him,</hi> whether it were a deep Melancholy that he was fallen into, which might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and heightned by the Devil's Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as moſt Interpreters think; or whether it were an actual Poſſeſſion of Satan's, as ſome of the Jewiſh Rabbins would have it; yet when <hi>David</hi> played skilfully upon the Harp it departed from him. The manner of this Cure is alſo variouſly adjudged by Expoſitors,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48121:12"/>
ſome thinking it a Hymn or Religious Pſalm that <hi>David</hi> ſang, and that thereby the Devil was the more effectually chaſed away from <hi>Saul;</hi> others attributing it only to the Notes of Muſick, and their natural Efficacy in the ſubduing of all black Melancholy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; all Anger, Malice and Envy, or the like foul Paſſions whereby the Mind can become overwhelmed, or enraged and caſt down into a condition truly Diabolical; whatever were the root of the Malady, or whatever might be the true cauſe of the Remedy, we find the Cure was effectually wrought by the Harp of <hi>David.</hi> I forbear to mention ſome other wondrous effects of Muſick related by the Ancients, as <hi>Plutarch, Pythagoras,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe they are not ſo proper to be conſidered upon a Religious Account; but the foregoing ones are abundantly ſufficient to let us ſee that there is ſomething in Muſick that has a great Propriety to Religious Purpoſes: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Holy <hi>David</hi> firſt compoſed Godly Pſalms, in number and meaſure, (he being admirably skill'd in divine Poeſy) and was moreover the Author of adding Melody, both Vocal and Inſtrumental, for the raiſing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48121:13"/>
up of mens Hearts, and moving their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions towards God; ſo likewiſe the Church of Chriſt doth at this day retain it as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to God's Service, and a help to her own Devotion.</p>
            <p>And thus much alſo as to my Second Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the Expediency as well as Lawfulneſs of this Practice.</p>
            <p>But after I have ſaid all in Vindicating of this Cuſtom, we do not condemn any other foreign Churches as guilty of any material Defect if they do not receive it, nor while we ſay it <hi>may,</hi> do we aſſert that it <hi>muſt</hi> be uſed; or although it be even expedient, yet it is not altogether neceſſary; but this may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid of it, that it is an agreeable attendant and a Suitable Ornament to Religious Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; though no part of the Subſtance thereof: but it is to be placed in the Claſſis of thoſe things which by Divines are called Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Councels, or Precepts of Perfection: things, which when they are ſeaſonably, and decently, and reverently uſed are apt to raiſe men's Hearts and Affections to greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Piety, and to produce larger Portion of Zeal and Devotion in our ſpiritual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48121:13"/>
Thus kneeling down in Prayer, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting apart feſtival Solemnities, making Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, building of Temples and beautifying them, and the like, are things that have a tendency in Nature, or (at leaſt) by univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Cuſtom to encreaſe Religion as well as to adorn it; to raiſe holy Thoughts and pious Diſpoſitions within, by ſuitable Aids and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments from without; making the aimia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of God's Tabernacles excite the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of our Thankſgivings there, and the beauty of Holineſs conduce to (or at leaſt concur with) the Spirit of Prayer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when this is ſuperinduced by the Piety of Chriſtian Governors, we maintain againſt all Oppoſers the Lawfulneſs and Decency, yea the fitneſs and great expediency of it in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Finally, whatſoever accidental Abuſes may creep in amidſt the uſe of theſe laudable things, we earneſtly diſſwade and diſallow, adviſing all Perſons to be very carefull and circumſpect in the uſe thereof, leſt their Minds ſhould ſtray, and it might happen to them as it did ſometimes to St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who in his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48121:14"/>
laments his Inadvertency in this point, <q>owning, that when the Muſick affected him more than the Subject-matter of the Pſalm or Hymn, he was greatly to be blamed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the Heart is the beſt Pſalmiſt, and the inward Affection of the Soul is the beſt Muſick in God's ear, and it is purely for the ſake of this, that the other is uſed. We alſo diſapprove of all other Defaults of a like kind; that is, where-ever the uſe of Edification is leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened or loſt, which may happen either when the words are not to be underſtood by the Hearers, or when they are not ſuited to the true Chriſtian Temper of Prayer and Praiſe, or when the Airs of our Anthems and Hymns are not grave and ſolemn, and befitting the Houſe of God, rather than the Houſe of <hi>Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> But on the other hand, theſe Faults be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevented (as God be thanked due care is taken in our own Church that they ſhould be) the Efficacy of Muſick is truly admirable, and does mightily edify, becauſe it does moſt powerfully excite the Paſſions and Affections; the very heart and Soul towards God. By this our Minds may be raiſed and ſpiritualized in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48121:14"/>
their flights towards Heaven, our Devotions quickned and enflamed with a greater Zeal and Fervency in our Religious Addreſſes, and when the Fire is thus kindled within, we ſhall become the more fit and ready to ſpeak with our Tongues, and to begin here upon Earth, that which is to be a part of our eternal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in Heaven; namely, <hi>To ſing Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs to the Praiſe and Glory of God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, to whom, let us aſcribe all Glory, and Majeſty, Dominion, and Power, both now and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
